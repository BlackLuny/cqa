(Hint: multiplying by 2/2 doesn't change anything).  If so, that c is the identity for the # operation.<br>  <br>  ~ is easier: what even number could you subtract from a and get a as the answer?<br>  <br>  3) distributive: show that a#(b~c) = (a#b) ~ (a#c) and a~(b#c) = (a~b) # (a~c)

There are several nice web sites that give mechanistic details of reactions.
7ac5475c5b8ba223544e3a4dd2383c9daa	One: Muons (and all other subatomic particles) can 'technically' be in two places at once because all subatomic particles are wave-particles. <br>  Two: No.  Muons can technically move forward in time due to relativistic time dilation, but NOT backward in time.  If he has somehow been able to achieve this, he should step up and claim his Nobel Prize!<br>  <br>  Muons are basically like a heavy electron.  They are indeed caused by cosmic rays entering the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Actually I take back "Muons can technically move forward in time...".  I just don't like how that sounds.  A more accurate statement would be: they move faster through time since they are moving at high velocity (when they are created in the upper atmosphere due to cosmic rays).|`|RbFSFhKvaa	Muons are nothing but "heavy" electrons. As quantum mechanical object they can "be in two places at once", but so can you... you are just as much a quantum mechanical object as muons are. <br>  <br>  No, muons do not go back in time. Nothing does. There is a mathematical formalism in particle physics which describes anti-particles as particles moving backwards in time. But that is formalism, not reality. It uses CPT invariance in quantum field theory to reverse the charge and the time in a diagram showing particle interactions... that does not mean that time is running backwards for antiparticles. <br>  <br>  You are absolutely right: muons do form in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere.
AA11059326	i don't know about plants, but the two types found in mammals are salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase. both break down starches, beginning in the mouth (salivary) and continuing in the intestines (pancreatic).
9f7328923e8ee8bd543f1c4b68806f3faa	In animals, amylase is in the saliva.  In plants, amylase is in the seed. After rice has been chewed in the mouth, the Benedict's test should be positive. When the barley seed is germinating, amylase becomes active, and glucose is released. Benedict's test should be positive.

Sie führte in mehreren F?llen auch zu Abstürzen von Satelliten.<br>  <br>  Zum Beispiel gab es im M?rz 1989 einen gro?en Solaren Flare. Dieser führte dazu, dass die Erdatmosph?re sich aufgrund der zus?tzlichen Energie ausdehnte. Der Kurs des unbemannten Satelliten SMM (Solar Maximum Mission) konnte nicht korrigiert werden und so wurde der Satellit von der Luftreibung abgebremst, weshalb er auf die Erde stürzte. Auch der Absturz von Skylab im Juli 1979 geht auf einen Sonnenflare und die damit verbundene Atmosph?renausdehnung zurück.<br>  <br>  @Mr.Brain: übrigens war Skylab auf einer H?he von ca. 435 km.<br>  @Mr.Brain: Jupp. :-)<br>  <br>  Grü?e Boson

In this case, it's 12.  This is the number of protons and neutrons together.<br>  <br>  Then look the atomic number (for carbon it's 6).  That is the number of protons.<br>  <br>  To get the number of neutrons, subtract the atomic number from the atomic weight.  In this case, it's 12-6; there are 6 neutrons.<br>  <br>  C-12 is the "regular" carbon atom.  The other isotopes of carbon are carbon-13 and carbon-14.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Eggs are complex systems.  If the tooth be told, a baby bird has a little baby tooth to chip its way out of an egg.  There is a little air pocket for the bird to breath as it struggles to free itself.  There are cone shaped air pores to let air in and yet leave the egg hard enough for protection.  As the chick chips at the shell the pore becom larger enabling more and more air. Until the chick makes is debout in the world.   Clearly,  baby bird, egg, morther and father bird all work in a complex system.    The egg is a biological system which speaks of a wise creator who dreamed it up form nothing  and efforts of scientists as I understand it make God look great as they explore His creation getting glipses of His handiwork|`|uKBHyrawaa	I don't really understand your questions at all?

So, it is literally possible to engineer egg and sperm from stem cells right in the laboratory.  Now, life in the cell: Nothing special about it. It's just chemistry and quantum physics.  While the technique for synthesizing life is not yet available, it's only a matter of time, experimentation, and working the problem through.  Modern science has only been around for what, maybe 300 years.  I see a time coming in the next 100 years where we will be synthesizing life to meet specifications, from off the shelf chemicals.    However, this accomplishment will have nothing to do with the scientific fact of evolution.

And how exactly does that egg not qualify as living?    And what exactly does this have to do with evolution?  Microbiology and cell biology have of course contributed to the theory of evolution (and vice versa) but understanding the theory of evolution doesn't give you any special insight as to how to actually construct a cell.    The theory of evolution explains species diversity as a product of gradual change over generations of reproduction, through a mechanism of natural selection (and sexual selection, etc.) that acts on random mutations as a sort of filter that can eventually produce increased (or reduced) complexity.    It doesn't tell you how to build a cell from scratch from non-living material ... abiogenesis would be a more relevant theory there, but even a solid theory of abiogenesis wouldn't necessarily give you the tools necessary to fully understand and engineer life from lifelessness.    Consider the following analogue:  I can explain to you in broad, general terms how an atomic bomb works, but I couldn't build one without much, much more specialized knowledge, and an array of very expensive and complicated tools -- each of which requires specialized knowledge of mechanics, science and technology that doesn't have anything directly to do with the physics that explains how/why an atomic bomb functions.  Scientists knew that fusion was occurring on the sun to produce tremendous amounts of heat and energy well before they managed to make hydrogen bombs and working fusion reactors here on Earth.    Finally, scientists are very, very close to being able to build a living cell completely from non-living organic material (look up Craig Venter: http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/craig...  Note that when they succeed, it won't be a validation of the theory of evolution (which already has plenty of evidence and experimental proof in favor of it anyway) but instead will further demonstrate that there is no need to involve magic, mysticism and animism to explain the nature and origins of life (which is something that the theory of evolution also happens to do).

YjvTQntAaa	The sky is not really a solid thing. The atmosphere of air that you breath surrounds the Earth. There is nothing else above us but more of that same air until you reach space, which is more or less just empty. The Krmn line, located at an altitude of 100 km, is commonly used to define the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. Getting this far requires a lot of fuel and time to escape Earth's gravity. While rocket's could take several minutes to archive this altitude, some high flying planes can reach it, but can take upwards of a half hour or more since they aren't going straight up. The blue that makes the sky look solid is really just sunlight being scattered. As you get higher and higher, there is less air to scatter the light, and the blue sky gets darker and darker and you see more stars. There does come a point when you see no more blue at all and just the black of space. However, if you look down, you don't see blue, you just see the surface of the Earth.|`|aLaiPipsaa	The "sky" has no end to it!   On earth, what we call "the sky" is our ATMOSPHERE.

It will take longer to describe it than use it, as is often the way!    You are given a function Y = f(x), and need to find an approximation to the value of x which solves it for a specific value of Y, say Y0. Take an integer trial value for x and calculate f(x). If this is less than Y0, increase x to the next integer and repeat. When you have a pair of x-values (x1, x2) which give Y-values (Y1, Y2) which bracket Y0, then the solution is    x' = x1 + (Y0 - Y1)/(Y2 - Y1)    Obviously, if your first guess gives a value which is too high, you reduce x to the integer below.    Ok, let's try the examples given:-    (a) x.(x - 3) = 100;   Try x = 10 --> Y = 10 x 7 = 70; go up x = 11, Y = 11 x 8 = 88, and again x = 12, Y = 12 x 9 = 108    Bracketing achieved, with x1 = 11, Y1 = 88 and Y2 = 108  so solution = 11 + (100 - 88)/(108 - 88) = 11 + 12/20 = 11.60  Rounded to 1 decimal place x' = 11.6    (For comparison, for x = 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, Y(x) = 97.75, 99.76, 101.79 respectively)    (b) x.(x + 8) = 95   Try x = 6, Y = 6 x 14 = 84; go up one to x = 7, Y = 7 x 15 = 105 - bracketing achieved    Solution x' = 6 + (95 - 84)/(105 - 84) = 6 + 11/21 = 6.52 or 6.5 to one decimal place.    (For comparison, x = 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 give Y-values of 92.16, 94.25, 96.36).    By scaling, the method can be adopted for most values of x - it's best to avoid bracketing values for x = 1 and 2, for example, and by multiplying by 10 these may be switched to 10 and 11. The approximation may also be repeated to obtain more accurate values if required.|`|yWuE91npaa	a) x(x+3) = x^2 +3x    x      x^2 +3x  8.7        101.79 this answer is too big  8.6          88.76 this one is too small  8.65       100.7725 too big  8.625      100.265625 this one is close enough  so x =8.625    usually with questions like this they say the equation has a solution between 1 and 10 or something like that which what confused me abnout this one

VkCrdtJkaa	You can file your taxes and claim the dependents.  The IRS will eventually notice that two people claimed the same dependents.  They will set up an "audit" where you will show your proof that you correctly claimed your dependents.  The party who incorrectly filed for them as dependents will be penalized.  This situation is not uncommon where a former spouse that does not supply over 1/2 of the child's support still claims the child as a dependent.  It may take some time for the IRS to notice and do the audit, at which time they will correct for all past years where this was done.      If you are ticked off with someone who you know has been incorrectly filing tax returns you can turn them in to the IRS. If you don't want to fill out any forms, you can call 1-800-829-0433 and report the person verbally. Here is the link to the form:  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3949a.pd...

A reaction my happen faster at high temps because of larger kinetic energy and everything included in collision theory. However, consider if ΔH is negative and ΔS is also negative.

Eventually, a reaction with a negative ΔH and a negative ΔS should become nonspontaneous at higher temps and therefore not favorable from a thermodynamic point of view.<br>  <br>  3. In terms of phase changes and ΔS, the difference in entropy between a gas and a liquid is much larger than the difference in entropy between a liquid and a gas.

TuJqS5A3aa	I'll try to help the best I can!    Congruent Triangles  1. Well, think about it - say you have two triangles, one with side lengths of 4, 5, and 7, and another with side lengths of 3, 6, and 7. They are both valid triangles with a perimeter of 16, but they don't have the same side values so they can't be congruent.  2. The first one is simple, the SSS congruence conjuncture. If all three sets of corresponding sides are the same length, then the triangles must be congruent. A second one is AAS, where you know that two angles are congruent and a set of corresponding sides not between them are congruent as well. Finally, there is ASA, where two angles and the sides between them are all congruent.    Metric Measurements:  These questions really aren't hard if you know your conversions. It may seem complicated, but it's really not. Here are some of the basic measurement conversions that you'll need for these problems:  Distance  1 centimeter (cm) = 1 millimeter (mm)  1 meter (m) = 100 centimeters  1 meter = 1000 millimeters  1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters  Liquids  1 centiliter (cL) = 10 milliliters (mL)  1 liter (L) = 100 centiliters  1 liter = 1000 milliliters  1 kiloliter (kl) = 1000 liters  Weight  1 gram (g) = 1000 milligrams (mg)  1 gram = 100 centigrams (cg)  1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 grams    I'll do a few example problems to show you how to use these measurements.    1. 500cm, 5000mm, 4m  Let's convert all of these measurements to meters.  There are 100cm in a meter, so 500cm=5 meters.  There are 1000mm in a meter, so 5000mm=5 meters.  So, now we're comparing 5 meters to 5 meters to 4 meters. Obviously, the 500cm and 5000mm are the same distance, with 4m coming in last.  2. 0.2 L, 240 ml, 50 cl  Now let's go the other way and convert all of these measurements to centiliters so we can compare them.  1 liter = 100 centiliters, so 0.2 L = 20 cl.  There are 10 ml in a cl, so 240 ml = 24 cl.  Now we're comparing 20 cl (0.2 L) to 24 CL (240 ml) to 50 cl. The 50 cl is the greatest, and the 0.2 L is the smallest.    Does this make sense? I hope it helps!|`|7qTKREOmaa	The triangles with the same perimeter might not have the angle measures. And for number 2 you can use congruence shortcuts like SAS ( side-angle-side) SAA (side-angle-angle) SSS (side-side-side) etc.

By using the variable "x" for how many sales she made that week, we can setup the equation:    $300 = $50 + x*10%    Since "10%" is the same thing as "0.10", we can rewrite the equation as:    $300 = $50 + 0.10x    Now all you need to do is solve for "x".

But assuming there are sales, she earns more than the 50 dollars.  Sales can be different every week, so they will have to be represented by a variable, say "x".  Kate gets 10% of whatever x is, so we would make a formula out of this by saying y = 50 + 0.1x.    In the problem you give, we know she received 300 dollars, so now we know what y is: 300.  300 = 50 + 0.1x  -50 on both sides  250 = 0.1x  divide both sides by 0.1  2500 = x    Her sales were $2500      Hope that helps!|`|nAN7lb6Gaa	Kate made 300 dollars. Out of that 50 is the weekly earnings.  So 250 is what she got by her weekly sales.  i.e., 250 is the profit she made, and the profit is 10%  10% of the weekly sales = 250  10 / 100 of the weekly sales = 250  Weekly Sales = 250*100 / 10  = 2500    Which is the first option a).|`|HkXYGAOdaa	X = her weekly total sale      1/10 X = her 10% of sales commission = 0.1x     0.1X + 50 = 300   0.1X = 300-50=250   0.1X = 250         X = 250/ 0.1         X = $2500 = he total weekly sales|`|pk9JbCE8aa	You know that Kate earned  $300, and her salary is $50. Subtract 50 from 300=250. She receives ten percent commission.(.10)  Try this.    x*.10=$250 ; or: x/10=$250  To solve for X -  x/10 *10=$250 *10     Now, we have X by itself.   $250*10=$2500.00      x=$2500.00
8Y7LQ6TGaa	You are talking about some complicated quantities. Wind resistance can  be found with a wind tunnel, or perhaps calculated with a supercomputer and an accurate 3D model of the vehicle.  Road and engine resistance (friction actually) again, depend on the exact design of the vehicle, it's engine, transmission, tires, bearings, and a lot more.     Air and Friction "resistance" is not a mass, it is usually in units of force. In the imperial system, forces can be in pounds-force (as opposed to pounds-mass).    These are usually measured, not calculated. In other words you measure the time taken to accelerate to a specific speed with a specific engine, and work backwards to get the force of friction that resists that acceleration. Of course that is a combination of air resistance, road friction and engine/drive line friction. You measure the HP via a dynamometer or other means, which includes the engine friction.    complicated. Hope this helps a bit.    .
1khVEE6oaa	The first post was correct, amethyst is a mineral.  Because of this, you can find it in all three types of rocks depending on their origin.  However, you would most likely find large amethyst crystals forming inside of a geode, making it classified as a sedimentary rock.  Basically if the quartz was dissolved in a solution trapped inside a rock cavity, then as the water evaporated from the small pores in the rock, the minerals would precipitate out from the solution and form crystals.    You can also find it in crystal form within an igneous rock.  When the molten material cools slowly enough, you will find amethyst crystals inside those igneous rocks.    Any amethyst found in a metamorphic rock would likely no longer retain its crystal structure after the extreme pressure and heat.  It's unlikely, although not impossible, that you could extract usable amethyst from metamorphic rocks for this reason.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	amethyst is a gemstone, a type of quartz, and thus isn't really a rock, it is a mineral.    A common way that amethyst forms is from very hot waters, geothermal (hydrothermal) water.  This puts amethyst into a kind of gray area that is neither magmatic nor metamorphic, but also sort of each.    I guess if I had to put it into one or the other box, I would put it into magmatic, although it doesn't really form from cooling lava, but rather more from the hot waters that come out when the lava cools.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	not sedimentary, i doubt it's igneous rock,i eliminate everything else and guess metamorphic.

WweVOrPZaa	Bacteria are unicellular organisms whereas eukaryotic cells usually work as multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells or bacteria are simpler in structure, and were originally the first cells (meaning they are more primitive). Eukaryotic cells originated from prokaryotes, and developed more organelles, as well as the ability to work with other cells to form multicell organisms. Eukaryotes also possess a nucleus whereas bacteria cells don't.

In about 4-5 billion years or so the sun will enter the last phase of its life and become a red giant, that will burn off the earth's atmosphere and it's oceans.    The 2012 prediction for the end of the world is based off of a misconception of the Mayan calendar.  2012 marks the end of an era for them ( the same way that 2000 was the new millennium for us), and their writings have a lot of archaic references to the return of their god at some point or another.  Which causes people to send chain emails saying that the world will end then.  It's all very absurd.

L3MSj55vaa	i would assume it would be natural selection :/    Bottleneck effect refers to the reduction of a populations gene pool and the accompanying changes in gene frequency produced when a few members survive the widespread elimination of a species.    Founder effects  A founder effect occurs when a new colony is started by a few members of the original population. This small population size means that the colony may have:    reduced genetic variation from the original population.  a non-random sample of the genes in the original population.  For example, the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa is descended mainly from a few colonists. Today, the Afrikaner population has an unusually high frequency of the gene that causes Huntingtons disease, because those original Dutch colonists just happened to carry that gene with unusually high frequency. This effect is easy to recognize in genetic diseases, but of course, the frequencies of all sorts of genes are affected by founder events.    Genetic recombination is the process by which a strand of genetic material (usually DNA; but can also be RNA) is broken and then joined to a different DNA molecule. In eukaryotes recombination commonly occurs during meiosis as chromosomal crossover between paired chromosomes. This process leads to offspring having different combinations of genes from their parents and can produce new chimeric alleles. In evolutionary biology this shuffling of genes is thought to have many advantages, including that of allowing sexually reproducing organisms to avoid Muller's ratchet.  In molecular biology "recombination" can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of DNA, often from different organisms, creating what is called recombinant DNA.  Enzymes called recombinases catalyze natural recombination reactions. RecA, the recombinase found in E. coli, is responsible for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms there are two recombinases required for repairing DSBs. The RAD51 protein is required for mitotic and meiotic recombination and the DMC1 protein is specific to meiotic recombination. |`|8c1907dde46c7fbd753cec57b372af40aa	I am really not that into biology (more of a physics nerd) but i think the answer is, as you proposed, natural selection.

WbVE1cXKaa	This is a bit of a lag in the weather response.  Usually hotter in july than June also, even though the day length peaks in June.    I suppose the best way to explain this would be to point out that there is some sort of average temperature that reflects the periods of lots of sun and periods of little sun over the course of many years.    Whenever you are getting less sunlight than you need to give this average temperature, the temperature will want to go lower.  So, even though you pass the shortest day in december, you continue to get less light than you need to make it up to the average temperature for quite a while afterward.  As a result, the air keeps getting cooler for another month or two, until the day length returns to a level that can at least keep things from still getting colder, and eventually will get long enough to make things start to go back toward warm.    In other words, just because the days are no longer getting shorter, it doesn't immediately make them long enough to get things warm again.    When I swim under water, when I stop going deeper, it doesn't mean I will suddenly be back at the surface.  I will still be under water until I have been swimming upward for a while, so I will still be getting less air than I need even though I changed directions, if you can see this as an analogy.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	The earth keeps spinning away from the sun on an axis and it just gets colder and colder.

For all practical purposes, the energy that heats the earth comes from the sun. Due to the sun angle during the winter months, less energy is received from the sun in the higher latitudes of either hemisphere than is radiated back into space by the earth. Due to this, the higher  portions of each hemisphere will continue to cool until the energy received is more than that is lost.     This cooling will continue, depending on your latitude, until sometime in March or April for the northern hemisphere. Those closer to the equator will be sooner than those closer to the Arctic Circle.

nAN7lb6Gaa	I don't understand you...  Why in the god's name are you adding the two dollars to $27?  You should subtract them because the waiter has deprived the costumers from it.   The actual bill is $25 = 3 * each customers bill - the amount waiter has.  $25 = 3 * 9 - $2  $27 = $27  Which is true and hence numbers don't lie.  To the customers the bill is $27 and hence they have payed the bill. They gave thirty dollars, and got their three dollars back.  To the waiter who is supposed to give five dollars to them, instead gave only three dollars. 2$ profit.    AND hello excuse me...  The two dollars that  the waiter has comes from the three nine dollar bills given by the customers. How can you add like that?|`|ICymCdqsaa	The reality is that the manager discounted the meals MORE than $1.00.  He gave them back a total of $5.00, which is $1.67 (rounded) off of each meal.

w2nfvZ0caa	I absolutely adore math, and not because "your answer is right or your answer is wrong; your answer is never 'kind of' right." I love working around numbers and being able to work with them quickly. I love how when people say, "THIS MAKES NO SENSE!" I just sit there and go, "Well actually it does. o_O" It is logical and useful. I love tutoring people in lower level math classes or helping out friends solve homework problems. Calculus has been the best year so far, because it helps a lot with word problems and everything has kind of just went "click" in my mind.    On that note (Calculus), I love how we're actually using the numbers to solve actual problems (for example, you can use optimization to figure out the largest size pole you can get around the corner of a house/hallway). Maybe it's just the inner-math "geek" inside of me coming out, but math is just something that I love to do (and something that I'm obviously talented in compared to other subjects like English or history). Numbers. :)|`|TuJqS5A3aa	I think math is sometimes a very logical way of looking at the world. Life can be complicated sometimes, but 5+5 will always equal 10 (unless you're in base 4 or something!).    There's also a great many things you can use it for. Lots of jobs require math, even though it may not seem like it at first glance. Math's a very important life skill, when you look at it that way.|`|vJa7abGfaa	i LIKE maths but i ADORE/LOVE science!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fwX9dzleaa	I've always been fond of the concreteness to math.  You start with a few very very basic assumptions (don't take 1+2=3 for granted) and from those assumptions you can do so much. There's rarely an opportunity to dispute answers.  I'd been frustrated as a kid about English teachers who didn't like my thesis or weren't fond of my diction and took points off my work.  In math, at least so far (I just finished calc 4), you're either right or wrong.  Sure there's the occasion where you should show more work to make your point clear, but no one can dispute the correctness of a good answer.    Everything else feels mushy at times, but math is nearly always concrete.|`|7d61a38f737366063f8587fd6efb39acaa	I have always loved math.

Too bad that employers don't recognize the importance of math when hiring people.

70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	D -- Nemesis was first proposed by paleontologists as a potential reason for the reason why extinction events in the Earth's history happened with such periodicity. They could find no mechanism for the rhythmic frequency of extinction events and thought that the source could be extraterrestrial in origin.     It's purely hypothetical at this point, because there is no evidence that the sun has a companion star. If Nemesis was a red dwarf, then it would have been seen and cataloged, and scientists would have been able to discover its (relative) extreme closeness to the sun using parallax. Those who do study the nemesis hypothesis believe that a brown dwarf would be more likely, as such an object would not burn like a star and thus be far more difficult to detect.     If it does exist, NASA's upcoming WISE survey explorer satellite, which will be conducting a survey of the entire sky, and specifically designed to look for small objects such as asteroids and brown dwarfs, should be able to spot it. It's scheduled for launch in November|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	B  yet to be found      E - factitious companion star to the Sun|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	B.

In the second degree equation put the value of y you have from the first i.e 2x - 7.    Now you have a quadratic equation in x, although you will need to do quite a bit of manipulation to arrive at the form:  ax2 + bx + c = 0  You will need to multiply 2x - 7 by itself, then gather like terms together. Watch out for -7 times -7 !    A more interesting way to solve these is to scribe a circle, centre (0,0), radius = sqrt(61), on a sheet of graph paper and then draw the line y = 2x - 7. If the line misses the circle there are no answers. If it is a tangent to the circle there is one answer, the point at which it touches, and if it cuts the circle in two there will be two answers, the two points of intersection. The answers will be rather crude estimates because of slight errors in drawing and the low level of precision possible using graphs.

WweVOrPZaa	Nutrition and lifestyle, such as a healthy diet in whole foods is vital in preventing many diseases in the first place. So in most simpler cases, I think it would be helpful if the patient's nutritional habits are accessed and not overlooked. Often times diet can play a large role in the person's health. Also, there are illnesses that cannot be solved with medication and require a proper diet plan instead (obesity, diabetes, food allergies etc.) In emergency situations though, medication would be an ideal choice.

Prior to fertilization the yolk together with the germinal disc is a single cell. It is one of the few single-cells that can be seen by the naked eye. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white (known more formally as albumen or ovalbumin) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae.    As a food, yolks are a major source of vitamins and minerals. They contain all of the egg's fat and cholesterol, and almost half of the protein.    If left intact while cooking fried eggs, the yellow yolk surrounded by a flat blob of egg white creates the distinctive sunny-side up form of the food.

The body is experiencing exothermic and the cool air is experiencing endothermic.  Why?  Because as the second law of thermodynamics states: Heat is naturally transferred from a hot body to a cold body, until the temperatures of the bodies are evened out.  Exothermic reactions are when a substance releases energy. Endothermic reactions are when a substance absorbs energy.

AA11118713	Because of the much larger tilt that Earth has compared to Jupiter we have more defined seasons between the southern and northern hemishpheres. If we had a tilt as small as Jupiter's the seasons would be less defined between the hemispheres. Whereas, now, when it's winter in the norther hemishphere, it's summer in the southern hemisphere, get it? So without that tilt I'd say it'd be more of a worldwide season all around.

IUmAflSqaa	Let me walk you through a.  You can think about b. yourself.    The Cauchy-Riemann equations are the pair of partial differential equations:    ?u/?x = ?v/?y; ?u/?y = -?v/?x    Well, what are u and v for a?  u and v are the real valued functions so that f = u+iv.  So:    u(x,y) = 5x^3  v(x,y) = 3x^2y^2    Now:    ?u/?x = 15x^2  ?u/?y = 0  ?v/?x = 6xy^2  ?v/?y = 6x^2y    Now when do these satisfy the C-R equations?  When both of the following are true:    15x^2 = 6x^2y  0 = -6xy^2    In the first equation, either x = 0 and y is arbitrary, or x  0 and y = 15/6 = 5/2.  In the second equation, either x = 0 and y is arbitrary or y = 0 and x is arbitrary.  So they're both satisfies when x = 0 and y is arbitrary.  That's not a big surprise--when x = 0, f(iy) = 0 identically, and any constant function is certainly complex differentiable.    The same idea works for b.  Just note that, of course, z = x+iy.

K6QlFoo0aa	Since I never heard of a tire rim with a radius of 17, and since you weren't specific about whether 17 is the radius or the diameter, I am assuming that it is the diameter.    That means that the radius of the rim is 8.5 inches and the radius of the tire is 8.5 + 4.5 = 13 inches.  That's about right for my car's tires.    One mile is 5,280 feet which when multiplied by 12 to get it into inches is 63,360 inches.    Thus the entire tire, with a radius of 13" and a circumference of 2*pi*r" = 81.684" requires 775.671 revolutions to complete the mile.    Notice that if d is the diameter of the rim of the tire, that I computed the radius as r = d/2 and the total tire's circumference as c = 2*pi*r.     That can be changed back to c = d * pi (where d is the diameter of the entire tower.     For the diameter of the tire rim D = d - 9 (the 9 is from 2 * 4.5")    Next I converted miles to 63,360 inches.    Then I divided 63,360 by pi*d, and in this case got 775.671 revolutions.    In general r is the original diameter and since I have already used up d and D I' call that rim diameter s.  You should call it d in your spreadsheet.    So the total diameter of the tire is 9 + (s/2) and the circumference is (pi * (9 + (s/2))).    Just to check I entered this into Excel:    = (63360 / ((PI()) * (9 + ($C2))/2))  where $c2 is the rim diameter and  the results in column e are the number of inches traveled and I got this:    14 .. 1753.749077  15 .. 1680.676199  16 .. 1613.449151  17 .. 1551.393415  18 .. 1493.934399  19 .. 1440.579599  20 .. 1390.904441    That's about as total an answer as I or anybody else could possibly write. :)  Note: the pi function is pi().    I hope that this takes care of your problem:)

Most stars are more or less the same color unless they are dying or being reborn into another star.    Distance I don't think matters.

HTmj2BXDaa	It depends.  How small is small?  Does it have to stay at 700 C for any length of time or can it just get up to that temperature once?  Does it have to heat up something other than itself?  Does it have to operate in air or can it operate in inert atmosphere?  Is there any requirement for how long it takes to get to temperature?  Is there any requirement for how accurately or how precisely it has to maintain 700C?    A 12 volt battery will create a nice little spark and the temperature in the arc is much higher than 700C.  Using electrical resistance wire is another way.  The heating elements in your toaster probably glow red.  Red heat is about 700C so, if you want to tear apart your toaster, you could use those elements to create a heater.  A propane or natural gas flame gets about this hot (I think) but you can get much higher temperatures if you provide extra air or extra oxygen (like oxy-acetylene torch).      Figure out more specifically what you need and research different heating technologies.  good luck

eYVAR8MTaa	haha i just learned this too , lol.    Mitosis is the process in which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus, into two identical sets in two daughter nuclei.[1] It is generally followed immediately by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two daughter cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle - the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell.    Cytokinesis is the process when the cytoplasm of a single eukaryotic cell is divided to form two daughter cells. It usually initiates during the late stages of mitosis, and sometimes meiosis, splitting a binucleate cell in two, to ensure that chromosome number is maintained from one generation to the next. In animal cells, one notable exception to the normal process of cytokinesis is oogenesis (the creation of an ovum in the ovarian follicle of the ovary), where the ovum takes almost all the cytoplasm and organelles, leaving very little for the resulting polar bodies, which then die. In plant cells, a dividing structure known as the cell plate forms across the centre of the cytoplasm and a new cell wall forms between the two daughter cells. Cytokinesis is distinguished from the prokaryotic process of binary fission.

If it is simply a matter of how much weight it can support, the biggest bridge wins.  If you have a restriction on how much your bridge can weigh or how many pieces of wood you can use or how much space the brigde can occupy, then the answer is much more complicated.  If the best design will be judged based on weight supported divided by the weight of your bridge, then a very light weight bridge that is highly efficient (all the structural members are loaded to almost their breaking point) will win.      This can be a very interesting project.  If possible, I suggest you actually build some test bridges, load them until they break and look carefully at where the weak points are.  good luck

Therefore:    3b - a = 12 and  2(a - b) = 12    Since 2(a - b) = 12, we have  a - b = 6  => b = a - 6    Substitute into the first equation:  3(a - 6) - a = 12  => 3a - 18 - a = 12  => 2a = 12 + 18  => 2a = 30  => a = 15    Ann had 15 cents    (And Betty had 9 cents)|`|aztQDdMXaa	As many cents as betty had....i dont know!!!!!! ah  =>_|`|WWlYETgHaa	Thought I had it, but it was way off.|`|uxJ3TGvuaa	Ann had 15 Betty had 9|`|YgSdjIkHaa	Work backward.  If at the end they both had 12 cents.  Then Betty had to have given Ann 6 cents.  Which means that Betty had to have had 18 cents, because there is always a total of 24 cents.  Which meant that before that, Betty had 9 and was given 9 cents.  So Betty originally had 9 cents.  So Ann had 24 minus 9 or 15 cents at the beginning.
4KptBDXmaa	Why are you asking us? Shouldn't you know the answer to this question based on your own years of living? For me personally, I would probably put on a warm coat if temperatures dropped below 45-50F (especially if it is raining/snowing or windy), but you are probably different. If you think 40F is "warm", then you probably wouldn't want to wear a warm coat until temperatures fell below 30F. |`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	About 70 for me but I don't need it unless it gets below about 55 degrees.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Anything Below FREEZING.|`|8aa1b215c8d6eee277d8176d813caf1caa	I would say anywhere below 65 degrees...|`|A7hBFAaOaa	well ill say like 30s and below

20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	1. Your momentum = 70x4 = 280 kg.m/s towards your friend let us consider this  direction positive.   2. Momentum of your friend before collision = -60x5 = -300 kg.m/s. 3.Total momentum before  collision = 280-300 = -20. As momentum has to be conserved as you lock together after collision. The combined momentum has to be = -20 kg.m/s that is in te direction of your friends momentum before collision. So he wins this collision.   4. The velocity with which you both move = 20/(70+60) = 0.1538 m/s.  5. Kinetic Energy before collision = 0.5x70x4^2 + 0.5x60x5^2 = 1310 J  Kinetic Energy after collision = 0.5x130x0.1538^2 = 1.53 J   So the collision is inelastic.|`|BmIWeBwvaa	1. Your momentum before the collision is your mass times your velocity.    (70 kg)(4 m/s) = 280 kg.m/s    2. Your friend's velocity is in the opposite direction. So the friend's velocity is negative.    (60 kg)(-5 m/s) = -300 kg.m/s    3. The friend is going to win the collision, because the friend has more momentum in his or her direction.    4. The momentum before must equal the momentum after. When you and the friend are holding each other, you have one collective mass and one collective velocity.    280 kg.m/s - 300 kg.m/s = (70 + 60 kg) * v    -20 kg.m/s = 130 kg * v    v = -0.154 m/s (in the direction the friend was traveling)    5. This is an inelastic collision. And kinetic energy is not conserved.|`|Gmvldblraa	1. m . v = 70 . 4 = 280 kg m/s (this one will be - )    2. m.v = 60 . 5 = 300 kg m/s     One of these has to be negative as they are in opposite directions.  Call the 300 positive because its the larger. So the 280 is actually -280     3. Actually no-one wins. All forces are equal and opposite.     Actually you win as your change in velocity is 4.15 m/s while your friends change of velocity is 4.85 m/s. Its changes in velocity that hurt.    Actually your friend wins because you both finish traveling in the same direction that your friend was going in.    Take your pick.    4. final velocity = total momentum / total mass  = (300 - 280)/130                          = 0.15 m/s    5. The collision is "inelastic" meaning that Kinetic energy is not conserved. Most of the original kinetic energy has been converted into heat probably. You can work it out but the final velocity is so low that there is hardly any KE left, and  they had quite a lot as the came towards each other.

KJHw0oI3aa	Since you are given the information that 1 mole *(6.02 x 10^23) of photons have 92.5 kJ of energy, you have to first find the energy of a single photon.  First, convert 92.5 kilojoules to joules by multiplying by 1,000.  This equals 92,500 joules.  Next, divide this number by 6.02 x 10^23 photons to find the energy in a single photon:    (9.25 x 10^4 J) / (6.02 x 10^23 photons) = 1.54 x 10^-19 J/photon    The formula for the energy of a photon is    energy = Planck's constant x frequency    Unfortunately, it does not contain the wavelength so we need enother equation:    speed of light = frequency x wavelength  frequency = speed of light / wavelength    Substituting for frequency in the top equation, we get:    energy = (Planck's constant x speed of light) / wavelength  wavelength x energy = Planck's constant x speed of light  wavelength = (Planck's constant x speed of light) / energy    The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant equal to 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.  Plack's constant is given as 6.63  10^?34 J?s .  Substituting in the above equation we get:    wavelength = [(6.63  10^?34 J?s)(3.00 x 10^8 m/s)] / (1.54 x 10^-19 J) = 1.29 x 10^-6 m.    The wavelength of photons with the energy of 92.5 kJ/mol is 1.29 x 10^-6 meter.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.    Some rotor machines were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or coprime to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the full cycle of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbe...|`|Q5RgGZ78aa	Only if you get bored...that's the only reason i can think of using prime numbers in a normal life...kinda sucks doesn't it?  prime numbers are useless to everyday folk like you and i, remember that|`|bGPt8pj5aa	In cryptology BIG prime numbers are very important|`|5xAu3RAZaa	imma be a psychologist,  where in normal life would i need to use a logarithm??  where in normal life would i need to graph a hyperbola???

You want every 3 people to share a bowl of salsa, every 5 people to share a bowl of chips, and every 8 people share a bowl of punch. How many bowls do you need to buy to make sure you have enough bowls, assuming you thrify and don't wish to buy too many more than you actually need. This question involves principles dealing with primes and divisibility - number theory.     You collect some car sales data and note that on average, and I say on average because economic conditions vary, but on AVERAGE, it seems you sell around 18 types of a certain model when the price is about 12,000. For each 500 dollar increase it seems, on average, that you sell one less of this model per month, and for each 500 dollar decrease you seem to sell one more per month. What price would bring you the most cash sales wise, on average? This would result in a quadratic equation.    Math teachers clearly use math more than most, but you know, things become of use in unlikely places sometimes. Why just the other day Shakespeare came up in conversation with a friend, and although English is not my forte, I didn't feel stupid and could folow the conversation.

cp1G4aDaaa	You can derive the golden ratio in basic algebra and geometry courses.  As far as majors, some would argue that Architecture makes most use of this concept, but arguments can be advanced for music, painting, and others...    One of the more interesting observations about the golden ratio is that the ratio of successive terms of the fibonacci sequence approach the golden ratio from above and below.  This seems pretty mystical (?)    Here is a link to a good discussion:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rati...|`|	idk sorry|`|	I first came across the golden ratio in college when i took a Geometry class that was focused for design majors (so, architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, etc)  it might have been mentioned in my high school geometry class, i dont remember|`|	I'm in high school level geometry, and we learned about it already.   Not in like super depth but we learned it... although I slept through most of it =P|`|	If there is a math class in which you could say you "study the golden ratio," it would have to be number theory.    However, we really study different contexts in which certain properties of self-similarity cause the golden ratio to appear in equations.    Perhaps the most text-book example of when this happens is the limit of the ratio of the Fibonacci numbers.  Mathematically, this is stated as follows:  Let F(n) be the nth Fibonacci number.  Then  lim(n->infinity)  F(n+1) / F(n) = the golden ratio.    Again, it's less that we're studying the golden ratio, and more just that the golden ratio is so basic to the discussion of self-similarity that it may appear in lots of different situations.|`|	I first encountered it at age 8 when awatching a cartoon called "Donald in Mathmagic  Land"    It is used in architecture because the rectangle based on the golden mean seems to be very pleasing to the human eye and psyche.    You might also encounter the golden ratio in biology since the Fibonacci spiral which closely approximates the golden spiral predicts how many branches most trees will have at a given height.

The reason people panic is because our councils do not clear the roads in time, where I live they only clear the main road (if we are lucky) but what is the use of a main road being cleared if you cannot get out of your own side road.    Years ago you could not open your door because of the height of the snow and we always got to school because we had to walk, schools never closed down, we were sat there in our jumpers and coats and got on with it.     I have to go out on Monday but if it is snowing I will wrap up, put my warm boots on and set off walking.  There is nothing like the feel of fresh snow under your feet.    I know there will be people who are not fit enough to do this but like I say if the councils got themselves organised (they have had enough warning) then the roads would be clear for these people to get their cars out or get a taxi or a bus.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	I dont mind if it all gets here tomorrow and then goes again ready for monday    I love the snow but you are right its awful when you have to drive in it as we cant seem to keep the roads ice free in the uk.

1gnzdHbCaa	What happens is the bullet will go as far as it can up in the air, and then lock on to curtis and go through his skull, killing him instantly. You were obviously high when asking this question.|`|O7rMKLEMaa	They go looking for innocent heads to fall on.     If there were no atmosphere, the bullet would follow a parabolic trajectory, falling to Earth with the same speed as when it came out the muzzle of the gun. However, air friction slows the bullet down. It falls at a steeper angle and slower speed. Except for really big artillery shells, bullets reach terminal velocity before reaching the ground.     According to my own corollary to Stokes law, the kinetic energy of bullets, of a given shape and density and falling vertically at terminal velocity, is proportional to the 7th power of diameter. So a .44 caliber bullet, weighing 8 times as much as a .22 caliber bullet, will fall on your head with 128 times as much energy. The .22 might make you say ouch, but the .44 will kill you.|`|805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	They go up for a while, gravity slows them down and then they start falling back down to earth again, accelerated by gravity.

NYpiBMCgaa	Fire has as many colors as it does because of the wavelength of light that the compounds you are burning give off as energy is given to them. Simple alcohols for instance, give off a blue wavelength when burned. Different compounds give off a whole array of wavelengths when combusted.    Try making some trimethyl borate. Mix borax (sodium borate) with an acid over light heat (HCl or sulfuric acid works) to form boric acid. Cool then filter this and react it with an alcohol (methanol or ethanol will do) and a drop of sulfuric acid, to form tri(alkyl) borate. These compounds are really interesting because when they are burned, it burns GREEN, which you can compare to the blue color of the alcohol to really see a difference.

1fQeyvG0aa	Your force approach is correct, this is the new equilibrium position of the spring with the mass hanging from it.  The energy approach is a bit trickier.  By setting the potential energy of the spring equal to the potential energy lost by the mass, you are finding the point where all of the original potential energy of the mass has been converted to potential energy in the spring.  This means that the kinetic energy is zero, BUT it does not mean the spring is at equilibrium.  This is the LOWEST point the mass can reach.  With no friction, the mass will oscillate between this point and its original position, with friction it will eventually settle to the point found using the force method.  This is why the energy method gives twice the displacement of the force method.

The metal is trimorphic, harder than sodium, but softer than aluminium. A well as beryllium and aluminium, and unlike the alkaline metals, it doesnt cause skin-burns. It is less chemically reactive than alkaline metals and than the other alkaline-earth metals.    Calcium ions solved in water form deposits in pipes and boilers and when the water is hard, that is, when it contains too much calcium or magnesium. This can be avoided with the water softeners. In the industry, metallic calcium is separated from the melted calcium chloride by electrolysis. This is obtained by treatment of carbonated minerals with chlorhydric acid, or like a sub product of the carbonates Solvay process.    In contact with air, calcium develops an oxide and nitride coating, which protects it from further corrosion. It burns in the air at a high temperature to produce nitride.    The commercially produced metal reacts easily with water and acids and it produces hydrogen which contains remarkable amounts of ammonia and hydrocarbides as impurities.    Applications    The metal is used in aluminium alloys for bearings, as a helper in the bismuth removal form lead, as well as in controlling graphitic carbon in melted iron. It is also used as a deoxidizer in the manufacture of many steels; as a reducing agent in the preparation of metals as chromium, thorium, zirconium and uranium, and as separating material for gaseous mixtures of nitrogen and argon. Calcium is an alloying used in the production of alluminium, beryllium, copper, lead and magnesium alloys. It is also used in making cements and mortar that are used in builldings.    The calcium oxide, CaO, is produced by thermal decomposition of carbonated minerals in furnaces, applying a continuous bed process.  The oxide is used in high intensity light arcs (lime light) for its unusual spectral characteristics and as dehydrating industrial agent. The metallurgic industry extensively uses the oxide during the reduction of ferrous alloys.    The calcium oxide, Ca(OH)2, has many applications in which the hydroxyl ion is necessary. In the process of calcium hydroxide quenching, the volume of blown out lime [Ca(OH)2] expends to double the initial quantity of quick lime (CaO), fact that makes it useful to break down rocks or wood.    The quick lime is an excellent absorbent for the carbon dioxide, because it produces carbonate, which is very insoluble.    The calcium silicate, CaSi, prepared in an electric oven from lime, silica and reducing carbonated agents, is useful as a steel-deoxidizing agent. Calcium carbide, CaC2, is produces when heating up a mixture of lime and carbon at 3000oC in an electric oven and it is an acetylate which produces acetylene by hydrolysis. The acetylene is the base material of a great number of important chemicals for the organic industrial chemistry.    The pure calcium carbonate occurs in two crystalline forms: calcite, hexagonal shaped, which possesses birrefringent properties, and aragonite, rhombohedric. The natural carbonates are the most abundant calcium minerals. The Iceland spar and the calcite are essentially pure carbonate forms, whilst the marble is impure and much more compact, reason why it can be polished. Its very demanded as construction material. Although the calcium carbonate is very little soluble in water, it is quite soluble if the water contains dissolved carbon dioxide, for in these solutions it forms bicarbonate when dissolving. This fact explains the cave formation, where the lime stone deposits have been in contact with acid waters.    The calcium halogenures include phosphorescent fluoride, which is the calcium compound more abundant and with important applications in spectroscopy. The calcium chloride possesses, in the anhydric form, great deliquescence capacity, which makes it useful as industrial dehydrating agent and as sand whirl control factor in roads. Calcium hypochlorite (whitening powder) is produced in the industry when passing chlorine through a lime solution, and has been used as a whitening agent and as water purifier.    The dehydrated calcium sulphate is the mineral gypsum, constitutes the bigger portion of Portland concrete, and has been used to reduce the alkalinity of soils. Heating gypsum at high temperatures produces a calciu

AA12121778	Yes!    In order to understand why Red sky at night, sailors delight. Red sky in morning, sailors warning can predict the weather, we must understand more about weather and the colors in the sky.     Usually, weather moves from west to east, blown by the westerly trade winds. This means storm systems generally move in from the West.     The colors we see in the sky are due to the rays of sunlight being split into colors of the spectrum as they pass through the atmosphere and ricochet off the water vapor and particles in the atmosphere. The amounts of water vapor and dust particles in the atmosphere are good indicators of weather conditions. They also determine which colors we will see in the sky.    During sunrise and sunset the sun is low in the sky, and it transmits light through the thickest part of the atmosphere. A red sky suggests an atmosphere loaded with dust and moisture particles. We see the red, because red wavelengths (the longest in the color spectrum) are breaking through the atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths, such as blue, are scattered and broken up.     Red sky at night, sailors delight.  When we see a red sky at night, this means that the setting sun is sending its light through a high concentration of dust particles. This usually indicates high pressure and stable air coming in from the west. Basically good weather will follow.     Red sky in morning, sailors warning.  A red sunrise reflects the dust particles of a system that has just passed from the west. This indicates that a storm system may be moving to the east.

AA10758548	An aircraft flies due to aerodynamic reactions that happen when there is relative motion between air and a wing.    If a cross-section of a typical aircraft wing is viewed, the top of the wing can be seen to be curved downwards, while the bottom of the wing is less curved or straight, but angled to the airflow. This shape, called an airfoil or aerofoil, creates lift when it travels through the air. However, this optimisation is not applicable for aerobatic aircraft, which need to fly inverted, or for supersonic aircraft.    Lift is created as an airstream passes by something which deflects it. The force created by this deflection of the air creates an equal and opposite force on the wing according to Newton's third law of motion. The deflection of airflow downward during the creation of lift is known as downwash.    Nearly any shape will produce lift if curved or tilted with respect to the air flow direction. However, most shapes will be very inefficient and create too much drag. One of the primary goals of wing design is to devise a shape that produces the most lift while producing the least lift-induced drag.|`|021b06081ef23b6475e57143dd1ef281aa	An aircraft flies due to aerodynamic reactions that happen when there is relative motion between air and a wing.

As a result when an airflow strikes the wing, the air that goes over the top has to travel faster than the air that goes over the bottom (otherwise we would lose some air somewhere). The faster moving air has a lower pressure (Bernoulli's principle - but its quite easy to see why here - the air that split to go over the top has to stretch further, because the top of the wing is longer).

Reactance is an energy storing device and is associated with coils which are magnetic energy producing device.    Hence a reactance stores energy and then gives it back .    Impedeance is the sum of resistance  plus reactance but reactance is 90 degrees out of phase. Hence reactance is   described as imaginary quantity where resistance is real quantity.

AA12349680	THE MAGNUS EFFECT    They are the VELOCITY of the ball, determined by the force at which it is struck; the SPIN of the ball, which imparts the curve; and the DRAG, or the braking effect of the air.     The key factor in all this is something called the Magnus Effect, named after a 19th-century German physicist, Gustav Magnus, who was curious to understand why spinning artillery shells deflected to one side.       Just after a kick, a spinning ball is moving forward at relatively high velocity, and the air flows irregularly over it.     But when the ball slows down -- specifically, when it reaches between eight metres and 10 metres per second (18-23 miles per hour), depending on its surface structure and texture -- the airflow becomes smooth, or "laminar," which instantly increases the drag.   Magnus found that a spinning ball or cylinder swirls the air around it, causing vortices on both sides of its surface.     Thus, one side of a spinning football experiences lift, while the other side is slowed. It is this imbalance of local air pressures that causes the sideways movement -- the curve.     But the real masters of the banana kick can also get the ball to change angle during its flight.       The change is dramatic. In a fraction of a second, drag can be increased by 150 percent. This drastically brakes the forward movement of the ball and thus enhances the curving movement derived by the Magnus Effect.|`|AA10965044	The football is under the laws of projectile motion which is governed by the laws of gravity. However, in reality, it is much more complicated. It also involves air resistance and the ball's spin.    If you thing of air itself as a kind of "road" (a soft road), then it is possible to "drive" on this soft road by spinning. So in truth, there is a path that the ball is heading, that is the projectile motion. BUT, there is also another motion that the spin is moving on the "soft air road" which will make it deviate from the "projectile path". The greater the spin, the greater the deviation.    Additionally, if one can time a spin such that it influences the ball up to a certain point and then stops influencing it (the spin stops in mid air), you can imagine that kind of trick this can have on the ball's motion. It may travel along a path and suddenly deviate from it (for example, like a dip). So the motion of the banana kick can take on very curved paths, depending on the skills of the player who knows how to manipulate contact with the ball itself, resulting in the desired spin, velocity and terminating conditions of the ball's trajectory.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Its called teh Magnus effect.|`|1fd89d0fb169b475f9bd840ff1135c3daa	only a man with good 'banana' can answer....|`|AA12215303	Centrificul force.|`|bc61c5569750d70b6008f617ed44d626aa	It creats air turbulance - Vortex in air, so it travel curved pattern in air.

The only problem is, is that we don't understand much at all of the known universe. Not even electricity or what causes Electromotive Force. We have theories, but thats all we have. Einstein spent the rest of his life at Princeton trying to produce the "Theory of Everything". P.S. His Nobel didn't come from his paper on "relativity".

Now human history sometimes repeats itself NOT because our collective behavior can be described using some mathematical equation.

You assume that there is some magical function that associates a certain place in spacetime with a certain flow of events on Earth; but what could that possibly be? There is absolutely no evidence to support this view.  The observation that history tends to repeat itself can best be explained by the observation that the fundamental properties of the human mind and of the Earth itself have not changed radically over our history.  If a certain human mindset, certain social conditions, and certain environmental factors lead to a certain flow of events x number of years ago, then an analogous set of conditions could lead to a similar flow of events today.  You are correct in saying that planets and solar systems travel in fairly closed loops around the galaxy, but the revolution of the sun in the galaxy takes millions of millions of years, whereas human civilization has only been around for about 10,000.

We can all cut and paste.    In a crystal, energy can pass through the lattice in the form of vibrations. These vibrations obey the rules of quantum mechanics.     They are also vibrations in a lattice of atoms that can scatter them, so they diffract in the way light diffracts from a 1 dimensional diffraction grating (you may have seen this in the lab). Except here the scattering points are in 3D.    This diffraction means that the vibrational waves travel differently in different direction through the crystal. Some are not allowed at all.     As the packets of vibrations (called phonons) move through the lattice they may hit atoms, impurities, defects or each other. When they do this they bounce off each other or scatter. In most cases they do this elasctically - like two billiard balls hitting each other. Phonon momentum and energy are conserved.    But if the scattering phonons would lead to a new phonon that the rules of diffraction above would not allow, they cannot scatter this way. Instead, a chunk of momentum is passed to the lattice, and the phonon that comes out is back within the rules. This sort of scattering is called Umklapp scattering.(umklapp is German for fold, because the momentum transferred to the lattice basically fold the phonon back by an amount characteristic of the lattice and not the phonon itself).    Because it is the only process that transfers momentum from the vibration to the lattice itself,it is the only thing that resists heat flow (heat flow is a flow of crystal vibrations).

AA10223886	The sky appears blue (instead of black) because light passing through the air hits tiny particles like dust and pollen. These tiny particles are large enough to reflect blue light, but red light (which has a longer wavelength) is not reflected nearly as much. So the result is that the blue light gets scattered by the particles, and you see it when you look up.     The other side of this is sunset, when the sun appears reddish-orange low on the horizon. That's because the light rays have to pass through a lot of air (and particles) before they get to your eyes, and all the blue light was scattered away and dispersed. That leaves only the red end of the spectrum to penetrate the atmosphere and reach your eyes.     At noon, the sun is coming straight down and only passing through ten miles of atmosphere or so. At sunset, the same light has to pass through many hundreds of miles of air to reach you. You will see more dramatic sunsets (redder and darker) when there's a lot of dust, smoke or pollen in the air. When volcanic eruptions occur, intense sunset colors are seen around the world, sometimes for a couple of years after the event.     If the air is truly pure, it doesn't scatter light much at all. If you climb up above the atmosphere, or nearly to the top of it in an airplane, the sky appears black, not blue. If we had particle-free air, the sky would likewise appear black instead of blue. But we don't.|`|AA11699770	The sky is blue because of dust particles suspended in the atmosphere. White light hits the atmosphere, and we know white light can be split into different wave lengths which correspond to  differnet colors. This is what happens when we see a rainbow.    It turns out that light with the wavelength of blue, passes through the dust in the atmosphere easiest, hence we see a blue sky. In the morning or the evening, just after sunrise or before sunset, the light has to pass through more atmosphere than at any other time. In these conditions red light passes through the atmosphere easiest, hence the red sunrise and sunsets. Hope this answers your question.|`|29df115d19fde53cf569e1770c60766caa	color is like a rainbow you see after a rain shower. light is a spectrum of color and has a wavelenght for each color. as light from the sun reaches the atmoshere, red, yellow, green,and so forth due to it's wavelenght gets filtered out leaving blue|`|038f9b97b650cf3d250161d1d71c272aaa	SKY IS BLUE BECAUSE BLUE LIGHT HAS LOO FREQENCY SO THAT IT SCCATERS IN THE SKY AND CAN'T REACH TO EARTH SO|`|5ac456c16b5984df81c92244ed645042aa	Since water covers most of the earth, the blue sky is a reflection of the blue water.|`|AA11819902	OK, its not reflected off of particles in the sky.      The blue light is absorbed and re-emitted by gasses in the atmosphere.  The reason they grab the blue light is because the energy contained in the blue photons corrosponds to a quantum level jump in the electron energy levels of the gas.    So, light passing above us is absorbed and then re-emitted in a random direction when the electron drops back down an energy level.  Some of the photons make it to us.      Now, most of the other things that were said about sunsets being red/orange because the blue has been 'filtered' out and the sky would be black if it weren't for the scattered blue light are valid.    Oh, jeez, the web site 'why is the sky blue' isn't about physics.  Its a commercial gambling site and they admit that they don't know why the sky is blue.  They just liked the name.

Medusa,  es el nombre comn de cualquiera de los animales invertebrados que componen dos clases del filo Celentreos. Se conocen unas 2.700 especies de hidrozoos y 200 de escifozoos. El trmino medusa se aplica de forma especfica a los organismos gelatinosos de natacin libre llamados medusas, forma que habitualmente adoptan estos animales en su fase sexual, generacin que alterna con una fase de plipo en la que la reproduccin es asexual. En una de las clases, las medusas tienden a ser peque?as y los plipos estn bien desarrollados, mientras que en la otra predominan las medusas. Ambas clases son marinas, a excepcin de unos pocos hidrozoos, como la hidra, que viven en agua dulce.  Las medusas tienen escaso valor nutritivo. Su picadura puede ser dolorosa, y unas pocas variedades tropicales en ocasiones causan la muerte de los seres humanos.  Al igual que otros celentreos, la medusa tiene slo dos capas de desarrollo importantes (ectodermo y endodermo), carece de cabeza, tiene aparato digestivo pero no ano, y tiene un sistema nervioso sin cerebro. El cuerpo presenta simetra radial, es decir, en torno a un eje. Las presas suelen ser capturadas por tentculos armados de nematocistos, o clulas urticantes. Los plipos suelen vivir en los fondos marinos y generan otros plipos por reproduccin asexual. Los plipos de hidrozoos suelen formar colonias con diferentes tipos de plipos especializados en funciones tales como la reproduccin y la alimentacin. Los plipos pueden surgir de la medusa por gemacin.  Por lo general la medusa produce huevos y esperma que se fusionan para dar lugar a una nueva generacin de plipos. Las medusas tienen forma acampanada y nadan contrayendo los msculos del velo. Su conducta es sencilla; la mayora nada con lentitud y es arrastrada por las corrientes. Su transparencia se debe en parte a que el cuerpo de una medusa contiene menos de un 1% de materia orgnica; el resto es agua. Las medusas ms grandes miden hasta 2 m de dimetro.  Clasificacin cientfica: las distintas medusas componen las clases Hydrozoa, con plipos bien desarrollados, y Scyphozoa, en la que predominan las medusas, pertenecientes al filo Coelenterata (o Cnidaria).

Se recomienda empapar el rea con una solucin de vinagre y agua (mitad de vinagre y mitad de agua) durante unos 30 minutos para remover cualquier nematocisto (dardo urticante) que todava quede. Se debe enjuagar el rea y despus empaparla de nuevo con la misma solucin de media cantidad de vinagre.  Para retirar los tentculos que queden, se puede utilizar harina o crema de afeitar y raspar con un instrumento romo, como una tarjeta de crdito. Se debe aplicar una crema que contenga un analgsico, un antihistamnico y un corticosteroide.  Avispa de mar (generalmente se encuentra en aguas australianas):  SE DEBE LLAMAR A UNA AMBULANCIA, ya que la muerte puede sobrevenir en pocos minutos.

Firstly, Einstein had many theories, and was involved in many areas of physics. This has lead to theories regarding the unified nature of all physical sciences.     To understand relativity, you must first go back to basics, such as the newtonian set. Velocity, gravity, time and space as linear. Einsteins theories on relativity have one basic assumption, which I believe is incorrect. This is that Light speed is a constant (~330,000km/ second.     For the theorum to tie together, it requires an atomic study of energy and matter, and that the two are interchangeable. E = mc2 is the main popular theory, such that the mass of an object can be converted to equivalent energy at the rate of c (light speed squared). However, with c as the constant, time can no longer be considered constant, as if an object approached light speed, time has less effect on it.    Anyway, the short of it is that if you are moving on a bus, and you throw a ball forward, the speed of the ball is not ball + bus, it is simply the ball, as by relative terms, the bus is the reference point, not the earth beneath the moving bus.     Also, this means that it is impossible to go above light speed, but it is possible to make time shorter (which is the bit that I believe is an incorrect understanding of the physical universe, whereas I believe that relativistically, the atomic particles slow down when aproaching light speed, and not time itself).     Anyway, read some web stuff and then come back to me when you are done and still have questions.|`|ac8c4d29fee0da9b15e816ff2775bd80aa	einstein say's do your own home work! Or I'll melt your brain!

From one perspective he watched the train as it moved quickly where it gave the illusion of being stopped when he would move his head just right.  Then the other perspective he watched the cows from the train- and noticed that each cow seemed to move either slower or faster from his perspective- even though the train was going the same speed.    So your specific quesiton is- what?  Are you curious about the subatomic particles when they go backwards in time?

Possibly both. What was their importance? They were revolutionary. Why? Ah, there's the rub.  As part of the centenary celebrations of Einstein's "miraculous year" when, as a 26-year-old patent office clerk he came up with his special theory of relativity (which is different from the general theory of relativity, which came 10 years later, and was even more revolutionary - let's just say it folded gravity into an already heady mix, and leave it there), a prize of 15,000 is being offered to anyone who can explain the theory in layman's terms. So let's have a go.    First, it's not an entirely original concept: Galileo used a kind of relativity to explain why we're not all swept off the earth as it rotates. Imagine a moving ship, he said; within that ship, everything functions as though you're on dry land (or, if you're worried about wave motion, try a train). Einstein's observation was that the passage of time, which everyone had always simply assumed is constant and immutable, is not: it's the speed of light that is. "Now Galileo would start to get unhappy there," says Sir Roger Penrose, author of The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, "because you'd think if you're moving along almost with the speed of light, the light should seem to be going more slowly. Why does it seem to be going at the same speed, no matter how fast you move? It seems like a paradox at first."    The theory of relativity was revolutionary because it showed how the speed at which time happens is mutable; that space and time are not discrete entities: time and space and motion (ie, movement through space) collapse into a fourth dimension, in which all act on each other. It is impossible to say "now" without saying "here" and "how fast".    Or, to put it another way, imagine you have a twin. You stay on earth, your twin goes into space on a fast rocket ship for 10 years; when they come back, they're a couple of years younger than you are. It even works with aeroplanes: circle the earth, flying low; when you return to your starting point, your watch will be slightly behind. "If you were actually moving at the speed of light (which you couldn't do, but suppose you could)," says Penrose, "your watch would stop altogether." It's a rather more expensive method of age-defiance than Crme de la Mer, but then again, it has the advantage of being a physical law of the universe.

So, I really appreciate that you write "If there is a creation of the world & the universe ...", because indeed, we can only suppose the Universe has a beginning (or not).    ---    We-Humans are used to believing that everything must have a "beginning", but actually, this could be a limited concept induced by our own human nature.    ---    So, my personal answer to your question:    - If I consider that the Universe was "created", had a beginning, I would also consider that... gosh, I don't know lol: speechless.    - If I consider that the Universe has no beginning, well it would surprisingly make more sense to me, because I consider that a "beginning" is a typical human limitating concept.    Given that I consider that the "Everything" is far beyond what we-humans can ever conceptualise, I think that it scientifically makes sense that the Universe has no beginning - because its essence is far beyond what we-humans can ever perceive.    So, in this case, there is no need to believe in a "creator", given that the Universe would have no beginning, would have not been "created".    ---    I really appreciate that your question starts with "if ...", because we can only state theories: no pragmatic broad-minded scientist can prove yet that the Universe has a beginning or not.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Your statement is nonsense. It does not follow at all that because things exist there must be a creator.    What you would need to do is propose a hypothesis that there is a creator, and what that creator did. This would have to agree with known observations. Then you would extrapolate your theory and predict new observations and look for them.    If you do this for the creator myth it always falls down at the first hurdle - that is, it does not agree with observation. For example, the Christian bible creation myth is out on timing by some 9 billion years- quite a large error.     So it sounds like the creator's motto should be "oops, i am just a figment of the imagination".|`|570e9e130910468ff459fb7d54d14e62aa	Hi,      I think that God is behind the creation.

AA11117311	Scattering is dependent on frequency of light. So, higher frequencies scatter more.    Fog - ie particles suspended in air, is a medium in which light gets scattered. Yellow light, becuause of its lower frequency, will scatter less, so, yellow light will continue to travel in the same path in fog, as compared to say blue light, that will soon disperse in all directions.    As a result, yellow light will light-up the fog, and make things visible more than other lights.|`|AA11937813	http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dispersed    Yellow light or any light for that matter does not disperse fog.

d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Its not clear that you could reach a state of maximum entropy.     The problem is that the set of microstates that the universe can occupy is infinite. This does not imply that there is not a maximum, but identifying it means comparing infinities, which is complex (for more details look up Cantor on a math site - he was one of the first to explore the theory of differently sized infinities).    Should there be a maximum, it would have to be an infinite subset of microstates that forms part of the infinite set of all possible microstates.    Even then, this would only imply dS = 0. From the second law of thermodynamics this would mean that no thermodynamic processes could move forward. Time would still pass, but there would be no energy flow or no net change in the state of any system anywhere in the universe.    So time would pass, but nothing would happen.

Therefore, the answer is "2".    The part you are confused about is because it's wrong. :P It should be:    (+20) **+** (-18)  = 2    "20 + (-18)" is the same thing as writing "20 - 18". This is because you can switch the middle sign and the sign of the last number. I'll explain this using easier numbers:    1 + (-1) = 0    If you switch the "+" to a "-" and you switch the "-1" to a "1" you have:    1 - 1 = 0    If that is too confusing, think about it a little bit. It's a POSITIVE 20 added to a NEGATIVE 18. Therefore, your answer should go DOWN.    Feel free to leave any more notes if you need further explanation. Dropping me an email might work better, actually. :P|`|MAruysqiaa	the minus sign between the 4 and the 6 shouldn't change.  This should remain + sign.

FYI - plus multiplied by plus is always plus  so...  +20 + (-18)  Now we got to multiply the plus with the minus which is always a minus.  +20 - 18 = 2  so the answer is equalled to 2 and you are right!|`|Gg9bK7caaa	-  The multiplication of signs is like making decisions. Let me explain. If you were in car and driving down a number line. There are only two direction you can go, either positive or negative.     The first sign tells me the direction you initially start out at and the second sign tells you whether you want to change your mind.      (-)(-) would say I start off driving toward negative, then I change my mind and turn around. Which direction am I driving? Positive    (-)(+) would say I start off driving toward negative and I don't change my mind. Which direction am I driving? Still Negative.    Here is a tricky one. (-)(-)(-).     I start driving in the negative direction, turn around, and then turn around again. Which direction am I driving? Negative direction    There is pattern we can see. Whenever we multiply PAIRS like signs we get a positive number. PAIRS of opposite signs however give us a negative number.     Find (-5)(-4) + (-6)(+3).    Multiplying numbers repeats addition so (5)(4)=4+4+4+4+4 =20 or 5+5+5+5=20 and (6)(3) = 3+3+3+3+3+3 =18 or 6+6+6=18.    Now use the signs.  (-)(-)(20) + (-)(+)18 = +20 + (-18) = 20 -18 = 2. Notice sign changed to subtraction, because (+)(-) = -. When you are at 20 on a number line and turn around and walk 18 units in the negative direction you will be at 2.

S8H5yYcoaa	Triangles:  1) There are many different kinds of triangles.  For any given triangle, we can divide each edge by the total perimeter to get a similar triangle of perimeter one.  Were it that all triangles of the same perimeter were congruent, then as each triangle is similar to a triangle with perimeter 1, it should be that *all* triangles are similar - clearly false.    Here is an example of 3 triangles with the same perimeter that are clearly not congruent:  - a 3-4-5 right triangle: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12  - a 4-4-4 equilateral triangle: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12  - a 2-5-5 isoceles triangle: 2 + 5 + 5 = 12    2)  Given two angles, as the sum of the interior angles must be 180 you can always determine the third; then given any one edge length the other two are also determined.  This yields two different manners in which to provide information: one in which the known side is between the two known angles, Angle-Side-Angle, and one in which the known side is a different edge, Angle-Angle-Side.    Given one angle and two sides coming from it, a rigid form is determined - you can only from here connect the two unconnected endpoints with a straight line, of specific length and hitting at specific angles.  Then this also determines a triangle, Side-Angle-Side.    My Geometry teacher used to always remind us not to make @$$es of ourselves - not to try to use Angle-Side-Side (or, for that matter, S-S-A, which is of course the same thing), because this does not rigidly determine a triangle: if the angle provided is not between the two given sides, there are often two possible triangles fitting the description.  For example, triangle ABC with A = 30, AB = 3sqrt(3), and BC = 3, could either be the right triangle with B = 90, C = 60, and AC = 6, or the obtuse isoceles triangle with B = 20, C = 120, and AC = 3.    Metric conversion:  The thing to notice in any of these problems is that you've got the same basic unit - grams (g) or liters (L) or meters (m) or whatnot, with a bunch of different prefixes.  If you know what the prefixes mean, it becomes much easier to get everything in order.    There's a table of these prefixes, from the very lerge through the very small, available here: http://www.essex1.com/people/speer/large...  For ease, I'll include here the most widely used of these here, ordered again large to small, but if you're curious about what-all is out there check out the link.    kilo- (kg, kL, km, ...): kilo is large - it means to multiply by 1000.  One meter is a bit more than three feet; a kilometer is a bit over half a mile.  no prefix (g, L, m, ...): no prefix means the unit as is.  For measurements much larger than this, you probably want to convert to kilos; for things smaller, it's easier to think about them in smaller units:  centi- (cg, cL, cm, ...): centi is middling-small - it means to divide by 100.  There are about 2 teaspoons in a centiliter.  A fingernail is generally about 1 centimeter wide.  milli- (mg, mL, mm, ...): milli is smaller - it means to divide my 1000.  The amount of active ingredient in a pill is generally measured in millgrams (the pill weighs more than this, though - an M&M is about 2 grams)    So to convert from one of these to another, we have to compare prefixes.  Let's try a few from the list (I'm not going to do all of them because I really have to get back to my own homework soon) to get an idea of what's going on:    1. 500 cm, 5000 mm, 4 m: since centi means divide by 100, and milli means divide by 1000, converting both of these to meters doesn't make too unmanagable a number, so let's do that.  (500 cm)*(1 m/100 cm) = 500/100 cm*m/cm = 5 m  (5000 mm)*(1 m/1000 mm) = 5000/1000 mm*m/mm = 5 m  So the first two are equal, but greater than the third.    2. 0.2 L, 240 ml, 50 cl: I'm going to choose to convert to centileters for this problem (it doesn't really matter what you convert to for comparison, so long as you convert everything to the same thing, but I'm basing this decision on the fact that the first term is already less than 1, so I'd like to look at it on a smaller scale).  (.2 L)*(100 cL/1 L) = .2*100 L*cL/L = 20 L  (240 mL)*(1 L/1000 mL)*(100 cL/1 L) = 240*100/1000 mL*L*cL/mL*L = 24 cL  So the third term of 50 cL is larger than either the first or second.    Notice that for the conversion of the second term, I first converted from the milli prefix to no prefix, then to the centi prefix.  You can skip this step if you want to and go straight from milli-units to centi-units by the following observation:  There are 100 cL in a L, and 1000 mL in a L.  Then  1 cL = (1 cL)*(1 L/100 cL)*(1000 mL/1 L) = 1*1000/100 cL*L*mL/cL*L = 10 mL - there are 10 mL in a cL.    Using this fact, that second conversion then looks like this:  (240 mL)*(1 cL/10 mL) = 240/10 mL*cL/mL = 24 cL  and in general, just keep multiplying by equal things (1000 g in an kg so you can multiply by 1000 g/1 kg or 1 kg/100 g, for example), continuing to cancel out the current numerator's units with the denominator of

9Wi2eNInaa	Since carbon-12 is six protons and six neutrons in the nucleus and an atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 the nucleus weight of carbon-12 you know that a amu is just one proton or one neutron (equal in mass)    If oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons then 1/4th of the mass of oxygen's nucleus is going to be 4 amu's    So the "new" amu is just 4 times the "old" amu.    Since silicon is atomic weight of approximately 28 , then it has 14 protons and 14 neutrons    So on the new amu it would be  silicon amu = 28/ amu = 7  ( since the new amu is equal to 4 of the old amu)    The value of the new Avogadro's number= take old amu definition and multiply by 4.    The precise definition is that it is one twelfth of the mass of an unbound atom of carbon-12 (12C) at rest and in its ground state.[1]      1 amu=  1 u = 1/NA gram = 1/ (1000 NA) kg   (where NA is Avogadro's number)    So the new scale Avogadro would be:  1u = 4/NA gram|`|8tQ8JLO5aa	Since Oxygen has an atomic mass of 16, the new definition of one AMU would then be 4 present AMU (or a helium nucleus, if you prefer)    Silicon presently has an atomic mass of 28.09.  In your new system it would be 28.09/4 =7.02 New AMU    Avogadro's number would not change on this scale, however, the equivalency of atomic mass to grams per mole would change.  You would have to multiply the New AMU by 4 to get the proper equivalency.

This continuous flexing, combined with whatever heat the tires pick up from the ground itself, heats up the tires, the inner tubes, and the air inside the tubes.Hot air expands. As it expands, it attempts to fill a greater volume. Since the volume is constrained by the rubber walls of the inner tube in the tire, the pressure increases, instead. If the air were free to fill whatever greater volume it required, the pressure would remain constant, and the volume would increase|`|b68c0e65b214b231e045bd334bffdeeeaa	Simply stated, the ground is hot so the air in the tires expands.|`|AA10333764	As the tires go around the rubber moves up and down so the tire is always flat on the side to the ground.

Hopefully your math teacher went over that.  If you remember the place value system, it's quite easy, so let's review that first:    I am sure you remember how it works to the left of the decimal, for example, look at the number 123, there is a 3 in the ones place, a 2 in the tens place, and a 1 in the hundreds place.    There are place-values for numbers to the right of the decimal as well, like in the number 0.123.  Now there is a 0 in the ones place, 1 in the tenths place, a 2 in the hundredths place, and a 3 in the thousandths place.  Because this decimal goes to the thousandths place, if you wrote it as a fraction, it would be over 1,000.  So it would be:    123  -------  1000      Now for the number you gave, 0.2, this number has a 0 in the ones place and a 2 in the tenths place.  Because it is written out to the tenths place, it is over 10.        ANSWER:   2  ----  10    Now, if your teacher wants the fraction in lowest form, this one can be reduced.  Because both the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) of the fraction are both divisible by two, you can reduce the fraction by dividing both of them by 2     2    2          ----           10   2           This would give you a reduced fraction of:    1  ---  5|`|Wng05H8uaa	it is 2/10 reduces is 1/5  take what decimal place (this ex. its tenths) and put the number over it    ex. .05  5/100|`|8aA31siRaa	0.2 = 2/10 or 1/5    Because 0.2 is one fifth of 1.

C2S3guXMaa	There's a common misunderstanding about black holes. Their gravity isn't any greater than for any other mass of the same size. The only reason their gravity can become so large as not to allow light to escape is purely and simply because their mass is packed so densely that objects can get a lot closer to the black hole's centre of gravity.    In a nutshell, the high gravitational force of a black hole is not because its gravity is greater but because objects can get a lot closer.|`|K5ezVimbaa	It would suck us all in to one spot, smaller than an atom.

Important difference. If you would replace the sun by a black hole of the same mass, you would not get pulled into the sun suddenly - the gravity of the sun stays the same.     You have to remember how compact a black hole is: A black hole of the mass of Earth would have only 9 mm diameter. The sun would be a few kms large as black hole.     A black hole, which should be able to survive for one second before evaporating, would already weight as much as two Ticonderoga cruisers. |`|Er5VmJvvaa	well first for a black hole to appear on are planet tons of technical stuff would have to happen, but if it did i suppose it would rip everything up little by little at an extremely fast rate.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Im wondering the same thing, even if it were small, wouldn't this have dire effects on the planet.

If a mini black hole is created then it would do us no harm, you see, what makes black holes so powerful is the amount of mass in them, all the planets, stars and other space debris that get pulled into them all squashed into a small area called the singularity, this has a mass to volume ratio of unimaginable proportions.  Now if they do manage to make a mini black hole it would be so tiny and last for such a short time that it wouldn't have enough mass to pull any thing into it other than a bit of air maybe, and then what would you be left with after the initial gravitational field from smashing the protons together had faded?... some air, or maybe even compressed air, which would decompress as instantly as the gravitational field disappeared, it certainly wouldn't have enough of a gravitational pull to stop light getting out or pull the earth into it...   Try to think of these mini black holes less as black holes, and more like a momentary point of gravity created by the protons smashing into each other, unless amounts of material equalling several solar systems all got pulled into that point in that split second, then there isn't enough mass to make a black hole.|`|GCUjfJs0aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJb5GeJam... check it out this is how we wold be sucked|`|dI1sHdDwaa	if your talking about the big bang thoery, well the black whol would be in a containment centr and wouldnt be very big it would barely destroy a building. so sorry we arent going to die.
SejorKDfaa	The initial conditions are    v(0) = v_0  x(0) = x_0    Okay. The first thing to do is define a useful coordinate system and then draw free body diagram. Please see this linkfor how I did this. (The total weight is the vector I forgot to label.)    http://s473.photobucket.com/albums/rr91/...    The way I interpret this problem is as follows. The component of the block's weight in the x-direction is as shown.  The retarding force F is in the positive x direction and opposses this component. Using Newtons second law, the sum of the forces in the x-direction is given by     F_x = F - W_x = ma    Since    F = kv  W = mg --------> m = W/g    W_x = Wsin() = mgsin()  a = dv/dt    You have    F - W_x = ma  (kv) - mgsin() = (W/g) dv/dt    where I am using  for the angle.     Now you need to separate variables and integrate.     Step 1  Divid both sides of the equation by dv to get    [ (kv)  - mgsin() ] / dv = (W/g) /dt    Step 2  Take the multiplicicative inverse of both sides to get    dv / [ (kv)  - mgsin() ]  = dt (g/W)       If  is assumed to be constant, then integrating both sides results in    (1/k) ln[ (kv)  - mgsin() ] - (1/k)ln|c| = gt/W    where I have used (1/k)ln|c| as the arbitrary constant of integration. Combining the left side using the properties of logarithms results in    (1/k)ln[ ( (kv)  - mgsin() ) /c ] = gt/W    which is the same as     ln[ ((kv)  - mgsin()/c ] = gkt/W    OR    ( (kv)  - mgsin() )/c = e^[gkt/W]     kv  - mgsin() = ce^[gkt/W] ------------> equation 1    At this point I will use the initial condition v(0) = v_0 to solve for c.    kv_0 - mgsin() = ce^(0)    c = kv_0 - mgsin()     Therefore using equation 1     kv  - mgsin() = ( kv_0 - mgsin() )e^[gkt/W]    v (t) =[ ( kv_0 - mgsin() )e^[gkt/W] + mgsin() ] / k    I am sure this can be simplified, but I kind of have to take off right now. (I hope I didn't make any "careless" mistakes.)

The partial solution of (3) must have  the form vp(t)=b*sina +c*cosa (6)  (Where vp=partial solution)  Substituting (6)  to (3) we take  bcosa-csina+absina+ccosa=gcosa  So must be  b+c=g  ab-c=0  In other words b=g/(a+1) ,c=ag/(a+1)  So vp=[g/(a+1)]sina+[ag/(a+1)]cosa (7)  Adding finally (5) with (7) we take  v(t)=v0*e^(-at) +   [g/(a+1)]sina+[ag/(a+1)]cosa    Now to find x(t) Put v(t)=x'(t) and  solve for x(t)

Then we have:    x = [a0;a1,...,am] vs. y = [b0;b1,...,bm]    Well, [a0;a1,...,am] = a0+[0;a1,...,am], and:    [0;a1,...,am] = 1/[a1;a2,...,am]    Since a1  1, [a1;a2,...,am]  1, and [0;a1,...,am]  1.  Thus:    [a0;a1,...,am]  a0+1    Now b0 > a0, so b0  a0+1.  Thus:    [a0;a1,...,am]  a0+1  b0     Now [0;b1,...,bm]  0.  Thus:    x = [a0;a1,...,am]  b0 = b0+[0;b1,...,bm] = [b0;b1,...,bm] = y    Now suppose we've shown that for some k  0, when we're in the above situation, x  y if k is even, y  x if k is odd.  So consider the k+1 case.  Define:    x' = [a1;a2,...,am], y' = [b1;b2,...,bm]    We have:    x = a0+1/x', y = b0+1/y' = a0+1/y'    And we have that x', y' are covered by the k case of the statement.  Thus x'  y' and hence 1/x'  1/y' if k is even, and x'  y' and hence 1/x'  1/y' if k is odd.  In the former case:    x = a0+1/x'  a0+1/y' = y    In the latter case:    x = a0+1/x'  a0+1/y' = y    Done.

You already have the first step- a dream journal. I use a pen that would only be used when writing down my dreams. It's just to make it more special to you, so it becomes important. When you go to sleep, repeat to yourself 'I will remember my dreams'. You can also try reading about lucid dreaming or such before you go to bed.    In the morning, if you do not remember your dream, don't get stressed. Be positive. Say to yourself I'll try again tonight. Also write that down in your dream journal. Try to write something everyday as soon as you wake up. If you do have a dream, even if it is fragmentary or blurry, write what's in your mind (what you are feeling, how you think the dream was, etc.). It took me about a month to get to the point of remembering 2-4 dreams a night. To tell you the truth, I actually get tired of writing all the dreams I had the past night.

The residue of CaO will slowly revert back to CaCO3, given enough time, but this is a very slow reaction at room temperature. In fact CaO (quick lime) can be stored almost indefinitely.  The reverse reaction to reform CaCO3 easily takes place in an aqueous suspension. This is a two part reaction:   CaO + H2O  Ca(OH)2 This is slaked lime.   On exposure to CO2, The reaction is  Ca(OH)2 + CO2  CaCO3 +H2O  If you take the solution of slaked lime, called lime water for convenience, and bubble CO2 through it,(in the lab your breath is sufficient)  you will get a preciptate of CaCO3 - the clear lime water goes milky. This proves the reformation of the CaCO3. The reaction is reversible

A circle circumscribed about a hexagon would obviously be divided into 6 equal sections!    By drawing a radius from the circle's centre to the 6 vertices of the hexagon, you end up dividing the circle's perimeter into 6 equal arcs!    A circle's perimeter is determined by the formula:    P = 2Pi x R    So a sixth of the perimeter is:    P/6  OR    (2Pi x R)/6, which simplifies into:    (Pi x R)/3    I hope that helps and is clear enough. :) Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

Since there are certain properties and theorems etc. dictating that all angles or pairs of angles in one kind of quadrilateral or another must be equal or of a particular value, and since these theorems can be confusing and tedious to remember, you need only remember these 2 simple facts: A quadrilateral is 2 triangles & the angles in a triangle must add up to 180 degrees.    This is true regardless whether the quadrilateral was inscribed in a circle or not.    In the given quadrilateral, the order of its vertices indicate that W & R are adjacent to each other. So when you draw a diagonal joining two angles opposite from each other, you'll have a triangle with W at the top, 1/2 of R in one corner & 1/2 of Z in the other corner, or R at the top, 1/2 of W in one corner & 1/2 of T in the other corner.    This isn't a great diagram, but it'll have to do:       W /---------------------/ R     Z  /---------------------/ T    In the first case, the diagonal joins the angles R & Z, making W the big angle at the head of the traingle WRZ.    And in the second case, the diagonal joins the angles W & T, making R the big angle at the head of the Triangle RTZ.    For the first case, let R1 = (1/2)R  & let Z1 = (1/2)Z    W = 45   &     R1 = 100/2 = 50    So, since W + R1 + Z1 = 180,    45 + 50 + Z1 = 180    Z1 + 95 = 180    Z1 = 180 -- 95    Z1 = 85    Thus Z must equal 2 x 85 = 170 degrees.    Since the quadrilateral is composed of 2 triangles, you don't have to repeat this exercise to determine T.  Finding T is now a matter of subtraction!    W + R + T + Z = 360    45 + 100 + T + 170 = 360    T + 315 = 360    T = 45 degrees      I hope this helps and is clear enough. :) Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

The (potential) energy of each electron, in its own separate atomic energy level, is reduced when both electrons enter a molecular energy level which encompasses both nuclei;  in doing so, and forming a localized covalent bond, potential energy is transduced to heat energy. So, bond formation is an exothermic process:            Ha(g) + Hb(g)--->  HH(g)  DH = -432 kJ mol-1

The more resistance your muscles encounter lifting weights the more they will grow to cope with the extra effort. I think the body has a built in survival mechanism which promotes physical adaptation so the greater the effort and physical stress the greater will be the tissue growth.

The small voids are often filled with liquid such as water or oil.    There is no observed effect to the ground (settling, forming large voids) due to the pumping out of oil.  Water replaces the oil in the voids.     Imagine, for example an empty glass with a straw in it.  Now fill the glass with a dry sand.  Even though the glass is full of sand (you can't get any more sand in there) you can add water to it.  So if you fill it up with water so that you can't add any more sand or water, you can use the straw to suck out the water, the sand won't settle or collapse.|`|AA12139405	The empty spaces created by the extraction of oils are filled with forced non contaminated water.

We get:    (3) 6X -- 6Y = 18    Now, we add (1) & (3):       (1) 14X + 6Y = 42  + (3)   6X -- 6Y = 18  ----------------------------  20X = 60    We divide both sides by 20. We get:    X = 3.

What is the h.  A trigonometric function can be a function within a function, etc., but not in that manner.  It may be a typo on your part.  What I mean is: In Calculus, you can have such a thing as Cos(h) & Cos[h(x)], where h itself is a function.  But you can't have Cosh(x).  The h included like that is meaningless and confusing.    In Calculus, there are related formulas for trigonometric functions.  One of the most basic and most used such formula is:    SinA^2 + CosA^2 = 1    Also, there are also double angle formulas.  One of the most frequently used is:    Sin2A = 2SinACosA    So, for your question, assuming the h is a typo, as I can't justify or incorporate its presence in any rational way,    Sin(2X) = 2SinXCosX    Sin(2X)^2 = (2SinXCosX)^2    Sin(2X)^2 = 4(SinX^2)(CosX^2)    Sin(2X)^2 = 4(CosX^2)(1 -- CosX^2)    Square root both sides.  You get:    Sin(2X) = 2CosX(1 -- CosX^2)^(1/2)    Since, 1 -- CosX^2 can't be reduced, such that all terms can be unified, you can't obtain an equation or an expression such that Sin(2X)^2 equals ONE Cos(X)^2, regardless of the coefficient of Cos(X)^2, so you can get Sin(2X) to equal some number times CosX.    I hope that is clear and helpful enough for you. :)  I tried my best just the same. :)  Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)|`|U4HWmqIwaa	First recall the fundamental identity:       cosh^2(t)  sihn^2(t) = 1.

(***)    From the identity you gave solve for cosh(2x), the function appearing in the numerator of the left of the equality sign, to get:         cosh(2x) = 2sinh^2(x) + 1.

To determine Y, we first need to isolate it. Which is just as well as I don't particularly like fractions & working with them. To that end, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by X(X + 1). That yields:    3X(X + 1)/(2X + 1) -- X(X + 1)/(X + 1) = Y*X(X + 1)/X(X + 1)    Simplifying yields:    3X(X + 1)/(2X + 1) -- X = Y    Simplifying further yields:    (3X^2 + 3X)/(2X + 1) -- X = Y    Next, we need to establish a common denominator for the expressions on the left-side of the equation. So we multiply X by (2X + 1)/(2X + 1). That yields:    (3X^2 + 3X)/(2X + 1) -- X(2X + 1)/(2X + 1) = Y    Simplifying yields:    [(3X^2 + 3X) -- 2X^2 -- X]/(2X + 1) = Y    Simplifying further yields:    (X^2 + 2X)/(2X + 1) = Y    Y can also expressed as:    Y = X(X + 2)/(2X + 1)    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

Y = [e^(X -- 3) -- 1]^4    & we seek dY/dx.    Let F(X) = X -- 3    So d/dx F(X) = 1    Let G(X) = e^[F(X)]    So d/dx G(X) = {e^[F(X)]}*[d/dx F(X)]    d/dx G(X) = e^[F(X)]*(1)    d/dx G(X) = e^[F(X)]    d/dx G(X) = e^(X -- 3)    Let H(X) = G(X) -- 1    So d/dx H(X) = d/dx G(X) -- d/dx 1    d/dx H(X) = d/dx G(X)    d/dx H(X) = e^(X -- 3)    Let Q(X) = [H(X)]^4    So d/dx Q(X) = 4{[H(X)]^3}*[d/dx G(X)]*[d/dx F(X)]    d/dx Q(X) = 4{[G(X) -- 1]^3}*[e^(X -- 3)]*(1)    d/dx Q(X) = 4{[e^[F(X)] -- 1]^3}*[e^(X -- 3)]    d/dx Q(X) = 4{[e^(X -- 3) -- 1]^3}*[e^(X -- 3)]    An alternative method is:    dY/dx = d/dx Q(X)    dY/dx = d/dx [H(X)]^4    dY/dx = 4[H(X)^3]*[d/dx G(X)]*[d/dx F(X)]    dY/dx = 4{[G(X) -- 1]^3}*[e^(X -- 3)]*(1)    dY/dx = 4{[e^[F(X)] -- 1]^3}*[e^(X -- 3)]    dY/dx = 4[e^(X -- 3) -- 1]^3[e^(X -- 3)]    Since this is such a complex expression, the key to solving it easily & simply is to use the chain rule. Otherwise, it'll prove to be too cumbersome & you'll have plenty of steps & opportunities to make a mistake somewhere. By using the chain rule, you can differenciate each expression by itself, then combine the results to form the derivative of the whole expression.

To that end, we subtract 16 from both sides of the equation (both sides so as to preserve the equality, of course, as you undoubtedly know. :) ). We get:    X^3 -- 3X -- 2 -- 16 = 16 -- 16    Simplifying yields:    X^3 -- 3X -- 18 = 0    According to the Factor Theorem, for a generic polynomial F(X) = aX^3 + bX^2 + cX + d, if F(e) = 0, then X -- e is a factor.    For our equation, seeing as -- 18 is a multiple of -- 3, we'll try 3. We get:    (3)^3 -- 3*(3) -- 18 = 27 -- 9 -- 18 = 27 -- 27 = 0    Thus, X -- 3 is a factor:    >>>> X^2 + 3X + 6  >>>>|X^3 + 0X^2 -- 3X -- 18  X -- 3|X^3 -- 3X^2  >>>>|(--)_______________  >>>>>>>>> 3X^2 -- 3X  >>>>>>>>> 3X^2 -- 9X  >>>>>>>>(--)____________  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 6X -- 18  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 6X -- 18  >>>>>>>>>>>>>(--)_______  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>0    Thus, X^3 -- 3X -- 18 = 0 factors into:    (X -- 3)(X^2 + 3X + 6) = 0    So either X -- 3 = 0 OR X^2 + 3X + 6 = 0    If X -- 3 = 0,    then we add 3 to both sides of the equation. We get:    X + 3 -- 3 = 0 + 3    Simplifying yields:    X = 3    Whereas, if X^2 + 3X + 6 = 0,    we'll need to factor the quadratic.    A generic quadratic of the form aX^2 + bX + c factors thus:    (dX + e)(fX + g),    wherein: a = d*f, b = d*g + e*f, & c = e*g    In this case, a = 1, b = 3, & c = 6    In the case of a, only 1*1 = 1, so d = f = 1    In the case of c, 1*6 = 6 & 2*3 = 6    We are left with the following possibilities:    (X + 1)(X + 6), but 1*1 + 1*6 = 7    (X + 2)(X + 3), but 1*3 + 1*2 = 5    So we have to sole the equation using the Quadratic formula, which states that, for a generic quadratic aX^2 + bX + c,    X = {-- b +-- [b^2 -- (4*a*c)]^(1/2)}/(2*a)    Note: +-- means + OR --, while ^(1/2) means taking the square root, of course, as you undoubtedly know. :)    In this case,    X = {-- 3 + [3^2 -- (4*1*6)]^(1/2)}/(2*1)    Expanding yields:    X = {-- 3 + [9 -- 24]^(1/2)}/2    Simplifying yields:    X = {-- 3 + (-- 15)^(1/2)}/2    But, it is illegal to take the square root of a negative number.

I'll try to draw you a diagram, but I know the system will just mangle it. In case it works, X is how far West one car got, Y is how far South the other car got & Z is the diagonal between the 2 cars.    >---X---  >\~~~~|  > \~~~ |  >>\~~~|  >> \~~ |  >>>\~~|  >>Z \~ | Y  >>>>\~|  >>>> \ |  >>>>>\|    What you're looking for is dZ/dt. So, according to the Pythagoras theorem we have:    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2    Differentiating with respect to time t we get:    (1) 2X(dX/dt) + 2Y(dY/dt) = 2Z(dZ/dt)    To simplify, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 (both sides, so as to preserve the equality, of course, as I'm sure you already know. :) ). We get:    2X(dX/dt)/2 + 2Y(dY/dt)/2 = 2Z(dZ/dt)/2    Simplifying yields:    (2) X(dX/dt) + Y(dY/dt) = Z(dZ/dt)    We are given in the question that:    dX/dt = 25 mi/h    &    dY/dt = 60 mi/h    Now, for the car going West:    In 1 hour it travels 25 miles  In 2 hours it travels X    That is:    1 hour ---> 25 miles  2 hours ---> X    Cross-multiplying yields:    X*1 hour = 2 hours*25 miles    To Solve for X, we divide both sides of the equation by 1 hour. We get:    X*1 hour/1 hour = 2 hours*25 miles/1 hour    Simplifying yields:    X = 50 miles    Similarly, for the South-moving car, we have:    1 hour ---> 60 miles  2 hours ---> Y    Cross-multiplying yields:    Y*1 hour = 2 hours*60 miles    To Solve for Y, we divide both sides of the equation by 1 hour. We get:    Y*1 hour/1 hour = 2 hours*60 miles/1 hour    Simplifying yields:    Y = 120 miles    Now, after 2 hours, X is 50 miles & Y is 120 miles. So Z is:    X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2    (50 miles)^2 + (120 miles)^2 = Z^2    2500 miles^2 + 14400 miles^2 = Z^2    16900 miles^2 = Z^2    Now, to solve for Z, we take the square root of both sides by raising them both to the power of 1/2. We get:    (16900 miles^2)^(1/2) = (Z^2)^(1/2)    Simplifying yields:    130 miles = Z    Thus, after 2 hours, the diagonal distance between them is 130 miles.    Now, armed with the information we calculated & what's given in the question, we substitute them into (2). We get:    X(dX/dt) + Y(dY/dt) = Z(dZ/dt)    (50 miles)(25 mi/h) + (120 miles)(60 mi/h) = (130 miles)(dZ/dt)    Simplifying yields:    1250 (miles^2)/h + 7200 (miles^2)/h = (130 miles)(dZ/dt)    Simplifying further yields:    8450 (miles^2)/h = (130 miles)(dZ/dt)    Finally, to solve for (dZ/dt), we divide both sides of the equation by 130 miles. We get:    [8450 (miles^2)/h]/(130 miles) = (130 miles)(dZ/dt)/(130 miles)    Simplifying yields:    65 mi/h = (dZ/dt)    Therefore, after 2 hours, the distance between the 2 cars is increasing at the rate of 65 mi/h.    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)
acbqsZZbaa	An example might help:    Suppose you have a bench power supply that can output anything from 0-30V. it has a voltmeter on the front.  Adjustment would be turning the control knob until the meter shows the voltage you want it to output.  Calibration would be adjusting the internal circuitry so that when the meter shows 30V, the power supply is actually outputting 30V    So calibration is a special kind of adjustment that is done to a piece of equipment to ensure that it is accurate.|`|IGyQohy9aa	Calibration is to compare against a standard. e.g. to check that a pressure gauge is reading accurately it would be checked against a standard pressure gauge (often under the control of a national standard laboratory). The calibration certificate will say what the true reading is when a particular reading is taken. There is no adjustment.    Adjustment is when changes are made. e.g. A watch might be adjusted to local time|`|gpMAkzKSaa	adjustment is a change from one set of parameters to another and calibration is a change to a set parameter. you must adjust to calibrate but not the other way around.

You could just force yourself outside though. That would eventually take care of it.|`|D0pQFlMIaa	I'm sorry you had a bad experience and are experiencing this fear as a result. Good for you for looking for some answers.     An irrational fear is one in which the fear outweighs the actual danger. If you live in a really bad neighborhood where there is a good chance that you will get hurt, then it may not be an irrational fear. But if your fear is greater than the actual danger, it could be seen as irrational.     It also depends on how you respond to the fear. Do you go to the store anyway in spite of your fear? Or do you find yourself staying home all the time because you're afraid? If the fear has taken control of your life more than you want it to, then it may be "irrational" and it could be time to get some professional help.     If you think that you are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or another kind of anxiety that is stronger than you want it to be, seeing a counselor or psychologist could be a great help. Some are better than others, so don't get discouraged if you don't like the first one you see. Some of them have sliding fee scales so they can give you a discount if you don't have a lot of money. Or maybe you have a counselor at your school you could talk to for free.     Lots of people experience "irrational fears" and anxiety-related problems- you're not alone. But it can get better if you seek some support.     Good luck!

He paid back $340 instead of $300.  40/300 = 13.33 %  That would be the rate if he paid it all back after one year.    But it was only for 10 months, not 12, and he made payments along the way.    We can make an estimate with a simple multiplication:    6/5 * 13.33 = 16%  That's not one of the choices.    If we multiply by 12/11 instead, we get  14.545 which matches choice a)  but I'm not sure why we would use 12/11.    If we figure compound interest, then it would be along these lines:    Each month he pays 1/12 of the annual interest rate.  So we have:  300 (1 + i/12)^10 = 340  300 * ((1 + (.1455 / 12))^10) = 338.425265

R0Ogy5qlaa	The unit vector along bar AB is icos20 + jsin20.      The unit vector along bar AC is -icos40 + jsin40.    Resolving the force F = -200j into components means finding x and y so that     -200j = x(icos20 + jsin20) + y(-icos40 + jsin40).      That gives us a system of 2 equations.     xcos20 - ycos40 = 0    xsin20 + ysin40 = -200    Eliminating x gives    ysin20cos40 + ycos20sin40 = -200cos20      ysin60 = -200cos20     y = -200cos20 / sin60 = -217.0 lbs.    Plugging this in to the first equation of the system gives     x = -200cos40 / sin60 = -176.9 lbs.    Since we used unit vectors to represent the two bars, then x and y are the actual magnitudes of the resultant forces.      So our answer is 176.9 lbs. in the direction from B to A and 217.0 lbs. in the direction from C to A.

p0sUEI0Raa	Assuming that:  3x + y = 0   is your first equation and  x - y = 4    is your second equation    First you must make either x or y the subject of any one of your equations. I'll do the second equation, because its easier. I will make x the subject of the second equation too, but it's really up to you.    x - y = 4    Move the - y to the other side. The negative becomes a positive, so you get    x = 4 + y    Then, replace all the "x"es in the first equation with your second equation.    3 ( 4 + y) + y = 0     Do the multiplication in the brackets first, and you'll get    12 + 3y + y = 0     Add all the "y"s together.    12 + 4y = 0    Then, bring the 12 over to the other side. The positive becomes negative so you'll get    4y = -12    From there we can see that     y = -3    Then, put y = -3 back into any one of the equations. Again, I'll be plugging it into the equation x - y = 4    So we get    x - (-3) = 4    The two negatives make a positive so we'll get    x + 3 = 4    Then bring all the numbers to one side and the unknowns to another, changing the sign when you bring it past the equals.    x = 4 - 3  x = 1    So your final answer should be x = 1 and y = -3
k75ThD0caa	10 yrs.    the bottom answer could'nt be more wrong, which now is obviously gone for some reason, as at the year designated, Nijah was 3 yrs less than twice Jessie's age. If that's the case then the following equation should work:     y = 2x - 3    y is Nija's age while x is Jessie's    if we plug in what the answerer at the bottom says then:    15 = 2(8) - 3    15 is obviously not equal to 13.       So Jessie could not be 8 at that point in time.    Here's what I did using the same variables:    x + 7 = y    2x - 3 = y    x + 7 = 2x - 3    transitive property    10 = x (Jessie's age)    10 + 7 = 17 (Nijah's age)

For example, if I asked you to tell me the square of 4 (it's written 42), I would be asking you to multiply 4 times itself.  So 42=16 because 4X4=16.    All you need is an algebraic expression, so you have to use a variable when writing an expression for the square of a number divided by 4.  Lets call "the number" N.    ANSWER:    N2  ------  4      By the way, all of the people who wrote N^2/4 or X^2/4 are also correct.  There is no key on the computer to make a little 2 like I did, so a lot of people use '^' to show that the 2 is an exponent (little and typed higher).

AmmobF3haa	1,000,001 and 1,000,003.|`|FD8I4zthaa	1000001    is one.    1000003    Hehe Derk. 1000001/101=9901  Well done|`|lwDz2bE8aa	1,000,001  1,000,003|`|C8Djjxqkaa	1000001 is not prime.  It is divisible by 101.    1000003 is prime!    1000033 is the next.|`|R0Ogy5qlaa	1,000,003 and 1,000,033.    This is not at all an easy thing to do by hand.  (For example, the sieve of Eratosthenes method would require that you test for divisibility by all the primes up to 1000, and that's 168 primes!)  If you are in a computer programming class then maybe it is reasonable.      Otherwise, find one of the prime databases online and get the answer there.  This is probably what your teacher had in mind.
1khVEE6oaa	Okay, write it out as an equation in slope-intercept form: y=mx+b where m=slope and b=y-intercept    So your equation would be:  y=5x+2      To Graph this, you know one point already - the y-intercept.  2 is the point on the y-axis that your line MUST go through.  So, get some graph paper, draw and number your x and y-axes (using a ruler), and put a point on the y-axis (vertical one) at the number 2.    Because your slope is 5/1 (same as 5), that means that for every 1 place you count to the right, you have to count up 5 places.  (The opposite is also true, for every one place you count to the left, you must count down 5 places.)  So you will put another point at (1, 7) where x=1 crosses y=7.  If you do this again, you will have another point at (2,12) and so on.    Then just take your ruler and connect those dots and extend your line to the edge of your graph.  You could also keep counting over 1 place and up 5, but the line you draw (with a ruler) will show you were all of those points go.  You only HAVE to plot two points to draw the line so long as you use a ruler!|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	y-intercept of 2 means the line passes through the point (0,2).    Slope of 5 means that if you move in the positive x direction one unit you will move 5 units in the positive y direction.|`|EyVbtK9Maa	Plot point 2 on the y-axis. Then for evey increase in x, increase y by 5 times that amount:   1,7     2.12,    3,17,, etc.    Draw a st. line thriught all the points.|`|t9iWZmmQaa	One of the forms of the equation of a line is  y = mx + c  where m is the gradient and c is the value of y when it cuts the y= axis.  Your line is  y = 5x + 2  Choose some values for x and use the equation to calculate the corresponding y values and then plot these pairs of points. You only need two points to draw a straight line.|`|gxwF60jMaa	You first plot the point (0, 2) (you know how to plot points?)  Since the lope is 5, you go right 1 unit and go up 5 units. Continue going right, but for each unit you go right, go up 5 units. Connect the points. You will have your line.|`|7d61a38f737366063f8587fd6efb39acaa	What does this question mean: Graph the following: The line with a slope of 5 and a y-intercept of 2.?    plot the point (0,2) which is the y-intercept  slope of 5 means from there you go up 5 and to the right 1 or go down 5 and to the left 1. Plot a few more points this way, and connect them  I don't understand what a slope of 5 is or y-intercept of 2. Can someone please help me? Thanks!

Subtract 3.14 from the area in which the circle is enclosed.  *************************
