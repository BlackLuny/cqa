Two tablespoons of these seeds should be soaked overnight in water and ground into a fine paste in the morning. This paste should be applied all over the scalp and left for half an hour. The hair should then be washed thoroughly with soap-nut (ritha) solution or acacia concinna.<br>  Dandruff treatment using Lime<br>  <br>  The use of a teaspoon of fresh lime juice for the last rinse, while washing the hair, is another useful remedy. This not only leaves the hair glowing but also removes stickiness and prevents dandruff.<br>  Dandruff treatment using Green Gram Powder<br>  <br>  A valuable prescription for removal of dandruff is the use of green gram powder. The hair should be washed twice a week with two tablespoons of this powder mixed with half a cup of curd.<br>  Dandruff treatment using Beet<br>  <br>  Beets have been found useful in dandruff. Both tops and roots should be boiled in water and this water should be massaged into the scalp with the finger tips every night. White beet is better for this purpose.<br>  Dandruff treatment using Snake Gourd<br>  <br>  The juice of snake gourd has been found beneficial in the prevention and treatment of dandruff. The juice should be rubbed over the scalp for this purpose.<br>  Dandruff treatment using Other Remedies<br>  <br>  Dandruff can be removed by massaging the hair for half an hour with curd which has been kept in the open for three days, or with a few drops of lime juice mixed with indian gooseberry juice every night, before going to bed. Another measure which helps to counteract dandruff is to dilute cider vinegar with an equal quantity of water and dab this on to the hair with cotton wool inbetween shampooing. Cider vinegar added to the final rinsing water after shampooing also helps to disperse dandruff.|`|HvbIE03saa	First off, acne can be not only the result of not washing your face properly, but also a result of genetics. <br>  <br>  Sometimes someone, no matter how well they clean, can still be more prone to acne than others simply because of genetics, and that's not exactly something you can cure.<br>  <br>  However, nowadays, there are a lot of options available from Acutane, to Proactive, to regular face washing with whatever you find at the grocery store.|`|UdiJDouhaa	You should try to use some mild daily exfoliants, and a nourishing, soothing masque.<br>  Don’t use any cream/lotion on your face, so your skin pores are not blocked. <br>  I use Neutroslim Daily Exfoliants.

6aEhPcDAaa	I'm pretty sure Cover Girl has one, and maybe L'Oreal and Revlon, but I'm not positive.  The reason why a lot of people don't know about these brands, if they do have primers or not, is because they aren't any good.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to pay $16-17 on a eye primer that is EXELLENT, then go to Sephora or Ulta, and pick up either the Urban Decay Primer Potion, or the Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  I have both, and I honestly prefer the Shadow Insurance, because it has a better tube, do you get as much product as you paid for, and its more lightweight on your eyes than the primer potion, and it seems to work better.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Just about every cosmetic company has come out with primers but if you're looking to find one on the less expensive side, I do know that Sally Hanson has an eye primer for about $7.|`|oPi9GQk9aa	revlon and cover girl|`|JhJXKRkOaa	the only brand of eye primer I know and have is Urban Decay Primer Potion.

YFXmO2Xqaa	heels were (i think)made so women could compensate being shorter than men.as years went on the high heel became a sexy attribute to womens fashion.i can run in heels.not as fast but they dont stop me.do you see alot of  taller women in heels?|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Actually, heels were invented in China as a way for males royalty to appear taller than the commoners.  The practice was brought to the west and made popular by the French nobility.  In both countries, the taller the shoe, the more important the person.<br>  Also, the French, who invented ballet, realized that heels make your legs appear longer and leaner and so they used heels in their dancing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~classics/slides/a29.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~classics/slides/a29....</a>|`|OlIGqmMNaa	I think I know what movie you are talking about. Is is "She's the Man" ? I guess if the girl is unable to run, then the guy can catch her easily. It is just to make men more powerful I guess. But then again, the girl can step on his neck with the heel too.|`|3gDRrscTaa	So for example,if they were set up on a blind date, and once they see the guy.. they are unable to run away.|`|b7raN3sbaa	If they can't run, then it's going to be harder for them to get away when it's raep time.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	No.  Back in the 1700s, 1600s and before, men wore pumps, too.  In fact, I think there was a period of time when men wore them and women didn't.  Men wore tight pants along with heeled shoes in order to accentuate their butts and legs.  Women wore skirts, so you couldn't see such assets.  However, a dainty foot in a heeled shoe is appealing, and heels DO help to keep your feet out of the mud, so women wore them, too.   Besides, fashion doesn't have to make sense.<br>  <br>  It stuck to being only women who wore heeled shoes, however.  That may have been sexist, but not intentionally so.  Look at it this way-- it is hard to do work in a field or a factory in heels.  Since those are traditionally men's jobs, lower class men didn't wear heels, though lower class women may have.  That carried over to all aspects of society and stuck with us.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Men didn't invent heels so that we couldn't run.|`|bg86ji6naa	It makes legs look tighter and butt too.
VLCUDZlcaa	For the same reasons that I used to get teased for..being different and standing out.

Most redheads eventually learn to take the teasing and use it to their advantage, but it's still not nice to tease someone about their hair (especially a female!).........|`|3Y6oROG4aa	Um duh because red heads=uglyness lol jk i dont know but i dont make fun of anyone unless they start! stupid sluty blond bitches.........well i can't talk im a blond :) lol|`|W4IOLSzbaa	Why does anyone get teased? I love redheads and want redheaded kids to each their own you know|`|ivH8tRtsaa	It is because they stand out. Most people, especially children, feel the need to tease in order to feel better about themselves. They are just looking for a target and what better target than someone with a bulls-eye on their head. Personally, I love red heads. If there are any red heads out there that are getting teased, just remember that the guilty parties are just trying to deal with their own feelings of inadequacy by putting the spotlight on you. I love the spotlight. It means people are paying attention to you.|`|FUZzB1JWaa	The answer is they don't, If somebody doesn't like someone they will always find something to bully them about, If its not there hair colour it will be because they wear glasses or because there mum drives a old car, They don't have the latest shoes,They are bad at maths see what i am saying bullies clutch at straws no one is perfect!<br>  <br>  And i think there is nothing wrong with ginger hair..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://yousonice.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/redhair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://yousonice.files.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>  <br>  You just have to be really strong and dont let it get to you!!|`|wehHMNihaa	that hair colour is usually accompanied by freckles<br>  <br>  which is more suited to the bottom rather than the face|`|adyNCp6eaa	It is usually because of one of these reasons:<br>  1.

bHAQH6z2aa	it sort of depends on your skin colour. if you're too pale you might look washed out with black hair, but if your skin colour is right, it might really suit you...<br>  <br>  Ask the advice of a hairdresser... Also, you can try a semi perminent, i.e. that washes out after 5-10 washses depending on which brand...<br>  <br>  then, after all that you could just go for it and if you don't like it, it will always just grow out!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|jLrG2N9eaa	Dark brown hair would match almost any colour...<br>  for me i think black would bring out the brown colour in your hair...<br>  i think i would suit it with pink-ish red or baby blue!<br>  i hoped i helped!

Obviously heels make your legs look longer and your body taller, but if you can't do that find flats that have a pointy tow as this is another visual trick to make your legs look longer (and your body skinnier) than they really are.<br>  If you've got a dark complexion you want to be wearing saturated colors like emerald green, royal/navy blue, and berry reds.  Try to stay away from the pastels as they look to babyish.|`|M9RJLpqEaa	pics will help alot|`|ZkL1CcGoaa	look for something that is form fitting around the bust and blooms out below your bra line. Stay away from most stretchy cotton blend tees that tend to cling to what you dont want seen and shrink easily. For pants if your backside is a bit more round than most always look for pants that have lycra or stretch in them do not get 100 percent cotton, stick to low rise jeans so that you avoid the back pucker from your tush, choose bootcut or straight leg pants try to stay away from flare because it draws more attention to large thighs. Colors wise you can mostly wear anything that you want but be careful with bright colors, pastels are much more softer. <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=331763&CategoryID=40138" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=356402&CategoryID=37783" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357808&CategoryID=37783" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  .....try torrid.com as well they have really cute stuff|`|TIIbKxWaaa	pics please:D

dxBHBPyKaa	For a black tie affair is always better to stick with traditional - rent or buy a tuxedo with traditional styling and  go with a bow tie - self tying of course - practice for a week or two before the ball to make sure you have it right. Ask the tux store to show you how to tie it first. Also add studs and cuff links for that added traditional look. You could use a vest (waistcoat) or cummerbund. Good luck - enjoy the evening|`|PS83gPGoaa	well bow ties look smarter and if its to do with your job you want to make a good impression so definitely go with the smarter option.|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Well, for a ball you'll probably be wearing a tuxedo in which case a bow tie will look better.

6Tx8Opmraa	You can Bleach your hair three times, and it will be overprocessed. Not dead. overprocessed. I lifted my hair from black, and it only went to a Golden blonde(With the roots, very white.), and it went overprocessed. I don't know what your doing to your hair, But If you've been bleaching the same hair for 2 years...That person would probley have no hair, as when you overprocess, It breaks off(Falls out.), turns mushy and slimey. I have never seen a person's bleached hair, look healthy.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	you just have to get about an inch trimmed everytime you bleach, otherwise then it will be like straw. as long as your hair stylist is not bleaching over the same bleached hair over again you'll be okay. you should just get touch ups on the roots. <br>  i refused to have my hair cut when i was getting the platinum blonde and after a while it looked bad! i had to cut 6 inches off then!
jr5Z03qaaa	the cut your sister has, fits her features.  you could probably pull it off if it were a few inches longer.  your face shapes are a lot different.  so if you were to get that exact hair cut, it'll make your face look a lot longer than it already is.<br>  <br>  if asymmetrical is your thing, think of doing it an asymmetrical a-line bob.  maybe having the shorter side fall right below your chin, that way your face doesn't look too long, and your cheeks will stand out better.<br>  <br>  here's a picture of a haircut that i've done on my sister. it's an asymmetrical a-line bob.<br>  <a href="http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/60/l_b204529a59a94e47825bd4a5599bf937.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a>|`|d2vENVGlaa	you look nothing like your avatar. sigh, i guess it's commonplace now. and what does piercing your lip have to do with cutting your hair?  <br>  <br>  anyway i like your hair the way it is.  by looking at it, i think you'll regret doing that to your hair, coz you'll have to do more styling to make it sit like that.  no offence, but i don't think it will suit you much anyways.  maybe something a bit longer than what your sister has, and have it layered or thinned out a bit to make it look kinda messy but cute.  it's more low maintenance too.  that's what i want to do, but i'm too scared of chopping off all my hair.  <br>  <br>  remember it's the actual person, not the hair or a pierced lip, that makes someone unique (sorry to get all soft on ya, but it's true)|`|m532H7Axaa	Your sisters hair is lovely but would you want to look the same? if so i think it would look nice however going in to a salon and asking for a total new look could help as they are qualified to show you what suites your face and how to cope with your hair :) <br>  i hope this helps <br>  good luck :)|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	No I really wouldn't......I don't think that you would like it after having such long hair, for a while.<br>  Try this if your into the whole punkish deal.<br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sXI8Dr0DFV0/Ro8tWhK5AjI/AAAAAAAABPI/RdsJua3-r_w/s1600/emo%2Bscene%2Bhair99.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sXI8Dr0DFV0/Ro...</a><br>  Hope I could help<br>  PEACE|`|DEGClROKaa	Wow that is a cool hair cut!

LdlNMvsbaa	Sure! Here is my  daily skin care routine. You see, I used to have HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE acne until I started this routine. These products/techniques worked amazing.<br>  <br>  Step 1-<br>  Remove all of your make-up, dirt, and oil from your face with Olay Daily Facials Express Wet Cloths. Just wipe down your face throughly with one to get everything off your face. Try using circular motions.<br>  <a href="http://www.olay.com/boutique/dailyfacial..." rel="nofollow">http://www.olay.com/boutique/dailyfacial...</a><br>  <br>  Step 2-<br>  Wash your face with a clenser. I use Olay Warming Deep Purifying Cleanser. Splash your face with water to moisten it, Squeeze a little of the cleaner onto your wet finger tips, rub them together, (this will activate the heat), and rub it onto your face. Leave on for 1 minute- rinse off with warm water. It makes your face feel sooooo good!!! I'm loving this product!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.olay.com/boutique/clarifyandc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.olay.com/boutique/clarifyandc...</a><br>  <br>  Step 3-<br>  PAT (don't rub) your face dry with a towel.<br>  <br>  Step 4- <br>  Apply an alcohol free toner. (MAKE SURE IT'S ALCOHOL FREE!) I use Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner. It's so great! Put it on a cotton ball and apply it to your face in upward strokes. I really like the clean smell too :)<br>  <a href="http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/16995/..." rel="nofollow">http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/16995/...</a><br>  <br>  Step 5-<br>  Go to bed.<br>  <br>  *** As you can see from step 5, this routine is for night time. If you are going to shower in the morning/ wash your face, skip steps 1 and 5.Just use the cleanser, dry your face, and tone your skin. I got all these products at target for a low price- nothing over $10 <3<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FDIEb624aa	I have the same thing i play volleyball and softball, wear makeup and have acne. What i do is i take a shower when i get home and use antibacterial soap. I found this new makeup found at your local walmart called physicans Formula and it works great, and helps not plog my pores. Then every night i wash my face with proactive. I know everyone says that it doesn't work and i thought the same thing with the first month or two but now i'm going on month four and my skin has changed dramatically. Hope i helped (:|`|HqEdWTfIaa	get dove face wipes they are amazing. all you have to do is put some water on them wash your face with the rinse off your face and your done. you face feels soft instantly and pimples go away QUICK|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	You can overdry your face and it'll create more oil and break you out more...so if your face feels dry in places get an oil free moisturizer and put it only on the dry parts.<br>  <br>  If you break out using all that stuff can just make things worse.<br>  <br>  I'd go for an anti bacterical soap and wash it for sure at night, but in the morning you could just splash cold water on your face.  <br>  <br>  When trying anything new with your face give it a few weeks to work or not work. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	It so happens that younger people, (going through the puberty stage, especially) get acne. Everyone gets it in different extremes. It's especially prominent in anyone who deals with more stress. Overwashing can also bring on the acne. Once a day is more than enough. Don't use anything special and fancy to wash with. Just use good ol', plain ol' soap. I, personally don't actually wash my face so often, and my complexion has always been excellent. But everyone's different. <br>  <br>  Acne is gonna happen. But, try and be confident and relax through it. And absolutely most importantly, DO NOT TOUCH IT. It's hard, I know, to avoid, but if you resist the temptation, you'll have much better results. <br>  <br>  I find, that using "Nutrigena" cleansing pads once a day, brings great results in general. Don't touch or let other people touch your face. That's gross and invites general oil and filth to get in there. In general, take good care of your skin, and try your best to resist oily, sweaty, dirty situations, and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you're a girl, i think mineral foundation is the most incredible thing EVER to avoid the likeliness of clogged pores, ect. I use L'OREAL, and it works even more wonders for my complexion.|`|GovsrmWxaa	Drink lots of water. <br>  <br>  I am using clinique, go to the counter, they will look at your skin, and then ask few questions, they will tell you which skin type you are, and will recommend which type of good set for you.<br>  <br>  I switch from shiseido to clinique, I got 1 set(cleanser, blablabla, etc) of skin care, it works well, I have lots of pimples, after using clinique for a week or so, my face barely has pimples..|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i would try the clinique line. i had a lot of luck with that. 1st cleanse, then tone, then moisturize--yes, even if you break out. clinique customizes to you skin type. you can buy a smaller kit for not too much. lasts a while too. i would try this before going to proactiv or other acne products. good luck!|`|jyoph3WQaa	Check out some of these products and the descriptions they have ... they have some stellar products: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/SkinBotanica" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/SkinBotanica</a><br>  <br>  Plus Free shipping on orders over $49|`|9jNsEAFGaa	keep doing what your doing. oil gets trapped in your pores and causes pimple and white heads ect. if thats really not working. then try proactive it does actually work.

tVJdClgBaa	well, for one, scene kids where brighter colors. they have more of a taste for wild things. and you'll be able to tell the difference between scene and emo girls because scene girls have bigger hair and where crazy things like tutus. scene kids like to where a lot of cartoon characters, like hello kitty and other things. also, you might see scene girls with fake eyelashes. scene kids have a kinda retro- 80s pop look, mostly because some tend to listen to that music.|`|MFlzqiU5aa	i consider emo being dark colors. and scene being bright and original stuff.|`|TprIqGhCaa	My opinion is the same as yours.

I've kind of been obsessed with red hair these last two years. This happened after having seen an Italian movie with a couple of redheads in the leading roles. lol My favourite actress in this world is an Italian redhead. <br>  <br>  Red hair can be amazing - especially with green or blue eyes. I think ALL red shades are great, everything from strawberry blond to dark auburn. The pale skin is also very beautiful. Why are people so obsessed with tanning? Soft, beautiful pale skin is SO much more attractive.|`|3Y6oROG4aa	red heads are ok....u shud ask me out :) id make you feel good every night lol|`|kXTYqfXcaa	If you have blue or green/turquoise eyes, pale skin and red hair, I'm utterly and completely in love. :)<br>  There's a difference between pasty and pale, and pale can be attractive while pasty can't.

And screw the people at your school, who gives a **** if they like red heads or not. In the real world, red heads are considered sexy and attractive.<br>  So......the kids at your school can get stuffed.

kCdISEGqaa	Are you keeping it moist?  I wonder, it's not completely uncommon, but when a tattoo starts to scab up, usually not after the first day though, the lines can look crooked and bent because of the scabs.  When the tattoo heals, it's usually (in my experience) the outlines that start to scab first.  I would wait until the tattoo is completely healed, typically 4-6 weeks, and see how it looks then.  If you are still concerned, I would go back to the artist that did it.  Are you able to post a picture of the tattoo for us to look at?  I hate to sound negative, but, even with stencils, some artists, especially those with little experience, don't have a very steady hand.  Best wishes!!!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Well firstly, give it a chance. Healing tattoos alway look messy and the lines can look weird. The healed result may be better than you think. If not, then you have two options. Return to the shop you had it done and you should receive a free touch up for something like this. However if you don't trust that the artist can do a very good job, then you can visit a different shop and you'll no doubt have to pay the shop minimum, which can totally vary. I've known shop minimums (in England) to range from ￡10 to ￡40. You will have to wait at least 2 weeks before getting it touched up, but it's best to leave it around a month just so you can be sure it's completely healed.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Im sure you would know if they used a stencil or not.Did you not notice ?And the lines follow the grain of the skin prob why it doesnt look perfect straight.|`|qNdsNhgOaa	Well you could go back to where you had it done and tell the artist that you're not pleased, and they should touch it up for you free of charge.  If you're uncomfortable going back to them try a different shop.  The bad thing about going elsewhere is most shops have a bare minimum that they charge regardless of what you want done.  Basically what that means is you may have to pay $50 dollars or so just to have a few lines touched up.  You probably will have to wait it out for about a week or two so it can heal up.  Best wishes on having it fixed up!  It's gonna be there forever so make sure you're happy with the result!|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	you can get it touched up after it scabs over and peels. so  1-2 wks depending on how fast your body heals.|`|AA12279950	That sounds rubbish.

Maybe consider getting some streaky platinum highlights and dirty blonde lowlights too. :]<br>  <br>  Also, use just a tad of Aussie Mousse Leave In Conditioner Duo and spray some Garnier Surf Spray over that.|`|M7YtqUVnaa	<a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/4448277/kate-hudson-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a>    Beachy waves, longer hair, but the look you want.<br>  <br>  Buy a product that will make your hair wavy, like Sunsilk Waves of Envy Spray. My hair is straight and it works really well with it. <br>  <br>  If you want scene, I would buy some clip in extentions in turquoise or pink, and curl them to blend in with your hair. If your daring enough, get a few (like 3 on each side of your head) strands about half an inch thick dyed a different color.|`|DRtSiZ7Paa	Some ideas include:<br>  *<a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/2174_2057_Moore-Mandy-03-121503-lo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a><br>  *<a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/d/G/jesssimp.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/d/G/jess...</a><br>  *<a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/3311_3965_Simpson-Ashlee-13-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a><br>  *<a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/3001_3679_Richie-Nicole-05-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a><br>  *<a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/2906_3488_Simpson-Ashlee-07-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a><br>  *<a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/images/celebrities/christina-medium-blonde.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/images/...</a>|`|GPhEKrs0aa	<a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/4448277/kate-hudson-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.short-hair-styles-magazine.com/images/female-short-hairstyles-12.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.short-hair-styles-magazine.co...</a><br>  <br>  try some choppy layers or something<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hair-styles-secrets-revealed.com/images/blonde-layered-hairstyle-picture.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hair-styles-secrets-revealed....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/4198_5751_Caldwell-Kimberly-01-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a>|`|UbZ6KQFCaa	get long layers, and make hair wavy. how to make hair get the perfect wave is shower @ night then french braid. you will have adorable waves! but don't brush hair when you wake up. it makes it less wavy and more poufy. just make your hair kind of messy and put some lemon juice in to lighten it. for extra fast highlights, blow dry then sun.|`|8Y8gub7iaa	Well you wont really get it if you dont have blue eyes but if you do try having only one strand of hair down the front of your face and cover your ears with your hair it is hard to explain but I did the best i could.|`|6ypx3xSfaa	Kaley's cool<br>  <br>  <a href="http://celebrity-pics.movieeye.com/celebrity_pictures/Kaley_Cuoco_124569.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://celebrity-pics.movieeye.com/celeb...</a><br>  <br>  :S <br>  <br>  <a href="http://imstars.aufeminin.com/stars/fan/kaley-cuoco/kaley-cuoco-20060128-104971.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://imstars.aufeminin.com/stars/fan/k...</a>|`|5aae8c2940f75959f35e7d6ddbda1d7daa	This site has some cute hairstyles if you want some ideas: <a href="http://www.perfectkarmabeauty.com/hairstyles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfectkarmabeauty.com/hairst...</a>|`|bZxKn3ZUaa	choppy layers and side bangs if they would look good<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs760/hji/medium/2006-layers-blonde.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs...</a><br>  <br>  but with not as much makeup.... lol<br>  <br>  i know it looks weird, but it would be cute.  here is another option<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hairstylesx.blogspot.com/2009/02/nicole-richie-hair-celebrity-haircuts.html" rel="nofollow">http://hairstylesx.blogspot.com/2009/02/...</a><br>  <br>  or this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thejoywriter.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c549653ef00e5532d770b8833-320pi" rel="nofollow">http://thejoywriter.typepad.com/.a/6a00d...</a><br>  <br>  i like the last one the best, but whatever you like. i know you said your hair was straight, but you can use shampoos that take your natural curl and enhance it

XLJHECEeaa	She goes for the rocker punk style with a soft blend of the R&B style. It's hard to explain, but that's what it is. She kind of go for the natural color make-up (gold, brown, soft colors----although sometimes she goes w/ bright color, but it looks good), but goes all out with her hair (mohawk with one huge curl poppin out in front of her forehead) and outfit. It's like if you take an R&B singer and try to convert them over to punk, but their not quite ready, well thats her kind of look...

QwRaFHZdaa	Omg. I really wanted that hairstyle and I even asked the same question on her before but everyone kept on saying no:( So I decided to get a second opionion other then Yahoo so I actually went to a hair saloon and asked her and she also said no. My advice is go to your hair salon and ask. And see what she says.|`|daBtvDv7aa	no its an awful hair cut. leave your hair the way it is|`|NfwJPdLjaa	I'm not sure if it will fit you, Probably not.<br>  Maybe layers, like Brookelle Bones.|`|5RhDnLHLaa	it will fit you, but i think there's more hair style that will fit you better<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.beautytwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/black-hairstyles.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.beautytwist.com/&usg=__fw--UdJTRyvC7KOWvRYjPji1s-U=&h=490&w=376&sz=49&hl=en&start=13&um=1&tbnid=WlwgIiTAzluR5M:&tbnh=130&tbnw=100&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dhairstyles%2Bback%2Bhair%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  try this hairstyle|`|q4ujyRiMaa	OMG.<br>  I actually think it would suit you.<br>  Yeahhhh i say go for it!<br>  (:<br>  If it doesnt suit you<br>  its a pretty longish style anywayy<br>  so just get it recut.<br>  Straighten it out or w/e<br>  Yeah i say go for it!<br>  Its a pretty safe cut tbf.|`|mY19PPlIaa	That hairstyle will just ruin your looks.

How many kids have that style? I guess that's what scene is. Following the scene style so you can be in the "cool scene." If you really want to pull it off, you'll need to fry your hair with straighteners and wear a lot of makeup.|`|ibOsXpkraa	umm hey...im emo/goth and i have a girlfriend that has that hair,....its not gonna fit you,its not gonna look good at you trust me...you dont have the look|`|Lrrwu7yzaa	IDK?!?!?!!!!|`|3pQFUhbiaa	Stop the scene.. seriously it's dead.|`|19pRLtvDaa	i think it will look great on you. :)|`|HApdbf6Faa	Honestly, I don't think that would be the right cut for you. Maybe try something more subtle.|`|tbuNZqJsaa	ummmmm..<br>  <br>  U can try?<br>  But i need to say one thing, <br>  teasing wrecks your hair like no other, dying and straightening it is just as bad too..<br>  <br>  Thats why i dont get scene hair these days.. are people actually trying to make their hair snapped and then they will have to shave it off to start all over?|`|AA10196282	yes|`|wlATm2aPaa	maybe something with a few layers and a side fringe but defo not that style|`|VpBWFCTWaa	well sure u can<br>  u just need to let ur hair grow [don't cut it >.<]<br>  <br>  and after its long enough and u can get that hairstyle<br>  ='3|`|zDPGjyRDaa	try it? it only hair it will grow backk
A5ZQmmW1aa	Find out if he has a problem.  I went out with a guy recently who is exactly the same height as me and we were talking about clothes or something and he was saying he liked high heels on women.  I didn't want to tell him that I had deliberately worn flats in case he was sensitive about his height (we are both 5' 7"), so I said that I only wear heels sometimes.  And then he said that he thought I'd look great in heels because I have nice legs (!), so I just asked him if it would bother him if I wore heels out with him and he said no.  Try a similar approach if you don't want to ask your boyfriend directly.|`|H0aIuM5Xaa	NO.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	wear heels|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	my best friend is taller just about same height as her boyfriend and she wears heels all the time. And he does not mind at all.<br>  <br>  It really depends from person-to-person. First check whether you would be comfortable wearing heels and looking taller than your boyfriend. If the answer is yes, then I would suggest you ask him directly before wearing. Else he may feel awkward and may cause problem.<br>  <br>  Best would be asking him, and wearing somewhere when only two of you are going together, no other acquaintances, so you can best judge his reaction.<br>  <br>  Check this link on High Heels Trend: <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02/fierce-shoes.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a><br>  <br>  Christian Louboutin, Versace high heels and some of the A-list celebrities wearing them.

UYnZtJ2daa	The best advice I can tell you about getting a surface piercing is to find a great piercer who knows what he/she is doing. Look at their portfolio, ask for pictures of surface piercings they have done that have healed. Don't just settle on any piercer because many will do surface piercings but don't know the proper way to do them. I've had my nape pierced December 2007...so quite awhile compared to how long people say they will last. I went to a piercer I had known for 5+ years and knew he would do the piercing as perfect as he could. He had me moving my neck around for like 5 minutes to find the best spot for it to go. <br>  <br>  I didn't really experience any pain. I thought it was going to hurt but I didn't feel anything except the jewelry going in. I was extremely surprised. But everyone has a different pain tolerance, it might hurt you even though it didn't hurt me.<br>  <br>  The process took about 15 minutes but my piercer is a freak about perfection so he doesn't just take you back there, pierce you, and shove you out the door. Like I said, I moved my neck around to find the best length and spot and then he marked it, pierced it, and got the jewelry settled in....add in a lot of glove changes and there ya go. But the actual needle going through process? It was as fast as any other piercing I've had. <br>  <br>  Remember, they can take a long time to heal. How well surface piercings heal or how long they heal also depends on the person. Mine still isn't healed. Most days it will feel fine but usually about a week out of every other month (like this week...) it will get crusty again and will hurt...to the point where I don't wear t-shirts that have a high collar because it will rub against it and hurt too bad. To me, it's just worth it.|`|rQmBuXnaaa	im not gonna lie it didnt hurt as much as you think it will .<br>  <br>  mine rejected after six months so i got it dermal anchored to make it look like a surface piercing.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I have mine done twice with surface bars, my piercer used the punch and taper method. The punch was very very painful since it's actually taking a chunk of your skin out (a very small piece but still) as for the taper, that wasn't anything. He kept asking if I was ok because he was afraid he was hurting me, my arm hurt because it was falling asleep because it took forever since my tissues didn't want to separate, he ended up needing to use a needle to get through, that wasn't fun. I got the second one a month later and for some reason it was 3 times as bad even though it was a shorter bar and he had less trouble. I am seriously considering microdermals when I go in for the third. Obviously it hurt but not enough to deter me from getting it done again and again. The first one took 15 or 20 minutes the second one took about 10. Healing time is usually 8-12 months, pure laziness has me adhering to the LITHA aftercare process but it's working great for me, no infections, no problems, no rejection. I just iced it for a week or so and since it's been a little dry a small amount of vitamin E oil, and it's healing beautifully.
PMK9JBn1aa	I think a really nice deep green would really make you look pale and elegant.<br>  I have extremely pale skin, almost porcelain coloured, so i've had experience.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I'd do the bleach it usually looks amazing and you have had it before :D|`|9Ni21lHpaa	If ure natural hair is white then the color that will make you stand out would be a bright cobalt blue shade or a shade of cerulean blue....that would make you look pale....:) goodluck|`|H6AThdgWaa	Hello, your problem is very simple.

You have to also stop with the high skirt lines, as they make you look like your were poured into them  . . . at age 15yrs old!  Go with some slacks and a fully covered top.

If you're going for one of those options I say something like option 5 is best, or like the second picture in option 1.<br>  If you look back at the first picture of you then that looks kind of side swept and keeps your face clear. Maybe something more like that?<br>  If you want advice or information on anything else to do with height you are always welcome to contact me through my profile. For example I have loads of advice on how to make yourself look taller than you really are.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)

18Weffunaa	Victoria's Secret has two semi annual sales a year... one in January and one is July (or August, can't remember for sure) You will see a lot of ads on TV before these sales though.<br>  <br>  In addition to these sales, they will sometimes have a small sale section within the store, but it is mostly stuff left over from the semi annual sales. <br>  <br>  Pink merchandise (and bras) do go on sale greatly during the semi annual sales.. usually those bras are the cheapest in price..usually around $12 or so.. <br>  <br>  When they have their semi annuals bras will usually range between $12-$28... and panties between $3.99-12.99. However, if you wait until the very last couple days of the sale they will have all their panties $2.99 and their bras $14.99 ( I don't know if they have always done this, but they have recently -the past year at least).<br>  <br>  They also have clothes (Pink Clothes,and lingerie and sleepwear greatly reduced anywhere from $5.99-$30ish)<br>  <br>  ALSO- if you get a victoria's secret credit card they mail you a packet of coupons to help you save on bras and panties.. and when you are a cardholder they send you lots of coupons for free panties, and money off bras!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|GhtqGf6jaa	i actually just got a bra online from there, and i got this catalog where they had loads of sales on all sorts of stuff.  check online|`|NwGDlZl1aa	yes to all|`|9DtJeAUKaa	1) They have sales often.

Dgcy9Y94aa	I used to have the same issues lol. I've cut my routine down to 20 min. & I dorm, which means sharing a bathroom with the rest of the girls in my wing gets really hectic when there's only 2 toilets, 2 showers, & 3 sinks that don't work half of the time lol.<br>  <br>  Pick out your clothing the night before & set them aside for the next morning. That way, you'll have plenty of time to put your outfits together without rushing. <br>  <br>  Straighten your hair the night before too. My hair's really thick & wavy in a choppy, layered cut. In the morning, it only takes about 2 min. to touch up, & I usually let my straightener heat up while I brush my teeth. <br>  <br>  Keep your make-up minimal. Just do the basics in the morning....a little foundation, mascara, & eyeliner. That should only take you 5 min. You can put your lipgloss on while you're walking out the door or on the way to class or work. & if you have extra time at the end, you can always add more if you want, like eye shadow or blush. My professors are late a lot, so while I wait in between classes I apply most of mine or touch up what I have already. <br>  <br>  That should help you a lot. =]|`|M9tH99gfaa	pick out a outfit to wear at night, straighten your hair at night and touch it up in morning if u need to...should save u some time...eat a quicker breakfast maybe if u arent|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	ok<br>  straighten ur hair the night before and spend literally one minute retouching it in the morning<br>  pick out ur outfit the night before<br>  you'll have just enough time to sit down and enjoy your breakfast <br>  put ur makeup on in the car|`|N48qV69daa	What I did in school was chose my out fit the night before.

pjcjWBGpaa	I'm glad that you acknowledged that you can't have 'perfect' skin - not even celebrities do! Anyway, here's a few tips to make your skin glow: <br>  <br>  - Try not to use standard soap on your face, it's a bit too harsh. Try using something like cream soap or emollient face wash (E45 is really good). From the sound of your skin type, you need a combination face wash (oily/dry complexions). <br>  -Work out what works for your skin and what doesn't. If you use a certain product that gives you breakouts even if it claims to be the best in the world, don't use it! <br>  - Make sure you dry your face properly by PATTING it - never rub! Your skin is very delicate so make sure you treat it gently. Make sure it's dried thoroughly - damp areas, such as around the nose, lead to spots. <br>  -Moisturise after you've washed religiously. This should be light in summer and more heavy in winter due to the weather change. <br>  -You may be right in that the products you're using are making your skin worse. Remember, though, that your friends have an entirely different type of skin to you - don't model your own skin on what theirs is like. Have an experiment and find out what works, then stick to it. Your skin should adjust and a set routine will help it cope. <br>  -And finally, make sure that if you wear makeup, put on thin layers to help your skin breathe, and make sure you wash it off thoroughly before bed. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|RFGGBtp5aa	it is in your genetics to be like that. what helps skin is loads of water and vitamin d. This is why people from warm countries have better skin (not always but usually) because the sun naturally produces more vitamin d in your skin. <br>  <br>  unless you move to a warm country and start drinking tank loads of water your skin is never going to be 'perfect'.<br>  <br>  there are probably loads of products that reduce spots and the condition of your skin but they can't change your genetics so in theory they are just damage limitation.|`|RCJqaWQYaa	Hey, <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water (8 glasses a day) to help your skin to be healthy, and try to eat healthy too. <br>  Make sure your hair is always clean because grease from your finger or the front of your hair could be making your skin oily. <br>  <br>  If you have spots, don't pick them or squeeze them. Leave them alone. However, some zits need to have the cover or "top" to it taken off. But please, don't overdo it. <br>  Don't tear up your skin trying to get the top off a zit! If you gently squeeze after doing so, the pus will come out of the zit, unclogging the pore. After you do this, put the cream or gel with the benzoyl peroxide in it on top of where the zit used to be. This can possibly clear a zit right up! <br>  <br>  Try this quick fix for your blemishes! Obtain equal parts water and baking soda, and mix it together! Apply with a regular-size Q-Tip directly on the pimple. Do not rub in. Will dry zit and decrease redness. After mixture is dry, apply a toner/cleanser/moisturizer. This is optional, but can help your skin feel smoother. <br>  <br>  Make a routine. Exfoliate once a week with normal skin, and twice a week for oily. This keeps the skin fresh and helps to reduce black heads. Also try using a facemask once a month. <br>  If you have oily skin use a bit of vinegar mixed with water, seeing as the vinegar can be too strong. Rinse your face with this mixture 2-3 times a day. May burn around infected areas and zits and/or pimples. <br>  <br>  More, on the website. Hope this helps! :)|`|XmdUYCDoaa	i have the same problem as you, how old are you? im in my adolescents and i will tell you this now, it will be the best thing you have ever done GO AND SEE A DERMATOLOGIST!! they will prescribe you to creams that are effective and that work! not the stupid ones on the market..they will also describe and tell you scientifically whats wrong with your skin! so yeah go and see one ..|`|EwY7dIViaa	Drink lots of water, but don't worry about chocolate and stuff...it's a myth.<br>  <br>  Here's a website and it has amazing face masks you just have to look a little bit through her videos.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bubzbeauty?blend=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/bubzbeauty?b...</a>|`|uUvV7eadaa	drink TONS of water. drink 8 glasses a day for a week, use a gentle exfoliator and a good face wash. you should see a difference in a week.|`|0fygxRHLaa	wat is tzone?|`|PF6YZSqnaa	drink lots of water<br>  always take any make up off before you go to sleep<br>  stay away from chocolate (?)<br>  <br>  xxx

Does he like floral, sweet, or spicy? Clean scents (like Tommy Girl), or rich (like The Body Shop's Ananya)? Also you have to make sure that you try it out first because perfumes react differently on different people and do not always smell the same on you as they do when they are in their bottle. Many department stores have very good quality perfumes that you can try out first, just make sure you snuggle up to your honey afterwards and whichever one he notices go back and buy then! : ) Good luck!|`|pvbzVlNNaa	Sun Moon Stars by Karl Lagerfeld<br>  <br>  TIP<br>  <br>  For long-lasting effects fragrance should be applied to the bodys pulse points. These include the wrist, behind the ear, crease of your arm and knee, and the base of your throat. Pulse points give off more body heat as this is where blood vessels are closest to the skin, therefore continually warming and releasing your fragrance. Also, for a lasting effect spraying fragrance lower on the body allows it to rise throughout the day. Layering with the corresponding bath or shower gel and lotion|`|Rd4kxxAcaa	I vary with the perfumes I use...here are some of my favorites:<br>  <br>  Narciso Rodriguez for her (classic, feminine, timeless)<br>  Daisy by Marc Jacobs (flirty, girly)<br>  Vera Wang by Vera Wang (romantic, elegant)<br>  Maybe Baby by Benefit (nice light day scent)<br>  Amazing Grace by Philosophy (clean, light, feminine)<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are some other amazing ones out there.

oQL4Tg1yaa	The first thing to know and the most unknown information on finding an authentic Juicy Couture purse is that 90% of Authentic Juicy Couture purse are actually manufactured in China and have "Made in China" on the manufacturers tag. I encourage all of you interested in buying a Juicy Couture purse to take a trip to Nieman Marcus or Nordstroms and check out the tags and you will see they all say "made in china". But you thought Juicy Couture was Made in the USA right? So did I until I started selling them. The truth is almost all affordable designer purse are manufacturer in China, however the company itself is "made in the USA" hence why Juicy Couture and many other popular Designer Handbags such as Kenneth Cole and Coach all claim to be USA companies, but get their purse manufactured in China. This is why Juicy Couture uses the slogan "Made in the USA". So what does this mean? Unfortunately the actual tag is not as much help in determining a Fake Juicy Couture purse, however your purse should definitely have a tag on it and make sure real cowhide leather is used.<br>  <br>  hOpe yOu havE lEarn sOmethiNg...|`|18Weffunaa	It's fake. if it came from china or anywhere outside of the US its fake bc juicy is authentic to the US, it's 100% made in the US. That is what the brand is known for- being 100% authentic to the US.  Therefore, there shouldnt be any markings of any other countries anywhere on the tag or packaging.<br>  <br>  If you still think it may be real, compare the size of that one to others that you have that you know are real. I had a friend who bought one off of ebay and it was a lot smaller than her real ones, eventhough it looked the same. Also, you can tell sometimes by the look of the tag inside, compare the tag inside to the real ones you own.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA11211154	It sounds like a fake, Juicy purses are made in the USA, also fake Juicy purses don't have real leather trim. In the future don't buy Juicy stuff from Ebay, its usually knockoffs. If you are sure its fake, you should report the seller to Ebay and try to get your money back.

HY5YTjpDaa	i cut my blunt bangs once because they were getting too long and my mum was pretty busy and all so she didn't have the time.<br>  and i don't really go to the hairdressers often etc.<br>  so i cut my blunt bangs and they turned out pretty awful. <br>  it was like choppy which was horrible because with blunt bangs, they only look good when they're completely even and such :/<br>  <br>  then i made the biggest mistake ever by telling my friend to fix it. she cut it waay too short. and admittedly, it was a bit more horizontally straight but omg. the length was so unflattering on my face.<br>  <br>  um it won't take too long to grow back. my hair grew back out pretty fast. though those days were awful haha.<br>  <br>  i don't think you can do anything to make it grow out faster sorry ):<br>  <br>  but maybe after washing your hair, comb and blow dry your bangs (nozzle turned down). this way they won't be as poofy and it'll look like their longer ? :/ won't make your hair grow faster but it'll give you the appearance of having longer bangs? :/ <br>  <br>  anyway good luck ! don't get too upset over it. it'll grow out soon !|`|YGbz1V8naa	I once cut my own layers while I was in cosmetology school and my hair came out looking horrible. Never again. Hair grows 1/2 inch per month, so that is what you should expect. There is nothing that can make it grow faster. Bang trims don't cost too much in salons, so I'd suggest you go to one, if at all possible, so they can at least make it look a little better as it grows out. :(

AA11644170	My husband is as manly as they come (hunter, fisher, works in construction) and he waxes in between his eye brows and uses his clippers to take care of the bushiness. <br>  Nothing gay about not wanting to look like a muppet!<br>  <br>  You can buy the little wax kit by Sally Hansen at the the grocery or drug store and do it yourself easily and cheaply. Just use it in the middle (to separate the unibrow) I wouldn't suggest trying to use the wax to shape your eye brows on your own.<br>  <br>  I think guys get into trouble when they tweeze or wax to "shape" their eye brows, that does look too feminine in my opinion.|`|YwaoZkWKaa	You certainly don't need to have them waxed, you could just tweeze them.

Gpi3HI3Caa	First you have to bleach it and then dye it since you are going for a lighter color.<br>  <br>  Go to a professional for first time and then perhaps you can do it yourself.|`|O2VfQyOdaa	I Would get it done by a pro but they can be quite exspencive so if money is a issue here is how you can do it yourself.... Get bleach powder and 40% vol peroxide they come in 20 30 and 40 u will need 40 because its stronger and has the best result on dark hair. leave bleach in for about 25 minuetes once rinsed apply a toner to your hair i suggest you buying 2 for your hair because its so dark. because after the bleach it will be all orangey/yellowy and the toner removes all that and makes it a nice blond i recomend getting an ash blonde toner.<br>  <br>  * you have to mix the toner in with some peroxide read the toner box they will show you how* they are pretty cheap to about $10. <br>  <br>  or you can get the hairdressers to put a toner through it for about $30<br>  and i say Buy a shampoo for blonde hair there usually purple and are about $10-30 australian $10 being a supermarket brand $30 being a high end salon brand but they all work|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	ok you wont have it over night!you have gradually build up to a lovely blond colour by getting highlights done, every so often.... <br>  after about 5 times of getting the highlights done you will have lovely blond hair,|`|f849fe6f1344072ff248076d8c5de5a4aa	Agree you need to bleach it first, just one more thing, buy a good conditioner because bleaching/colouring damages your hair and you will need it.|`|420e76e4daaff536c4d70d00660d1610aa	Go to a salon.|`|xjHW0boMaa	go to a good stylist and pay for the same|`|LXvAoUxHaa	have you put any colour over your natural colour?<br>  <br>  The blondes you are using should show a light white colour saying they contain bleach. if you have dyed your hair previously I would recommend you do this repeatedly for an hour each time leaving a period of time between each bleach and using strengthening treat meant conditioners and dont leave the bleach in for more then an hour at a time, after you achieve a lighter blonde then the one you are after dye your hair the desired colour<br>  <br>  dont bother going to a hairdressing salon if you are after this result immediately, I would only be able to bring it up to a light coppery colour, perhaps the ginger you are getting? <br>  <br>  hope it helps sweetie<br>  <br>  Xx|`|N8cAwzxzaa	You need to go to a salon and get them to bleach it. It costs that bit more obviously but it's near impossible otherwise to get the colour you want. If you don't want the bleached blonde shade they'll go over the top with another dye, like honey or ash blonde.|`|EJWXhydUaa	I would suggest getting it done professionally. If you would rather do it yourself, you need to get a color stripper, which takes all the pigment out of your hair, and then dye it a blonde. You may need to dye it twice.
c503ad208e9d6b0524a3bc6f69ee2f8eaa	Depends on who you are doing business with.<br>  Go back into the jeweler, and let them know what happened.  You have a 50/50 shot of them replacing the stone.  Be prepared to have to pony up the cash to buy one, as you already know your warranty doesn't cover missing stones (though what kind of warranty you bought I have no idea!), and any jeweler could reasonably argue that the stone was solidly in place when you were there, and you did something to it in the interim.|`|0191j9waaa	i m in china owing one diamond jewlery factory . following is my suggestions according to my experiences.<br>  <br>  1. they should give you a diamond for free if it is in guarantee time if you wear and maintain it properly.<br>  <br>  2. you should brush the stone very gently. meanwhile, you have to cover the hole before you brush the stones. otherwise the stone will go with waste water.   U should be pay much attention to this!<br>  <br>  3. if the same stone always come out, that means the prong fixing the stone is damaged.you should ask them re-make the prong.  THIS IS THE MAJOR ISSUE!   if it is large stone, you should show them the pc ank ask them whether it is because of the damaged prong!  then, maybe , they should do something with it.
N4a1wMnUaa	Hey! If your not going to take them out, going back to a smaller size would help them heal faster. If you're not willing to do this then yes they will heal in time, make sure you clean them with salt water, anything else is too harsh and un-needed. <br>  <br>  But as a warning, I wouldn't stretch them any larger for a good few months, blow outs are not attractive!!<br>  <br>  x x

Had it for 4 years now|`|uQfk8p7Laa	plus numbing cream don't work anyway! just suck up and take the pain! <br>  i don't think you can buy numbing cream honestly! if you have to have that then why get your navel pierced if you can't handle piercings you shouldn't get them! everyone pain tolerance is different! some say it hurts alot, some say it hurts a little and some say it don't hurt at all! some get redness, soreness, and after pain worst then period cramps! <br>  everybody is different just because they don't have problems you might it just depends on your body! sometimes it will rejected from your body which means your body can't handle the shock from the needle! sometimes it grows out or change position if your under 16! <br>  i got my navel pierced 3 yrs ago and honestly it was nothing to it! she put the clamps on and then put a rubber band on it so it stayed there, then she poke the needle through my skin i didn't feel anything at all and then she put the curved bar bell through and then she put the balls on and then 30sec i was done! i never had no after pain, no redness, and no soreness cause it depends on your weight as well! if your a little heavy when u bend over it will hurt!|`|JHLK8T92aa	it really doesnt hurt that bad. it depends on the level of pain you can take but its real quick and simple the best thing to do it just not think about it and breath, it'll be over before you know it. its way worth it for sure so i recommend not chickening out lol and just deal with the pain. <br>  for me the pain was like a 6 out 10.<br>  idk what to compare it to.. i guess just someone pinching your really hard. haha. <br>  just make sure that you take good care of it and clean it with dial everyday or it will get infected and close up. also like getting ears pierced people change the jewelry before its really done healing and its best to wait then there's a better chance of it healing correctly and not having any complications. <br>  just follow the rules they give you and everything will be fine lol. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and i hope i helped (:|`|6npsRIzUaa	It's just like a nasty pinch to your belly button, and it's over quickly. No, it is not a myth, some piercers do offer a numbing cream/spray, but not all do.

It lasts all day as long as you touch it up every few hours.. so I think it's worth the money for sure.<br>  <br>  hope this helpsss.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	I used it for Halloween for a goth look, and I was very happy with it.  It's translucent, not opaque like clown makeup.  It's a pressed powder and lasts as long as other pressed powder does.
gMKrx3vxaa	Number two looks best you rocked all of them though what ever one that you pick will be cool|`|sojfRnxjaa	Top right looks the best to me.

YCXxP43Laa	Damage limitation should be your immediate aim. I'm glad yoiu're in England as there is an excellent product called Protect and Perfect Serum that is sold from the counters at Boots No7 (it is a Boots No7 brand).  It has been shown to categorically work by independedt researchers who were doing a documentary for Horizon. They were trying to prove that anti-ageing products do not work, and were astonished to find that this one did. It contains retinol, which has been prescribed by dermatologists for years as it actually reduces wrinkles, unfortunately, although it is the only anti wrinkle treatment to work, it is not available in a high enough concentration in creams... except Boots No7 Protect and Perfect Serum. It costs around ￡16.75, but it does work.... and if you buy one product then use this, it is the only scientifically proven one, and saves money on the bigger cosmetic companies ones, which do not work.<br>  If you find even that too much (and they do a mens version now), then Holland & Barrett have a Retinol Cream it costs around ￡4, but does have quite high levels of retinol, so should give a good effect.<br>  <br>  Try Boots Botanicals for cleansers and toners; they have a really good one that helps with open pores, or use a foaming cleanser and apply rose water as a toner (you can get rose water for a ￡1 from the cooking section of supermarkets, where it is cheaper than chemists).<br>  <br>  Get some Vitamin E capsules and prick them and smooth over the face, vitamin E has excellent restorative powers for the skin. Use at night.<br>  <br>  USE  A SUNCREAM... factor 15 or above, even in dull weather... this is the most improtant thing yiu can do! Drink plenty of water, don't drink or smoke, eat plenty of berries and salmon, try to do some facial exercises, massage your face when applying moisturiser, get plenty of sleep, try wet, cold teabags under your eyes for ten minutes.<br>  Good luck|`|mtaMzeG2aa	dark lines under your eyes - Go to bed earlier! a week of early nights and should be ok I think. Also, lay off the drugs.<br>  <br>   open pores, wash with hot cloth and rinse with cold water (to close the pores)<br>  <br>   , wrinkly skin, maybe a moisturiser<br>  <br>  frown lines in my forehead, maybe genetic.|`|os1ydh2daa	mary kay has a product with cologen in it. look it up and try that. i know some people who have used and and absolutley love it. they put it on every night before bed!
4IVWMgp7aa	Hair stylists will NOT dye your eyebrows.  There is a small risk of you going blind if it gets into your eyes (which its sure to do).|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No and don't every do anything like that to your eyebrows!|`|SMNPqBIOaa	My opinion is that you should ask an expert or research stuff on websites, it will help you make your decision. I think that you should stick to your natural colour, but because I haven't actually seen how light they are, I'm not sure. So do ask an expert, or maybe even a friend, they're sure to help you with some good advice. I don't really know any tips on how to darken them though. Also, I haven't tried the mascara, sorry... :)|`|z2TjjnxVaa	If you do darken them, never do them yourself, go to a salon for that.<br>  <br>   Just buy an eyebrow pencil that is a couple of shades darker and try that out. Eyeshadow wouldn't work too well but they do have pencils dedicated to eyebrows.|`|AA10843517	for me just put a glossy brown eye shadow. it fits to all gal.
kGkUG0fKaa	if you are getting it cut because it is damaged then explain that to the stylist and let her or him figure out whats best to do.<br>  <br>  if you want a short do, go for a nape of the neck even bob, it can sit right on your shoulders, you can add layering and it will still be long enough to put in s ponytail and do other things with.<br>  <br>  If you want a shorter do, then just go for it. And if you don't like it you can always add extensions in to mke it longer til it grows back.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	shave it, you will get noticed more|`|9LvLGfb1aa	yez <br>  my opinion will be that u shud cut your hairz<br>  it will not be any problem<br>  they'll grow|`|kgDH2BILaa	If you really want to go short, Do it! I'm just saying, once you cut it, it will grow back, but it will take a while. I had really long curly hair that went down to my mid-back and I cut it about 5 months ago to just above my shoulders.. (Like 10 inches off) I thought it was cute at first and I was glad I did it! Now i just miss all my long hair, It's so much cuter than short. (don't get me wrong, I love the short too). <br>  <br>  You'll miss it for a while.<br>  Women were meant to have long hair.|`|tpPbawXuaa	it really is up to you, it will grow back no matter what and your boyfriend will love you no matter what but you have got to do what makes you happy, i hate getting my hair cut as i love having long hair and i also get alot of split ends, i cried last time it was cut coz they took it shorter than i wanted. <br>  <br>  don't alway's straighten your hair, and use deep treatment hair masks aswell to replace nutrients your straighters burn.|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	probably you'll know it later|`|GqJVk2kYaa	Sure.  It will always grow back if you dont like it.|`|PUC1K40saa	if everybody likes your hair so much you should just get it trimmed.|`|v6fQWSy2aa	your hair's health is not depend on length, so do not cut it. i love long straight hair too! try to use another shampoo.|`|adyNCp6eaa	Okay, this is what you should do: cut your hair like 1/2 inch- 1 inch, to get rid of the split ends. Keep your bangs and get long layers. This will look cute, but keep about the same length. Another tip: dont straighten your hair too much, it KILLS your hair. Just be happy with your natural hair. You could use a hair relaxer if your curls/waves are really bad, but straightening is not the answer, you are cooking your hair.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Sounds like you want to get a new style for yourself. If you want to go short do it. If your boyfriend is true then he'll be honest and tell you if he likes it or not, then when your ready to do something else maybe more serious then you won't have to worry about him giving you an honest opinion beforehand. That's a good thing to find out while he is still a boyfriend and not something more.

This is for Autumn/Winter 2009-2010.<br>  <br>  Fashion week is never held in July - the Spring/Summer 2010 shows will be October the 1st to October the 8th and it's usually always around these times of year, showing one season in advance.<br>  <br>  The shows are held all over Paris.

OnTXgFx1aa	AVEENO!!!!!!!!!!!|`|z7MPaUELaa	It's kind of expensive but I really like Aveeno. It has a nice smell and is great for sensitive skin. <br>  <br>  When my daughter was an infant her cheeks would turn red and dry. Her doctor recommended Aveeno lotion and it worked.<br>  <br>  Lubriderm is good too though and it is cheaper. I've never used St Ives lotion but I do like their apricot facial scrub.|`|Rdi1qOwkaa	If your skin is just thirsty, Use St. Ives.<br>  If it's REALLY dry and/or itchy, Aveeno is th way to go.
SkDomhoXaa	if you want an honest answer :-<br>  <br>  bight/vivid colours are out this season and cool natural is in...... by all means have a radiant red but not in huge chunks, break it up. as natural looking colours are big this season...... but then if you want that have it as is good to be different.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Sounds very cute.<br>  As for fashionable, your hair color is your hair color. Any color is in style these days. As long as you like it, then it doesn't matter but yes, it will be a very fashionable choice!<br>  <br>  Go for it!|`|VnqPrEXPaa	Go for it, it'll be cool.  I used to have pillar box red lowlights in brunette hair, but just before xmas decided to get plum!!  It's absolutely  fab, didnt think i would suit dark hair but its loads better than the red. It lasts longer than the red, and you dont have to keep getting the roots done!!! Bonus!|`|lXNVhMiaaa	Sounds like it will work.  My professional stylist does a lot of mixed colors - all colors and they come out looking great.

(I'm the same, I have a 'kicky' pair of shoes, and nowhere to wear them, so I put them on to go grocery shopping, woo!! lol)|`|R1zUIh7taa	It looks nice, but I'm not sure about putting makeup on the bottom of your eyes, it makes them look smaller.  I'm not writing this to be mean you just have small eyes.  Maybe look into techniques to make your eyes look a bit bigger.  Just my opinion though.  But your eyeshadow does look very pretty...good job!|`|Gbeak6fAaa	Wow I love your eyeshadow. i wish I can apply mines like yours. I like the different blues you used. Everything looks fine to me. oh yea, cute tattoo!|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I think it looks really good. It looks well blended not harsh at all. And I think your really pretty by the way. You have a really pretty smile.|`|Qtqnk7P2aa	it looks really good! not even kidding, the colors blend perfectly and its a great color for you too! your also pretty, so that helps.<br>  my only suggestion would be to lighten it up a teeny bit ... its a little dark and so is the eye liner ...<br>  but other than that is gorgeous! i also like your tattoo! haha|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i thought it looked good. the only pic i thought was too 'liney' in the shadow was the last...i wasn't sure if it turned out that way or what, but it looked like it had settled into the creases a bit.  but otherwise, i didn't think it was tacky; didn't really think it was necessarily sexy, but overall it looked good.  it looked like the 1st 2 pix were blue shades and the last 2 in darker shades, like grays, but that could've been the light???<br>  <br>  btw you're not ugly at all, you're very pretty.  don't sell yourself short.<br>  <br>  do some more experimenting and have fun!!|`|zI4XBfkPaa	really good the smokey look looks good and don't worry about what people say you are beautiful

I stare at girls that are ugly and laugh to myself in my head that she's a brown bagger so without a picture there's no telling what the guy was thinking.|`|A2G9foewaa	Ummm guys think about sex like every ten seconds, so if he is staring at you longer than that then yeah he's thinking man I would like to get some of that.|`|AA12265821	U really think highly of yourself !<br>  maybe there like ughhh that ugly <br>  person keeps looking at me<br>  ughh !<br>  bit of advice get of ur high horse !!

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You're just going to have to make it through that awkward length. I promise it will be worth the wait! Anyways currently you might try putting it half up or clipping sections out of the way if it's getting in your face too much. Also you could take hair supplements to help it grow faster. I recommend GNC Ultra Nourish Hair. Worked for me. :)<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	The package says 6 weeks, but mine lasts for a few months.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	Usually about 4-6 weeks depending on how often you wash your hair (ie- everyday, every other day, etc.)  Also, if you use shampoo and conditioner with color protectant it should last longer than using regular shampoo / conditioner.|`|AA12316855	It depends. It depends on the type of hair color you use, the color you're changing your hair from and to, and how often you shampoo. I've found that mine lasts about a month, unless i'm changing my hair to a redder color, and then it lasts longer. <br>  I've also found that the John Frieda color glazes work well for keeping your hair color in. Shampooing less frequently definitely helps it last.<br>  I've recently taken to using Henna hair dye to prevent my hair from becoming super brittle and gross--of course I dyed my hair frequently in years past, so it may not be necessary for you.<br>  One other thing--you CAN'T make your hair blonde from a dark color with semi-permanent hair dye--you're going to wind up with unfavorable results. <br>  <br>  good luck and happy hair dye! :-)|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	It depends on which one you use. Look on the color box or ask your colorist to verify. Also, types of shampoos, how much sun or chlorine your hair is exposed to, and the color will affect how long your color looks good. But be aware that if you have light colored hair and you go for a dark color, that will never completely wash out.

Though I strongly recommend using fake tan rather than risking your health by using sunbeds, which can lead to skin cancer, obviously. Just go for one or two sessions of fake tan per week and you should be set by the time the next two months come around.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	it only takes about 2 weeks in a tanning salon, unless you are pale as a ghost|`|zqrBkVI4aa	If u wanna get tan a.s.a.p., then a spray tan is your best option, plus it doesnt cause skin damage or cancer. But if u want the tanning bed, try starting soon. thhe buildup of your daily visit will have you in a perfect golden tan before 2 months. Just remember, Use lotion afterwards. it keeps ur skin hydrated and soft, b/c tanning drys u out!|`|NVshaXKCaa	I would start now!  Just start with a few minutes to see how your skin reacts.  Know that all tanning beds are not the same -some are stronger than the others. If you start now and then go up on the amount of minutes each time you will have a great tan in two months!

NVqmnFuUaa	Pediculosis, better known as head lice, is an extremely contagious infestation of small white insects known as lice. Their eggs are known as nits, and usually attach themselves to hair close to the scalp or body. Lice are spread by sharing infested clothing and items, and by direct personal contact. They're pesky, but treatable--read on.<br>  <br>  Assess whether you actually have lice. Symptoms include itching, swollen glands in the back of the neck, foul-smelling hair and small, oval white or gray-white spots stuck to the hair shaft. <br>  <br>  Check for live lice and nits. Work in strong light and section the hair. Use a fine-tooth comb (a pet flea comb works well) to find the insects and to comb them out if possible; or remove them using tweezers, your finger-nails, or a piece of tape wrapped around your finger, sticky side up. Adult lice are reddish-brown; nits are white or clear and adhere to the hair shaft. They do not jump or fly. <br>  <br>  Step3Check everyone in the household. Lice are very contagious<br>  <br>  Wash all bedding, recently used towels and recently worn clothing in hot water, and dry them in a hot dryer. Soak all combs and brushes in hot water for at least 10 minutes<br>  <br>  5Treat eyelashes and eyebrows with a thick layer of petroleum jelly. Apply twice a day for 8 days. Never use any chemical treatment on eyelashes or eyebrows. <br>  <br>  Try using olive oil or mayonnaise on the head. There is some evidence that it works by smothering the nits. Massage it into the hair and leave it in as long as possible. Manually comb out the nits after the olive oil or mayonnaise application. <br>  <br>  7Use a blow dryer, as heat can kill lice and nits. But exercise caution and avoid placing the dryer too close to the scalp<br>  <br>  <br>  8Examine the hair daily to make sure that all nits and lice are gone. If you see more nits, it may mean that there are still lice in the hair or that re-infestation has occurred. <br>  <br>  9Report the presence of lice to your child's school so the staff or faculty can check for an outbreak. Children with a lice infection should be kept home from school. They can return after the lice have been removed or have been treated with a commercial product<br>  <br>  10Check with your pharmacist to make sure that any product you plan to use does not contain lindane. The National Pediculosis Association strongly advises against using lindane because it has been associated with a number of serious medical conditions, including seizures and possibly cancer <br>         I hope this will help you on your problem.|`|kl0YIHY4aa	you should buy some lice remover, it works really well, i had lice a couple of yrs ago and that got rid of them, but remember that you have to wash all of the clothes  that you wore and your bed sheets and most of the boxes come with stuff that u can spray on the couch that helps|`|ajeMVARraa	Get some lice shampoo from the pharmacy (RID is a brand that works).

I don't want to catch anything!|`|BTI0XOptaa	The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical shampoos then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pdN0UHrsaa	Hello^_^<br>  <br>  Please try "Quell Shampoo" for lice or "Oilganics". That will help you a lot. I tried a bottle of it. <br>  <br>  Every time I took my bath, I used Oilganics or Quell. I wiped my hair with my towel, and after I check it, to see if lice were present in my head. And good to hear, my lice were removed<br>  and my lice were gone. It's affordable and effective. Try using it. It will amaze your eyes^_^!...It's affordable and very effective. <br>  <br>  I have a little websites...try checking it|`|pLn7ez5Daa	Use both anti-lice shampoo and comb your hair with a metal "lice" comb twice a day. Repeat everyday until you start getting blackish-looking dots in between the comb....those are the dead lice >.<<br>  Living in a hot country like Singapore, I learned by experience :) Just try not to scratch too much because then you'll start getting dandruff as well! Hope it helps xx|`|whqPXLjcaa	The simple way for this is =>grind one onion then squeeze its juice n put the juice all over ur scalp n hair.keep it for 1 hr n then wash it with a good shampoo that has a good fragrance.after this ur hair will b free from lice.its easy n cheap n homemade.|`|rMaASWmlaa	Use Medicare shampoo available at any General stors for atleast 1 month, twice every week.<br>  Comb by very fine Comb when hair is wet<br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|fVN9H9Rpaa	You need some nit lotion.<br>  Apply it then comb it through with a nit comb.<br>  wash out the lotion<br>  <br>  cutting your hair won't remove lice|`|gAgGrzWdaa	hai  grind some neem leaves + 2 tsp soaked fenu greek seeds and apply in hair . after some time wash it ...try it
kCdISEGqaa	Yeah, I've been there.  Fortunately for me, I'm small enough that I could go without until mine were all healed.  Try not to let your straps rub if you must wear  bra, you don't want the straps to pull scabs or rub the dry, dead skin off before its time.  I know a lot of ladies that wear strapless bras until they heal.  Best wishes!!!|`|rjac15O0aa	Use a paper clip or something to hold your straps together in the middle of your back.  Like on that Commercial where the lady has those clips to tuck the straps under a crisscross shirt.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	I have a tattoo on each of my shoulders...I am a 42DD and if you get the right strapless bra they will work. You will have to spend money on a good one but they are out there...|`|wNZ95AK3aa	wear a tube top|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Try to wear a strapless bra, or one with convertible straps.I wore a bikini top that was halter style when I got my shoulders done. Especially if your hair is longer, no one will even notice. <br>  If possible, wear a tube top under your shirt for a layered look, and you can skip the bra (depending on your size) I am not very top heavy so I can get by with these tricks, I am not sure how they would work for someone that is large chested.....|`|UqOKOKx6aa	HA HA HA, I am the same size as you and just had my tat done Saturday.  I have to have support too.  I have a strapless bra that has the rubber outlining to keep it from falling down.  It works fine.  I still want my straps back, I am going to try a few of these ideas though.  The clip and the other style bras.|`|AA11329531	i just got a tatto as well. my guy told me not to wear a bra strap and not to wear any tight clothing and all soft clothing. the important thing is when your tattoo begins to flake - that you don't rip it|`|6LJzt2ngaa	wear a strapless bra, and a couple of tank tops that have the inside bra? thats what i would do.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	There are a lot of options when it comes to bras. I'm a 36DD so you can't tell me strapless bras don't work...they do, you just have to find the right one. Usually, cheap bras at nonspecializing stores aren't going to do the trick. But if you go to an actual lingerie store (VS, etc) then you're more likely to find more supportive strapless bras. And you can even try them on to make sure they are.<br>  <br>  There are also those things that turn your bra into a racerback. There are racerback bras, sports bras, convertible bras....that won't rub against your shoulder.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	a sports bra or tube top would be better, or a bra that you can change the straps on so that it can be a halter bra or can cross in the back. you don't want that much rubbing on your tattoo because it could cause problems.

6aEhPcDAaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  If you look on the bottom of the product, usually where it says the color of the makeup, it will have a little circular picture, and it looks like a "cap" is coming off that circular "can", and in there is a number.  For example, if there is that little picture, and it has a 12 in it, that means the product should last 12 months.<br>  <br>  An easy way to figure out also if makeup has gone bad, is if it starts smelling bad.  After having the product for a long enough time, you should know what it should smell like, and if it starts to stink, throw it out.<br>  <br>  I will give you a little guide to how long they GENERALLY last, but this isn't always, so you really want to make sure they are okay, don't smell terrible, because that could make you sick, or get a infection or something.  Okay,<br>  <br>  Mascara: These are the ones that you have to replace most often, generally, they last about 4 months, to help make it last longer, don't pump the wand in and out of the tube or more air gets into the mascara, and it dries out quicker.<br>  <br>  Lip  Gloss: Probably last the longest.  Maybe up to 2-3 years, but you also might run out of product which would make it less.  <br>  <br>  Foundation: It really depends what kind, but usually to a year to a year and a half.  Again, check on the bottle somewhere, and it should have that little symbol, which will give you a better idea for the actual product, not just generally speaking.<br>  <br>  Lipstick: Same as lipgloss, lasts a long time, and its usually a few years.  You can stick it in the fridge to make it last longer (I don't know anyone that does that, I just read it online, lol) but throw it out ones it starts smelling weird.<br>  <br>  As for what you should say, don't beg, that just gets her annoyed.  Just wait a few days, and when she is in a good mood, go up and talk to her about it, and give her really good reasons why you should be able to use some.  (ex. You spent all this money on expensive makeup that you barely ever use, and if it goes bad, you would've wasted a lot of money....and so on)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|JsffWlnEaa	be careful,if its expired it cause cause infection/rashes|`|A7ovwP94aa	Found this is in a magazine. I think it is more to do with the ingredients going off and irritating your skin.

Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.This is a good review website at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and see what everyone recommends.|`|2fd33bceabba2ae15aad5658e84d9fe9aa	Foundation: 1 year <br>  Lipstick & Lipgloss: 1 year <br>  Mascara & Eyeliners: 3 months|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	I believe the rule of thumb is 3 months.
pC0GVZCcaa	Waiting inbetween bleaching hair doesnt save it from any damage. The damage from 2 bleaching sessions is the same whether you leave it 1 day or 1 month.<br>  <br>  You'd definately be ok to go back now, as long as your hair isnt extremely damaged (to the point of where it all breaks off whilst brushing)|`|zZ8kHajcaa	It should be 2 months as what i've experienced but be careful for health reasons as there is ongoing debate regarding more serious health consequences that may result from use of hair coloring.<br>  There are news articles that link the development of some forms of cancer ,including leukemia,  bladder cancer, blood cancer, and multiple myeloma with use of hair color. Prolonged use of permanent dark hair dyes can actually double a person's risk of getting various types of blood cancer

ZqHqKDqEaa	I keep the scalp oiled by using some of these products - Keracare, or Jane Carter Hair Solutions. They don't make the hair or scalp greasy but instead gives the hair a nice sheen. <br>  <br>  I shampoo my hair every 2 weeks to prevent the scalp from developing dandruff or oil build up. Don't pull on the braids otherwise you can loosen them up. <br>  <br>  At nights I tie my head up with a scarf, or you can sleep on a satin bed pillow which will protect the hair as well. <br>  <br>  Taking care of the braids will enable them to last longer.

I don't think so.<br>  you still young but old enough to understand it, now you don't have to smile at all the time but you'll need to help them by start conversation usually with a joke and 'natural attitude' don't show yourself to smart or to needy and keep the eye contact if he does is a good sign but if he doesn't keep walking, be patient one out of 1000 guys will do that but hey! there's "players" and porno producers who knows the game pretty well:-(

MehqmwZXaa	If your hair gets tangled easily, you should comb it while you're still in the shower, before rinsing the conditioner. That will hep you to style it and you won't cause any more damage by overcombing your hair when you get out of the shower. Remember that you should never brush your hair while wet or brush it too much or too hard, even while it's dry. <br>  <br>  And of course, avoid heat styling tools as much as possible.<br>  <br>  One home treatment you could try is olive oil. I've never tried it myself but I've heard it's pretty good. Just don't apply it to your roots, specially if your hair is oily.<br>  <br>  All of these will avoid causing more damage and repare a bit your hair, but if your hair is really brittle and damaged the only real solution might be cutting it off. You could do it gradually so you have the chance to get used to the new length.<br>  <br>  If you're in doubt, ask your hairstylist.|`|ymTvDaHQaa	omg i knw wat your going throw my hair is the same exact thing , first lets get a trim and lets strat off by for a whole mounth dont use any chemicals or heat on your hair buy a mask for your hair any kind ( panteen , sunsilk , dove , netrogena hair , garnere frutess exx) and use it ones a week also dont wash your hair only ones , every 3 days also use hot oil treaments theer also very cheep , or just use olive oil and massage it in your hair and keep it for 1 hour . also use leave in conditioner right wen u get out of the shower and also massage your hair everyday to let the blood flow and take more vitimanes and drink lots of water and eat right that will make your hair grow faster and healther ,i hoped i helped please me 10 points .. mwaaaaaaaaaaa experionce|`|4QHanq1Laa	Get a trim, get your dead ends cut off. <br>  Buy hot oil treatments do that or the cheaper method sit with mayonaise on your head.<br>  Use heat protectant when your hair is damp before doing your hair. <br>  If you can avoid heat all together, even better|`|AA12265821	egg thickens the hair and repairs just crack a few eggs open and use as a sort of shampoo ! LUCK|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	In cases like this, I suggest you invest in the professional hair aides such as Paul Mitchell.  The line offers a variety of helpful treatments that will deliver promising results.  My hair is over processed too and I have been using Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner for dry and damaged hair.  I also use a supplemental leave in serum to calm hair and add a nice shine with a soft touch.  Good luck and don't cut your hair!  It's salvageable! :)|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Keep using that good shampoo and conditioner and ALWAYS spray a good heat protectant on your hair before you style it. Before you blowdry you can put in a leave in conditioner too that helps. Deep condition every 2 weeks. Ask your stylist they'll tell you the best one for your hair. Trim all the dead ends off that's your best bet. If you can't trim them ALL off just do it little by litte as your hair grows. Try to blowdry and iron as little as possible since it dries your hair out. Take sm hair vitamins and try to eat more veggies and that will help it grow faster so you can get those dead ends off quicker.
OgdihnCmaa	My advice would be to go with a deep chocolate brown or at least something a few shades up from true black. The issue with going completely black from blonde is that often times what most people consider "black" hair is really dark brown (Asians are the only people with real black hair). Other than that, I would recommend buying shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair. Your first shower after getting your hair dyed should be conditioning it twice, and rinsing with cold water. This keeps the color from fading. In general, make sure you know what you're getting in to, and keep your hair healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Also, to keep your hair extra soft, wash and condition it twice with every shower, finishing with very cold water. This will keep your hair from frizzing as well as making it very soft, smooth, and over-all very healthy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! = )|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	Black can be pretty matte, so we warned of that. Also, even the semi-permanent black colors won't wash out so the only way to get rid of the color would be to cut your hair off. And unless you are thin, black hair and porcelain skin can add a couple pounds. <br>  <br>  If you choose to dye it at home instead of going to a salon, have a friend do it to minimize the amount you get on your skin. If you accidentally do get some on your skin, use lemon juice (let it sit on the stain) to fade it. Good luck!|`|DMhAPurkaa	You have some really great answers here already.<br>  You might want to try chunking it in first to see how you like it.<br>  I think your eyes and complexion would make a nice contrast, if that is what you are looking for .<br>  I agree with the other answers, like it can be matte, and don t go to the darkest black.<br>  Also the pasty thing can be a concern with your skin color, but maybe you can put some blush on, or color on your eyes, like a green or blue, or blush on your eyes, and it would balance that out. Or you can go with the whole contrast thing and put on just eyeliner , smoky, and some red shade of lipstick.<br>  Good luck, and try to honor your mother, it will come back to you somehow, and it will make your life easier if you have to live with her, and depend on her somehow for your livelihood.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	If you were going from dark to light then yes there may be some weird color coming about it you do not strip the dark color first but being that you are going from light to black, it willjust turn all black. Black hair dye is a heavy color, the heaviest so once you dye it black it will turn pitch black and stay that way however to reverse will mean stripping your hair of the black, which stripping means to bleach out the dark color first to add a lighter color, perferbaly do that in a salon so you don't mess up your hair.<br>  <br>  Black is drastic and if you have pasty skin it can drown you out and make you look goth or emo (as these kids now are)<br>  <br>  The stylist will be able to tell you everything you need to know which isn't much just learning how to keep up with the maintenence of your hair color. Also try a Rinse Color and Rinse Colors are dyes that you put in and will wash out with shampooing after a couple washes. Its a good way to help find what color will work for you before you go permanent ebcause permanent dye is harder to change colors consistently because of the process to go from dark to light or light to drastic and it damages your hair, a rinse does not. <br>  <br>  To show your mother what it would look like, go to the store and get a spray dye in black, spray your entire hair (it washes out easily and more quickly than a rinse which is designed to stay in longer) and that way you yourself can see what black hair color will look like on you.<br>  <br>  I agree with your mother, going so drastic and permanent is a mistake. try it out first. I experiemented with many hair colors with a rinse before I went to jet black but I am also a dark skinned chick so black doesn't wash me out like a light brown did.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|kgDH2BILaa	It should work out fine. If you end up getting hair dye in a box, Go with loreal. It works good. Also, I'd probably go with a 3C natural match. Don't go for a full out 1, sure it's the blackest black but it doesn't look natural at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope it turns out good!|`|S61zbh8Yaa	dont dye your hair black by the sounds of your complexion that colour would be too drastic foe yor skin colour.maybe try getting some nice choclate lowlights ,they would look lovely,dont try and dye it yourself you might ruin your hair hope i helped x x|`|Ig3W5YZnaa	black it|`|PjcRpwXGaa	just dye it if u wont to

koGuVA2iaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of the content but Tresemme Salon Silk conditioner is excellent but I've found the best results are from using another product to smooth. Tresemme Straightening Balm is the very best, whether you straighen or not.<br>  <br>  I have hair like you and tried just about everything on the shelves in every price range and as you found they didn't work or made your hair greasy.<br>  <br>  You can't find it everywhere but I've bought it in Morrisons before now. It costs around ￡4.50 and a little goes a long way. You only use a pea sized amount rubbed into your hands a little and smooth over the ends then gently smooth the rest over your hair and the top. You really do only need little and your hair looks totally natural and not clogged up or greasy from product. :oD|`|N2XKAzZQaa	you should go into the shop 'lush'<br>  they make everything themselves & it's all completely natural<br>  the stuff they have is amazing, & the hair stuff is quite good<br>  i always use their bath bombs, they're so nice.<br>  although some of the stuff can be a little expensive<br>  <br>  either that or you can try frizz-ease. i'm pretty sure that they don't use animal testing with their products, & their stuff really works!<br>  but again.. a little expensive<br>  i guess you pay for quality though<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|5uAaJfaaaa	head and shoulders<br>  or <br>  herbal essences- frizz fighter <br>  they are both really good|`|sojfRnxjaa	Most shampoos have sodium laurel sulfate as the lathering agent in them which can dry some hair out. You can find shampoos that are sulfate free but they wont lather as much. Health food stores have shampoos that don't have harsh ingredients. Always look at the ingredients and that should tell you how strong or mild the shampoo really is.|`|As87hWa7aa	the Matrix line in the orange bottles are good.<br>  also Herbal essences has some good anti frizz shampoos|`|H84GwaLGaa	u should use head n  shoulder , ganneir fruitis  or herbal essences|`|S61zbh8Yaa	try herbal essences or pantene the both worked for me
2glmH9Jbaa	okay. for hair color, i say reallyyy dark brown. i think its sexiest. second, i loveeee anything nutragina. how ever you spell it.. the wave is really good. proactive is okay.. but its too expensive. and other stuff works jsut as well. also the clean and clear ultra kit thing is amazing. third, i think a little bit of eye liner, black or brown, and a little mascara. not a lot. only use coverup that doesnt clog your pores and make sure it looks natural. but you dont need to use that. a good way to loose weight? dontt starve yourself or go beliemic. please dont! the biggestttttt things are to eat pretty healthy. that doesnt mean to eat only vegetables or eat smaller portions. it means just cut out the unnecessary junk food. second, DO. NOT. EAT. IF. YOU. ARE. NOT. HUNGRY. snacking can add up to more calories than actual meals. instead of eating when you're bored or craving it, have some water and do some sit ups. do something fun like go on a jog with your friends or bounce on a trampoline. :] <br>  lastly, to break the ice you just need to become friends. as for flirting? you dont need to be a huge flirt. just do those cute little mysterious things that will be on his mind ALL DAY. and i dont think you should ask him out. put the bait out there and wait for him to take it, just liek a fish. :]|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	dye it darker brown but not black<br>  proactiv works well<br>  generic makeup i use maybelline mousse with powder and it looks good<br>  to loose weight eat less and maybe jog after school<br>  dont ask him. flirt your way into getting him to ask you :)|`|oMlPqu8Naa	Die your hair dark brown. with platinum blonde streaks.<br>  <br>  And try exfolicating your face with an exfoliating face glove. Also, try any nutrigena face washes.<br>  <br>  do not use foundation, it will not work out good at all.<br>  <br>  just mascara, and use a non-shimmering brown powder as eye liner.<br>  just on the bottem lashes.<br>  <br>  To lose weight, force yourself to dtich junk food.<br>  go for runs, it works. do cardio (workouts that gets your heart beating and you puffing and sweating)<br>  <br>  and just take a deep breath and ask him. just do it. don't think about it. do it<br>  <br>  it's like jumping off something high. you don't think about it you force yourself. get it over and done with =]<br>  <br>  stay natural and yourself.<br>  <br>  don't use cover ups on your young skin.<br>  <br>  x

wNZ95AK3aa	use a black eyeliner to increase the shape around your eyes an use talc or a very light powder to soften your skin tone.once u make your eyes darker it will make your skin look pale automatically.and to be honest dont listen to anything that carmen said i think she was very wrong to advise you that you should save for surgery when your 16 years old!!she must have very low morals....|`|xFVDjZqPaa	Get a job now, start saving all that money till you are of age to get what your wanting done...done. Pale skin either comes by using pale foundations and powders or through chemically bleaching your skin which yea you will have to wait to do that, so again get a job and start saving. With your eyes you can use eye liner to draw a pointed frame around your eyes which really will give a more goth look, so again get a job and start saving money for the surgery. Now with that being said, make sure you get a good job, a rich husband, a plastic surgeon as a husband, something that entails alot of money, cause honey your on the road to always wanting to look different and never being happy with your looks.|`|Bn5JoVlLaa	eyes... use an eye liner to creat a chape on ur eyes magazines n stuff have pictures n steps to give thinner looking eyes dark eye shadow along the base of ur eye lid will also help..<br>  as for ur skin maybe just go with a very light foundation.. apply talc on ur face first then a very light power or foundation...<br>  as for ur neck.. ive NO idea sorry|`|gMKrx3vxaa	Why do you want to become paler leave you skin ALONE god made it like that people ALWAYS mess with there skin and then 5secs later there skin is uglier than before LEAVE it ALONE|`|Ron6f6nAaa	As for being paler, stay out of the sun i guess, and as for your eyes-there is no way without surgery, and the neck fat-if you are not in shape-you can be thin and out of shape-try diet and exercize-peoples face shape and neck can fluxuate depending on whether they are in shape or not, and if your trying to look asian i guess you could die your hair dark and make sure it is very straight-but my suggestion is to just be yourself, good luck :)|`|gLXzVbm8aa	wear liquid eyeliner to shape your eyes however you want them.|`|uUvV7eadaa	to make your eyes more asian looking, get black liquid liner and apply it to the top lids, and go straight across, do a bit of a winged eye. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v191/lizsybarite/FOTD08_Vamp/IMG_2416.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v191/l...</a><br>  <br>  like that, but more of a straight across line.

A7kWoGvnaa	You know the old saying 'Prevention is better than cure'<br>  Why wait until your face starts to wrinkle when you can delay them dramatically with a good anti aging cream.<br>  Moisturisers are great but a good anti aging cream contains quite specific ingredients to combat wrinkles, sagging skin, dry skin etc.<br>  I keep saying a good anti aging cream because there are tons of them on the market, most of them are just moisturisers masquerading as anti aging creams.<br>  So if you can afford it why not go for it, otherwise at your age I'm sure a decent moisturiser will keep your skin soft until those naughty lines start to appear.|`|hbIPsBrIaa	Revitol Complete is a cutting edge anti wrinkle solution which can help you look younger and more beautiful by reducing the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and other effects of aging. This revolutionary anti aging cream utilizes the most advanced ingredients available today. The active ingredients not only help to firm, hydrate, and tighten facial skin but also help to repair the appearance of fines lines.|`|dsmoeZcXaa	There's absolutely no reason why you can't use it - as long as you make sure you have the correct treatments for your skin type. <br>  <br>  The best hint I can give you is: avoid exposure to the sun without sunscreen and shade  etc.  The minute you get burnt or tanned your skin cells become "traumatised" (hence the change in skin colour) because they're being cooked by the heat - just like meat in an oven!<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd use a moisturiser with spf 30+ sunscreen in it for day use. Leave the anti-aging treatments (if you decide to go that way) for at night.  You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars to look after your skin for the future.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|oxGVEbisaa	No, you are just a girl.<br>  Do not use it.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	there are a lot of theories out there that say that using anti aging cream may help keep your face smooth as you age, but there aren't studies that prove that people using a good moisturizer on a regular basis won't get equally good results. i would stick with a good moisturizer that you like and use it religiously.|`|XZ9yP4Jkaa	um, your 19. not 50.

7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	There is no time frame because it depends on how fast the hair grows. This is different for each person, so you just have to do it when it needs to be done.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I shave my face daily....|`|283tO9j9aa	In winter I'm sort of lazy. I keep shaving my armpits but my legs get shaved once a week instead of twice a week. I don't see why I should shave my legs every day when the hair doesn't grow back enough for anyone to notice, even I don't notice it at that point.<br>  <br>  I use hair removal cream on my bikini line but it's one made especially for that area so it doesn't itch or burn. I do that once a week.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i tried veet and nair and they both burned me even though i used them for the time it said on the back. i wax my arms and bikini line. i shave my lower legs every day-and my thighs i shave like once a week, the hair grows slower there.|`|6a054048746da7edf01f4a2e7fa8cac0aa	veet was horrible in my mind i was left with a red painful rash  i would buch rather shave with a razor  and i do that daily i hate hair on me t all|`|26znDQcKaa	I don't.|`|zqrBkVI4aa	first of all, hair removal creams (like veet and nair) tend to smell HORRIBLE and the smell is hard to get off. So i would suggest shaveing. this lasts 1-2 days. The nair/veet will last about 3-5. Shaves or veet when ever you feel your hair start to stubble back on your legs. You can also try waxing if u have the $$$. This keeps your legs hair free for about 3-6 months. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|N2XKAzZQaa	when i shave i have to do it about every 2 days, i hate it when my legs are prickly. but i started eplilating because it got really annoying shaving constantly.. epilating lasts for about 3-4 weeks it's so great<br>  <br>  :)|`|0cJjyogqaa	i shaved everyday.. ^_^|`|chHPoiThaa	I only shave twice a week because it keeps your skin soft that way.<br>  If you shave to often your skin will become very hard in time.
adyNCp6eaa	You should try to conserve your money, make sure you dont have it on you often. When you get your check, cash it in and put it in the bank right away. And DO NOT go to the mall and look at the perfumes. I know its easier said than done, but if you dont want to go broke and live off of perfume, then you have to really try hard to break this. lol people get crazy addictions. Ex. my sis is addicted to the comp., she was on for 7 1/2 hours the other day, she seriously needs help & so do u! Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|u7o75zipaa	Wow, I work in a chemist that sells perfume, so I can see how that would be costly lol.<br>  I have 40+ perfumes, but I've only actually bought a few. The rest have been freebies from work, or presents.<br>  <br>  You could try getting testers? A lot of stores that stock perfumes have little testers that you can take away. Or you can get samples off some websites. That way, you can have loads of perfume - for free - without taking up much room either :) x|`|AA10862145	Hell no, you're not addicted, yet! Every woman and male, who's not afraid to express themselves, should have a wardrobe full of perfumes. There's seasons and moods and times-of-day, occasions and events and they all require their own scent to give you that just-so special feeling. <br>  <br>  I have a house full, but again I'm in the industry www.studio-xn.co.uk, so I have an excuse. What I would say is buy carefully rather than on impulse, decide why you want, how you want to feel and then buy something fitting. Or if you want to create something *totally* individual take a look at my website.<br>  <br>  As for the cost side - spend your money on what makes you happy. Some people like smelling great, some people like buying CDs, DVDs, video games, flossy glowsticks, shoes, handbags, we each have our vices. It's probably more healthy than cigarettes and alcohol.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	yes im going through a phase at the moment where im buying lots of perfume , its hard to be satisfied with what i have , and as soon im in a department store and start spraying the testers i smell one i like i have to have it and wont rest until i get it . i know what you mean.|`|AA10843517	actually because of my love for perfume i decided to have a business.

xJZZc4Kmaa	if you are going to use a tanning bed i would take it very slowly. since you are very fair i would only start out for a few minutes, then work your way up that way you don't burn. (when you burn that is when it is hard on your skin). a month or so of tanning should give you a nice base tan.  i would make sure you use a tanning lotion because it will help to hydrate your skin. don't use any with a bronzer in it, they have a tendency to make you look orange but regular lotions won't. when your on the cruise i would still use a high spf sunscreen. i think you are doing the right thing. you would definately burn without having a base tan. have fun!!!!!!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Natural tans only give an SPF of about 3, a plain white cotton tshirt has an SPF of between 6-8.<br>  <br>  So feel free to spend the next 2 months in a booth baking yourself to leather, it really won't do you that much good. Yeah it's a pain to put on sunscreen every 3 hours, but try using a really high SPF like 50 or 75 that way, you won't be crispy if you forget and go 4 or 5 hours. And be sure to put the correct amount on, if you're wearing a bikini, you should be putting about a golf ball sized amount on (if your average sized) biggest reason people have a problem still getting burnt is because they don't put enough sun screen on.|`|VVk0hHgpaa	Nah, I say don't tan.  I'm very fair myself and I like it.  I don't like the orange look. No tangerine for me lol<br>  <br>  Wear sun cream SPF  30 or higher.  I do when I'm exposed to the sun.|`|zon13nY2aa	Sometimes before I go on holiday, I use the sunbeds twice a week for 6 minutes at a time. But I tan very easily and find 6 minutes too much sometimes. So you would need to start off with just a few mins.<br>  <br>  There are some really good fake tans out there. Fake Bake is brilliant - it doesn't go orange or streaky. Yes it's ￡25 a bottle but it's worth it and it lasts ages! x|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	I would not tan in a booth. Spray on would be ok. The thigs you can do is use the highest rated protection for spf and gradually get some sun before you go. Wear a hat to protect your face and light clothing to protect skin.<br>  Have fun.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	I would try tanning in a booth but at really tiny intervals about a week or so before you go on the cruise, but only stay in the booth for a minute or two because of how fair you are- that way your skin can slowly build up a tolerance.  But make sure to wear sunscreen for tanning booths and wear sunscreen on the cruise (as much as you can remember to), but you should tan alittle better that way when you're on the ship.  I also have VERY fair skin that burns, and when I went to the Bahamas this is what I did and I ended up with a slight burn at first, but then I had a nice golden tan that lasted for a month.  ~*Good Luck*~ and Have fun on your cruise!!!
rjac15O0aa	Sounds like your artist went a little deep and caused some bruising.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	It's normal. I got a large tattoo on my calf and had the same thing happen...I think it's just the muscle gets sore from the process. If needed, you can ice it but make sure you wrap the bag of ice in a clean towel.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	yes it is normal. i had that on all three of my tats. it will last a while, but it will fade.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Think back to 2 weeks ago when you first got it. You probably guarded it from everything. Usually when you try to protect a specific area of your body from harm, you carry and use that part of your body differently than normal. So many times it can cause the muscle in that area to strain etc..<br>  Plus you just had a tattoo, which means the artist punctured your skin thousands of times with a needle, that can cause a muscle to react and to be sore. Not that the ink is in your muscle, but the muscle in your leg was held still for a while when you were getting the tattoo, and then the guarding I mentioned above....<br>  I think you are ok, it is pretty much normal. I wouldn't worry unless it continued for more than a month (?)|`|QikvnTnqaa	Yeah. I have 7 hours on my upper leg a and my leg was healed, but it still was a little achey. If it doesn't go away in another week or two, go talk to your artists. :D|`|br1FB5rraa	Yea that's normal, your muscle is still just a little sore. It'll wear off|`|gMKrx3vxaa	Yes it is the needle digs deep into your muscle it will ache probably one more week from now but it will stop do not worry

rgNP0Qo6aa	Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Yes, it works great!  It is expensive though....<br>  Best of luck to you, hope it works out!  :) ?|`|weLpbxlEaa	sk:n is good!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sknclinics.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sknclinics.co.uk/</a>|`|GdHNQYzraa	I have been getting my eyebrows shaped by an electrolysis, and I just asked her a few days ago about laser hair removal. She had done laser hair removal in the past. She says it is only effective for people with light skin and dark hair, even then it could be only 20% permanent hair removal. She says the average results are regrowth of lighter, finer hair. She also said that some people get little white scars from the lasers, and she felt the tradeoff wasn't worth it. She has seen better results with electrolysis. I think it is less expensive as well. I pay a buck a minute. 15 minutes for eyebrows. I had to go in every 2-3 weeks for a few months and now I go every 4-6 weeks, but it looks like I'm almost finished. I've probably only spent 130$ for all the sessions I've had. It will take a much longer time for a large area like the back though. You might want to see about it. It would be a waste to spend all that money on laser and end up looking the same in a few years.|`|koGuVA2iaa	I've had permanent hair removal on my legs, underarms and bikini line. I have naturally dark brown hair.<br>  <br>  Hair has to has pigment for it to work, the darker the better. It does not work on fair or grey hair.<br>  <br>  The clinic I used stated 10 sessions were needed. I paid per session (more costly than you have been quoted) and attended for 6. I have a few odd individual hairs which still grow on my legs and bikini line but I just pluck those out. My underarms are not much different however and I still have to shave. It seems that the softer/denser the skin area, the less successful it was, so if that's the case, it should work well on your back if you have dark hair and definitely better than just thinning.<br>  <br>  Maybe get a second opinion from another clinic too :oD

I'd suggest not using wax at all; try Nair cream for facial hair instead. You don't want to risk the scars getting even darker; that's worse than a mustache! <br>  <br>  The scars are pink because you've burned them again. Hopefully, they'll go down on their own but you should continue to use Neosporin and then Mederma.

The first one is when your hair is growing, the second is resting and the third is shedding. It will continue to grow as long as the follicle has not been damaged. Exercise helps because you are getting good circulation throughout your body. This along with stimulation through massage can help nourish the scalp and hair to promote healthy hair growth.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	The under active thyroid could potentially be the problem, but if your hair is long, it could just be that it's reached it's peak. Some people's hair just stops growing at a certain point, and this may be yours.|`|Twq7efhQaa	there are many factors that can control hair growth and hair loss. The thyroid gland is just one of them.<br>  This is very unusual to have the hair just stop growing. Is there a pattern to it? In other words, is it ALL of the hair that’s not growing or just some areas? Has any of the non-growing hair shed, or is it all intact?<br>  The first question you should answer is, do you have any hair loss in your family history? If you do, you can study the cause of their hair problems, which might shed light on what is causing your particular problem.<br>  Second, you are on two medications that can cause hair loss. One is Prozac and the other is Atenolol. We certainly do not recommend you discontinue the Atenolol with your cardiac history, but you must be aware that it can cause hair loss. There are no reports that either medication will stop hair growth.Other things can cause hair loss. One is the thyroid, but you should also rule out increased levels of male hormones or problems with your hormones. Check a DHEA level, testosterone level, FSH, T4, TSH, and Ferritin Level to check your iron stores, and CBC to evaluate you for anemia. A well balanced diet or vitamins are essential to hair growth.<br>  It seems that your problem seems to be primarily that your hair is not growing any longer. This can be a problem for some females. There are many females who find that the anagen stimulators in Hair Cycle shampoo and conditioner produce a healthy hair environment that prolongs anagen.

sojfRnxjaa	Curls are good because they add a soft and feminine look to the face. You can try getting layers to where they are contouring to your head shape. In other words, try not to get a cut that looks to boxy or like a helmet. A nice shaggy look or maybe an emo cut. It doesn't have to be short in length just shaped right so it fits your face and has the right balance for your overall frame. The right haircolor helps too, like warm colors and highlights.|`|Yb9Adbseaa	On this link there are 10 curly hair styles<br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/curlyhairstyles/ss/curlyhair2_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/curlyhairstyl...</a>|`|gMKrx3vxaa	Try To Straight your hair than put spiral curls in there that is the only way I can tell you girl Good Luck|`|FdLmXTVmaa	i also have curly hair and a fat face, and i cut it once a bit too short and it looked terrible! maybe try straightening it for a few days but remember to put smoothing cream on so it doesnt frizz :)|`|KdxTQ6nGaa	I'm not too sure what kind of style, but definitely NOT short.

rnUr1JJ7aa	Coca Butter Or Shea Butter Thats The Only Thing i No that Will help Because u Have Sensitve Skin|`|AA10702451	Well I don't like proactive and when I went to get a facial the lady took me that proactive works but after with some time of usage your skin gets used it so the product will stop working. Honestly if you have a good insurance you can go to a dermatologist and they will definately help you but if you don't want to do that then I love using clean and clear products, I use a foaming facial cleanser on the morning an acne cleanser for night time and I use an acne clearing astringent, just remember you want products that has salicylic acid. Hope I helped, good luck|`|W8Look0waa	Try proactive and that new dr. miracles works very well and it's about like 30.00 also if you trying to fade them away go to Dillards and get dermaBlend it's 33.90 and it's long lasting and hard to wash off niether of thse should break your skin out. And also you may need to change your hair style if you have bangs or hair in your face. Hope this helps

2uZivThaaa	Its perfectly normal! I used to have this problem and this is what I started to do. <br>  <br>  1. I started to use men's razors (Gillette Quatro). Their usually more sharp and give a closer shave for those tough hairs.<br>  2. I use body wash and a exfoliating mit to get rid of any dead skin and lift the hair from the skin. <br>  3. I then put baby oil on the skin and use the razor to shave it. This keeps the skin moist and avoids any nicks and cuts<br>  4. I then use body wash to rinse all of the baby oil off so I don't have a greasy feel. <br>  <br>  Doing this keep everything nice and smooth and nick free! And you'll stop having razor burn! :)|`|PRg9UgOlaa	Trim it first, use a MEN'S razor and lots of shaving cream. ALWAYS use a fresh razor and not a used one or you will have crazy razor burn and ingrown hairs.|`|vwOwnjUiaa	Quit shaving, go have it waxed!!!|`|1ef783bf47b87eab548df2f0856383a9aa	shave down not up|`|5vgnrvcmaa	You shouldn't have to shave "downstairs" because that hair is a nature dry lubricant.<br>  <br>  If you mean where your underwear don't cover, then just shave after a hot shower, use plenty of lathered soap, a new razor, and go gently.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It's a very sensitive area and that's bound to happen.  Have you looked into waxing instead?  The "cut" sounds more like an ingrown hair.
cKb1YiHvaa	how do you know its your style if you dont even know what it is?!?!
kTTwUY0Waa	I would first try the airbrush, you might want to mask off an area using the lassoo tool or even the magic wand. Use a fuzzy edged brush and give it about a 60% opacity. Select the skin tone by using the eye dropper. For this kind of work you will need to zoom in (shift+). Also have a good look at how your skin tone is comprised on the picture. <br>  <br>  You could also try using some lighting techniques from the light and shadow option in the filters menu. <br>  <br>  Skin is notoriously difficult to get right becuase no one has perfect skin, it is made up of a surprisingly different number of shades. But keep playing with it and you will get there.<br>  <br>  You could also try some of the open source/linux forums with Gimp threads.|`|qZrE4isoaa	<a href="http://www.hamzazovice-hdnzik.fr.gd" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamzazovice-hdnzik.fr.gd</a>
1eorsCpQaa	lol. i know what your going thru, i was like that back in middle school too. Don't worry about it. you'll grow and your body will change. soon all your friends and you will fit into sz 10's! its all about how your body changes. Size 4 is fine.|`|Pltwn7D3aa	Honey if you are size 4 your butt and legs are no where near big!!! Its impossible. I think you should re-evaluate your idea of your body. Try speaking with your parents, sisters or aunts or other family. The average size woman (18 years+) is size 12. That means that the norm is a size 12, and you are a size 4. Be thankful for what you have and don't stress on what you are not or don't have.|`|ypy1ikVDaa	u must be real young. Size 0 is sooo small. You are probably a bit more mature for your age. A size 4 is fine and its still small, just not skinney.  some people will never be a 0. I used to run 6 miles a day go on a major diet to where i was always hungary and the smallest i could ever get was 4/6. you are fine, trust me|`|T497f0iwaa	It may not be possible, unless you are short.  Think about it... How tall are these "size 0" friends?  My only friend who is a "size 0" is 5' tall, and she is also asian.  <br>  <br>  If you are size 4, you probably look very sexy!|`|4ea9f6105f9d3790c618010733218e62aa	A. How tall are you?<br>  B. If your friends wanted to rob a liquor store, would you? <br>  <br>  Best think to do is BE YOURSELF...dont be so size oriented. Yes, maintain a healthy diet but dont make yourself sick,|`|RTgMgT6baa	Swim a lot,walk a mile a day|`|EH7G8voyaa	Grow up|`|283tO9j9aa	Well, the best thing to do would be to stay healthy and ignore all the pressure from both sides.<br>  <br>  Personally I'm pretty damn offended by the people saying size 0 is ugly. I'm a UK size 6, which is the same as the US size 0 and that's because I'm short, I still have boobs and a backside. Some of us are just little damn it, how dare some of you assume that everyone is the same.<br>  <br>  Which brings me back to my answer. If you're tall, or you have wider hips, you'll never be a size 0 because that isn't right for your figure. If you try, you'll look worse than when you started because you'll be out of proportion and probably feeling like crap. You'll look much better wearing a size 4 and wearing clothes that suit you than you will trying to squeeze into a size or style which doesn't work for you.|`|yzTMKrfIaa	I agree with everyone who is encouraging you to feel good about your body. It's your body and can't be compared with anybody else's. Your tone is very scary, anorexia is a very real problem and this kind of thinking has a way of spiraling out of control.<br>  <br>  I would like to add that it might be a better idea to to focus on things that will help you become a better, happier person on the inside. What's the point of looking good on the outside if you're not happy on the inside. Take care of the inside and the outside seems to take care of itself as it should.<br>  <br>  And, if none of this is enough, it's a fact that the vast majority of people who diet end up gaining more weight after the diet. I believe that most people would not have weight issues if they had never, ever dieted.|`|kmAMgkiraa	It's really dumb to try and compete with your friends. Let her brag about it, she obviously has insecurities. Wanting to be a size 0 is an easting  disorder just waiting to happen. And guys don't like girls who look anorexic and are that thin. They like their girls to have a little meat on them! Hello J-lo and Beyonce, men melt over them. Remember that. :]|`|7fh3JCVxaa	if you have a tiny stomach and big hips and legs then you can really change that figure much. you can lose weight, but that figure wont change. but a lot of people love that body so yeah...<br>  but you should try just exercise, and buy a stepper to tone your legs.|`|TNTZkez8aa	personaly i think a girl who is size o is really ugly,  they have absolutely no shape and no one likes tht. u are better off staying a size 4 even tho tht is also a bit tiny. size 6 is absolutely perfect|`|TTt51jutaa	You need to stop trying to "compete" with your friends before you end up in some kind of anorexic hospital!

cgO5PviRaa	your hair is growing.  the problem is that its breaking off.  all of the styling damage you did before will keep causing you problems until it has grown out enough to be cut off.  besides straightening, try to avoid other things that can cause breakage.  this means let it air dry whenever possible, protect your hair from the sun, avoid chemical processing(color etc.), and avoid ponytail holders and barrettes with metal on them.  Deep conditioning can help strengthen your hair so it will not break so easily.  Instead of spending a fortune at the salon for deep conditioning treatments every week try an at-home deep conditioner.  Personally I really like aussie 3 minute miracle.  It does a good job, is reasonably priced, and keeps my hair soft and strong despite constant coloring.  Getting all of your split ends trimmed off will help too.  getting a hair cut may seem the opposite of what you want, but removing the most damaged part (at the ends) will help avoid further breakage and make it look much better.  I recommend a trim every 8 weeks or so, or whenever you start to notice any split ends.|`|JdkPNBuYaa	no, what determines hair growth is what you eat and how your body metabolizes it.  everything else lies to you.<br>  <br>  just eat lots of eggs and protien

YQxxVdLNaa	They're usually over $100. The best kind is the kind that lets you see. You can wear them even if you don't need them. The best for you is probably the kind that changes the color of your iris. You clean your hands and the lens, then you open your eye wide and push it lightly on your eye. If you poke yourself, it'll hurt. It takes practice to put it in and take it out without it dropping on the floor. Maybe the kind for astimatism because it won't irritate your eyes.
sojfRnxjaa	A good professional blow dryer is strong enough to straighten most curly hair. The most popular ones now days is the ceramic and tourmaline blow dryers. You can find them at the beauty supplies like Sally beauty supply or any others in your are that sell to the public and you don't have to have a license. Be sure to get a good shampoo and conditioner and styling products to protect your hair from excess heat while you're there.

sojfRnxjaa	You can tip up to 20% of the price of the service. It really depends on the results and how satisfied you are with the service. Just ask yourself some questions about the experience; did they meet your needs or exceed your expectations, did they spend enough time on you, did they give you a consultation to find out what your needs really are, did they rebook your next appointment and finally did they recommend products to maintain the style at home? If you can answer yes to all of these questions you found yourself a new hairdresser and you should tip them 20% if you can afford it. If not keep looking you will find the right one to fill all your hair needs, there's plenty of us out there.<br>  Martin|`|TiGk3pgDaa	I usually tip my hairstylist 15% of the price. So, if my haircut was 60 i'd tip her 9 dollars.|`|09xCfB9Faa	there is not a certain amount u should tip, if your happy tip just how much you think is approriate for the work and technicality of the wrok done xx|`|qFcI01GJaa	I don't think there is a specific amount, its entirely up to you,<br>  I always tip around a ￡1.00 or the most was ￡3.00 but that was because i was very happy with the style. <br>  I think they are grateful of a tip no matter how big or small but i say generally between ￡1 - ￡2 <br>  If you want to tip the stylist and the lady who washes your hair just give them a ￡1 each.<br>  But I don't think you should go mad and tip them lots.<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out well for you...<br>  :-D
H6AThdgWaa	Well I want to show you some jacket which are related into what you want. I think you can find that baseball-like jacket here <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c9yr83" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/c9yr83</a>|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	are you serious?<br>  I dont think Fry's jacket is supposed to be anything in particular.<br>  Most likely a red denim style kind of jacket... idk<br>  it's a cartoon for gods sake, they dont buy their costumes, they're drawn haha
EoAoMlXhaa	UR PEPE|`|DADV7cnpaa	well it's really up to you since it's your body and everything, but i think you should get a lip ring, snakebites are ok but personally i think that a lip ring on a guy looks waayyy hotter|`|BAPj9JW3aa	snakebites would look good!....like studs...not hoops..<br>  <br>  or an eyebrow piercing!|`|HosRSAnVaa	im thinkin snake Bites would look good|`|L5jjhYnNaa	SNAKE BiTES! <br>  I think there hot<br>  on anyone!|`|IWgQCYnOaa	I think snake bites would look alright that or a bridge

And OMG-I love your hair! It looks kind of like mine :P|`|sojfRnxjaa	Hair looks good straight or curly as long as it is healthy. Be sure to use the right products for your hair type and protect it from excess heat. Straight hair has a tendency to have a masculine look whereas curly hair can have a soft look and feminine too. Really it's preference and if it makes you feel confident and good about your self.|`|2uXdXMO9aa	yeah|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	the layers show up good when your hair is straight
BLQsD0w5aa	this is an easy 2 points|`|kUhcypC9aa	No :) x|`|dat8eoYyaa	fake and bake :)|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	wait, what?|`|EoAoMlXhaa	NO SE PORQUE|`|05OjWUyCaa	OMG!!!! How'd you know! You couldn't have seen my fingers! Where are you???!! I'm scared.....(hahaha)|`|qOzEuQofaa	WTF?!!|`|bPZlpe0taa	No
TC0LmbG4aa	Honestly I would say the eyes, hair color, and skin color all contribute. First off Asians have more narrow dark eyes, like a pure brown or even black color, with dark hair, and beautiful pale skin that is almost porcelain looking. <br>  To me that is that facial characteristics of an Assian.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|cb1s5U7Caa	from face???????i don,t think so i am 100%pure indian and also a hindu and i have greenish blue eyes and light brownhairs not onlly i their are many peoples in india,in lucknow ,u can't say only by  their face that they r asian but for chinese,japnese ,koreans i have to say that their face plays an important role to make their look asian.but u know i like guys belonging to these countries soo much|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	their eyes, hair texture(straight and shiny from what I've seen, jealous as hell haha), nose, and I guess skin color? though I've seen some pretty light asians, and really dark ones. I suppose it varies with regions they're in|`|XzXpDPpfaa	The bone structure, the hair, the eyes, the nose.|`|egXXgFAyaa	Epicanthic fold.|`|d2yhgGU6aa	definitely eyes. I'm 100% Caucasian and my friends make fun of me because I have short eyelids, like if i smile my eyes almost close.|`|EoAoMlXhaa	THERE SMALL PEEPEE|`|73Iasdntaa	I guess it's the whole package!|`|hKT5AGHeaa	most asian people have wide cheek bones and narrower eyes (actually soem have really bigs eyes) and a more flat nose. they hair is a give away and skin colour tends to be tinted a brown, white and yellow|`|HIShUwIuaa	there eyes are not normal they go up and listen to what they speak to people on the phone and there acent|`|f4ehvRQlaa	their faces!  :D|`|AA11285960	face bone structure, the eyes look different to me even on the "isolated asians" also every asian ive ever met has super dark eyes and straight, dark hair|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	I have no idea.. I mean, I get you.<br>  Even if their hair is dyed completely blonde or brown or whatever, including eyebrows and with colour contacts, you can still tell they're Asian.<br>  I think it's the eyes, but mostly the nose.|`|JEdP02Oeaa	the hair and the way the eyebrows grow and shape naturally.|`|2eab6NK2aa	Eyes,skin color and hair texture:D:D.Asian eyes are the most pretty and sexiest ever!!|`|WIurOBbDaa	It's the Asianess of it all...
8rmQx8wBaa	i think girls and guys both look good with a bit of a tan.<br>  <br>  answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj3IqVPVMzEbkZDYzK28Vm4Rxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223010645AAvbJgh">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|d511kNpraa	everybody in general does have different taste....<br>  some guys prefer natural...some dnt<br>  it all depends<br>  but i dsnt matter what the "guy" thinks of ur skin color every girl shoud be happy the way she is regardless what a guy thinks of her....:)|`|iqw0k3Mlaa	Tan babes are superfly:)|`|AA10953999	I absolutely hate fake tans. Anything natural is fine.|`|05OjWUyCaa	Like you have your opinion on guys with tanned skin, guys have their own opinions too. Everyone's attracted to different things. I think most girls think that guys what them to be tan but really I think alotta guys would rather you be yourself.|`|MwrRCxKGaa	i prefer my girls to look natural, so if that means pale then that's fine.<br>  All those girls running around So tan they look like a oopa loompa lol Very unattractive to me.|`|RZWiU7Jcaa	I like pale to a light pale tone not overly tan or too tanned.|`|G4Tvc8gHaa	I think everyone has different taste....|`|jYxSoKVvaa	dont forget the orange ones tooo......  and whatever looks great, not too over board or too scary..|`|SJLgRqgSaa	it depends, my man dont mind, but he hates it when i look orange and he says that i look like an oompa loompa and that he wont walk down the street with me lol!! xx|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	It really depends on what's natural to each individual. I like women with brown skin, black skin, or white skin. <br>  I don't like women who get fake tans. I'd prefer women to look as they look.<br>  In the same way that I wouldn't want Asian, black or Latino women to lighten their skin, I wouldn't want white women to darken theirs.<br>  We have one weird society when it comes to racism and racial identity.<br>  White women are often trying to darken their while many minority women are trying to lighten theirs.
F2rI3Juaaa	Hell Yes! Girl Power!|`|SJLgRqgSaa	i like hearing the sound when they hit the floor, it sounds nice, heels do make me feel very sophistatcted! but also i can feel just as sexy is flats xx|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	I love wearing heels|`|LSKeLOIGaa	I love wearing heels. They make me feel feminine, sexy, and strong. I like the sound too... except for when Im walking in the hallway to use the bathroom and I walk past a class and Im that chick thats causing the noise lol.|`|nwQDMP2caa	I'm a dude and they make girls much more sexier and as for power....they can have as much over me as they want!|`|AA11285960	yesss! i love the sound of my heels tapping on the floor...ever since my first pair of heels as a little girl.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Only when they have a nice 'click'.<br>  I hate heels which go 'clack'.|`|ml83MsMoaa	Not really, but considering my big sis says i walk like a dude sometimes, lol, maybe i'm not the right person to ask. But i will tell you though, when i wear high heels the clicking sound helps me keep a certain rhythm when i walk. I don't know if it makes me feel sexy or anything, but that rhythm does help to give me a confident stride.|`|mpmAncIVaa	Yes!<br>  That's one of the main reasons I love going to formal outings.<br>  I can't wear heals anytime else, <br>  on the account of I'm only 13 & I'll look skanky.:]]<br>  ahah.|`|wOGUL6v6aa	I agree with you 100%.  I am able to wear only one shoe with crutches so my cadence is less or slower, but I love the click.|`|6baa64727b51c64bae38424691f14768aa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  I dont know why but i feel stronger, more confident, and sexier.|`|HwWlGV1Baa	yup<br>  feels all sexy|`|aM1O65craa	not really. i just get this irresistible urge to go home...
oVxr5B3Eaa	I find everything on the ear to be about the same. Don't let the pain stop you, it's not something you should worry about. The human body has no memory of the feeling of pain, only the memory, so you'll remember thinking "hey, that hurt" but you won't be able to recall the actual feeling. Besides, if it DOES hurt, it will already be done by the time you can think about it hurting. Never let the pain stop you. <br>  No, it doesn't have to be a ring. Some piercings will make you start with one, but it depends on the piercers. Other piercers may make you start with a curved barbell. Just request what you want to get it done with. I usually see a barbell anyways. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CWR892dJaa	It all matters on your pain tolerance. If you dealt with your tragus you should be okay.
7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	I don't know if it so much as bothers me, but I would prefer nice-looking feet on women. But I'm a foot guy, so that shouldn't be a surprise I would say that.<br>  Yet, having said that, I wouldn't judge a woman on her feet. That's strictly a physical trait. Personality and temperament are far more important.<br>  Why do you think they're ugly?|`|AA10953999	I try not to look at anyones feet because I know if I do, I will be scarred for life lol|`|ziz0xURoaa	Get a toe ring, it'll up the attractiveness of your feet tenfold|`|EoAoMlXhaa	plastic surgery.......|`|8wjkHuOsaa	nope...<br>  foot its not essential in relationship..|`|HgiuxcaUaa	lmao your funny i like you|`|05OjWUyCaa	Haha I have the same problem...but I don't think many people pay too much attention to your feet because they have other features to focus on lol
mpmAncIVaa	Cute!<br>  It sounds like something I would wear.:]]|`|S4QBvAaGaa	I don't think you should wear the beret(With the red and yellow going on, it sounds like it would look out of place), and the flats sound like a gamble(Though, I haven't seen them, they sounds like they'd clash a bit with the yellow bags against all that dark), so it sounds like an okay outfit that could be improved.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|Fb11LZdOaa	Get a black bag yellow looks like poo. the first is good 2nd get in pink the 3rd get in black or blue|`|A1Ngt4peaa	yes, very cute! <br>  <br>  love the cardi - very stylish. <br>  im glad you said that the tanktop is gunna be navy because i wouldnt put pink & red together (the red shoes + pink top)<br>  <br>  they are nice colours and go together well. though, i wouldnt wear the beret without wearing another accesory the same colour. (maybe matching bracelet/bangle).<br>  just remember to stick to maybe 3 or 4 colours and your good :)<br>  <br>  x|`|AA10601526	It looks like a really cute outfit to me...except for I would maybe try and get the bag in red because the yellow and red together might look a little like a  mcdonalds sign|`|k2vvT6glaa	nicee <br>  <br>  but not too keen on the bag lol|`|t8Kjdn2Maa	I love itt :)<br>  <br>  the yellow bag actually looks really cool<br>  <br>  its pretty much a casual perfect outfit
X7DDlR1caa	Your a very pretty girl, you've got nice hair, try to smile showing your teeth :D <br>  You look innocent but i'm sure your not lol|`|AA10458195	It is pretty hard to tell but why do you worry so about your looks. Everyone is beautiful in their own way. Find your way.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Yeah your really pretty looking.Your very attractive looking maybe try a different hair style, and try using make-up to make yourself different looking, thou you dont need to chane your look as your are very nice.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	The picture is way too dark to even see her|`|wNZ95AK3aa	your very pretty i like your hair.i think your perfect the way you are
MAdFGBN8aa	I use exfoliating gloves. You can get them easily at supermarkets/chemists etc. I use them to put shower gel on and they are brilliant, but not every time I'm in the shower or I would end up with no skin left! And then I make sure I moisturise well afterwards.|`|be39ceb67f0fb5c751515b7be1fb2f56aa	Apricot Scrub... use every 2 or 3 days. I also use to exfoliate my legs before shaving. not too harsh, smells good and you can't beat the price. Found at local grocery stores, target, walmart etc.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	a loofah -cheap & convenient!  soak in a warm shower, exfoliate gently, and moisturize well.|`|5dMw30kMaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MichellePhan" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/MichellePhan</a> <br>  Look through her videos she has some really good innovative ideas for washing and moisturizing your skin :) Plus a lot of other good stuff!
9HtY062Kaa	I think your tattoo is awesome! Good choice.<br>  <br>  ...no idea if it is related to the eczema, though :\|`|rjac15O0aa	My guess is that the two are unrelated.  You said it yourself you had a break out in the usual place.  I would believe that it is an unrelated coincidence.  Treat the break out and the tattoo as two separate things.|`|MfIz3TPVaa	i have 2 tattoos  and i have not  had that problem but everyone is different|`|8TmK8Qklaa	tattooing your body isn't a healthy thing to do in the first place. Sounds like you had bouts with eczema before you should go to a dermatologist not your husband.<br>  He might be looking for a reason for you to stop tattooing your body.<br>  <br>  I know I would be|`|kCdISEGqaa	I've never heard of a tattoo causing a reaction to another part of the body.  I do know that the irritation from the tattoo can cause a breakout in the area the tattoo was applied.  If you have normal flare ups in the usual place, especially after four weeks, I would say they are unrelated.  Tattoos are usually healed after 4-6 weeks.
DMhAPurkaa	I do use Revlon in those shades<br>  The color is good, but the quality is less than my hair needs.<br>  It really is rough on my hair.<br>  I have had to change to L Oreal.<br>  Nice and Easy has better color rendering and is easier on the hair than Revlon.<br>  I d love to hear more about no harm to animals testing on hair colors, more info , please?

H6AThdgWaa	HI. Well, For what can I say is wear a clothes or an outfit which makes you comfortable in performing or find an outfit that suits for the kind of the occasions like what you've said in a concert. So, you must deal on an outfit that suits into the environment of the event. In deal also on the genre of the concert if it is Rock concert, pop, alternatives, etc. well, if it is a rock, the outfit you've telling about is great but Black is much powerful color in a concert.|`|Bp5THu35aa	u can wear dat very cute or dis.....<br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/rock_out/set?id=6765135" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/rock_out/set?id=...</a><br>  because its simple...but cute and dont worry its going to be fun i bet|`|J4qeaBDnaa	just go with what makes you feel good, im sure you will look good .|`|ogTM8gPEaa	c a s u a l .<br>  <br>  <br>  um, skinnys and a check shirt?|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	yeah that sounds really cute!<br>  Have fun!

ZxYxB9jCaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  I do not know whether you are a man or a woman...so I will tell you of stores for men/women/both...<br>  <br>  Some of the labels that I like are...<br>  <br>  -BEBE (cute shirts, tracksuits, jeans, and dresses)<br>  -ARMANI (Armani Exchange…love their shirts)<br>  -Ed Hardy (cute shirts and tracksuits)<br>  -MASIH DESIGNS and NIMANY have great Persian calligraphy designed shirts<br>  -Guess (great jeans)<br>  -Gucci (cute handbags and sneakers)<br>  -Ray-Ban (sunglasses)<br>  -H&M (very affordable clothing...great accessories)<br>  -Macys (carries a variety of labels)<br>  -Nordstrom (has lots of top label designs)<br>  <br>  …To put the look together, all I can say is that you should make sure that everything that you are wearing sends out ONE single message/attitude/mood…your LOOK should be ONE…a clean well prepared (ironed, etc.) outfit...there shouldn’t be any weird clashing of styles…think of a look that you are going for, and try to pick pieces that will send that message.<br>  <br>  …Hair is very important…again, I’m not sure if you are a man or a woman, but your hair should always look taken care of…if you are a girl, you could try straightening/curling it, and putting one of those small poofs in the front of your hair if you want...or you could get some cute bangs...its whatever you like…I am just telling you some of the styles that I like...just make sure that your hair looks healthy and shiny.  If you are a guy, then you could do whatever…I don’t know what kind of styles guys like…maybe a short mohawk/spiky look…not really sure.<br>  <br>  ...About the "posing"...just be yourself...if you want it to be "model" like, then I guess you could try posing in front of a mirror and deciding which look you like best...but you should stay away from "posing"...just be natural. <br>  <br>  However, the most important thing to make sure is that your LOOK is a clear representation of who YOU are…you should be comfortable in what you are wearing…when you are comfortable in your outfit, it doesn’t matter how simple or over the top it is…people will find it to suit you and it will look great on you...just be CONFIDENT.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

zqrBkVI4aa	Ok, usually for a mom, short hair is the way to go, like a bob or pixie. But if u like the longer styles, like me, i would try a shoulder lenght or shorter trim. u can get ur hair thinned out to, this makes it more managedable. also, get some bangs, about chin length, like swept bangs.<br>  <br>  like this: <a href="http://hairstyles.hairboutique.com/gallery/JenniferAniston014_600h.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hairstyles.hairboutique.com/galle...</a><br>  <br>  for the styling, you can curl your hair for a late nite out like this, <br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pictures-of-side-swept-bangs8.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <br>  or straightn is for easier management.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!|`|adyNCp6eaa	Maybe you could do something like cut it a few inches shorter,(like 3 or 4 inches), and get it angled to frame your face.

LCnVgsj4aa	sounds like you are on the right path. if i were you  i would  not use any more chemicals. make sure  you get regular trims. also use do grow products they wonders  use the whole family, shampoo, conditioner, leave - in conditioner, and scalp conditioner|`|5snO0Yngaa	Where do you get African pride Magical Gro Grease from? Sounds like it is working.<br>  Does it make your hair thicker too?|`|sojfRnxjaa	On an average hair grows a half inch a month, so depending on how long its been since you had a hair cut that should tell you. Your hair will continue to grow regardless of what you use on the outside of your scalp. The hair past your scalp is really "dead", so it really doesn't matter what you use as far as making it grow faster. The main thing is genetics and circulation. Your hair requires a good amount of stimulation on the scalp to get a good blood flow that will nourish your scalp and hair. Be careful though some product like mane and tail have ingredients that will coat your hair and can make it dull and limp. I hope this helps.

p5cwGQ88aa	definitely tighty whities and briefs man.  they are the way to go and are the new fashion out.  boxers are the lame thing to wear now.  me and my buddies (we all do sports) all wear briefs for underwear and when we hang out at eachother houses, we just hangout in our underwear.  we sometimes wear boxerbriefs too, but usually it is all about the briefs. and yes we are in highschool|`|gm3B6HLNaa	I wear briefs almost everyday, or boxer briefs.

Fb0wSA1Gaa	Since you have such pretty (sounding) eyes, just try to enhance those more. I have found that with colored eyes such as yours, a pretty light, kind of shimmery eye shadow looks best, such as a bone color or almost a gold. Also, use a little bit of blush in a very pinky undertone and use that on your cheekbones, but also slightly dust in on your T-zone. This will make it all blend in more. Also, I would suggest a pretty light pink on your lips, something subtule. And, ALWAYS use mascara! Good luck, and be pround of your light skin, I have it too! You just have to know how to work with it!|`|e6q6dXDraa	for your skinn, i recomend u a darker foundation... with a lighter powder...<br>  i have an aunt that does that, she i whiter than the damn wall lmao<br>  and make up, just use a casual eyelines mascara alittle bit of blush.<br>  <br>  and foundation!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dueces ;)|`|x4jORszyaa	color eye liner would probley look great you have black hair so you could even go for liquid eyeliner maybee a deep purple and no eyeshadow with the bright eye liner line your top lid with the bright color and bottom with black.

331512b4169f8467fd51d17e965e5784aa	Ok, if you say you have pale skin you have two choices - either choose colours that contrast with your skin and your eye/hair colour like deep purple, dark brown, slate grey or you could choose slightly toned-down colours like pale pink, rock rose, light blue. The colours you wear or the accessories for that matter, must be suitable to your personality also. <br>  <br>  Many a time we do notice people who dress like Captain Jack Sparrow or the Pied Piper but they look great because mix and match works for them and they can carry it off. If you feel you can't carry off certain things even if you like the colour - avoid it. You can of course choose to accessorize lightly with these colours. For e.g. if you like red but you don't feel confident carrying off red shoes or a red shirt, wear a denim ensemble and maybe that could have a red piping along the sides or just a red felt rose somewhere, something like that.<br>  <br>  The colours you choose should suit your lifestyle, personality and also the occasion- please don't show up in a red number on your graduation party. I'm not trying to be rude, just practical. Silver jewellery will look great as long as you keep the trinkets along with your dressing style. For e.g. I wear chunky jewellery in a variety of mediums from silver, glass to acrylic and it suits me because I wear it with fusion wear- a long gypsy skirt with a short top and a chunky bead necklace. But style is individual so..... <br>  <br>  Ask around - your friends will tell you what suits you best.|`|jxPr6dd4aa	yeh yeh, red and darker colours methinks =)

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	I am a totally flat footed person. My only problem is shoes with  a high arch and I have an exceptionally wide foot. I have to modify with inserts because puts pressure on arch. Other than that I have done lots of long distance hiking and have been a long distance runner and an outstanding sprinter. It has not handicapped me in any way. I think all the exercise has lifted my arches slightly. You can never lift an arch with inserts.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	my sister has flat feet too. it's actually a problem with the tendons in your feet that cause it, and if you dance or run track it can cause serious problems. My sister has been going to physical therapists and doctors to see if she can avoid surgery but since she is so young they have been making her wear inserts in all of her shoes that have an arch to try fixing her feet that way.|`|9794VMZ9aa	When I was younger, my feet were flat-footed too. I had to wear arched trainers and stuff for a few years until my foot wasn't so flat anymore. It used to hurt when I wore flat sandals and trainers, basically any shoe, but now I don't feel a thing.<br>  <br>  You can get tons of flip-flops with flat soles! Just browse your local shoe store. In fact, I've only ever seen a few pairs of flip-flops with arches!|`|6ed13da024a2998766d229239b4edae6aa	I have a friend who is flat footed. What you can do is to buy those shoes that has an arch(i forgot whats its called. starts with B) and try to wear it as much as you can. It may feel uncomfortable at first but you'll get used to it ! :D In time, hopefully your foot wont be so flat.
2AJmAD0Xaa	Beauty is as beauty does. The inward personality is much more important than outward looks. If your heart is clean and you radiate loving thought and above all else have smiling friendly look on your face you can be very ugly and folks will see your beauty. On the other hand if you have a flawless complexion and figure but bitterness and unkind things come out of your mouth you will change the perception that people have of you and the glamour they might  have seen will be cancelled out. Good looks helps but it is not everything|`|OTIa819uaa	I suppose it depends on what you want to improve on.<br>  One overall way to improve your looks is to eat healthy, exercise, and drink things like green tea which does wonders for your skin.<br>  Other things that I would suggest are proper skin care ( you can go to any make up professional at the mall and they can help)<br>  Proper hair care ( go to a salon that knows what they are doing)<br>  Healthy eating ( ask a professional or get some books with meal plans in them)<br>  Exercising ( staying active is a requirement for looking and feeling good) <br>  If you have anymore questions or if you could be more specific in what parts you want to improve I could help a lot more :) Good luck!<br>  <br>  liz<br>  lizzej007@yahoo.com|`|OUtYUT8daa	feel confident. thats really it.<br>  <br>  I used to be so horrible with myself.

agRLoU9naa	Body lotion is lighter in terms of moisturising. While moisturiser is more oily and thicker, like cream.<br>  <br>  Moisturisers lock more moisture than body lotion.|`|SVM8uJACaa	I suppose a moisturizer is a type of lotion. That is, at least most moisturizers are lotions... but many lotions are not moisturizers. You can have aloe lotions, sunscreen lotions, medicated lotions, even dehydrating lotions or acne lotions, designed to remove excess moisture or oil from the skin!

The whiter your skin was the richer you were.<br>  <br>  Times have now changed and the modernization of the planet has wiped out that theory. Now days the richer you are, the more you can afford to go abroad to hot climates, such as safari in Africa or extreme sports in New Zealand in these hot climates, it is very sunny and people generally pick up a nice tan on the beach, whilst poor people sit there inside big factories pale as ghosts.<br>  <br>  So really that's where the tradition of being tanned comes from- they say the more tanned you are, the richer you are- it is very much a status thing. <br>  <br>  Another small reason why modern day girls do it, is that some men find it attractive, i myself think that a nice tan does look sexy :P<br>  <br>  Hope i Helped =]|`|IalXpm7Uaa	I think the answer to this is kinda obvious.. <br>  Flick open a magazine, and what is on the first few pages?

I've never actually seen a very fair Victorias Secret model.<br>  <br>  I think that's why, because tanned girls are all that's advertised these days.|`|cGRVB6N9aa	Because people are sheep.

Gew6pZhbaa	I've been straightening my hair on a daily basis for years now, and my hair is very healthy because I take extremely good care of it. First off, don't forget the most important thing of all, trim your hair every 4-8 weeks to keep the dead away and keep it looking and feeling healthy. I recommend using L'Oreal Vive Hydra Gloss shampoo and conditioner. They're designed for dry/damaged hair and add tons of moisture without weighing hair down. They cost about $2.84 at Walmart, but you can usually find $1.00 of coupons in the Sunday paper. Next, use a leave in conditioner, like VO5, on your ends. I've found that using it all over can weigh hair down too much. It shouldn't cost more than $3.50 at Walmart. Don't forget to use a heat protecting spray. TRESseme makes a good one for about $3.84. Don't worry about what other people say about not styling your hair every day. You look at salon stylists, as well as celebrities, and they're hair is healthy and fine. Just because they have professional products doesn't mean it doesn't do damage, you just have to be sure you keep your hair moisturized and healthy, and you'll be fine!|`|Yb9Adbseaa	I straighten mine all the time and it isn't damaged because I use products for damaged hair for prevention! First I wash it with shampoo for damaged hair then I put a conditioner for 3 minutes and once a week I put a mask for damaged hair ! So basically just buy a shampoo conditioner and mask for damaged/dry hair and before you fry it put on spray that prevents damaging from the heat spray it on! And don't worry if you take care of it straightening isn't bad at all it's nice you take care of the way you look! O yea and every 6 weeks go and cut split ends and ask for them to put some deep conditioning or something professionally tell them you straighten your hair every day! lol I'm sorry it's so long!|`|pA1M2HSoaa	i know showering and blow drying my hair right after makes it straight and thats not as bad for your hair as straightenening it. also they have a buch of healing and strengthening shampoos and stuff|`|Ky9wKmzuaa	CHI. you can get it at walmart & its sold at hair places.|`|adyNCp6eaa	First of all, straightening your hair IS bad for your hair, so just STOP STRAIGHTENING IT! Why dont people listen when somebody tells them that something is bad?!? If someone told you that this medicine makes your eyes the most beautiful eyes in the world, but you would lose your vision within 2 years, would you take it? I certainly wouldn't. Is it really worth it? Anyways, some ways to help with DEAD hair is by cutting maybe an inch off to get rid of the split ends, and use herbal essences hello hydration shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair look great and hydrates it beautifully, although NOT straightening my hair helps A LOT too...Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Use Sebastians hair product or John Frida's and get the heat protectant (or any other products heat sealer I just like those) and make sure to deep condition your hair if you wash it daily twice and rinse with really cold water.
adyNCp6eaa	I've heard that if you use clean and clear on your hair it makes it lighter. My sister tried it and she said it even made your hair shiny.|`|09xCfB9Faa	go out in the sun and use lemon on your hair. x|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Why not? Even natural stuff damage your hair just as bad as color does. Lemon Juice has acid in it, Sun in is basically peroxide...The only thing that doesn't damage, is the Sun, itself. But it probley won't make it blonder.|`|AA12185428	Just being in the sun a lot seems to do the trick, but have been known to add some lemon juice to speed up the process.|`|N15Io74Iaa	if you want them on the top wear a pony tail and play a sport around 3 ish daily, if you are consistent its will highlight, it worked for me;)|`|JKERXFuiaa	wash your hair normally and then comb lemon juice through it.<br>  then just sit out in the sun and let it dry naturally.|`|sojfRnxjaa	Wow, there are several ways to lighten your hair without permanent hair color. First you have to know exactly what your target shade really is. By target shade, I mean how light do you want to go. Realistically you can only lighten maybe one half a shade at a time with organic lighteners. It may require several applications to reach the desired shade. Be sure to condition your hair with the right conditioner for treated hair. One natural lightener is lemon juice and heat or sun. Another is chamomile which comes in different forms such as shampoo or  powder you just either shampoo with it several times, not necessarily in one sitting but over a period of time. The other way is to use it in a paste form and add heat or sun and you'll see some difference. Don't be unrealistic dark hair takes a lot longer to lighten then light hair. Don't forget to condition your hair and use a mild shampoo. Once you reach your target shade the last thing you want is a dry frizzy mess.|`|INwbf37Vaa	try using products made for blonde hair, such as sunsilks blonde shampoo and conditioners  this is meant to bring out the natural highlights in your hair, also V05 has a blonde brightening cream<br>  x|`|SVM8uJACaa	Here you will find lot of Hair Care Tips<br>  <br>  Find which one actually works for you.<br>  <br>  Have a look:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://xrl.us/beg73j" rel="nofollow">http://xrl.us/beg73j</a>|`|TiGk3pgDaa	buy sun-in and go outside for like 30 min a day or something.
x5Zf7lQLaa	Last July, I had a septoplasty, which is very similar to a rhinoplasty.  The recovery from that was the most miserable I've been in my life.  I didn't breathe out of my nose, but that's because I just couldn't, as my nose was completely stopped up.  I'm not sure there was really anything I found that helped me get better faster...<br>  <br>  However, if you get some nasal saline spray, that can make you a little more comfortable, especially if you are breathing through your nose.  The kind I'm talking about is in a metal pressurized can, not just the little bottle you squeeze.  So get that kind, or there's this stuff called Ayr Saline Nasal Rinse, and you can mix it up yourself, its probably cheaper that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your recovery!  I hope you get feeling better fast!!
Gew6pZhbaa	It won't fade because you straightened it, but it will fade after washing it. Since black dye is just a pigment, it doesn't do much damage, so straightening it shouldn't hurt. Just be sure to stay away from gel or hairspray, as they tend to contain alcohol and other ingredients that will eat away at the dye.|`|lXNVhMiaaa	Whenever you dye your hair - do whatever else you are going to do first, then give your hair a couple of weeks to recover.  <br>  <br>  Example - perm or straightening hair - do it before you color.  This according to my stylist. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question.  Yes - Fade and damage.  Your hair will not fall out, but remember next time to do it in the reverse order and give your hair time to recover in between.  Good luck!|`|1LIGgy0naa	First and most important you should never ever do a double chemical process within a day of each other. You must allow at least 2 weeks b4 attempting 2nd process. By doing anything different you take the risk of not only damaging your hair really badly but losing the hair entirely or in patches.|`|Id4PlUpaaa	It will fade the colour ALOT i did it before lol|`|UlBryfIoaa	I have done it before with dark brown and it didn't do anything to the color.

4kIDqJCwaa	One on right is innocent. One on left is the ****...see through dress|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	From your photo i would guess that the second girl is the one on the left-the brunette. The only reason I'm assuming it is her is because she is wearing a see-through dress. you can see her panties pretty clearly and she doesn't look concerned...so either she doesn't know or she is trying to draw attention to herself. The blond is wearing more modest clothing so she appears to be the more innocent of the two...they are both wearing rings on their left ring finger|`|eHUXcYZhaa	You've got issues.|`|kUhcypC9aa	Well the first time I glanced at the photo I thought the slutty one would be the one on the right, purely because of what she is wearing but when I looked for a bit longer I changed my mind. This is because the girl on the lefts face looks still quite fresh and innocent and she actually looks good in what she is wearing. Most girls wouldn't get away with it but she is carrying it off and looks great.<br>  <br>  The one on the right is also very pretty but she has something hidden behind her smile, a little twinkle in her eyes which is a bit cheeky and makes me think that she is the one who sleeps with the guys!!<br>  <br>  Both girls are pretty and have some class and I hope whichever one the **** is, looks after herself but has her fun along the way because she is asking for trouble!! :) x|`|D0ShtJJJaa	I honestly think it's the lady on the left<br>  Why?<br>  She is wearing a kind of see-through dress also the women on the right doesn't look like she would do that type of thing also by the way she dresses you can tell<br>  <br>  :)|`|EiX4L2xQaa	I would say the one on the right who is the mother of the girl on left,she is just having fun and enjoying her freedom after a bitter divorce|`|f4ehvRQlaa	the one on the left looks better!  :D|`|yfMmr7uGaa	I would think that the one on the left is the innocent one because she is more beautiful and looks like she can be happy with a single man<br>  The one on the right looks kinda not that nice and looks like the type that will have sex with many men and not be satisfied|`|hpgIe6rvaa	Easy..........the girl on left with see threw dress is the innocent one,<br>  the lady on the right,likes to have a good time!! <br>  you can see it in their eye`s, also just because someone wears a sexy dress, it doesn`t mean they are mad for it!!|`|hSaLWg74aa	They look like mother and daughter!!<br>  The blonde being the mother, that is!|`|5cKkUyoEaa	cant judge a book by its cover|`|dlaS6e7zaa	wow..|`|5c2tW6d4aa	It looks like the one on the left is innocent but she probably isn't|`|7ozcEEg5aa	Erm... <br>  <br>  Is one of the giirls in the pic you?

f1lpdiNEaa	Use a shampoo for blonde highlighted hair. Perhaps even a purple shampoo which keeps blonds bright (but check this with your hairdresser first). If swimming don't get your hair wet as the chlorine from the water will give your hair that greenish colour. You might need another trip to the hairdressers to dye the blond slices again and get them back to normal.|`|e8wAggo9aa	the answer above is NOT a good idea the chances of your hair turning a nice, EVEN color is slim.<br>  <br>  if your swimming in pools, the chlorine is turning it green. if so get some shampoo that protects against that.<br>  <br>  <br>  if thats not the case, you should get it fixed (either yourself or by the salon), and then after that buy a good shampoo for colored hair. it really keeps highlights or dye bright and pretty, and it wont dull.|`|VpGLZn8zaa	you need to wash your hair with a dark purple shampoo three times a week|`|adyNCp6eaa	My friend had the same problem, although that was because she didnt clean her pool, and the stuff from the pool got in her hair and it wouldnt come out. Just make sure you wash your hair thoroughly, if that doesnt work then maybe you used a cheap brand of hair dye, and maybe you need to use a better brand to dye over the green. Hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|09xCfB9Faa	go to your hairstylist your hair shouldnt be goin green and ask for advice and you may also be entitled to a free treatment. but a suggestion is to use a shampoo for blonde hair the best ones are from loreal *shine blone* xx|`|DMhAPurkaa	Okay this is common<br>  I suggest not doing any more color to fix it<br>  because I bet your color is lovely, it is just doing it s greenish haze thing<br>  to fix this, use a shampoo that is blue ish or lavender ish to corect the color.<br>  Just look in the gray hair section and get a silver shampoo.You can open the bottle and see it is a purplish or bluish shade.<br>  This will correct the color in your hair. Just use it a couple times and the blonde should perk up. If you use it too much, the blonde will take on an ash look. A cool /as opposed to warm..look.<br>  So if it starts looking too ash/cool, just back off that shampoo.<br>  There is also some stuff called " Bluing" in the laundry section. In the old days, they used to add it to their white laundry to brighten, lighten, whiten the look of the light colored things. You may see older women who use too much have like bluish hair or purplish... it is being used Too Often in that case. This is good just as an occasional use deal, just to perk it up. Use it too much and you get a bulidup of it in the hair shaft and the color cant shine through good enough. Just back off, it will lighten up.<br>  If you use a blonde highlight shampoo, it may lighten your brown hair, and while it lighten s up the blonde, it can also dry it out. Some of these blonde shampoos have peroxide of some strength in them. <br>  If you get the bluing you add it ; a tiny bit to your vinegar rinse, or to water rinse,... if you add it to your shampoo, then you will be adding it to your hair every time and that won t be necessary. If you add it to your conditioner, again, every day will be too much. You just need a little to bump it up. The bluing is very dark, so add a tiny bit to some water or vinegar ( for shine) you can keep this in your shower in like maybe an old honey bear squeeze bottle.<br>  Notice Downey is bluish or purplish? It helps your clothes look whiter and brighter.<br>  I had a friend who used Doney on her wigs, but I have n t tried it on real hair .|`|YN0DdLVlaa	It sounds a bit weird but put some tomato ketchup on it for about 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Use a shampoo and conditioner that enhances blonde tones.

6npsRIzUaa	Ouch,  sounds like it ripped a little, possibly slightly infected. Treat it gently like a brand new piercing again, and if it doesn't start looking better by next week I'd have it checked by your piercer.<br>  <br>  And ugh at these other answers, cleaning a piercing with antiseptic or peroxide? No. Bad idea. Sea salt soak the piercing about 3 times a day, unless your piercer recommends otherwise, and if you're in a rush (or just impaitent) H2Ocean spray works wonders for piercings, just make sure you still wipe it with a q-tip at least once a day, so crusties don't build up on it.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Speak with the piercer, if you still have access to him or her. If you don't, go to the nearest tattoo and piercing parlor and speak with the piercer there. It may be nothing, but it also may be a sign of an infection (the piercing itself likely tore, which increases risk of bacteria entering the wound).|`|eWEqGHvJaa	You should use peroxide to clean out the puss that is in it.

GZKbvXLLaa	Let me fill you in on a few things. Calgel is crap made in Japan. Biosculptre is a joke. You are going to need a nail technician's license to purchase professional products in the first place. Look,playing around with acrylic nails - on yourself is one thing. Playing with UV gels is quite another. And my guess is that you have not had even one minute of formal training, right? Lots of things can go wrong. Why put yourself at risk? Leave it to the pros. Just my opinion...

kCdISEGqaa	It's going to hurt, don't let anyone tell you it won't.  As for the mole, no, we don't tattoo over moles.  They can get lost and forgotten over time because of the tattoo, and it's best to keep them as is just in case they change texture or color, becoming potentially cancerous.  About your design, be careful, small letters in fancy writing don't age well.  Even with the advances in ink and machines, they still fade with time and show poorly.  Make sure your artist is experienced, if they go to deep it could scar, if they don't go deep enough, it will fade faster than normal.  Tattoos like that sound simple, but, artists should take special care to make sure they are done right.|`|BzbCgFGMaa	It's hard to answer everyone asks this but everyone is different in one place a person might hardly feel it but for another person it could be really painful in that place.<br>  <br>  Since your tattoo is only small even if its painful it wont take long so it should be ok :)<br>  <br>  And it feels like a needle going in and out of you over and over again and for the colour they hold the needle in you for a bit longer :)<br>  <br>  They can tattoo over your freckles but not over your mole without it looking stupid.your tattoo artist if he is good will advise you not to get a tattoo over a mole as it wont look good.<br>  <br>  Good luck hope your tattoo turns out great!|`|Acp0aIaHaa	I'm not gonna lie, it hurts.

Have you ever scratched yourself and its gone all raised? Well it hurts like one of those.<br>  <br>  The worst part is when they first touch your skin but you get used to it really quickly.|`|wjGj6uU3aa	it feels like having needles poked in and out of your skin. over and over|`|MtDEf9zxaa	Consider getting it on the other wrist if the mole is in the way.  If it is a freckle then it won't matter (freckles are just colored skin, moles actually stick out of the skin).  Tattoos hurt, needles hurt, plain and simple.  I actually have a huge fear of needles but I actually don't associate that fear with tattooing.  Not saying that I'm a big fan of getting tattoos either cuz I have a low pain threshold.  My advice to you is to try not to associate needles with the tattooing process, and then remember, it is going to hurt for a while, but then it won't hurt anymore.  Little bit of pain now (or a whole lot) and a pretty picture on your wrist later.  Just keep thinking of the end product the whole time.|`|h3s02b3Jaa	I had one done by my ankle and it didn't really hurt at all. But I think where you have it done depends on how much pain. I would think the outside of the wrist would be about the same. They should tell you about the freckle, have seen questions like that on here, and quite a lot of people seem to have the tattoo's over them with no problems.<br>  With a name, which is very personal, hope it's not a boyfriend, because if you break up you will be left with this on show for good. I like tattoos, but you have to live with them for a long time, so make sure you have thought it through for the future.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	It will hurt like hell, but not as much as it'll hurt in 20 years time when you bitterly regret having the tattoo done and can't afford to have it removed.<br>  <br>  No, moles can't be tattooed over! That's a sure recipe for (a) pain, (b) lots of blood, (c) a very bad looking tattoo, (d) skin cancer.|`|MpoQljzOaa	it only hurts a bit and that is only when the neddle is in the skin when it is out it doent hurt and about the freckle as long as it is not raised it should be fine<br>  <br>   hope this helps|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	A tattoo that small won't hurt at all and it will be over in about 10 mins.

SpcYCBndaa	The source that popularized this pictorial maxim is a 17th century carving over a door of the famous Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō, Japan. The maxim, however, probably originally came to Japan with a Tendai-Buddhist legend, from China in the 8th century (Nara Period).<br>  <br>  In Chinese, a similar phrase exists in the Analects of Confucius: "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety" (非禮勿視， 非禮勿聽，非禮勿言， 非禮勿動).[1] It may be that this phrase was shortened and simplified after it was brought into Japan.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|euZRbiA2aa	Sometimes they use 4 wise monkeys,the other one is do no evil.Use the 4 to be different,<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_...</a>|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Are you going to have pictures of the three monkeys holding their hands over their eyes, mouths and ears.

pRK5nXaLaa	A smooth paste of turmeric, gram flour, curd, honey and rose water is really effective I use it regularly. But just remember these points:<br>  1) The amount of turmeric should only be a pinch of it for a tea spoon of gram flour.(otherwise u might turn yellow in Colour n the colour would come off on to your cloths as well)<br>  2) Use this at night.( the pack unclogs ur pores etc so even when u wash it off wen it is dry it still works on ur skin, so the best time is night, let it work while u r asleep.)<br>  This is the best way of getting your color back.

ocD7VFtWaa	Alcohol is useful to disinfect and clean because it kills bacteria. It can be dabbed onto spots but doesn't actually heal anything, it just sterilises wounds and stops them from getting infected. So on acne marks it wouldn't do anything good because the infection is gone, and you have skin that has already healed but healed imperfectly, leaving a scar. <br>  Tea tree oil does have antiseptic properties but again, only use a tiny, tiny amount on "live" spots because it can cause scarring, being very harsh.<br>  Products that contain tea tree wouldn't damage your skin, but you can bet the other ingredients are the ones doing the healing, not the tea tree, which is better as an antiseptic than a healer.<br>  Don't use anything harsh or acidic on scars.<br>  Honey and royal jelly are good for healing skin but to be honest I would try to find a product that is designed exactly for acne scarring.<br>  I know la roche posay do a few creams that are for scars, I think they are designed for after plastic surgery but the function is the same.<br>  Also, in my local chemist I buy a moisturiser by Ictyane that does a version for acne scars.<br>  It's a french company so I don't know how available it would be in the Uk.<br>  A dermatologist would really be your best bet as they can tell you what to put on your face to get the best results instead of risking layering more products on that may damage your skin.<br>  If you have the money, you can also get non-surgical procedures like laser that can remove scarring, stretch marks and all sorts of things.<br>  Probably expensive in the UK...|`|hbIPsBrIaa	Aloe vera has been shown in clinical studies to have a positive effect on wound healing and holds anti-inflammatory properties. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  As stretch marks start out as microscopic tears in skin layers due to overstretching of the dermis, aloe vera helps heal these small wounds without causing scar tissue to form, effectively preventing the appearance of stretch marks. Aloe vera has been used for thousands of years by the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Indians and Chinese to decrease the appearance of scars and to moisturize and heal skin. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  This extract from the aloe leaf protects skin from environmental factors and promotes skin regeneration.|`|kYcBVmRMaa	nahh sorry lil mizz it doesnt fade till 24 hours after and if u had loads u will have a hangover the next day so before you go 2 bed take 2 paresetamol and then when u get up take another 2 it washes it out of ya system|`|TUiT6uhpaa	No..it dries your skin completely out|`|dfhBAv0Zaa	naw put peroxide on your face|`|rHKW1CJJaa	no... i find that stuff is way to harsh and works against your bodys natural healing. try things like tea try oil (make the discoloration peel off) but remember, it also depends on how severe your scars are|`|Hrky2Tigaa	You really should look at this

HWlN2TqCaa	Usually on beauty products where the ingredients are there is a little picture of what looks like a jar of face cream with a number next to it.

So, for example, the Urban Decay palette can stay on a Sephora shelf for a very long time and it won't expire because no one has opened the package to use it. Same thing with powders, lipglosses, eyeliners, Blush, etc. <br>  <br>  Mascaras, Foundations and Concealers are another thing. If they don't sell within a certain amount of time, then I believe they are sent back to the manufactoring company (if no one buys them on sale) because of the ingredients they have. <br>  <br>  <br>  The expiration clock starts ticking when you first start using the product.|`|c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	Once you have started using the eyeshadow, it should be tossed after 18 months.  The pot to face to pot action puts bacteria into the makeup, and it can give you some problems.<br>  <br>  Mascara, by the way, should be tossed after 3 months.

gqopFVeyaa	The problem is that there are lots of lip balms that are supposed to be super medicated and good for you, but they are mostly made of the same things and rarely work for the extra-hard cases. You could go to Bath and Body or somewhere similar, and try the lip scrub or related products, but those can be expensive (some are more than ten dollars for a little bottle) and you have no guarentee it works, so it may be a waste of money. <br>  <br>  Maybe since you know what works, the answer isn't try something new, it is make what you have work for you. What you could do is, get one of those little tins of lip gloss, spoon some of it out, then mix the Vitamin E into it. It would be time consuming and you would probably need a box worth of Vitamin E if not more, depending on how strong a solution you will need, but on the other hand, you said nothing else works, and this is a good way to disguise it, as well as add some color to your lips if you choose a balm you like.|`|AtjlmByAaa	The only best for chapped lips I know is petrolium jelly.

So if you lick your lips, you are putting digestive juices on your flesh, and it will start to break down your lip tissue.<br>  Try to avoid licking the lips. The cocoa butter will seal in the moisture, and the myrrh will heal them. It will take time and you will have to keep doing this, or the same problem will come back.<br>  To start this process, you might want to exfoliate ( yep) your lips first so they can start to absorb the healing. You can use a teaspoon or less of sugar in your palm, and pour a little olive oil on top of the sugar.<br>  Rub this onto your mouth area.<br>  It looks funny, but it works. Sugar has something called Glycolic Acid naturally in it, that will help get off all the dead cells. <br>  You can use salt on the feet.<br>  Salt is astringent, so it will dry your lips too much .<br>  Olive oil and coconut oil is very healing.Rub it on your lips every chance you get.<br>  You can buy an avocado and rub that on your lips, or use it like a mask on your mouth.<br>  An avocado has a very nutrient filled oil in it, very nice for cuticles and any tender area needing emollients, however, they are 250 to 300 calories each, so not good to eat them. I recommend external only. <br>  Hey, good job taking such good care of yourself and losing the weight and all !<br>  Be well!

3EHsDqY3aa	My hairdresser told me one sure way to strip your hair of color (in an instance very similar to yours!) was to use baby shampoo.  Baby shampoo is much higher in alkalinity than normal shampoos, and will take some of the color out of your hair!  Just remember to use a good conditioner following the baby shampoo!  :D  Good luck!|`|Twq7efhQaa	Those natural home remedies won't do a thing to get rid of black, sweetie. I'm a hairstylist, take it from me--go to a salon. <br>  <br>  Firstly, by coloring your hair black, you have already "taken out" your natural color. It's gone, kiss it goodbye. Now let's work on the bright side and keep a positive attitude here. This isn't the end of the world.<br>  <br>  Never, EVER do a major hair color change before a big event. Lesson learned, I won't drill that one into you any further.<br>  <br>  The only, I reapeat, ONLY way to get black out is to have it stripped or bleached out. Then your stylist can add color to it to get it to a color that you want.<br>  <br>  The GOOD NEWS is that you have only applied one round of black to your hair. It should come out fairly easily! It's when you've been coloring it black for months or years that the color becomes very difficult to remove. Since you've only colored it once, I bet after one bleach or stripping session, you'll have removed almost all of it. <br>  <br>  When the stripper is rinsed off, you'll look a dull and rather spotty shade of light brown or blonde or even reddish. Don't expect your natural haircolor to come shining back. Then your stylist will have to tone the color to get somethign close to what you want. <br>  <br>  It will cost between $150.00 to $200.00 not including tip ( i recommend a $20.00 tip--she'll be working on you all day). But it's worth every penny.<br>  <br>  Do not go into the salon with a perfect vision of getting your old hair back. Just work with what your hair gives you and make your only goal to get the black out. Then go from there with your stylist.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, it's simply not true that your hair will be damaged beyond repair when you bleach it. There are many good innovations going on to make color stripping not near as bad as it used to be. <br>  <br>  After you have it done (it will take all day, so pack a lunch and clear your schedule), deep condition it with a salon brand conditioning treatment or something of the like. Sleep with baby oil in your hair the first night. Even if it comes out with breakage or damage, you can still tame it for prom night with a good stylist and plenty of good product and curling/flat irons.<br>  <br>  Calm down--this can be fixed with something you're happy with. Let us know how it turns out!
IupDRUKnaa	Yes, i have this. I think its Normal.<br>  Its nothing big to worry about though. <br>  I Just cover it up with a consealer stick.<br>  Unless you like it, then Leave it how it is.<br>  =]|`|XaE4zDRVaa	Lucky you, envy of everybody, you have natural eye shadow, while the rest of us have to apply.
lU8e0VQFaa	It can take up to 12 months for a navel to fully heal, so if it's not painful, swollen, irritated or anything else just a little dry, I'd say you're fine. The piercer may have put it in too shallow but it isn't rejecting, rejection is painful and pretty obvious when it's happening (plus once rejection starts there is NO way to stop it, so ignore any one who says you can). Most likely, you're just drying it out by using the dial soap, never use the stuff my self and all my piercings healed perfectly fine. I would say stop using it and pick up some pure Vitamin E oil and just use a q-tip to gently put a little around where it's dry, cover it with a band aid if you want so that you don't get oil every where. <br>  <br>  After a few days it should be perfectly fine but if it was pierced shallow you'll want to keep an extra close eye on it for as long as you have it because that can increase the risk of rejection.|`|894fcfdea3cb1ddf4477cdd7464742dfaa	maybe your allergic to real gold|`|1h5RpINNaa	It sounds like your body is reacting to the gold ring.  Mine does the same thing when I put gold in.  Try going back to the original ring and see if it corrects its self.  Make sure to keep it there for a least a couple of days.|`|mZYzdQ2taa	If its cheap gold it probably contains nickel which can cause a reaction. Its winter, everyones got dry skin, try using lotion and if its still irritating you, try switching to a hypoallergenic ring or just take it out.|`|VlxBs9zyaa	take it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
QCkRRqVwaa	You can buy a tux, or you can rent a dress. <br>  A wedding dress symbolizes a lot, though, and women don't usually want a used one.|`|RJyhnT8jaa	Because women want the dresses and guys don't really care, we just were them once so we don't need to buy them|`|sLGehA4raa	Some would say it involves alterations. In truth, tuxedos do require tailoring, but that doesn't stop men from renting ill-fitting ones anyway. <br>  <br>  Second, the distinction between a tuxedo and a suit is unbreakable. The lines are more blurred with women's clothing, given that a woman could wear a cocktail dress to events where men could be in anything from blazers and open-necked shirts to black tie. Thus, a dress could arguably be more versatile. If a man plans only to rent twice in his life, renting might be a bit more economical. (Three times, though, and he should buy.)<br>  <br>  Third--and this is the big one--all two-button notch-lapel tuxedos look alike. There are differences, yes, but even a one-button peak lapel and a 6x2 double-breasted shawl collar are pretty similar. Conversely, the differences between two prom dresses are obvious even to someone who knows nothing about clothing. While men's formalwear emphasizes uniformity, women's formalwear emphasizes difference. A dress rental store would have to stock hundreds of dress models to accomplish the same thing as a tuxedo rental store that carries half a dozen. Unfortunately, rental shops still haven't given up on convincing men that they can stand out by wearing bright colors and strange designs. Always think: What would James Bond do?<br>  <br>  Fourth, think medically. By junior prom, girls tend to have finished their growth spurts, while many men are still growing. Buying a tuxedo wouldn't be practical.<br>  <br>  All that said, I bought a tuxedo for my senior prom, and it's already paid for itself compared to renting, not to mention the advantages of tailoring.|`|t0Xdw5gxaa	the truth is that girls can rent dresses if they like, its just that they don't want to wear a dress that someone has already worn. Not that all girls are germs freaks, its that they don't want to repeat and copy someone else. stupid but true. plus tux sometimes cost more than dresses.|`|iPje1iyGaa	There actually are places that rent out dresses, but they're hard to find.  Try asking around.|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	because no one rents out dresses, and dresses require more alterations than a man's tux
283tO9j9aa	You should be able to find something like Live XXL, it's permanent and there are several purple shades.<br>  <br>  If you want a brighter colour, you could order some Manic Panic online. It's only semi-permanent, but it gives a really bright colour and it has different chemicals in so it doesn't mess up your hair so badly.<br>  <br>  I have purple hair and I always use a shampoo for coloured hair and lots of conditioner. If you dye your hair yourself, wrap your hair in clingfilm (you know the clear food wrap stuff) and blow dry your head while you wait for the dye to develop.

Pantene do a good one for about ￡3. <br>  <br>  Blow drying hair straight is both time consuming and tricky to do yourself. Even then, you won't get the same result as you do with hair straighteners. The trick is to run the hair dryer from root to end whist pointing the dryer down the shaft, and using a good brush with air vents. Also I would get some heat protection spray (GHD do one called 'hair oil') which you spritz on wet/dry hair to help avoid heat damage. <br>  <br>  Or how about putting hair up in a twisted bun, and allow to dry naturally - this will give you nice waves if you fancy a change from being straight. (So to speak!)|`|AA10764528	hold the drier up on your head and dry your hair holding it down and then back up again.

Nu6HaIfgaa	First, look in the mirror and make note of all the positive things you like about yourself. Do this alot, because it takes practice to change the way you think about things, especially how you think about yourself. And make note of not only the physical, but the things you like about yourself as a person. Be aware of you flaws, but don't let them over ride your inner and outer beauty. Make notes of things you can improve on, and embrace what you can't change. <br>  <br>  Confidence isn't just physical. I know many gorgeous women who are the most insecure people in the world. This is because they rely on their looks too much. Being proud of who you are comes from the inside out. <br>  <br>  And yes, you'll have days that you won't feel pretty, but that's normal. Just make sure to remind yourself of all the positives, and that you are the only you in the world. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Take care|`|1eorsCpQaa	It's all what you see mi dear. You must see your self as pretty before anyone else can say it and mean it. You have to love your self first before anyone can love you. It's a hard thing to do when we as women are told never to be so vain as to look at ourselves and say we are beautiful. Instead, we are told to always look for ways to improve our outside image and only look at our selves as projects. So ask your self are you a good person? do you love yourself? if you truly do then you are beautiful.|`|p0kzT2jzaa	First of all, don't rely on other people and their opinions for your confidence. Confidence comes from within. As cheesy as it sounds you must "find yourself". You are never going to find your confidence if your looking to others for validation.|`|ugaIZSjuaa	theres not much to say here people are already telling you that you are pretty and no one is going to go out of their way to prove to you that you are so if you cant believe them then thats just the way you think|`|IupDRUKnaa	You Need to treat yourself how you would Like people to Treat you.<br>  You need to look in the mirror once in a while and say <br>  "You Look Good"<br>  You need to think positive.<br>  Make the most of what you have got, and enhance it.<br>  Good Luck<br>  =]|`|cb1s5U7Caa	my problem is same as u .thanks for asking this question|`|NGHdmQwoaa	i have the same problem and i find that this site helped a lot more to believe in myself <br>  <a href="http://www.communicationconfidence.com/be-confident.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.communicationconfidence.com/b...</a><br>  hope this helps :)|`|gLXzVbm8aa	well dont think about it. if you are pretty good for you if you are not pretty o well you wont be hurting anyone if you arent. everyone is beautiful in their own way.|`|KGJHXvflaa	It'll be easier if you have a pic but i can deal w/ that!

Paracetamol (e.g.Panadol, Tylenol) is an appropriate pain-reliever which may help you to sleep on the first night. Do not use aspirin as it promotes bleeding<br>  Days 2 - 5<br>  Cold Drinks<br>  Keep a supply of iced water on hand and sip this as required to reduce discomfort and swelling. Sucking ice cubes will also help.<br>   Food<br>  At this stage it may be difficult to talk and eat because your tongue will be swollen. It is important to maintain your food intake during the healing period. High-calorie foods (e.g. milkshakes, ice-cream) will keep up your energy levels – if you do not eat enough, the healing process may be delayed. Cold foods are better tolerated than hot foods.You should avoid anything spicy, or stringy foods that may get caught on your new piercing.<br>  Mouthwashing<br>            * Rinse your mouth with salty water as often as you like. The correct proportion is 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to 8 ounces (250mls) of bottled water. Sea salt can be purchased from supermarkets or delicatessans. Do NOT use iodised salt as the iodine slows healing.<br>            * Try sucking antibacterial/anti-inflammatory throat lozenges such as Difflam ? to reduce the swelling.<br>            * Use a disinfectant mouthwash after eating:<br>                  o Biotene ?<br>                  o Listerine ?:It should be diluted to a quarter of the usual strength – otherwise the mouthwash will destroy your naturally occurring enzymes and kill the exposed healing tissues.<br>                  o Oral_B ?<br>                  o Rembrandt ?<br>                  o Tech 2000<br>            * If your tongue turns brown or green this is a sign that you should reduce the amount of mouthwash that you are using.<br>            * Do not use mouthwashes or toothpastes containing peroxide.<br>  Pain<br>  After the first day you should not need any more pain relief<br>  Swelling<br>  You may experience some swelling on Day 1, but the worst swelling occurs during Days 2-4. The swelling often feels much worse than it really is. Ice and cold drinks will help reduce swelling. Hot foods, spicy foods, talking a lot will tend to increase the swelling.<br>  Days 6 - 14<br>  Changing Barbells<br>  Your initial barbell is usually longer than the your tongue is thick, to accommodate swelling. After 5 - 10 days most people will see their piercer to fit a shorter bar.<br>  Healing<br>  A tongue piercing should be very comfortable after 2 weeks. However the piercing is not permanent till 6 months have elapsed. Don’t play with or chew on your piercing as this can lead to the formation of scar tissue<br>  Warning<br>  Never leave your piercing without jewelry for more than a few hours during the first 6 months! Even after this time a fully healed piercing may shrink, making it difficult to re-insert the jewelry<br>  Cleaning<br>  Expect to see white material collecting around the balls of your barbell. This is a sign of healing. Gently clean this material away with a soft toothbrush. Never use undiluted mouthwash or alcohol to clean your piercing. These will kill the healing flesh|`|wsfCVlbpaa	Actually, yeah, the swelling's normal. It goes down in around 10 days, the worst will be over in a couple of days though. <br>  <br>  As for foods, nothing that requires much chewing, mashed potatoes, soup (...cold, maybe?), milk and other cold drinks. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget that in around 10 days you can and should get your barbell changed for a shorter one.

XYT7jvBdaa	To prevent spots and blackheads and other skin problems you will need to have a skin routine in place to keep your skin not only clean, but hydrated. I have quite clear skin and here is what I do:<br>  -Wash face 2 times, twice a day<br>  -Use a toner after washing<br>  -Moisturize<br>  -Use an exfoliant twice a week<br>  -Use a mask right after the exfoliant<br>  Using a mask right after the exfoliant is the best way to use those two products, because the stimulation from exfoliating brings all of the the nasty stuff in your skin closer to the surface, so the mask can pull it out easier. The products I use are all Olay.<br>  -Olay gentle foaming face wash for sensitive skin<br>  -Olay refreshing toner<br>  -Olay complete moisturizer for sensitive skin<br>  -Mary Kay sugar scrub<br>  -St. Ives Alpha Hydroxy mask<br>  <br>  Just take very good care of your skin and find products that work well for you. Go to your local makeup counter and ask them what they'd suggest for your individual skin type. <br>  <br>  Regarding foundation, the best coverage I ever get from foundation is when I use Maybelline Mineral Power foundation, applied with the pink Coastal Scents kabuki brush. It goes on very light but offers very buildable coverage.|`|5TkqRvBLaa	neutrogena products! they work amazing:)|`|7BfvCGAhaa	Clean and Clear foaming cleaner is is like 4 dollars at Drug Stores :)<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps :))|`|f2FbMVoXaa	I tried Clean and Clear and it made my face look oily plus it made my face feel gross after using it!

1O1ZyEhpaa	IMO what you should do is wash and deep condition your hair twice a week. Try Aphogee Deep Moisture Shampoo or their shampoo for Damaged hair and for Deep Conditioning use their 2 Min reconstructor. You will have to do this for awhile before you hair gets back to its normal state. Do you plan on relaxing again in a few months or do you want to go back to natural. If you are planning on relaxing again. I would wait no less than 7-8 weeks to do a touch up. If you are planning on going back to natural then I recommend taking proper care of your hair a LARGE component of taking care of black hair is moisturizing and deep conditioning, if you do this your hair will restore itself very nicely.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Well, a 14 gauge is about 1/16 of an inch. i'm assuming they are in a square shape, right? That would make the hole 14 guage * 2, by 14 gauge *2. <br>  2 14 gauges would be 2/16 or 1/8 inch across.<br>  1/8 inch is ABOUT an 8 gauge.

I have never seen a black person with blue eyes.<br>  maybe green?|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i think it would look really dumb. it would look like me, a white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, putting on an afro wig. just wouldnt look right. <br>  <br>  green eyes would look good i think tho.. as long as they arent really a fake green colour.|`|t0KTJr8xaa	I used to date an afro-american with blue eyes, so I'll disagree up to a point with the people who say it's unnatural.<br>  But, I have to be honest, no matter what, when you have dark eyes and wear color contacts, it will look unnatural... There's just something disturbing about pupils that don't dialate.<br>  Light eyed people can get away with those tinted contacts, but really, if you have dark eyes and want to play with your appearance, I'd have to recommend novelty contacts, because they're -supposed- to look unnatural.<br>  But in the end, it's totally up to you.|`|c5njkH5Oaa	One of my black friends has blue contact lenses and they look awesome!<br>  I know it's not a natural eye color for black people, but any eye color lighter than hair color is flattering- natural or not!<br>  Go for it, I think you will like it, and there's no harm in trying is there? It's not permanent!|`|b4FmKhZXaa	HEY OMG I HAVE A FRIEND SHE IS BLACK AS WELL...JUST AROUND CHRISTMAS SHE RECIEVED BLUE CONTACTS....OMG SHE LOOKS SO COOL..LIKE...IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN..I WOULD TOTALLY WANT YOU TO GO FOR IT...WHO CARES WHAT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS ON HERE....I LOVE TO BE DIFFERENT....IF I WERE YOU I'D SO DO IT!!! GO FOR IT..IM SURE YOULLL LOOK SO TITE!|`|fhIndzl4aa	no!<br>  i wear hazel or honey or greenish brown. als stick 2 something that looks more natural...|`|nHwJyciKaa	They wont look natural. Color contacts are tacky.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	no, it wouldn't look natural at all|`|cb1s5U7Caa	no,  u have to wear dark cotacts, this make ur look much better -i hope this help u dusky beauty|`|OnTXgFx1aa	no
SBFs2Cheaa	why does everyone care about her so much. omg she had 8 kids, get over it.
v1uNUcwCaa	im not sure since your hair is naturally straight and fine... you are best to ask you consultant but dont be suprised if they suggest something else

KuWLNfYbaa	yes! that looks just fine|`|AA11967904	Any hair style for a hottie like you would do|`|N2XKAzZQaa	any hairstyle really..<br>  you could have loose curls, that would look quite nice<br>  like this..<br>  <a href="http://aycu39.webshots.com/image/43678/2003337403030885062_fs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://aycu39.webshots.com/image/43678/2...</a><br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|EH7G8voyaa	Errr none.

AHY3UUIiaa	Boots do really good tweezers or just try a local beauty salon they will have a range of tweezers.<br>  <br>  Happy Plucking =)<br>  <br>  AJ.x
QCkRRqVwaa	You can get it chemically straightened, <a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip086.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip086....</a><br>  I don't think it's extremely expensive.. it's probably about the same as any good hair cut or dye.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Yeah. It's called Chemical Straightner, it'll last a few months, and is quite damaging to the hair(But hey, What isn't?).  Chemical Straightner is usually around $50.|`|nrTDOs6aaa	You could (kinda) straighten the hair you have now, but once it grows out it will be wavy again. The shape of hair is caused by the follicle and roots. And you cant change them
oD3DBOBfaa	Congratulations on 1st anniversary :)<br>  <br>  Here is my question to you before answering yours:<br>  <br>  Why are you questioning about it? <br>  <br>  If you think it is not too much, go ahead and buy her one. But you are not sure....<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would give her something not related to what you have given to her already. That makes more special to her. If you have already given her those jewelry before, the third one would not make better impression. Moreover, you are not sure if it is a decent present or not....<br>  <br>  Something both of you will remember forever.... like a dinner at the special restaurant (it does not have to be a five-star restaurant), your homemade dinner, a day-trip or a hotel room with bunch of flowers.<br>  <br>  My point, I guess, is that if you have already fed her nice jewelry a few times, you have already spoiled her. And don't you spoil yourself either. Use your brain to make her happy without typical THINGS that, you think, women would like.|`|XrcZkt6Haa	I don't think so. It showcases that you love me and want to give the most stunning things she love..I always expect my next jewelry piece, <a href="http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=pearl-earrings-style-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=...</a>|`|NAhsHPYsaa	If you can afford them, they are just perfect.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	Your additional comment was just what I was thinking when I read your question a little bit ago. Yes, I think you're setting the bar way high fairly early in your relationship. She's going to expect expensive gifts all along the way, and who could blame her? Scale back, have fun, make her laugh, give her a rose along with her favorite candy bar for no reason other than you love her, wash her car, and know that she'll appreciate her next nice gift even more down the road.|`|T497f0iwaa	You can also do an amazing anniversary, for about $200.  For example you can get her 2 dozen roses, make her a beautiful dinner, and give her a nice gold chain necklace with a birthstone charm.|`|QfitgXqSaa	Absolutely not....one year strong is a great accomplishment and i think thats the most important anniversary! if i were you i would go all out...but not for all of them..just this 1st one|`|TTt51jutaa	Oh course not. Spend as much as you want on your sweetie.|`|cFJTZaV8aa	No, It would not spoil her in anyway but  the diamond earrings signify your long lasting love. It is an ideal gift for the auspicious occasion as it would redefine your love towards your beloved.|`|GrBH30vfaa	To give a diamond is never a question of bad timing. All has to do with what she likes, what she would love and enjoy and what you want to give. Go ahead, make her happy !|`|fVIC7fBlaa	NO DUDE U WANT THE GIRL TO BE HAPPY! DON'T GET HER SOMETHING STUPID OR IDIOTIC LIKE A TOASTER! YOU WANT AN AHHHHH! NOT AN Oh... GET THEM GET THEM GET THEM! Bye!|`|2FCYuOO7aa	If you can afford them, why not?
