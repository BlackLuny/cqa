You look good without it. <br>  <br>  I like clean guys that are around my age. And i hate how thre are hairy guys before their 20's. <br>  Ugh.

Do not get confused with a bowl cut, the bowl chop was invented for my family in the 70s by my grandfather. You simply place a bowl over the head, careful that it only goes half way down your ears - otherwise you will be stuck with an unfashionable hairdo! That is the first step, so adjust the bowl size to change with current trends.. but I believe the half ear bowl chop is the most trendy at the moment.<br>  <br>  You should then get a pair of blunt scissors and chop around the bowl. She should be left with a beautiful hair style that is envied by many of her peers. I do wish I had an image of myself with this do, because I was quite the stunner back in my day.

Place a slightly warm compress on your face for approximately 10-15 minutes in order to soften the blackhead, making it easier to remove.<br>  4. Pat your face dry again.<br>  5. Place a piece of tissue on the tip of each finger to avoid slipping, which could tear the skin and cause further damage.<br>  6. Gently apply even pressure to both sides of the blackhead by pushing down, then up around the blemish. You're trying to apply the pressure from *underneath* the blackhead. Only attempt this once or twice. If it does not "pop", you may bruise the skin, make the blackhead worse, and could cause scarring.|`|dt2Vl76Gaa	get a good face scrub, preferably one made for blackheads. clean and clear makes a good one, as does neutrogena I believe. keep your skin clean and moisturize. also use blackhead stips and astringent, but not too much. using too many products can dry out your skin and actually make skin oilier, which will produce more blackheads.|`|7n523JW1aa	Why the **** do you call them blackheads?

GABzViCmaa	Blue eyeshadow makes brown eyes look warm and pretty, so you could try a sheer blue eyeshadow (: Also, try navy blue eyeliner (just on the rims of your bottom lids) and stick with black mascara! Gold eyeshadow looks beautiful on tanned skin and especially brown eyes. Taking grey eyeshadow and putting a little bit on your lids is a good way to go too. At night, moisturize your lips with something like blistex, and put on  chapstick throughout the day, but make sure its a kind that gives you shiny, glossy looking lips. Neosporin Lip Treatment is great for that. Use a pink blush, not too much, but just enough to give you a glow (: Shimmer powder is a good way to go on your chest, shoulders, arms, and cheeks too! And, get a nice smelling perfume, it doesnt have to be brand or expensive.

The tattoos that I plan on getting in the near future will be for several important people who have passed recently.<br>  <br>  I also plan on getting a tattoo of red carnations for my grandma, who is still living, because she is one of the most important people in my life.|`|8DjbA8ouaa	I love tattoos! I have 5 tattoos. They all have special meaning. My first tattoo was a music note I got with my best friend when I was 16...which is now covered up by a different tattoo. I have a face my friend drew for me on my back symbolizing what an awesome friendship we all had. I have 33 on my wrist which is my bad luck number. I have love and hate on the backs of my arms with stick figures... my husband drew them and I just liked them a lot. For my biggest tattoo I have two old cop cars almost crashing with butterfly's in the middle meaning the bliss before the crash. I would have more but I got pregnant and plan on being wayyy tattooed after she's born. I think they're an amazing way of expression. They're artistic. I just love them.|`|quHnUWyWaa	i am slowly working on an entire head to toe body suit, it is for:1) personal history; 2) respect for ancestral traditions (millenniums); 3) i love the mind rush after hours under the tattoo machine|`|BZEN8QXbaa	<a href="http://s201.photobucket.com/albums/aa66/morgen1213/MyTattoosAndPiercings/" rel="nofollow">http://s201.photobucket.com/albums/aa66/...</a><br>  <br>  I just love tattoos and i love art and i say what better canvas then my body? :)|`|spXPpyP0aa	Yes I have 6.

The original idea was drawn up by a very good friend of mine & then my artist changed it some more. It's a memorial tattoo for my grandfather, and a very close childhood friend.<br>  <br>  The other is on my right thigh. It's of a Dutch Iris, and stands for my heritage, and all those who are important to me (both alive & dead).<br>  <br>  I have some others in the works, one is going to be text that represents how I feel 'flightless' at the moment, and once I've achieved some of my goals, it will be added to, and will then represent that I'm no longer 'flightless'.<br>  <br>  I'm also considering a pin up ballerina style tattoo, to represent my love of ballet, and have recently thought about getting "reveal to me my true name" as I believe we all have a past life, and I would love to find out what mine was.|`|m7wzE1ndaa	Sure do. 6.<br>  Why? Because I like to use my body as a canvas for expressing myself, and if I ever get murdered they can easily identify my body.<br>  <br>  I have the Beatles tattooed on my back, one of my favorite bands. Most of my tattoo ideas are music related, it makes me happy no matter what.<br>  I have a few birth and death dates from really close family members, for personal reasons obviously. And a few favorite quotes.<br>  <br>  Just so people can know a little more about me without me having to say it. And to show not all people with tattoos are bad...like the stereotype says.
oC5XGZcVaa	getting the spray tan is probably best for you<br>  it usually takes a good month in a tanning bed to get a good tan, and you should only go every other day, and I don't think you would get the color you want in one week<br>  just get the spray tan just make sure you go somewhere good and trust worthy|`|g0KSiZqbaa	Don't. <br>  <br>  If you must be tan, use a gradual self-tanner, especially if you've never tanned before, it can look very obvious<br>  <br>  <br>  And tanning's bad for you anyways, why pay for skin cancer?

zVVybJFXaa	Sure it's o.k!  I wear bikini tops and bottoms, but feel comfortable wearing board shorts over my bottoms. I swim in my board shorts. I'm not a big gal, but there are  many big women all over that aren't afraid to wear a two piece. You should wear a bikini because you feel confident and comfortable in one. So what if people look at you strange! You need to learn to be comfortable in your skin, not theirs.|`|TkQBalj9aa	Don't feel silly!<br>  I do occasionally wear bikinis when I go to the beach, but honestly, I feel much more comfortable in something that covers me up a bit more.  <br>  <br>  Just ignore the strange looks.

Wgwtbrw9aa	pac sun, rue21, hot topic, forever21, ross, kohls, <br>  but you can just buy jeans that dont fit right, & sew them up at the bottoms if you know how. :]|`|qlnmWsinaa	The first thing that you should remember when trying on skinnies is that all denims will stretch out- especially ones that are tight to your leg! They will stretch in the waistband, the thighs, hips a little bit, and knees. It is best to buy them when theyre a little bit too-tight (but still comfortable), so that when you have broken them in they will be the perfect fit. <br>  <br>  You can sometimes find short inseam denims, but usually not for skinnies. Retailers have been making them with longer legs because the style is to cuff them or scrunch them into ankle length pants. If you want them the perfect length for you, take them to get hemmed (this is usually under $10). <br>  <br>  Lastly, if you want nice jeans that will last a long time and are good quality, go try brands that are famous for their denim (like Guess, Gap, American Eagle)... otherwise you can find cheap styles at stores like Forever 21.|`|zADXnaMPaa	Buy jeans that dont fit you so that they become skinny leg.|`|ujiYCA2Qaa	pac sun! im pretty much that, and they have lots of sizes and super cute jeans there|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Ya get them tailored to fit you properly.

They're coming out with alot of colors...even some wierd colors too. lol
154dzJ1Faa	This is the age-old question. Every graduate from any program is always asking that question. But eventually, they all get jobs.<br>  <br>  You need to find a place that will take on a "newbie".  Many places like to take on a new person, and train them the way they like for their style of work.  Some smaller places will accept a new graduate, and some large salons take on new people too.  You need to show them that you are willing to be trained, that you will do any thing they require (often it is assisting before doing clients) and usually you are paid a low wage.  No one starts at the top!!<br>  <br>  Just keep applying at the right places.

What does your resume look like? Do you have a portfolio with pictures of some of the things you have done? I've found that a lot of stylists start at chain salons. You are guaranteed an hourly wage at these salons so it is an ideal place to start since you probably do not have a steady clientele right now. Plus, they offer supplies and training. Salons are more willing to hire those who come with a clientele and salon experience.|`|n3pSWkg0aa	you can start by volunteering/ or helping out at a place to get experience. you can take extra classes and get more experience that way. or you can find a salon that will hire you, or go to a larger one and ask them if they can "train" you or something

ZqXUduJMaa	Hair dye will wash out with time. You need to re-dye about every six weeks.<br>  <br>  Try using a special shampoo and conditioner for colored hair to make it last as long as possible.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Its fading. You are supposed to recolor your hair every month.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	well theres nothing you can do about it if you dye your hair darker then its natural color, just keep touching up the roots, and add the high lights you want.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Use semi-permanent hair color- I use natural instincts. It will wash out in a month and a half to two months and then you can just do it all over again to get total coverage- it has no ammonia so it is safe to use that often and won't hurt your hair. Plus it looks really natural and if you don't like it it will just wash out. And you won't have any roots. <br>  <br>  Permanent hair color will fade but it will never wash out. I know, I've had to go to the salon to remove it a few times- they had to use bleach wash to get it out before I could have it re-dyed brown. My stylists have always said "never do permanent hair color from the box" After a few fiascoes I listened and it works out great for me<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is to get color-enhancing shampoo. You can get shampoo that will wash some color back into your hair if it fades. Just go to Ulta or any salon and ask them, they can tell you exactly what product will work best. Or any well-stocked grocery should have them. Just pick the color closest to your hair/ color and wash with it once a week to keep your color strong and even

Now if you split up the B's then that'd be cool...or if you don't have a problem with things being symmetrical like myself then both on one wrist will work, and if you have an interview or something then you can always wear a watch to cover it. <br>  The wrist is good if you want it out and showing the neck is good if you don't and if you put your hair up people can see it anyways.|`|CmClaTYnaa	well if you want the WORLD to see it you should do it somewhere obvious, like your upper arm, the front of your neck, etc.... if you want it to be more private, maybe on your ankle,(only private if you wear jeans) or maybe like the back of your neck|`|kq0yqASCaa	on your arms or the back of the wrist or on the side of your ribs liek brody jenner's or get it on your *** that would be something funny ahah|`|KnQuTXozaa	inside of the wrists is the perfect place! but get it on opposite wrists =) that spot is masculine enough for him, and feminine enough for you.|`|tfqpb5XQaa	I think somewhere like behind your ear would be nice for something like that, as long as you were only thinking of making them small|`|oWYs6Btgaa	BB= butt buddies, best buddies, big britches, blubber busters, blubber boobies, bodacious butts, beer bandits, big boobies, big bitches, butt busters, bongo boobies?? close yet?<br>  maybe on the body part that is close in relation to your 'inside' joke?!<br>  Just how inside is it?? :D  lmao|`|J38v75bvaa	well first i would think long and hard about getting a matching tat if your young, what if you stop being friends?? ur gonna have it on u reminding you that she stabbed you in the back or crashed your care or whatever for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  my mom sis and i all got matching one on our feet. didn't really hurt. its 3 hearts, for the 3 of us girls. <br>  <br>  but you wanna do it where you can cover it up. no wrist, lower arms, neck...if you are dressed fully and you can see it...not there!!|`|8DjbA8ouaa	don't get matching tattoos! i got one with my best friend when i was like 16 and i covered it up. bad idea. but she had hers on her inner wrist and i had mine on my hip ( i had to hide it from my mom)|`|spXPpyP0aa	put it on the inside of your lip|`|cBYfTwa7aa	bb means bareback so tattoo it on your bare back

Don't buy it.

I would buy it if I were you. Except, that style particularly isn't very flattering, in my opinion, to the bust area. It's like tube tops.

But, design-wise, I think it's cute and fun.|`|90n59RnBaa	its out there..very cool.and very european.!

Though one thing... if you have a bigger chest, it will be much harder to wear, and you can easily fall out of it. Great for the guys... but not the attention you want. ;o) If you are smaller, then it is perfect and helps create curves.

ibtLgY5Xaa	You mean nautical?|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Tattoo shops in general charge by the hour.  I would assume that would take and hour so it would roughly be $100.00 to $125.00.  When you go to the shop ask for a nautical star.  It is the correct term for a nor cal star.  Are you in Northern california?  If you are I am too and I know of a great shop if you are interested.|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	what exactly is a "norcal" star....?    or Maybe you mean a NAUTICAL star...left shoulder probably about $50 to $100 just depends on where you go|`|B3Sree53aa	norcal? do you mean nautical?<br>  <br>  it depends on size, color, & the place your getting it done at(:|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	dude dont do that, every guy  i know has at least one nautical star tattoo. its way too over done|`|pI50uDcdaa	forget norcall!!!<br>  <br>  its all about socal.
HQmAP5EVaa	i dont think that 'no one seems to know how to do it' is the right thing to say about stylists. <br>  <br>  To be honest most salons don't carry crazy colors like pink.<br>  <br>  You would need to get an all over foil and get a highlight/lowlight. They wont put the pink in foils because they'll need to lift your hair before they can make it a true pink color.<br>  <br>  this salon seems a little bit old school, i'd try looking for a salon thats a little more up to date.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	You need to call the salon and ask them if they would be able to do what you want, if not ask if they have any suggestions where you go. You are definitely looking for a salon that has more of a funky vibe, if you live in a suburb you may have to go into the city.|`|wtGy4Q8Gaa	Interesting combo, very unique.

Obviously the girls you meet with aren't looking for a relationship because if they were i'm pretty sure you'd be taken. You'll find a girl that appreciates you for your personality and your cuteness, just give it time.

I even used to hang out with the popular guys, but it was always them that got the good looking girls. I can only suggest that you look for girls with a similar personality type to your own. They are more likely to understand how you feel anyway. Good luck, at least you do grow out of the cuteness thing.|`|wUEeccrMaa	youre probably short. im a freshman, and the guys in my grade are mostly "cute" too i guess. theyre just not manly enough yet. you probably are a bit shy and arent very outgoing. girls tend to be attracted to bold outgoing guys, the confident assertive ones. shy ones remind us of our friends, and our friends in our mind are also just cute.|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	LOLOOOOLLL.  I'm 14 too.  Noone who isn't $(utty says that.  Seriously, you are probably finne.  If it is confidence, then just take pride in how you look act and feel.  Be proud.

QsPwh6xtaa	i personally like curly-wavy hair....|`|ZUepTX57aa	I know it's probably not a great answer, but the fact that you CAN do both is awesome.  So if I were you, I'd probably do curly for a majority of the time (cause I am personally lazy when it comes to that) and then when I have the extra time or I'm going out or for the hell of it, I would take the extra time and do it up straight, play with 'em both.|`|b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	Well I love curly hair, but my hair is curly too, but i do it straight. Its really just that I don't like what I have I think most people are like that, but if your curls look nice and its easy don't straighten it or you will lose your curl. I made that mistake my hair doesn't look the same anymore.
SVuYaK8maa	If your unsure the best thing to do is not to do it at all.  I always say you can add to it but can't take away.  My sister uses one from bed bath and beyond.  She only payed 70 for it.

This is a cut for naturally straight hair, however if your naturally wavy or curly, using a chemical straightening kit will work fine. they last for 3 months and a home-one (which you can get for ￡15 at boots) are just as good. if you have high-lites or have used bleach/peroxide DONT use them, they will make your hair extreamly brittle, break and even fall out...<br>  <br>  hope ive helped you x|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Best thing is to always bring the picture to your hairstylist.

ymU6w0Pwaa	Solia is the best!!!!! Read the reviews at Folica.com the Solia has better reviews and its tourmaline ceramic plates! I think that its better because you can adjust the temp and on some of the models of the Chi you cannot! The chi is way overrated and a lot of reviewers on Folica say that it dies after a year or less! <br>  <br>  <br>  here are links for the 1 inch and review videos from you tube!|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	chi is really good. they also have this product in a little silver and red bottle that makes your hair silky and smooth and easier to straighten. their products are great|`|1Nl2Jatmaa	The chi works the best.|`|8V0yeQJ6aa	Chi gives best results!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|NVlwi2braa	For your hair you should use CHI flat iron.

Cavz3kAPaa	If I'm correct that some sort of language? I don't think it would go behind your ear. Writing needs to be big, because of the tendency for it to bleed if it's too small. I'd hate for it to be like that in a few years time.<br>  <br>  Hopefully your artist realizes this sort of thing. So just to be safe, please consider a second spot if you can't get it done behind your ear.<br>  <br>  As for the cost, each artist will probably have a slightly different amount, but I'd say it would be the minimum cost for the shop (usually about $50)<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|0n5sYl6raa	Prakashnath ..thats too big to be behind the ear..troll|`|h6jmaRypaa	depends on who you go to but on average probably about $50: for a real good job

2HPa1ETUaa	I think they're neat!<br>  That's why I got it done.<br>  And it does hurt a lot, but worth it.<br>  Oh, and if you get it done, make sure you clean it everyday! Or you may end up with bumps around your holes, like me right now. They do go away with sea salt soaks, but it's better to just not have to get the bumps in the first place.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I wanted one for a long time and anyone I told about it had the same reaction: "Why? Those don't even look good. But if you want it, get."<br>  <br>  I did want it. And I was going to get it. Until I thought of the shape of my ears. This is going to sound weird but my family has always joked about my "elf" ears. They are more pointed than rounded at the top where the piercing would be. They aren't horribly pointy, but definitely enough to notice if you pay attention to ears, and enough for me to doubt how well this piercing would look on me. And then I watched a video online of it getting done and that convinced me not to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, I do like them!!|`|r1Vg6djRaa	its not worth it.<br>   its cute but it has sooo many complications and i like my rook and snug better anyways<br>  <br>  plus its pretty painfull to pierce and heal|`|hQA8Ql21aa	I love it and plan on getting it done.<br>  Only bad thing is it takes 6 weeks up to a year to heal.|`|y77Te4eUaa	i had it done.. the pain was tolerant on the bottom but the top was PAINFUL!! lol it looked good for about 3 weeks then the bottom piercing wouldnt stop bleeding :/ so i took it out it was sad but i got it re done on the other ear and its going well :D get it if u want it.. the pain only last for about a good 5 seconds then it just stings..<br>  <br>  hoped it help :) good luckk|`|fXqiQzp6aa	i love how they look! i've wanted to get one for a while. and i've heard they're pretty painful but i think it would be worth it.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Ooh the pain :P|`|x0gquSCsaa	i love them but i heard they hurt a lot

9d8k5hBfaa	Yeah, about the same thing happened to my sister. One friend of hers asked her to go on a date and she said no, but then later she decided that she liked him. He was very happy to know that she decided to like him, he probably felt like the rejection undid itself. So yeah, he would be relieved to find out that you two have potential. Flat out tell him that like him, he won't be disappointed. Good luck :)|`|k1FenuRLaa	depends how u rejected him. as a guy he cud easily have got over u and been onto sumone else. it is very easy for a guy to find a crush. im sure if u become his friend or sumthing u can maybe work ur way back in|`|PFXUdEl9aa	of course not, he still going to have feeling just sad, and if you ask him out he will go with you|`|ed4083e4ac5a6b1af9f6c384015e9f7daa	If he really liked you he will be delighted to know that you have changed your mind.

I dig it.|`|AA10451072	Could you get ANY more ignorant?<br>  <br>  <br>  Girls grow hair all over their body, too.<br>  <br>  We expect them to shave, so it's justified that they'll reciprocate.|`|nuWo6z6taa	ha well im a 17 year old girl and i like hairless boys ? i don't mind the legs but if you have a hairy back PLEASE shave it , because im really touchy and i donnnn't want to touch that <br>  <br>  it's a big turn off|`|8294rVR2aa	Hehe opposed to what you just said waxed chest :)<br>  but not legs thats just wrong lol
EoMVOWoqaa	my locker is pretty simple but it looks good. i think lockers that have a bunch of posters and stuff look stupid.<br>  my locker has:<br>  a magnet on the door that holds my schedule (which comes in very handy)<br>  a magnetic shelf thing that has containers that holds some pencils and pens, a pack of gum,chapstick, lip gloss, and my cell phone<br>  a few pictures of me and my friends on the door<br>  and a mirror in the back so when i open up my locker i see myself right away.<br>  <br>  that is really all you need. hope i helped!|`|B29boGPcaa	I have a bunch of magnets in my locker.

8pexNGjraa	Definitely Not! I use to think that there was something wrong with me because I never had a boyfriend all through high school and college but I find someone who was perefect for me. Being picky or concentrated on something fulfilling in your life requires dedication, so your just concentrating on what makes you happy right now, perfect! Just know when you find someone your interested in, you can't help but gravitate towards them, so maybe its not that you have ruined possible opportunities but maybe you have a stronger gut feeling than most girls and when you find someone great, you'll have a lot more to give and receive a lot more because you didn't waste your time compromising your heart and your values on just anybody.  Besides, why have that mentality now? you don't live forever but your twenties are not the end of the world.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Not necessarily. Maybe guys are intimidated by you, and are afraid to approach you. There have probably been plenty of guys who have been interested in you, but just haven't said anything. If the guys aren't going to you, go to them, and be confident.<br>  Good luck :]|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	No, that means you have never found that person that is right for you. Also body language can make a guy think you are uninterested, like crossing your arms and not having eye contact. <br>  <br>  Stand straight up, smile to men, look them in the eye but not for a long time, don't cross your arms. I have never dated anyone or had a bf and I am currently 17 years old. I am not bothered by it. I wasn't allowed to date in high school, but I think now I can since I am in a trade school, but now I just don't want to for some odd reason. weird.<br>  <br>  Have confidence and talk to men first and say "hi" before they get a change to. He will like your confidence and will want to talk to you more and more, and sooner or later you will find yourself in love.

PK506WbBaa	Everyone's skin is different, and so are most toners.<br>  <br>  There's some that have salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, alcohol, witch hazel, or may not contain ANY of those things (which, I don't know exactly what you're paying for at that point.)<br>  <br>  If you have a sensitivity to any of those products, then yes, toners are bad for YOU. IF you're already using one at its irritating your skin, check the label and switch to one with a different ingredient. And when you use the new one, try it out on a small area first to see if irritation occurs before you do serious (but probably temporary) damage to your face.|`|pKycJ4oJaa	It may depend on the type of toner you use and what skin type you have.  If you're using something high in alcohol and you're experiencing dryness or flaking, then you should switch to something like a mineral soothing water or tonic.|`|859dacb3d872ff6ddfb70a8f2e7846bfaa	It is if it has rubbing alcohol (sp?) in it.

You have perfect skin, so I would just use a light dusting of some makeup like everyday minerals for foundation.  Also,  for the perfect makeup look, I would use slightly less eyeliner, with more mascara and a bit of eyeshadow to really make your eyes pop.  Finally, I would let my eyebrows get a little bit thicker, as they need to really frame those gorgeous eyes.|`|b1Upbj2Caa	WOAH; I am soooooooooo speechless. Do you really think you aren't pretty?

You could maybe try some  frizz-fighting hair products, and do something with just the ends of the hair, either with a straightener (which I use just to gently curl my ends under, not to straighten) or with a curling iron or curlers.

0S4rtq1Haa	I have the same stuff and I use a sponge. Since your hands and fingers have germs and stuff on them, I've heard its not the best way to put foundation on since the dirt and stuff will clog up pores. Use a brush, or, do what I do, and use a sponge.<br>  I just take a bit and rub it in. =)|`|Yue2YKTnaa	just put it on your face then blend it well<br>  dont put too much|`|ag5fthVAaa	Use a brush like this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT146&PRODUCT_ID=285" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....</a><br>  Although that one is expensive, it works great. You can also get one exactly like it at Target for about 8$ by Sonai Kshuki. <br>  Never use your fingers. It makes it uneven and puts bacteria in the makeup and on your skin. <br>  This brush will make your makeup more even and cover more in areas where you need more coverage. <br>  I have used the Dream Matte Mouse product and this brush and it made my face look dewy and smooth. I loved it. <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|TAUYiPpLaa	dip your finger in it, then lather it all over your face in a circular motion.|`|29EORG8Iaa	Dip a sponge into it and softly rub it in circles all around the areas you would like covered.|`|JOfW3U5taa	just put it on your finger and apply it..
genZbG74aa	Definitely not the Urban Decay, their mascara is very very clumpy. BadGal and Colossal are pretty even to me, but since Colossal is cheaper, i say go for Colossal|`|93H9KLgCaa	honestlly the expensive mascara isnt that great :/ i messed up with smashbox and stila it made me so madd<br>  <br>  the only thing is that they kinda make your lashes deflate by the end of the day into a crisp nothingg<br>  but all the other products are amazing<br>  <br>  my favoritee is definatleyy<br>  lash blasttt. its my muust have any i think im a crazy person. <br>  the only expensive mascara i would buy would be the new givenchy.<br>  ask someone its so coooll|`|ItU5NVWoaa	colassal mascara is wack!|`|YCMUPkbZaa	Bad gal Lash is Amazing,|`|hmzMd5TLaa	BadGal Lash is a big thumbs down. It made my eyelashes look even shorter than they already are, but good for volumizing.|`|29EORG8Iaa	Bad Gal Lash = Best mascara I've ever used. Make sure to get your outerlashes!|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I have the Urban Decay Mascara and it works AWESOME|`|BvjPU3wkaa	I prefer Colossal out of the three.  I find with mascaras that have a large applicator that they tend to dry out quickly, because of this I would have to recommend the cheaper out of the three.  You get the same results all around.
XITPweLEaa	I have then same problem. Wiggle mascara brush at the roots of the lashes then sweep to tips. Use a lash comb. Try some different mascaras and brushes.
Yp15y9zRaa	Beautiful boy, terrible hair and beard. He has potential I think, i would recommend that you send some pics in to a modelling agency. That facial hair will need to go though, and I imagine they'll want him to have a haircut too. If you can convince him to face the scissors then he could well be posing in CK underwear soon! lol. <br>  <br>  Question is, could you cope with him working with female models?|`|ErIxYrxlaa	possibly... <br>  <br>  if he's shooting for high fasion , i doubt with a beard shaven like that <br>  he will make it anywhere...<br>  <br>  he should have taken the offer when he was younger..|`|nfSZPpAHaa	I think so!<br>  He has amazing bone structure like you said, and that unique look many male models have.<br>  And wow I can't help but mention I love your eyes!<br>  <br>  :)|`|BGM50F8Caa	See? I knew I couldn't. Maybe when I looked younger and beard-free like in my avatar.|`|JmNaXTjqaa	i think so but i think he would have to have a shave and a bit of a hair cut|`|ruLqEgsuaa	O<br>  M<br>  G<br>  <br>  Bloody OMG AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  NO|`|SeNz1cyFaa	zomg !! he looks like aston kuther! ( his face ) and maybe if he sahves and gets a six pack :P no offence|`|rM7ERib6aa	theres a ferret on his face.. so i cant tell what he looks like.<br>  <br>  xoxx.|`|tcV7KsYZaa	not main stream but maybe for some clothing stores, MAYBE|`|6uhnyEYEaa	maybe with a haircut and a good shave. but other than that no!!!|`|yVRnOawlaa	i dont think so...|`|mNkTbxrJaa	after he shaves ewww|`|ms2iEvy2aa	I think he's super cute, AND I like the beard...so everyone else can bug off.<br>  <br>  So my answer is yes! (I also added you as a flickr contact too 8)   )|`|AA11569882	You are in love, I think you are biased!<br>  <br>  Perhaps if he got a haircut and had a shave he'd look better, but as for now, you just carry on thinking he's the most handsome man in the world and keep him for yourself!|`|972OdSIJaa	doubt it.<br>  <br>  he will need to have 6packs|`|AA11899483	yes he could, he needs to change his style such as hair cut, depending on what sector he wants to model in. he should contact some agencies, only they can tell, remember just because one agency might reject him, another one might not, look around. models get rejected for lots of reasons, it just depends on what the agency is looking for.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Who knows? I hate that beard though.....ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	The lad needs a good shave!!<br>  His measurements mean nothing if he looks scruffy|`|zprAkP3eaa	he needs to trim, but not bad.|`|edJtHlDiaa	Nope he's no "nigel barker" and i don't care if he's 6'2 i'm 6'1 but i don't think he's a model he don't have the bone structure for it and i think your in love and you think he's hott thats all.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	He could become whatever he wants to be,<br>  so as; he doesn't take a lifetime to decide <br>  or he'll be forever lost and so will you; if he's just a dreamer.|`|aqx3pIbeaa	ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah... i thought it was a rick roll until the second picture lololololololololololk<br>  FAFAFAFAFFAFAFAFA U MADE MY DAY|`|wbkBpamKaa	probably. only because of the unusal features in his face. i personally dont think he is attractive and loose the beard!|`|ai33g11Maa	Most definitely not!  No offence but no way.  His features are far too large/wide.  <br>  <br>  Noooooooooooo!|`|8nF5YjyYaa	He needs to sort that f*cking beard out, and smile a bit.|`|bspT5rkeaa	omg. ew. <br>  he needs to shaveeeeee.|`|mxcLdHrgaa	i think he could! He has a marc jacobs edge,maybe could be in a chloe ad.
AXh7WLSJaa	aveeno works well.|`|8vuOwZHuaa	Rub llama milk on ur face. Yep that will work.|`|Rg4YOHGhaa	BB creams! :)<br>  <br>  The BB Cream, aka Blemish Balm, is the hottest beauty product in Asia right now. It has the advantages of both a makeup and skincare product. It can even out skintone, camouflage undereye circles, acne scars and add radiance to the skin without the heavy mask-like effects of a foundation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lavidafashionistas.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lavidafashionistas.blogspot.com/</a>|`|hahwsMd7aa	neutregena<br>  i think i spelled that wrong|`|1UUK3B9Taa	poop

Good luck!|`|mtmVc2FCaa	thanks for the info, sounds like a great idea! maybe you should contact guiness and see if they already have a record holder in longest nipple hair|`|pwC0bEmHaa	hahahaha i don't think it will grow up to your knees.
f4f3f79b7b8f882378c37ad59affe31eaa	I looked everywhere and couldn't find them listed anywhere- do you remember where you saw them?|`|jwvGjDa4aa	never seen them. they sound ugly though.

Without the face I'd say.... 6/7
XBJAewIYaa	if ur really in a hurry to change them, i'd say wait for about 7 days. if u got time, wait about a month until everything is fully healed.|`|AA11618909	As long as your not moving the gauge up, you should be fine to do it within a few days.
ER8L9croaa	yeah like the person above it depends on ur pain tolerance, it does hurt more than an eye brow wax as the hairs are thicker and theres more. but it only lasts for a few seconds, for me id say a 3 or 4|`|jzEo2Qtfaa	it depends on the person's pain tolerance level...<br>  <br>  probably 5 or 6 for some people
WImLNgbYaa	I had the same problem<br>  Until my mum starting buying SunSilk Voluptuous shampoo and conditioner.<br>  This gives the hair a bounce and lifts it up so it looks like you've backcombed it already. <br>  Just dry your hair as normal and then Backcomb your hair upside-down and then lift your head up and you'l notice your hair is like all over the place<br>  Flatten it a bit, apply some hairspray and as the hairspray is still wet, backcomb it again. Carry on doing this until your happy with it but never backcomb your hair when the hairspray has fully dryed.<br>  This can cause damage to your hair.<br>  And don't apply a lot of hairspray. You a decent hairspray that holds but dont use a lot.<br>  Or use wax, either way they work good (:|`|7hIwM2jzaa	Start by blow drying your hair upsidedown (gives loasda volume).<br>  .<br>  Then from just over 1/4 of the way down the back seperate your hair in to 2 parts (so the bottom half is left down and the top part is clipped up)<br>  then peice by peice take small peices of the hair clipped up, combe it through then spray a small amount of hairspray near the root, and then from about 1.5 - 2.5 inches away from your scalp back combe it a few times. (backcombing is where you come towards your scalp instead of down to the ends) <br>  Keep doing this at the back/top of your head until you reach the desired effect, and wellllllaaaaa! scene hair!<br>  <br>  if you look on youtube im sure you will find countless amounts of videos on how to do it|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	It really depends on what type of hair you have.<br>  <br>  Blow drying your WET hair upside down is good but what really works  is the blow dryer made by WAHL called Complement Ionic. <br>  <br>  It's like blow drying your hair with a big circular comb but without the trouble of blow drying and combing at the same time. That blow dryer can no longer be found on store shelves but can be found on ebay.
HCk6ifrAaa	Well I personally love gels, but now that you have a baby I think you should get practical. They are way to hard to keep up, and don't get acrylics they're too harsh for the babys skin.<br>  I think you should just get your regular manicure with polish. Keep it simple, and it still looks great! :)<br>  congrats on the baby! ?|`|GZKbvXLLaa	Personally, I prefer gel nails. But that's just me. If I were you, I might think about having the gel nails removed and just getting a manicure every few weeks, at least until you are settled into a routine with your baby. Keep your nails well groomed, and they will look very nice, I'm sure. Best wishes!|`|gaWZ79gNaa	once you have the baby you are not going to care about your nails believe me!!!<br>  <br>  I would do acrylic since they are stronger and less likely to break!
S4Q6jO9waa	I have sensitive skin too and have to be careful what i put on it.<br>  I have used this product and haven't had a problem.<br>  Maybe you can try it on a small area on your face, and then wait a couple of days to see if you have any allergic reaction or break out.<br>  good luck!|`|DJK8yUbAaa	Only use it twice a week.  I have really sensitive skin too.|`|62ba5ca2b4be2582988c9c78b56c7032aa	I use the St. Ives apricot scrub for sensitive skin also. So, far I have good results, I use it 2x a week.
29EORG8Iaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  For a 16-year-old I'd recommend a brown smoky eye (especially for blue/green eyes)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgKuh29e2EI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgKuh29e2...</a><br>  <br>  That's a great tutorial for smoky eyes.<br>  <br>  Peachy lip gloss and subtle bronzer.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	The trick with makeup is to understand that it is there to enhance, not cover. The best makeup is to appear like there is none at all. Bad makeup is the black lines over and under the eyes, that caked and faked look and the artificial colour compared to you real colour.<br>  Use sparingly and to enhance. Not to make everyone notice your makeup.

If they have Barry M get their lipstick which is numbered 100, i think. I love it. <br>  Benefit is amazing. If they have Urban Decay they have a primer potiony type thing and thats good. Its in a genie type bottle.|`|hmzMd5TLaa	Definitely get a Stila Smudge Pot. I got mine recently and I am absolutely adoring it. Try Urban Decay, Benefit, Too Faced, Stila.<br>  I also love the CARGO blu ray High Definition Mattifier, as well as Benefit's Boi-ing Concealer.<br>  One thing I wouldn't reccomend is Benefit's Posietint- it gave me the worst allergic reaction!|`|76cercFraa	too faced shadow insurance if youre looking for a good primer dont get the urban deay primier potion because it burns and its hard to get the product out of the bottle its only a dollar more...it costs 18$ ..worth it<br>  hope i helped :)|`|jf1s8kDmaa	NARS is definitely my favorite.<br>  <br>  Im a big eyeliner girl, and their stuff is great, their eyeshadow is pretty awesome too.|`|Pb5lQwXCaa	There's this incredible primer, it's called Paula Dorf and it's in a black tube and it's bigger than most primer bottles.<br>  Hard Candy is amazing, also Dior (the spray foundation works wonders)<br>  But I would recommend Urban Decay. It is the best compared to all, no comparison. It has funky colors and glitter, and there's also neutral colors for such things as everyday makeup.<br>  Too Faced has a mascara that you should get, the brush is magnificent. <br>  Hope I helped!|`|zP1MQSoiaa	Sephora is very expensive and you don't want to waste your money on makeup that won't work with your face and skin tone,it'd be better to post a pic of yourself so people would know what to suggest|`|AA12133586	too face shadow insurance which u will get most out of your money...<br>  makefup forever hd loose powder<br>  smashbox photo light primer
jVUbjpYgaa	Well if the tattoo artist has aids, and you have sex, then yes you can get it.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if your talking about the gun, no unless its a non-professional artist and he doesn't steralize his guns, but they all do anyways.<br>  <br>  ab.|`|kCdISEGqaa	You can't get AIDS from tattooing, unless the artist spreads infected blood onto your open wound. Tattooing is VERY different from injecting drugs. The needles used in tattooing are not hollow. They do, however, travel back and forth through a hollow tube that acts as an ink reservoir. The tip of the tube is dipped into the ink, which draws a little into the tube. As the needle withdraws into the tube, it gets coated with ink. When it comes forward, it pierces your skin and deposits the ink. You then bleed a little through the needle hole. This happens several hundred times a second.<br>  <br>  You are only at risk of infection if you come in contact with infected<br>  blood. Since it is only *your* skin that is being pierced during the<br>  tattooing process, only *your* blood is being exposed. This means that<br>  the only person at greater risk is the artist, because s/he is the only<br>  one coming in contact with someone else's (potentially infected) blood.<br>  This is why reputable (and sane) tattoo artist wears surgical gloves<br>  while working.|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	oh wow.... as with any other job you can catch aids from an infected person if they have a cut or any other laceration and you have a cut and their blood enters your blood stream... or if you have $ex with that person... aids is transmitted through bodily fluid...  <br>  <br>  Tattoo artists wear protective gloves and people that are HIV positive are supposed to tell them that before they get it done, but even with all the precaution it is still possible for a mistake to happen

So give yourself a MANicure before wearing them ok?<br>  <br>  Trim those nails, and make sure you use lotion, because dry cracked feet are gross too. <br>  <br>  Flip-flops are kind of tacky/typical lazy-guy too, so only wear them on hot worthy flip flop days!|`|bChxr1J5aa	eewwww no thats really gay
sLGehA4raa	I once wore a tuxedo jacket with jeans. Of course, this was the morning after prom, and it was cold outside, and I had nothing else. Otherwise, I would have shunned the look.<br>  <br>  I've seen "fashion-forward" types try to pull it off. The mixture is too jarring. The satin lapels don't look right unless they have the full backdrop of black created by the jacket and trousers. Stick to a blazer or sport coat.|`|DUhK9p9kaa	Nice blazers look great with jeans but an actual tuxedo jacket would be too much for the jeans. But anything goes in Vegas and no one will look at you funny.

New images come and go. Tattoos don't. Don't get a tattoo to create the 'hot new me' because the 'hot new me' may be something you hate in a years time. In the words of Oscar Wilde - fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we need to change it every six months. Well with a tattoo, you won't have that option. Of course get a tattoo if that's something you're passionate and serious about. Perhaps I've got you wrong. But when you say it in the same breath as a new hairstyle, it doesn't sound to me like you are. <br>  <br>  If you want to spice up your image a bit - get a wacky new hairstyle. New colour, totally new cut. It can do wonders for your self esteem. Get a facial, get your eyebrows and nails done, maybe your teeth whitened or your skin tanned. Save up a bit of cash and go on a shopping spree, but only buy clothes in a totally new style - and don't think "it won't go with anything I have" because you'll be buying all the new stuff to go with it while you're there! Perhaps if you do want something a bit different, get a new piercing, perhaps your nose or tongue - this way you can dabble in a bit of body mod without it having lifelong consequences if you change your mind later down the line. And another thing, if you don't already, try and eat healthily. I am a major slob with my diet - I often sink into habits of eating loads of chocolate and not enough good stuff. And then every now and again I'll go on a bit of a health kick, and even without changing my outwards appearance, if I swap the chocolate for fruit and the coke for orange juice, I feel so much healthier and full of energy and the 'new me' really does come from within! There are loads of things you can do to spice up your image, but I would leave getting a tattoo until you are really serious about that individually, rather than as part of a makeover. Have fun!
4hv0y3bEaa	well my legs are 2 and a half feet and size zero is pretty long on me. from head to toe i am 5' 2"|`|Ja7ytPJUaa	All jeans, regardless of size, are usually 30 inches long from the bottom of the crotch part to the bottom of the pants.  That part is called the inseam.  Look on different websites, and on the sizing chart they'll probably tell you the inseam.  Most stores, though, have different lengths, short, normal, and long.  Short is 28 inches and long is 32 I think.  so if the pants are too long or short, buy different lengths.  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped :]|`|TOzQM4DWaa	i dont really know how long my legs are but my height is 5'6 and size 0 pants fit me fine on the length. sorry i couldnt be more help.
AA11963297	I love the Beauty Rush lipgloss by Victoria's Secret. That's all I use.|`|gipfVShsaa	Calvin Klein Delicious pout lip gloss and philosophy. They even taste good on your lips.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Lipalicious or something like that. It's the Bath and Body Works brand. My fave is the cotton candy flavor because it smells soooo good and it's a clear/light pink color.|`|zvN64drnaa	myyyyyy #1 of all time is <br>  VICTORIAS SECRET beauty rush lipglosss!<br>  i lovee these. i have like 7 of them hah.<br>  my favorite is cupquake but its so like glittery!<br>  i think the glittery ones are the most like best smelling ant tasty ones(:<br>  i wana get pinked lemonadeeee & the grape one ahh <br>  i want like every flavor im scared they are gonna stop making them<br>  or smt hahah :D<br>  i always have one with me everywhere i go. the presence of these babies on my lips is addicting haha.<br>  the formula is like thickk and kind of sticky but i mean come on if the winds blowing your hair will always like stick to your lips no matter what kind of lipgloss you are wearing.<br>  i feel weird. but yeah i love this stuff =]<br>  they are $7.00<br>  <br>  also i really like revlons new creme gloss.<br>  i have it in pink cami. its a reallyy pretty pink color. its actually really pigmented and such a nice creamy texture!<br>  they are about $9-10<br>  <br>  hope i helpeddd=] you should check theem outtt hahah<3|`|qzkWahFeaa	<a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P44800&categoryId=C17366&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a> in Think Pink is amazingly colored, and it lasts forever on me. <br>  <br>  I also like DuWop Lip Venom(<a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P51801&categoryId=S10605&shouldPaginate=true))" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a> and <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P218706&categoryId=S10605&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a> in all scents/flavors. The Victoria's Secert kinds are good as well, and LipSmackers smells really good.<br>  <br>  Plus, none of those are sticky!|`|tXqBY3Fxaa	here are some good lip gloss products from online at sephora.com<br>  some things I would consider purchasing!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P225372&categoryId=S10605&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a> (a lot of lipgloss for a great deal)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P150719&categoryId=S10605&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a> (lots of option)|`|ag5fthVAaa	For colored lipgloss I love Mac Listreglass. They stay on well but aren't sticky. <br>  My other favourite non-colored gloss is Victoria's Secret's BeautyRush lipgloss; It comes in a white non-transparent tube. It is great it makes your lips smell minty and makes them a little tingle-y<br>  Hope this helped :)<br>  You sohuld try both.|`|IIKwBSrxaa	I love Liplicious by Bath and Body Works... they smell good and they taste good and come in a variety of different shades.  Some of them are "sheer" (glossier) while others are "opaque" (have more color).  My favorites are Black Cherry, Watermelon Sorbet, and Mocha Latte.  They're about $7 dollars regularly but they can go as low as $1.50 when they have major sales.  Good stuff when you compare it with the price.<br>  <br>  I also like Revlon's line of lip glosses - they stay on forever and it doesn't look terrible.  Almost as good as Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush - those smell as good as Liplicious, but they don't taste as good.<br>  <br>  Lipgloss tip:  If your complexion is:<br>  <br>  *Pale, then wear pink lip gloss.<br>  <br>  *Tannish Pale, then wear red lip gloss with pinkish tints.<br>  <br>  *Tanner, then wear pink lip gloss more on the brownish side.<br>  <br>  *Dark, then wear purplish pink tints.|`|HVhVpDrmaa	I recently became a fan of the Too-Faced Smurfette lip gloss. It always looks super cute on and smells very nice. It also leaves a nice color on your lips when the gloss wears off. It is definitely something to try. I liked it because a lot of the time my lips look too red like i have bad chapped lips, but this gloss gives me a nice color, thats not too "loud"|`|J670EOFBaa	My two favorite lipglosses are victoria's secret lipglosses. (the beauty rushes and the very sexy glosses becuz they give u that sexy shine on ur lips like the models have on the runway shows...lol) and my second favorite is from almay and its called the ideal gloss. Its a wonderful gloss and it has a brush applicator and its not sticky and its just a wonderful gloss. =)|`|7SwmxIvaaa	Hmmmmm...........<br>  <br>  It would have to be lipsmackers,<br>  I don't know why, it just ALWAYS smells like<br>  it did the moment that you bought it!<br>  I bought this one thing of lipgloss in the summer before 4th<br>  grade, and now I'm a freshman, and is STILL smells fruity tooty!|`|71rDrQTOaa	the ones from victoria's secret they look nice and taste qood<br>  :)
24Xy8qWtaa	Did you cut it? Or maybe it was dry/chapped from the cold weather and the sour sugar crap got in a cut and made it sore.<br>  <br>  Or you have oral herpes.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Its probably just an allergic reaction. I'd ice it and sleep on it. If it's not better in the morning, call a doctor. Good luck :D|`|MIILkAR4aa	try lip relaxer you can buy it at target<br>  ummm maybe it's an alergic reaction.<br>  go check with a doctor if it doesnt go away by tommorow|`|mzMOpQhvaa	Sounds like a cold sore to me!<br>  <br>  I get them as well (through no fault of my own...I know 'oral herpes' makes it sound bad! haha). They are genetic. I would invest in abreva to make sure it doesn't get any worse :)
R4SXa7v4aa	Ah, the whole judging thing all over again. <br>  i see, well I have big brown eyes. I say, if you want to fix yourself up a little bit, get your eyebrows done, but just a little, not too much or you'll look trashy.<br>  If you get your brows done, use a bit of mascara, and a nice shade of eye shadow. Lip gloss or chapstick is good for your lips.<br>  About the whole guy/ girl making fun of you. DONT LISTEN TO THEM! <br>  They have no right to judge you, make fun of you or anything! Who the hell are they to judge someone they dont know, and by appearance? Come on, can they get more shallow ? Thats really pathetic.<br>  Just remember. Karma's a *****. they can deal with it.|`|rFRC4Ilcaa	i dont think this belongs in the makeup sections.. probably like advice. but most likely they are jealous. it makes teenage girls feel good about themselves if they are hurting someone else. dont let them see that it hurts you. they will get their thrills if they see you hurt.|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	If you dont want them to call u ugly because of your eyebrows, PLUCK THEM.

No big deal.|`|LKFqR3zZaa	Maybe they are just jealous. if you are confident and you think that you are good looking then don't even care what they have to say. focus on what you think of yourself because they are only trying to get you down and if you let them think that they are getting you down they'll just mess with ya worse.|`|8L7MbIYQaa	i know people say you shouldnt change for other people but on this time i think its a good reason go get your eyebrows waxed and thinned out to a nice shape.. and see what they ahve to say the next day ;) bet they wont be making fun of you no more :D<br>  x|`|JqjSAhPuaa	They do it because people are bitches!

ViZyM2AUaa	I know this is like, the grossest request on the planet, but can we get a discription? There are different types of zits, and they need to be taken care of in different ways. <br>  -A cyst (a zit under the skin, no white head) needs to be taken care of by applying a strong spot treatment, and once a "white head" (it's not a real white head) appears, it can be popped, and will be gone. If you try to pop it before then, it will get inflamed and look worse. <br>  If it has a white head on it, it can simply be popped. I recommend that you get a hot washcloth and lay it on your face to kinda loosen it up first... The easier it comes out, the cleaner it will come out and the less noticeable it will be. dude, that sucks. good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Use cover up!!!|`|iJZsy5rgaa	lol pop it fast lol.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Cleansing face wash, plain toothpaste, or that Zeno Zit Zapper.<br>  <br>  I suggest doing things in that order if you want it gone. Cleanse the area, then apply PLAIN toothpaste to it so there is no burn or anything. After that, try the Zeno Zit Zapper thing. You hold it up to the zit, press the button, and it makes it go away/get tiny.<br>  <br>  Just don't pop it! It will increase redness, could make it worse, and leads to scarring.|`|5cK3ed4zaa	first wash your face with hot water( however hot your face can take)<br>   <br>  pop your zit <br>  then after sprinkle a tiny bit of lemon juice and baby powder<br>   <br>  then 5 minutes later rinse your face with cold water<br>  <br>  dont touch your face it increases oil<br>  <br>  also check out your local stores|`|1OEDcz6Raa	pop it then immediately after- put toothpaste on it. or if you have acne cream put that on it. or hydrogen peroxide works too|`|ebGjDZtMaa	DONT pop it it might get infected <br>  he wouldnt care if you have a pimple coz he probably have one too|`|SWHFvXI0aa	Pop it :o|`|aBN1yjSvaa	well, haha.<br>  ASAP.<br>  lol<br>  "asap"<br>  yes. lets get rid of it "asap"<br>  welllll,<br>  for starters, fooooo.<br>  you can learn to accept that at some point in their life EVERYONE gets zits.<br>  ORRRR..<br>  you can curl up in a ball and hide under your covers for 48 hours until it goes away!<br>  works for me;)|`|PtqjRurnaa	There is a mud its like mint julble mud.  It comes in a green tub.  Its only like $3.  But you put it on your face/zit and it socks up the zit!!!! And the best part is it gets the redness way down too if not got completely!!!|`|fEGSig3Zaa	Get the stripes that you put over like your chin and nose and other places one your face. you leave the stripes on for like 15-20 min. they help me but I forgot the name of them.|`|wD9PVU3haa	you can put toothpaste on it and dry it out over night or you could just put makeup n it|`|Cq2u8K9Iaa	windex girl. It's weird but it works.|`|nGVoyPoEaa	try an acne medicine|`|0ZgoLkz8aa	i use toothpaste once and it cleaned my face|`|139gItikaa	don't pop it! it'll get infected and swollen, then make it look even worse.<br>  just wash your face, but on some acne medication then use cover up<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|W98JltiMaa	pop it or say mabye do it some other time and tell him he will understand
fXqiQzp6aa	i'm mixed too (im half black and half white), and it all depends. my sisters and i generally tan, but if the sun is particularly harsh or i'm in the sun for too long i sometimes burn on my shoulders or nose. it's only happened like twice though lol so i wouldn't worry. <br>  but you should still wear sunblock. i know it's annoying but black and mixed people have just as good a chance of getting skin cancer as white people (even if you don't get sunburn!)|`|zjWKkHPqaa	im mixed (filipino and white)<br>  and i dont burn badly, i just peel on my face sometimes.<br>  it all depends on you and your skin...some people just tan, while others burn or peel.<br>  since you've just been tanning, you'll prolly keep doing that, or it'll be a really mild burn/peel situation.|`|Ta6y5u0daa	I'm mixed (half black and half white) and usually I tan well before I burn. I think it just depends how dark your skin is. If your skin is darker you obviously have more melanin which is a natural sunscreen. My skin isn't very dark, but has a light tan.|`|G0ljmbAvaa	You should always wear sunscreen.  It doesn't matter if you are mixed or not.  Everyone should wear sunscreen to prevent cancer and pre-mature aging of the skin.  That will also prevent sunburns at the same time.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hi IM 19 Mixed & a Proud Virgin<br>    Given that Black people also get Sun Tanned it stands to reason that people of mixed origin should also!<br>       Perhaps that was a Freudian slip SONG is a sunny word and a nice word to substitute Sun with.<br>     God Bless you and yours.|`|zFgQtN7Raa	tan really depends
qPpzUAs8aa	Definitely don't shave it with no guard on the clippers.  The shortest I would go without looking like a "skin head" ( I hate to say that, but it's true) would be a #2.  I would tell them you can't stand your hair and it bothers you a lot and it would just feel better for you if you shaved your head.  I'm sure they wouldn't mind?<br>  <br>  P.S. Short hair is suer nice on guys :)|`|XQ4OOqwoaa	hmmmmmmmmm <br>  ask your parents first, <br>  Don't shave it all off that's bad !! no no <br>  try using different shampoo \<br>  good Luck !|`|YwZSSwhMaa	can you please, pretty please with a cherry on top, post a pic of yourself so we can see your hair!?<br>  <br>  u can try and put some link in the details|`|26pGJRhwaa	Ewwwwww<br>  Ewwwwwww<br>  Ewwwwwwwwwwwww<br>  Iv seen so many people with no hair.. <br>  I think it is soo grows!!!|`|zJL0jqFeaa	heey im a hairdresser.<br>  <br>  just get a buzz cut, girls will like it :-)|`|PFm1dI55aa	Don't go for straight bald-status. That's a girl repellant. Just a little trim, maybe?|`|Xez2NzqOaa	very short buzz cut. they're so hott on guys..|`|ibpoLakuaa	i wouldn't go bald seeing as your worried about it too much. maybe going with the buzzcut at first and see how you like it and if you think you should just go bald then you can do that but at least with the buzzcut you would still have some hair :P|`|sm7DJGOoaa	i think shaggy hair is sexy, and buz cuts are totally wigger.
DlMsJPwUaa	Nowhere really, but you CAN go to a thrift store or ebay and buy a super cheap one you would never wear and ttake it off.|`|ee5LcXQraa	Send it back to juicy, they have a great policy, and should replace it if there is no other problems.<br>  Or go to a thrift store and but a cheap jacket.|`|U8lBt4Feaa	No where.

I recommend you do chunky highlights (with no uniform to it), because when it starts to grow out, it will look more natural. :)|`|SiaRRMJ2aa	i think that blonde on the bottom and brown on the top will look good. The other option would be to just have brown highlights all over.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Forget it.|`|quoizD3zaa	the brown. blonedes okay but i like brown. its ur hair

CpoPZaQTaa	i was 11 when i had my first boyfriend.<br>  we lasted 7 months.i think its okay as long as you don't do anything stupid like have sex and start kissing. i think your too young.<br>  all i did was hug and rarely hold hands. if u ever get a boyfriend i think you should take it slow. don't rush yourself just because you think your old enough.|`|z1gUsqzHaa	So long as it isn't super serious and you don't go "too far"|`|FvjbdPNPaa	yes....boys are going through the whole sex-crazy-phase|`|xEmIhOc3aa	yes 12 is very young....maybe 15 or 16|`|4kgJNCTEaa	I think you are never to young to have a crush. Although, I do feel you can be to young to date. I dated young and really all I got out of it was drama. In my opinion your probably not ready to appriciate someone for who they are yet. Also the fact that you have to ask is proof that you're not ready. If you ask me I say keep him as a friend, get  to know him, and if you like him, then date him in high school. Then you'll already be able to trust him and know what type of person he is when your old enough and ready enough to date :D|`|KuJXcGZTaa	Personally, I think it is. Every time I see someone hugging in my school (I'm in middle school) I laugh inside. I'm like, "You don't even know what a relationship is." It drives me crazy how everyone thinks it's cool. They're all like, "Omg! Did you hear that Katie broke up with Dan?" "No way! Are you joking?" Ugh. And congrats for realizing the truth! You're pretty cool.|`|ckM1lYwoaa	Yeah, wait until you are ready for a relationship. 12 is too young and can stir up drama !<br>  <br>  12 is also too young to be on Y!A, you have to be 13 hun.|`|SMv0Xj20aa	yes, it is. at twelve you end up thinking your inlove when really they don't know what love is and then they get caught up in heat of the moment situations and do things that they will regret.|`|6E17I3jnaa	its alright as long as the boy is around the same age and they aren't doing anything sexual besides snogging. lol sorry I've been reading harry potter...I had to say snogging. making out. same thang.|`|OLJekQVwaa	It totally is! Just worry about being a kid! Its way better than have an immature boy as a boyfriend! Trust me!|`|q90ozSQ9aa	YES, you dont know what love is. I would not worry about getting a boyfriend mate.<br>  Relationships at your age do not last long, your friends may feel they have something special but it won't last.|`|7fsqT04Iaa	yes im 20 and never had a bf|`|URpJodMLaa	Depends on how you're defining what a boyfriend is.<br>  Is it a crush?<br>  Do they claim to like eachother a lot?<br>  Is it sexual things?<br>  Or is it just because they want to be cool because everyone else has a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  It all depends on how you define what a boyfriend is.<br>  Personally if it were sexual things then deff. having a boyfriend at 12 is WAY to young. But if it's like a puppy dog crush or something like that then it's fine. Kids around this age are confused and wanting to fit in and be accepted. So kids may think that they love this person and are boyfriend and girlfriend when in reality it's more of a social thing.<br>  <br>  When people say that you don't know what love is at that age is totally wrong. How you determain love is by your own standards, and how you view what love is. Because many people view as different ways. I personally fell in love with someone at 15 and now i'm almost 19 and to this day I still am in love with that person though we are no longer going out. You can also claim to have more than one love. I believe that love is defined as caring for someone and going through hardships and end the end you still have feelings for that person, you still care about that person and that person is still in you heart.<br>  <br>  But like I said defining a boyfriend depends on the person and if it's to young or not. Love also depends on that person as well. There is different kinds of love towards people. I'm sure most people don't love their other half like they do their grandparents or parents.|`|3T0KClccaa	Well, think of it this way - the point of dating, is to find someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with. So what's the point of dating at such a young age when it's pretty obvious that the relationship won't go as far as marriage.|`|cyEi99Upaa	I'm 16 and haven't had a serious boyfriend yet. Be your age and have fun. The best advice I can give to you. Don't rush a relationship, because you don't want to end up pregnant at an early age. Just have fun and worry about that stuff later.|`|DyHD3Qx5aa	yea i think so. but im 13 going to be 14 next year and really want a bf... lol. <br>  15 is like the best age for that stuff in my opinion... :)|`|s8URbvwraa	If your gonna be swaping spit than no. but as a boy friend, you can hangout and enjoy eachothers company|`|761X9qo9aa	What would you guys even do?<br>  <br>  I mean you can't really get money to go on a date or whatnot. and 12 year olds hooking up is just weird|`|1NPVVxW0aa	It's not too young to have a friend who's a boy.<br>  It's WAY too young to do anything adult or sexual.|`|vKoa9mQsaa	well, you can't really do anything with him. i would say so. but you can have crushes though!|`|LiiDOQWqaa	yes of course what if you were dumb and got married at the age of 13,14 it could happen with alot of young people|`|xqIu84S4aa	thats to young im 18 and still havent found a serious boyfriend|`|QG1w0t2daa	I think yes.|`|mRWAn2vHaa	I think so.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	yea.........<br>  its early..|`|32N7lygtaa	depends on what kinda love you mean|`|ZT7Rp8OKaa	yea. trust me your making a mistake..|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Not just YES, but Heck yeah.|`|IurrHmvMaa	no. im 12 and like, everyone in my skool has boyfriends.
24Xy8qWtaa	Your eyebrows look.. blue-ish.. maybe it's just the photo but they're a really bizarre colour.<br>  Anyway, personally I think you should change the colour of your eyebrows, lighten them up a bit or at least make them more brown.|`|bUATSZsaaa	Maybe 1 shade lighter than your eyebrows would be good.|`|40zMUQMGaa	um... dye it brown.<br>  Every blonde girl i seen, known have their eyebrows brown. It looks great... so dont dye your hair.. just the eyebrows.|`|nHJk5BlBaa	i would dye your hair the same color as your eyebrows, or maybe a shade darker than your brows
tusCN8zpaa	You totally should get the bangs, it would add some edge to your hair, it looks a little boring lol no offense.. Maybe some little streaks in your hair too. ;]]|`|CpoPZaQTaa	i think it would be better if you cut ur bangs straight across you forehead but not too short just right above your eyes. or you can get side bangs similar to the picture but a little shorter.<br>  hope this helps :)|`|gSIGZmq8aa	there was no picture/?>Q<Ksdfew|`|7nrhPCf0aa	yeah|`|nKYkk6ataa	don't get bangs! you're so pretty, those bangs would ruin your pretty face! you should maybe get some of your hair cut so you have really long bangs, like enough to do a quiff, and keep them our of your face and then do a quiff sometimes, that would be so pretty, but don't get bangs to put down on your forehead=) not like a super quiff though haha=P|`|iPje1iyGaa	I think those would look really cute on you!  To style them like that, first you need to blow dry them forward, and if they're not straight enough, run over them with a straightener.  For the piecey look, try a hair pomade to hold it in place like that.|`|11QzdN87aa	yeah you would look good<br>  when you get them cut pay attention to how your hair dresser styles them, if she does it a certain way and what she uses..|`|RXSu3VNdaa	Bangs. It looks more interesting|`|vcNOuvPNaa	You would look GORGEOUS in bangs!! Get them ASAP! :P haha i love your hair !!!|`|Jusnu14oaa	YEAH THAT WILL LOOK FETCH ON YOU|`|7mmmGytpaa	you'd look good cause you have a biggish forehead :)|`|6OkIzEoQaa	go for it baby... :)|`|0Qd9btGFaa	yeah totally! i say go for it. you only live once so take risks. and i definately like those bangs..and even if you end up not liking them, you can always pen them back and make a little hump with it-so cute. I really like that girl's hair its awesome. Just do it. jump outside that boxx. I think it will look really good on you. Since your hair is long and straight, i think once you get a new haircut, you can start styling and cutting it your own way..like making your hair your own and owning that hair! just go for it and make your hair you want it to be. Go for it!|`|blZfb4g1aa	no you wouldn't look bad, but since you have long dark hair i would recommend  cutting your bangs all across your forehead.|`|KTHx4RXsaa	First of all..beautiful hair:) and beautiful girl..<br>  and yes..you would also look good with those bangs:)|`|eORymXoSaa	yes yes yes yes yes all the wayyy!|`|AA12111573	oh yeah you could rock it<br>  I would say straighten them and part them kind of to the side should be work well|`|UWHG2m6aaa	to be honest, i dnt think it would suit u that well. Try getting advice on what hairstyles would suit your face shape.<br>  Good luck! xD|`|xgWf3SKxaa	yes :]<br>  <br>  hair straigtener and hairspray help|`|p0pDGL6zaa	Print the pic and show it to your hairdresser!<br>  Don't go to a cheap hair salon, they will ruin your hair!<br>  so go somewhere expensive (if you want what your looking for, its always expensive but so worth it)<br>  GOOD LUCK.<br>  ps. i like your long hair aha.

uD7giDNjaa	My fave quote from the book is:<br>  <br>  <br>  “Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were the stars- little points of life and reason. Then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. And there was no more reason for anything.” -Edward to Bella when he was trying to convince her that he still loved her.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you could talk about how after he left, there were just pages with the month written on them, because she was so numb.<br>  <br>  Baaaaah I can't read New Moon without crying.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Sounds like you'd better start reading!

7VjhcEk8aa	The key to achieving a glowing face with make - up is to use all three of the above hand in hand. <br>  <br>             How to:<br>    <br>                         Step1: Cleanse and moisturize <br>  <br>                         Step2:  Apply foundation according to skin type. A powder finish for oily skin or a creme foundation for dry skin.<br>  <br>                         Step3:  Apply a pink or peach blush to the apples of your cheeks. Then apply a bronzer  right under the apples of the cheeks, under your jaw line, and along your hair line to both contuor and give that glowy look.<br>  <br>                         Step4:   Apply your concelear under your eyes and on your "T Zone" ( the middle of your forhead, nose, laugh lines, and chin) <br>  <br>                         Step5: Omit if you have dry skin!!!  With a powder brush lightly dust your face with loose powder.<br>  <br>                         Step6:  Lightly mist your finished face once with toner.  Hold bottle about a foot away from your face when misting. This will set your make up and make it last through out the day.<br>  <br>      Good luck!|`|Yue2YKTnaa	powder<br>  use a bronzer for a glowy look|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I like foundation but couldn't love without powder. So if I had to pick one it would be powder. I think you can get shimmering kind to make your face more glowy. I use warmth from I.D. Bare minerals and it makes my face shimmery.|`|7g3LGsZxaa	If your face is pale and you want to add color, try using a bronzer (lightly dust onto cheekbones, nose, chin, forehead - wherever the sun would naturally hit) instead of getting a color of foundation that doesn't match your skin naturally. If you do get a darker foundation, people will be able to tell (usually because your neck, ears, chest do not match your face). <br>  <br>  Try something like MAC's Mineralize Blush in Warm Soul, NARS Bronzer in Laguna, or Benefit's Boxed Powder in Georgia or Hoola<br>  <br>  For concealer's I use MUFE 5 Camouflage Cream Palette (No.1), because I can use one or a mixture of the colors to cancel out any redness on my face or the darkness under my eyes.|`|Rg4YOHGhaa	You should try BB creams! :)<br>  <br>  The BB Cream, aka Blemish Balm, is the hottest beauty product in Asia right now. It has the advantages of both a makeup and skincare product.

jcEtRUVZaa	It's not that big of a deal. Ideally, you should only use a hair pick for a while and not wash it for a couple of days. If a perm took well, the piece you combed will spring right back to it's permed self.|`|W05lqxGHaa	For me,, no coz it would make the perm bad i mean it won't last long if you keep  on combing it|`|qGh1HhPwaa	If its now straight, go back to the store<br>  Perm = Permanent until it grows out or badly damaged
3EBGykXEaa	I would say you could do a nice smokey eye if you wanted. that would really make your eyes pop with your grey dress! if you dont want to go that dark, you could try a light lavender or cream color eye shadow, and mascara, maybe a little eyeliner if you are comfortable. Experiment during the day before the party and youll find a perfect match. :-)|`|zcbvIbRjaa	try aly and aj's makeup on like whoa on youtube or look up party makeup looks.
4KDDFobnaa	You shouldn't use sun screen when you go tanning or are out in the sun at all, until you start to burn or turn pink. Sun block blocks the UVB rays, which are the good rays that your body needs, and lets the UVA rays, which are the bad rays, in. If you use sun screen you probably won't get as tan as you would if you didn't use it at all. Tanning makes freckles worse, so if you want freckles, I wouldn't use sunblock. If you don't, use it.|`|ykdaQarAaa	If you use sunscreen your freckles and tan won't change.

If you use it enough, your eyebrow hairs might get lighter. You know, it looks more natural when your eyebrow color is as dark as your roots. That is, if you're blonde, which apparently you are. You want to be careful using chemicals like that; your hair might fall out!|`|NHvYiT27aa	no go to a beautician and let them do it, its not that expensive and they know what they're doing you have to be very careful when doing that cause you might fry your eyebrows or it will be hard and yuk|`|0AkFH1M2aa	is your hair naturally blonde? if it is then you shouldnt care what people say.
AA10614861	Well I have lots of advice, but it may be a little long (Sorry) :<br>    First, to get your hair straight get a straightener and if you want curly hair then get a curler. Also, buy some hair spray because it will help keep the hair spray the way it is longer. Plus, if you want you hair to be shiny put some hair gloss on it. Remember, if you put hair spray and gloss to wash your hair at night so your hair won't be oily. I recommend to wash your hair every 2 days or every day so it would have that freshness. If you wash your hair, try to don't use the hair dryer that much because if you use it a lot, it may give you split end. However, if you wash your hair late at night and is falling asleep. just use the hair dryer or else you could be migraine as you grow older, better be safe than sorry, so wash you hair earlier to let it dry naturally. <br>    Second, eat as healthy as you can because the types of food can change your look. Like if you eat to much fast food, you will get fat. If you eat too much salty foods like french fries, they might give you pimples. Fibers could help get rid of toxins. Also, stay away from sugar such as chocolates, cakes, candies and etc. because they could give you lots of unwanted fat. It is important that you eat all of your meal, breakfast, lunch and dinner, because if you skip a meal you might eat more in your next meal and that might cause you to gain some fat. Each meal should be equal. Also, between each meal, have a little muffins or something healthy so you won't over eat. Remember to eat a little of everything.  <br>    Third, exercise. Exercise help keep you healthy and allow you to look skinner. Women with really good stomach muscles, their stomach won't puff up when they're full. If you walk to school try taking a longer route, or when you're biking. If you drive to school, try to stop a few block before you reach school ground, and walk, this will save gas and good exercise for people that are busy. Also, if you take the bus to school, try to walk past your usual stop and go to the next one. By the way, when your walking or sitting make sure your back is straight. Exercise is a great way to bet fit and give your body an attractive look. <br>    Next, makeup. Im guessing that you're a teenager/young woman. I think that makeup is necessary because you're young and you should show your youth instead of covering your whole face with powder. Some makeup girls commonly use would be eye liner/shadow, mascara, chapstick/lip gloss, and facial cosmetic powder. I suggest just use the eye liner/shadow and lip gloss/chapstick because mascara will look so ugly if you cry and facial cosmetic powder just makes you look older than you should.  Eye liner and shadow help emphasis your eyes. Plus, lip gloss and chapstick helps makes your lips soft and shiny. Lotions are great, it help keeps the skin soft. Hand lotions and body lotions are a must. They help keep the body soft and smooth. Shower gel is also a great source to keep your body soft. Bath and Body Works is a great place to buy lotions. Another important factor is to get enough sleep. Get at least 7 to 8 hrs of sleep because if you don't get enough sleep than the makeup wouldn't look as great. Also, before sleeping, do a facial masks this help a lot and make your face all shiny and soft. To use a facial masks, remove all the makeup and up it on for like 10 min and throw it away. <br>    Last, clothes and acessories. Have you seen fashion magazines and wonder why the models look so beautiful in their clothes? Well, its simple because the stylists knows which clothes would look best on that model. I don't actually know how you look like but I'm going to put some examples to help you figure out which types of clothes fit you. If a petite person, you might want to buy tops that reaches your waist, and longer pants. An average person would want to try to have tops that a bit longer and the top and pant should be almost the same length. However, a taller person would want to wear a top that probably covers her waist and hips. Skinny jeans are a classic, so you might want to buy a couple of skinny jeans. You might be able to find some a Ross but it might be hard, and they're cheap there. Store like Hollister, have cute clothes but it's pretty expensive. White, black, jean, grey, and beige are the easiest to match with each other and this colors are a good combination with other colors. For example, white and blue. If you want to get a guy attention, wearing red would help. The brighter and skiner the fabric is, it might make you look fat. Velvet and dull color tends to make someone seem skinner. Also, you have to determine where you attract the most attention, focal point, and try to show off your focal point. For example, if you pick your hair to be the most attractive part then wear something on your head so people will notice your hair. If it's your waist then you might want to wear something tighter on the waist or wear a belt to show your curves. If|`|UVscrbwkaa	Buy things you wouldn't normally buy, but stylish if you know what i mean. Like if you see someone in your town thats wearing something you like.. try find something like that in a shop.<br>  And nobody's hair is ever the same the next morning when you have come back from the salon lol.<br>  Try curling it. Often has a good look on some people.<br>  And don't wear eye shadow, its just.. not 2009.|`|9X7YBQl3aa	Substitute clumsiness and jerky movements with graceful and fluid actions. You'll feel like a fake if you just clump along while walking. True "girly girls" sort of look like they're floating. <br>  Buy clothing that fits and gives you a waist. The stores Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, Nordstrom, Hollister, Limited Too, Wet Seal, Aeropostale and Pacsun are suggested, but you don't have to go by these stores. <br>  Remember: makeup usually makes you look polished. Lip gloss and mascara is perfect for everyday wear. You can also wear cheek tints and eye shadow, if you want. Foundation makes your skin look flawless, but too much can look fake. If you can't use makeup, don't worry, your face is all ready pretty enough. <br>  Groom yourself every day. A good grooming routine everyday, is taking a shower, and shaving. Apply body lotion. The last step is perfume. Pick a custom scent for yourself to be your trademark. <br>  Look after your hair. Make sure you comb it with a wide toothed comb or a brush, wash it every day or every other day, depending on your hair type, and don't use too many hair products. Straightening your hair every day could cause serious damage, so use a heat protection spray! You can also go for soft curls. <br>  Keep in tip-top shape. Don't eat too much dessert. It would be smart to eat low-fat (or fat-free) foods. Exercise daily. However, this doesn't mean starve yourself. You don't have to be stick thin. As long as you're healthy, you're fine! <br>  Take care of your nails as well. Treat yourself to a pedicure/manicure, & make sure to keep from biting your nails, picking at them, etc. People notice your hands more than you think, and jagged nails don't look very nice. <br>  Use mostly pastel colors such as pink and baby blue. Especially pink. For girly girls it is a must have color. Purple is a very pretty color as well. However, you can still wear, red, green, black, etc. Just because you're a girly girl doesn't mean you have to wear pink or purple all the time. <br>  Have a bright personality, bubbly and happy. Don't giggle all the time, because people will find that really annoying. Instead, make other people laugh, and be really cute. Don't take yourself too seriously. Be sweet and friendly, do not yell too much. <br>  Get girly clothes - skirts, cute shirts, accessories, jeans, cute shorts...anything pink is good. Make an effort to look around. When you first start coming out of your "comfort" zone you won't like anything and will keep saying, "No" to everything you see. Go to every store you can. You might get tired of walking around, but just looking is a big step! Go with your friends who have style or with somebody who has any style different than yours! Let them help you, but develop your own style and don't just copy theirs. <br>  Wear jeans that fit. Don't wear low cut jeans if you don't feel comfortable, but make sure your jeans fit you. Not tight, not baggy. A belt is okay, but the fit says it all. Try on lots of brands, styles, cuts and sizes. Not every size jean will fit the same depending on the brand. The same goes with shirts. Not tight, not baggy. If your shirt is so tight you can see your bra or you have trouble getting your shirt off of your back, then it's too tight. If your shirt is so big that you can pull it up and see your belly button then it's too big( nothing against belly button shirts)! Things like camisoles are supposed to fit tight. <br>  Keep your teeth nice and white. There are several ways to get the perfect dazzling smile. If your teeth are crooked, don't shy away from braces. Just think of them as jewelry for your teeth! For whitening, you can either do it yourself at home with a store-bought product (such as crest white strips) or go to a dentist that also has expertise in the area of cosmetic dentistry to get them professionally whitened. <br>  Be romantic. Girliness is also associated with romance sometimes. Be sure to read/write romance novels and develop a keen interest in poetry. You can also make this your music style by listening to love songs. <br>  Listen to pop music. <br>  Hang out with gal pals. Girls love the mall, shopping, and almost anything associated with beauty. Get a group of friends and have a shopping spree, makeovers, a sleepover, or any girl-related activity. <br>  Keep a diary. Draw girly stuff in it, like , hearts, metoyou, other cartoon characters, flowers and write poems and stories and so on.|`|FqFzLPvtaa	CLOTHES: Stores like Ross, Mervyn's, & even WalMart are great places to find cute clothes at cheap prices. A lot of people wear skinny jeans, but depending on your figure, you want to get something that makes you look slim & shows off your curves.<br>  MAKEUP: Great eyeshadows for any color eyes are gold, blue, green, & red. Make sure they aren't too bright, tho, because it will take attention away from the actual eyes. Use a brown liner on the top lash line & a pretty dark black for the lower lashline. Black mascara on only the top lashes.<br>  HAIR: Put gel in your hair while it is still wet & comb it straight. Let it air-dry. Then take a straightener & carefully straighten locks of hair only a few inches long & not very thick. Then, comb it out & straighten it more if you need to. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped! :)|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Start simple.

N4JTdvwiaa	alright well what i would recomend is a short dress because right now its the hottest there is out there, i would say a v curve on the top would be stunning :] and defanitly red, white, or a light pink. now for the hair, in my opinion updos are pretty with the strapless and then having it down would be more in the sexyy side so i would say a nice updo would be nice, and then for jewelery... a diamond necklace or pearl, diamond earings. for shoes.... defanitly white heels with little rhinestones on it and the reason heels are the best is because it'll make u have great posture :D so i hope that helped :]]

uRqm4Bxcaa	I had the procedure and you'll have a bandage on from anywhere between two and five weeks.  I think I wore mine for about 3 weeks.  Honestly the bandage or the 'mask' and gauze is more for blood etc. than just the actual structural cosmetic look.  Also the healing depends on you doing what you're supposed to:  sleeping properly (and not rolling onto your nose) drinking fluids juice etc. and using the nose drops they'll give you.<br>  <br>  This is heavy stuff and if you aren't 120% sure about it, don't go through with it.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	well lets see....<br>  my brother had his nose broken and the surgeon had to bash it back into place, so he basically got a free and very painful, traumatic nose job cos of some a.s.s. nd he wore a stiff plastic corner bandage for a week or two, and had to be very careful, couldnt go out in case it bumped.<br>  <br>  It wasnt too painful for him afterward.<br>  To be honest though, i think nose jobs are vain and lots of people end up stil unhappy with their appearance, and find somehting else to fix, as it is merely a matter of boosting your self confidence. You would actually be better off seeking guidance in self help books or something, then you would boost your self confidence and feel great about yourself, and then you could spend the money on a new wardrobe!<br>  Besides, you can always tell when someone has had work done...everyone has their own 'flaws' that make them special (:|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Don't get a nose job. If it goes wrong you could wind up looking like Micheal Jackson lol.

hmzMd5TLaa	Really play up your eyes with a lengthening mascara in black. Use brown eyeliner, really thin (if it gets thick, you'll look like a clown). You can also try a brown smoky eye (youtube has a ton of great tutorials), purples and greens would look good also.|`|3EBGykXEaa	for day to day, you can do really simple stuff. like a nice brown mascara, and a brown eyeliner. if you want some added touch, you can do a smokey eye effect with brown/cream colored eyeshadows. i personally like revlon cream shadows because they last and have a nice added glow to your eyes.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	It's hard to say what colors will pop on you with out knowing what the base colors and highlights that run through  your hair, skin, eyes...<br>  If you see, for example, hints of green in your eyes I would use natural light pinks to make them shine or even shimmering gold. <br>  With really pale skin pink or reddish blush makes you look sun kissed, with olive skin colors in the brown family will suite better. <br>  <br>  Again, it's really hard to say how to accent your features and high points with out knowing what they are. I would just be sure to keep it simple. Some times a bone colored shadow with black mascara looks so elegant, even though it's the simplest application.<br>  Try the event makeup artist for more in depth help.|`|uMj5csRdaa	go to target, walmart, a good beauty supply store or someplace like that and get any of the following products (eye shadow):<br>  <br>  "Almay Intense I-Color Powder Shadow Trio- Bring Out the Hazel"<br>  <br>  "Physicians Formula Shimmer Strips Custom Eye Enhancing Shadow & Liner- Hazel Eyes"<br>  <br>  "Organic Wear Duo Eye Shadow Hazel Eyes"<br>  <br>  and for eye liner just use a dark brown or black depending on the color of the shadow.

AA11942043	Try cute flats in black for shoes. <br>  And sadly that is a problem with skinny jeans. One way to cover them is to wear a long (really long) cardigan. The Boyfriend/Grandfather style in black. should hit below his, but not quite to mid thigh. than throw on a black and white graphic shirt underneath and that's all.<br>  Only button a few buttons on the Cardi or leave open. Closing it will only make your hips look bigger.<br>  <br>  (if red in black isn't your thing, try all primary colors, (yellow/blue or grey shoes<match the cardigan><br>  shirt with red/yellow/blue on it and a grey cardi.)<br>  <br>  To make them look smaller anytime else, you have to draw attention away form them. A long top, (try a baby doll) can help. It should hit in the middle of your hips or longer.<br>  <br>  And the best way to look tall that I've discovered, (I'm 19 and 5'3) is wide-leg pants and heels. Or wedges. anything to get your feet off the ground.<br>  Hope it helps! ^_^

ThE5yYqaaa	hey i wuz just like u and i'm 17!!! i just got my seconds done on saturday and seriously i was SO surprised i felt like nothing!! seriously hun it doesn't hurt! the best way i can describe it is someone just like touching your ear with a toothpick... (not forcing it through... just like pinching it) seriously it's absoloutely NOTHING and it's over so fast i didn't even get a chance to react! lol bring a friend with u to destract u and you'll seriously not even notice... i was very nervous 2 but really it's nothing... and yes i agree with everything everyone else is saying about not getting it done with a gun!! guns damage your ears because think that you are literally "shooting" a blunt stud through your ear... and just moving the skin around the stud instead of cleanly removing a microscopic piece of skin with a needle... seriously needles are SOO much better!!! get it done by a professional and make sure they use a hollow needle! oh and it heals A LOT better with a needle as well... and you won't get the "after pain" associated with gun piercings...<br>  <br>  it doesn't hurt more (because i saw ur additional details) and ya i didn't remember getting my ears pierced for the first time either... i wuz about 3 months old as well! lol so ya don't be scared u can do it!! it really is nothing... i was sooo happy afterwards :D lol and all u feel after is the "hot" sensation... but it's not even that bad... TOTALLY worth it :D mine were a lil hard to sleep on the first 2 nights but after that they were GREAT :D it is now going to be a week tomorrow i got them done and they're already like almost completely healed! they don't hurt at all... not red... nothing! i should be able to take out the starter jewelery in about 5 weeks :) <br>  <br>  my advice to you is after you get them done use a sea salt water solution and clean them (using a q-tip dipped in this solution) twice a day... don't touch your ears excessively! and make sure you wash your hands before cleaning it! also DON'T turn your piercing!! it can actually harm it on the inside... even if the piercer told u to... seriously just move it BACK AND FORTH (in the direction it is already going) as if you were pulling it out and putting it back in... do this only when u clean it so that the solution goes inside to... you'll feel it when it goes in as it will slide easily and feel wet :) then you can just dry the excess and get on with life :) lol<br>  <br>  it's well worth it :) i love mine :) good luck! you will do great! i promise you will barely feel it! :)|`|nKL7v9vbaa	Not at all. I did my second holes myself and it was fine. Ear piercings don't usually hurt in the first place, whether using gun (which are not so safe, or hygienic for that matter) or a needle|`|kBn3UsjTaa	It really depends where though. You may first want to consult your parents or doctor! :)|`|wNXq55tWaa	nope its over in a second :)|`|zmjAccMFaa	Nope not any more than your first hole.<br>  Just make sure you go and get it done professionally, this is a place that uses a needle and not a gun.<br>  <br>  Why a needle?  Because needles are sterile unlike a piercing gun.  Needles actually hurt less than a gun because it causes less pressure to the ear.  Type why are piercing guns bad into Google and read up.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions feel free to ask.|`|96ydDKocaa	no more than the 1st maybe even less because your older i have 3 holes and by the last on e it didnt really hurt|`|dwUVFRgOaa	ill give you one peice of advice, make sure you get it professionally done. Not with one of the guns, those can jack up your ear. Keep it clean and it should only sting when you first get it done!|`|7oVCFgeiaa	No more than the 1st!

A 13 year old girl should not wear make up. Just because everyone around her is doing so, it does not mean that she has to do! A girl at 13 hardly has any flaws!

xzJi0bcSaa	Have you tried different hair styles? Thats a good way to be different without damaging your hair, or a different color? I used to have medium length hair that was a dark brown, I dyed it black and layered it which looked neat on me. I would suggest maybe trying a different style and color?

It's usually $100 at my old hairstylist.<br>  <br>  She's also very friendly and is so sweet. I can basically talk to her about anything really.

TjPwxbuJaa	Well, I may get bashed for this, but one way is to wrap your 5/8 inch plugs with tape. I have used teflon (plumber's) tape or electrical tape. Many say that electrical tape is bad, but when worn only for a short time, I haven't had any problems, and it is easier to work with than plumber's tape.<br>  I've used this method several times in the past and now have 1 1/2 inch very healthy stretched ears.|`|OJQqbIu4aa	you can go to www.bodyartforms.com i dont think you need a credit card.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and i think that silicon ear skins are easier to stretch with even though its not recommended
FmvnC8keaa	If they are juniors sizes there is a different secondhand store called Plato's Closet where they pay your for your gently used brand name clothing. (Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle, Aeropostale, and different brands of that sort) I recently went there and sold about a bags worth of old clothes for 60 bucks. If your jeans are not accepted by their buyers then you can try re-donating those jeans or giving them away to charities, special olympics bins which need clothing donations, etc.|`|lOguMWVGaa	sell them on ebay or garage sale. u never know who will buy them|`|nvYt8FV7aa	you should give them 2 like a thrifty store or give them 2 the poor or summin.|`|nXloT3Iiaa	Recycle them by making a denim bag or hair accessories.

zih1Weanaa	How can people help you when they have never had zits or oily skin?<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to control the oil during the day so it doesnt sit on your face when you dont have access to wash it for a few hours, so first off, get some oil absorbing sheets. I use Bare Minerals, and they are pretty good. I use about 4 per day, two at a time just to be sure.<br>  <br>  Then, make sure everything you put on your face is oil free, and dont touch your face with oily, dirty fingers.<br>  <br>  Try a moisturizing gel and a good, gentle acne fash wash.<br>  <br>  The oil will never go away, but it can be controlled.|`|nGVoyPoEaa	drink A LOT of water. Clean your face regularly soap and water. Eat less foods with oils and fats (ex: fast food, sweets etc.) and eat more foods like fresh fruits and veggies. Get a little exercise.<br>  <br>  and you can use this throughout the day to control oil!<br>  <a href="http://www.beautydeals.net/shop/details.html?id=5533&utm_source=Google_Base&utm_medium=Feed&utm_campaign=Feed" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautydeals.net/shop/details....</a><br>  <br>  I got this for my bf when he had that same problem and it did the trick. :)|`|uJnvFKyLaa	Lush has a face bar, it is pink and awesome.|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	stop eating at mcdonald's|`|Yu3jLy9vaa	omg... icnore that... get some visaline face cream... i use it... but i've never had promblems with zits... i just like the way it feels on my face... lol!! use it... in about a week it'll heal!!!|`|PFm1dI55aa	Try Neutrogena products, they did the trick for me. I especially like their oil-removing cleanser.|`|w1QuVAX2aa	MAYBE TAKE A FRICKIN' SHOWER EVERY NOW AND THEN?|`|WQV4cfSuaa	Well, to really reduce oilyness, get a great pressed powder. Go on bobbibrown.com and check out the oil absorbing powders. They might be kind of expensive but they work SO well! The aveeno clear complexion line will really help with your skin. The oily all of a sudden thing happened to me also, and it hasn't gone away yet, but i've learned to control it. A product called Aczone has worked super well for me, but it is perscription only(you can see a dermatologist and ask them about it). hope I helped :) <br>  <br>  p.s. what is probably happening to you is natural. Depending on how old you are your skin is naturally doing this. but, it usually has nothing to do with your diet or what your doing.|`|H6uYThgjaa	i noticed when i eat foods that are higher in fat, my skin gets oily. i wash my face with neutrogena for acne twice a day. since my skin is also very sensitive, i use eucerin facial lotion with spf 15 or 30. it's very mild to the skin, yet moisturizing. if you have bad pimples, apply an acne ointment with salicylic acid before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  these 3 items really help to keep my skin under control. took me quite some experimenting too.

t2LOcPkLaa	Yeah, they automatically keep sending it to you. You can cancel it though, just do it right away. Honestly though, I wouldn't recommend Proactive. Everyone I know that has used it says it dried out their skin-- it's really strong.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Honesty every dermatologist I have had preaches against it. <br>  <br>  I get an RX cream called Differnin. I takes about 2 weeks then my skin is completely clear. Even if you paid out of pocket to see a dermatologist it wouldn't be that much more expensive then subscribing to proactive.<br>  <br>  In the meantime what works best for my skin is Purity face wash 2 times a day. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P7109" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  In the evening I use rubbing alcoholic after washing then rinse with cold water and put Aveeno sensitive skin moisturizer on. If rubbing alcohol is to harsh for your face witch hazel will work as well.|`|TAvPmMQ3aa	Try Accutane.  I hear its the best stuff you can use.  And it works.  Ive had a few friends take it and their skin cleared up better then anything I've ever seen.  It's just a six month program.  You take three pills a day.  After the six months I can pretty much guarantee your skin will clear up. It dries the hell out of you face and back and arms and especially lips but its well worth it in the end. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/accutane.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/accutane.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The reason these topical face washes don't work is because they don't get to the source of the problem.|`|hAFxcxP0aa	There is a free trial after you buy it where they give it to you. If you dotn think its working or youy dont like it, simply return it in an amount of time. I suggest you buy it and then cancel it after a couple of months. Search it up and read about it. I have searched it up for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.proactiv.com.au/Proactiv_AU/default.aspx?utm_source=jumboaffiliates&utm_medium=cps&utm_campaign=proactiv" rel="nofollow">http://www.proactiv.com.au/Proactiv_AU/d...</a><br>  <br>  Theres a bit of helpful info on it, read about it before you buy it.<br>  You can buy it separatly if you look around in different shops.<br>  <br>  It costs a lot and manufactures are making a lot from it. Im veyr sorry to admit this to you but - it is not good stuff at all. I have used it and many of my friends. We have all found out that its making out skin oily and removing pimples very slowly.<br>  <br>  After i finished up with Pro Active, I started using Clearasil. It is absoloutley amazing stuff! Its great! within one week of applying it daily, my skin was glowing and pimple-less. You can buy it online, through phone calls or just go to your local chemist, shopping cnetre or mall and buy one squirty pumper container for only about $15.00 dollars. It is so good that after my pimples were gone, i used it still to keep them away and trust me, it works like heavon.<br>  <br>  Try it or continue on wiht Pro Active.

You get any three of their products for 40, any four for 40, and any 5 for 50, plus S&H. <br>  <br>  If you use it only once a day, it can last four months. Once a day would cut down on the skin drying. <br>  <br>  I would def order it, it is 100% refundable, even if you use it all AND like it, you can still return it.

gWufVQfSaa	You know, if you put your conditioner only on the ends of you hair [like, any hair not touching your scalp], then it'll keep it from getting so greasy.<br>  I'm not sure if it'll help your entire problem, but it may help a little. :]|`|rBLviASYaa	Try a dry shampoo! They make them in small enough bottles that you could carry one in your purse. <br>  They are really simple to use and most come with a set of directions, or have them on the back like normal shampoo bottles.<br>  You could use it when you are in the bathroom washing your face or whatever at night...<br>  It's great stuff.. haha<br>  I have a bottle in my purse all the time because my hair does the same thing.<br>  <br>  o. and talcum powder works too! you just sprinkle a little on your roots<br>  <br>  try either. they both work fine.<br>  and seventeen magazine aparently recommends talcum powder.. haha =D<br>  <br>  anyway<br>  good luck and have fun at your friends.|`|4OGtxtPHaa	Try using a dandruff shampoo such as Celson Blue. I have the same problem as you and it helps a lot. Like other people said, cut back on the conditioner and never use a 2-in-1. That's bad for your hair. <br>  Try rinsing your hair in as cold as water as you can stand and make sure you get it totally rinsed out down to the scalp. When it's dry, flip your head over and brush your hair out from your roots to ends to distribute the oil. This makes it soft and shiny. Hope this helps :)|`|yMfH4YlEaa	hello why dont u go 2 ur friends house and why dont u tell your friend wats happenin with ur hair she will tell ya she is your friend.|`|OGgx927Vaa	Wash it<br>  Condition it<br>  Rinse it out thoroughly <br>  Brush it<br>  Blow dry it<br>  Straighten it<br>  <br>  Viola!

Everyone carries their weight differently.<br>  <br>  Imagine two females both 5ft6 and a US size 12. One has measurements 39-29-41, is muscular with 25% body fat. The other has measurements 39-33-41 with very little muscle and is at 35% body fat. The first woman would be totally average and healthy, while the second woman would not. The difference is the body composition and way the weight is distributed. <br>  <br>  So just stay fit and healthy and don't worry about the size on the label!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps : )|`|qq4Da51jaa	Size 12 in the US is chubby but not fat.|`|MRODFWgmaa	Good for youu:]<br>  and yeh it is pretty big

jWmnSXlLaa	Try youtube.com I went there last night and watched several different videos on makeup techniques and tips. It was very helpful. I reccomend using a moisturizer then use a primer and lastly your foundation.|`|tusCN8zpaa	How to Apply Eyeshadow<br>  <br>  1. The first rule when applying eye shadow is to blend it well so there are no harsh edges. Put the very light shade (high lighter) on the space beneath the brows up to the crease of the eye lid.<br>  <br>  2. Apply the medium shade on the upper eyelid only. Use a lighter shade under the browbone to highlight the eyes.<br>  <br>  3. And the darkest shade on the crease of the eyelid that is the place almost in the middle of the total eye area-above the lashes and beneath the brows. Blend both the colors well.<br>  <br>  4. With the tip of a fine brush, apply a little shadow beneath the eyes, along the lower lash line. Smudge it lightly to give your eyes a subtle, glamorous look.<br>  Applying Eyeshadow Tip submitted by Pav<br>  <br>  Purple eyeshadows tend to look stunning on brown eyes as does green on hazel eyes, gold on green eyes, and for blue eyes use a blue eyeshadow in a lighter shade than your eye colour.<br>  Eye Shadow Kit and Colour Choice<br>  <br>  Your eye shadow kit may contain 3 shadows-a very light shade (vanilla, very pale pink, beige, silver grey etc) which is the high lighter and which gives a light shimmer on the brow bone and highlights it. The box has two more shades of the same color. Light base shadows in pale pink, yellow, cream or beige look good on small eyes; spread over the entire lid with a touch of dark shadow in the outer corners, these accent the eyes.<br>  <br>  Apart from colour, there is a choice of forms of the eye shadows. You can choose from pressed powders, pencils, sticks, gels, crayons and creams. Pressed powders are still the most popular form of shadows, because they are the easiest to apply and control. These are available in pearly and matt textures. The effect is not long lasting, but if you apply them with a wet brush, you can get a deeper effect and increase the staying qualities of the colour.<br>  Powder and Cream Eyeshadows<br>  <br>  Powder Eyeshadow: This is the most popular type. These come in pressed cakes of powder either with a small brush or a sponge applicator. You can build up their density from barely there to dramatic. Apply using a damp brush or sponge if you want a deep colour for an evening look.<br>  <br>  Cream Shadows: These are oil based and come in little pots or compacts. They are applied either with a brush or your fingertips. They are a good choice for dry skins that need extra moisturizing.<br>  Stick Shadows and Liquid Eye Shadow<br>  <br>  Wax based, you smooth these onto your eyelids from the stick. Ensure they have a creamy texture before you buy them, so they would not drag at your skin. Usually Liquid eyeshadow come in a slim bottle with a sponge applicator. Look for the cream-to-powder ones that smooth on as a liquid and blend to a velvety powder finish.<br>  Picking Your Eye shadow Colors<br>  <br>      * Eye shadow colors matched with skin tone, eye color and hair color is what makeup experts recommend and neutral looks good on everyone.<br>      * The first step towards applying any eye makeup is to pat some powder onto the eyelids to matte them and keep the powder eye shadow from creasing. If using cream eye shadow, this can be skipped as creams will clump and clog with the dry powder.<br>      * Eye shadows need to coordinate with eyes and hair, not than clothes. Browns, lavenders are best for blue-eyed, blonde haired women as well as light brown eyed-ladies. Smoky grays, bronzed pinks and silver toned peaches look good on women with green or black eyes.<br>  <br>  Eyeshadows Makeup Tip Suggested by Visitors<br>  <br>  Try applying an eyeshadow that matches your skin tone. Apply to the lid all the way up to the eyebrow. Then apply a walnut colored eyeliner on the top lid, then smudge. Put on a dark brown mascara.  You will look sophisticated, but very natural.<br>  <br>  NEVER wear red eyeshadow if you are a blue-eyed blonde. It seriously makes you look like da devil. Or the American flag which is worse.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Know your style! and work it! show off you inner beauty with your eye make up! <br>  Don't apply harsh colors to cheeks especially if you have larger pores, this will help with the invisibility of your pores. If you don't have visible pores still use this tip because it will look fake and you will get the stripe that is mentioned a few tips down. <br>  Focus on one part, or two at most, of your face. Don't use a bold hue of lipstick with stand-out eyeliner and a bright shade of blush. Instead, zero in on the eyes and lips, or blush/skin. Keep it simple; don't over-do your makeup applications. <br>  Quality is always better than quantity. If you have $50 for your entire face, don't get 10 cheap things, get 4 good-quality things ($25 foundation, $10 mascara, $10 for blush, and then a $5 lip-gloss <br>  When you apply eyeshadow, it's common for specks of color to fall onto your face. This is a pain to get rid of after you've already perfected your foundation. If this happens frequently, apply your eyeshadow first, clean up the mess and then apply foundation. Alternatively, if there are only a few specks, you can just very carefully pick them up off your skin with tweezers. <br>  Eyeshadow sometimes falls onto your eyelashes and on oily skin, and it can smudge underneath your eye. To avoid this, use a make-up wipe or a cotton bud with a little make-up remover on it, and gently sweep it over your eyelashes from root to tip to pick up any leftover eyeshadow. <br>  To prolong your eyeshadow staying power use an eyeshadow base. A really good one is Urban Decay Primer Potion (UK ￡9.50, US $15.) Or you can use a good vitamin E cream (this also moisturizes your skin) <br>  Try to buy non-comedogenic makeup (it won't clog your pores; it says on the back if it's non-comedogenic.) <br>  Make sure all of these colors go with your skin, eyes, and hair colours. <br>  Use a liquid-to-powder Foundation to save time and skip powder application. <br>  For the best results, apply your makeup with good, natural lighting. <br>  Make sure that your lips do not look chapped or cracked before you put on lipstick. If your lips are chapped, lightly brush off the dead skin cells with a toothbrush or towel. Next, apply a chap stick with an SPF of 15 so your lips will look great all day. This way you have a nice, smooth, clean canvas to work with. <br>  Keep in mind the difference between day makeup, night makeup, and special occasions. Day makeup is light and tinted with neutral colors. Night makeup is more strongly tinted but never very heavy or caked on - use stronger colors. Special occasions take special items like false eyelashes, liquid liners, and highlighting under the eyes - look at the magazines around awards season. <br>  When choosing eye makeup, take the occasion into consideration. For everyday makeup, just use a pencil. Black or dark brown will do--but remember, the only women who should use black are those with black hair. Match your hair color (original), if possible. Liquid eyeliners are best for special occasions. Your eyeliner should be more natural looking for day makeup, and can be a bit heavier for evening looks. If you want a more dramatic look, dot the eyeliner under the lash line, then use the angle brush to blend. Your mascara will bring the eyes out more. <br>  Always apply a foundation that contains at least an SPF of 15. If your foundation does not contain sunscreen, apply a separate sunscreen before starting your makeup routine. Wearing sunscreen will keep your skin looking healthy and decrease the likelihood of wrinkles. Look for something that is oil-free to reduce the chance of getting acne. It will also smell less strong. Your make-up might also turn a different (darker) color that will not blend with your skin tone as well. <br>  Take as much time as you like! It allows you to figure out what looks best on your face. If you try to rush, you might do some damage to your skin by dragging. <br>  If your skin doesn't look smooth, put foundation on before the other makeup, making it look smooth. <br>  If you are an active person who needs to wear makeup to the gym, make it waterproof. <br>  Have waterproof makeup remover available, and make it part of your daily routine to clean any and all make up before going to bed. <br>  Sometimes they have free makeovers scheduled at the mall on a walk-in basis. It's fun, and you learn a lot about your skin without spending a ton of money. <br>  The amount and type of makeup that you wear is completely up to you. You know your face better than we do - take the time to experiment. Makeup is, quite literally, the art of painting faces. Experimenting allows you to find what works best for you. <br>  Try using tinted moisturizer instead of foundation. It looks more natural and it's much easier to match to your skin tone. <br>  Always curl your lashes before applying mascara... If your lashes don't stay curled well, or you need to keep them curled for a long period of time, try blow drying your eyelash curler before using it. Just make sure it isn't too hot...|`|0lewWYJdaa	you just need to experiment for a while until you get a feel for it.<br>  it took me like 2 years to be kinda good, and im still not the best.<br>  but when i started out, i CAKED it on. i mean like black eyeliner all around my entire eys, and dark purple eye shadow, and i SUCKED at puttin on mascara so my eys looked skwinty and small. that was really bad seeing as im asain! lol<br>  so just dont put too much on.|`|e8b42803cca27f15ab897dbc4a0227e7aa	Youtuber macaholic18 is pretty good :]<br>  Just check out Youtube and Wikihow for some more tips :]<br>  <br>  oh yeah, PurseBuzz is another good makeup-tip Youtuber, too.|`|yn72mHCcaa	yah, just go to youtube,  but make sure it looks natural.  like no clumps, not a huge blush line (when theres too much blush) u know|`|sBGqBYJqaa	Just put it on light and make it look natural don't load it on it looks bad but yeah so just put  light blush and bronzer and put light eye shadow on and light mascara|`|bhyUX6kkaa	You should try the event makeup artist.<br>  I used it to better my own appearance and now am a professional makeup artist thanks to them.<br>  <br>  <br>  www.theeventmakeupartist.com

Let it grow. You will be so mad at yourself if you cut it. You should trim it. A trim is not going to hurt. In fact it will make your hair look better and healthier. And it is not going to stop it from growing. A little trim compared to the amount your hair grows each month is not going to effect it. And yes you should get some layers or get it thinned out.  Good luck., And keep it growing you will be happy.|`|uXN063Toaa	Actually, trimming your hair makes it grow faster because your getting rid of split ends. Also, hair that's one length grows faster. (: So, I would get a trim to however deep your split ends are (ask your stylist) and trust me, you'll be so much happier with your healthy hair. Thick hair is only beautiful when healthy. Hope this helps.|`|sm7DJGOoaa	get a mullet.<br>  <br>  <br>  sexii.|`|ztuGabXOaa	if you want your hair to look soft and shiny for your cousins wedding, you need to trim it.  but you should do this thing called "dusting". go to your hair salon and ask for your hair to be dusted. this means that only about 1/4 inch is going to be taken off. it's perfect for you because it will get rid of the split ends and keep all your length (regular trims cut off 1-2 inches).<br>  good luck!|`|UQkgk7ffaa	if you cut the split ends it WILL grow faster<br>  plain and simple<br>  also to prevent future split ends, use redken real control<br>  after you shower, and apply to the roots of hair, do not rinse out|`|zJL0jqFeaa	get a trim and get a hairccut with layers so you wont feel so heavy :)

UeJom5WKaa	many white people look fine with micro braids. Extensions are very expensive though. I would recommend just getting the hair you have done. That way, you can save some money.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	If you just let anyone do them, then no they will not stay.  Here in San Antonio, there's a few African shops that do micros better than anyone and one jamaican shop.  They tie the hair in such a way that the braid does not slip out.  They charge $180 to $220 here, and it lasts me 2 1/2 months... longer if I wanted but I need to be fresh ALWAYS...|`|6ccuJbLbaa	I've gotten my hair done in tiny braids before, and it'll come out good...I have straight hair and im white. lol.<br>  Anddd, they wont laugh at you!

mRWAn2vHaa	there is a bitter nail polish that you put on your nails that gives them a nasty taste when you put them in your mouth.  It was recommended by my son's orthodontist.

gjMkNCrQaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  For 1920's , we have the flappers ; as you've cited. Another, the clothes of males on that decade are shapeless and looser.The bust was suppressed, the waist disappeared, the shoulders became broader and hair shorter and shorter.<br>  <br>  On the skirt length, there is such the elusive hemline. Gradually by degrees the skirt lengths on dresses gave the illusion of being first long and then shorter with dipping, scalloped and handkerchief hemlines in floating fabrics.  It was only in 1925 that skirts rose 14 to 16 inches (45 to 50 cm) from the ground making the shorter hemline we associate with the era.<br>  <br>  In 60's , you must have bouffant wig; hippie female adult costume. Or Barbie's clothes will surely do.<br>  <br>  <br>  1970s - flouncy gypsy clothes, embroidered peasant tops.<br>  <br>  Men wore heavy make up and grew long hair. Women wore short hair and layers of clothing in 80's , wide shoulders are at vogue, and it's arduous to go anywhere without a jacket, but a complete suit does. Diana Princess of Wales was the fashion icon then. <br>  <br>  Finally, in 1990s, Diana Princess of Wales was the fashion icon too. Retro clothing and clothes with neon colors proved preeminent. The tight lycra or black leather mini skirt, also known as a tube skirt, was popular. <br>  <br>  I hope it answers your imperative.<br>  Expressing my gratitude!<br>  God bless!

TKf6z1vHaa	I have the exact same problem and I have been trying to cover them for about ten years now, (i'm 21), anyway, what I have resorted to is I just use undereye concealer to cover them. The area around your eyes is really delicate and you should be careful with what products you put their because it causes wrinkling. I would just go with some light concealer, most people honestly won't notice. I hardly get noticed for mine. I've only been asked once what happened or why they were purple. But good luck.|`|5cK3ed4zaa	you need cucumbers <br>  and then after sprinkle <br>  a little baby powder<br>  to reduce purple blotches<br>  <br>  also lately stores have made a tool<br>  that reduces puffiness and redness<br>  <br>  like : garnier has one<br>   <a href="http://www.garniernutritioniste.com/en/#home/eyeroller" rel="nofollow">http://www.garniernutritioniste.com/en/#...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  its about 13 dollars at local drug stores<br>  <br>  also garnier's website has tips

b6kbdBFqaa	Honestly, getting your ears pierced isn't so bad if you're having just the earlobe pierced.  I got mine piereced twice on both my ears, and I was so nervous.  But what I usually do, is focus on something else in the room and the pain is only temporary, 3 seconds at most.|`|XMFdD8vIaa	It may hurt for a little while after the piercing, but don't worry, they will probably look great. When i got mine pierced, i got some sort of numbing cream called emla (from the drug store, which i put on my ears--i didn't feel a thing!

Any mask I have used has always dried out my skin, so i apologize i dont have one to reccommend. i know that if you have dry skin, go for a moisturizing mask, oily skin a thick mask, etc. i would only go for about once a week, 2 at most. you could search on google for facial masks depending on your skin, and that may help you better than I can. Just make sure that the mask is oil-free, so it won't clog your pores and give you blackheads. Good luck though! :-)|`|tbKZLynQaa	That depends on the type of mask you are using.  Some moisturize, some dry out your skin.  But I wouldn't do them more than once a week.

fjTVAbdBaa	First of all I have looked into getting a tat on my finger as well. From what I read, tattoos on the underside of your finger tend to fade a lot faster because they are constantly rubbing on things. <br>   When you are working with the public like that you really have to be careful how you appear to them. A visible tattoo like that might give some peopple them impression you are immature or unprofession, therefore they won't take you seriously. You don't want your pay check to walk out the door. I would keep my tattoos in more conservative areas.|`|PAZWfnFtaa	I think as a professional, anything that draws attention to your middle finger would be problematic.  If you want a tattoo, put it somewhere you can cover up.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I think it would look like crap because it's impossible to tattoo anything well on the palm of your hand or the palm side of your fingers, and anything you do tattoo there just blurs out and fades in a few years.|`|kCdISEGqaa	A lot of artists won't do them.  I don't, but, both of my artists in my shop do, but, they charge a minimum of $200, regardless of how small it is.  It's kind of their way of trying to get the person to change their mind.  Finger tattoos age poorly, and don't always heal the best, so, people come back asking for free touch ups.  If you do find an artist that will do them, they may not guarantee the tattoo and will charge for touch ups.  My husband is a teacher, and has tattoos on his wrists, and it has never been a problem.  But, a tattoo on your middle finger?  That may send the wrong message in any field.|`|N0d961nhaa	i don't think that would be a good idea<br>  if you want to become a therapist<br>  just because some patients<br>  may not appreciate tattoos<br>  and all that stuff<br>  so if I were you,<br>  yeah I would go with a place that is not visible to your clients.|`|2EobcGqqaa	That's a hard question. In my opinion, I am a  teacher and for the sake of doing something I love; I refrain from putting tats in visible areas. So you'll have to decide that yourself. Good luck...|`|Ccj8Y0tZaa	i think a little celtic cross would look nice on your finger

GZKbvXLLaa	You mention that you went to a 'professional.' It depends on what your definition of a professional is. Are you talking about a tech in a shopping mall discount salon that charges like $25 for a full set? Or a tech that does a full set for really cheap, and in about a half hour or so and you find it difficult to communicate with the person because of a huge langage barrier? I have found these have the very least professional of all techs, and they will typically use Dremel drills on your natural nails and file them down to nothing -  supposedly to make the acrylic 'stick better. That is so unnecessary, but then again we are talking about unskilled workers here, so it doesn't surprise me one it. <br>  To answer your question, nail services should NEVER cause you any pain, or discomfort in any way. If you do experience any pain, you are most likely going to the wrong salon. Avoid the cheap, discount salon chop shops at all costs. Americans seem to love their $15 dollar fills done in 20 minutes flat, but they don't know the truth about these salons. Yet, so many women seem to flock to these chop shops and line up to get some cheap nails applied and call it good. I don't get it. My suggestion is to find a highly reputable salon with experienced techs who actually take pride in their work. It will cost you more, but the end result will be so worth it. Just avoide the cheap places. And don't let any tech use a dremel tool on your nails - ever. These tools were not intended for use on nails, and are illegal to use on nails in many states.|`|ohkoVSpzaa	When I get mine done, they never hurt. Maybe you are allergic to something in it. I hope this helps.|`|itiJVgRsaa	either you've got really sensitive skin or they don't sanitize their implements. dremmels can hurt too. sometimes places dremmel to deep and leave divets in the nail. or when they file into your skin with a diamond dust nail file. did any of these things take place? that could be why you are hurting. otherwise, you should NOT be hurting at all.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick products up locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <br>  Some other great curly care sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a>|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	I use the Matrix curl line.  But Garnier Fructis curl line is great, too.<br>  <br>  However, the MOST important thing I do is use a leave-in conditioner.  I also use a curl cream (both are garnier fructis), NOT mouse or gel.  Mouse drys my hair out, and gel gives is a trashy wet look.<br>  <br>  Also, if I'm going to wear it curly, I don't brush it at all after I get out of the shower.  I might finger comb it, but that's it.  My hair is pretty long, and this all works for me!<br>  <br>  If you want to blow dry it, get a diffuser, flip your head oer, and scrunch and dry!|`|W8cf9Dxjaa	I also have naturally curly hair. You should use Pantene curls mousse. It works very well!|`|DRZMb7HPaa	Ok. I feel your pain. After years of fighting curls and straightening it everyday. I finally just gave in. I like to use heavy conditioners on my hair just because curly hair is very dry and it needs alot of moisture for it to calm down. Also washing your hair everyday can increase the friziness just because it basically doesn't allow your hair to soak up all the natural oils it needs. My stylist told me to wash my hair like 2 times a week. I know it sounds gross. But our hair doesn't get all nasty and oily like most peoples hair does. So try the shampoo. And if you want to wear your curls. I will let mine dry and go over them with a curling iron. To make them more defined. And it looks awesome. I always get compliments on it. Also putting layer in your hair does make it curlier. That's what I do but I like my hair. Also sorry I could go on and on. When you wash your hair don 't ball it all together and lather it up. Just start at the scalp and go all the ways to the ends like you are smoothing it out. This help your hair not to frizz. And when you get out do the towel the same way. Just just squeeze your hair in a downward motion. And that should also cause less frizz. Spray in some leave in conditioner. Because again. Your hair needs all the moisture it can soak up. Hope this helps.
zmjAccMFaa	Yes the grow closed.  Who knows how long it would take, that depends on your body.<br>  You are not likely to get an infection if you care for them the correct way.<br>  Did you get your ears done with a gun and use a bottle of solution they gave you?

It's cheap, it tingles, it smells fresh and clean, and it leaves your face feeling smooth, not greasy. I've used it since I was about 11 or 12, and I'm 40 now. I've tried lots of different cleansers, but I always go back to Noxema.<br>  <br>  As far as razors, I used to use a Venus and it worked really well. I use the cheap daisies now, and they don't cut quite as close so the hair comes back more quickly.|`|3EBGykXEaa	Im not familiar with the mary kay you were talking about, but i use olay exfoliating scrub. its simple, doesnt dry out my skin and keeps it fresh. <br>  <br>  for the razors, i stick with venus. it hardly ever cuts me and lasts a while. try the embrace one!

PRCfCSDxaa	Who are you hiding the piercing from? <br>  <br>  Well, my sister is hiding hers from our parents. She bought a nose ring and told my parents she would go around school with it on but it would actually be fake. So they were ok with it. After wearing it for two days, she pierces her own nose and my parents still to this day, don't know it's pierced lol. <br>  <br>  My sister had to constantly take it out for basketball practice/games and they last for about two hours. She said it hurt like crazy when she put it back in but she still managed. You can't take it out for that long though when you first pierce it because it's basically like re-piercing your nose everytime it goes back in. Trust me, she's my twin sister, I'm with her wherever and I know how she feels lol. <br>  <br>  Don't cover the hole up with make-up. It's such a small hole you can't even notice it so when you take it out, no one will recognize it anyways. The make-up will cause an infection which are extremely easy to get on your nose if you do not keep it clean 100% of the time. If your nose is a bit swelled up from the piercing, just tell people that you are getting a zit lol. <br>  <br>  The site on the bottom is of a retainer to put in your nose when you take out the nose ring so it doesn't close up. Just ask for them in stores such as Hot Topic or other stores with jewelry and they supply these for ya!<br>  <br>  Good luck with the nose ring!|`|AA12351337	Yes, and you can also buy one of those clear piercing things.  If you get the right kind, no one will notice.  A friend of mine got through most school with it in so the hole wouldn't close up (we weren't aloud piercings at all on the face in high school, except ears).<br>  But good luck getting a good job you want with a nose ring.|`|H6uYThgjaa	it first has to heal completely before you can make that into a routine. otherwise the hole will close quickly, or you could risk infections. even after it's healed the hole is clearly visible.|`|N7vjmH6Uaa	no cause it closes really easy unless you  clean it with rubbing alcohol to carterize it to keep it from closing but it takes about a week to do so|`|vqmainCJaa	I have mine pierced and you aren't allowed to " take it out or change it " for at least 6 - 9 months (says the people who do it).<br>  Anyway, getting your nose pierced is A LOT different than any other piercing. If it falls out and is out of your nose for more tha..4 or 5 hours the hole will close up. I've had mine for 3 years and about 8 months ago it fell out in my sleep and closed up...<br>  You can (if youre good with pain) get it done then put in a clear one right after. Those you don't really notice and if anyone says anything just say its acne or something. <br>  To clean it, use anti bacterial soap twice a day. And whatever you do..DON'T TOUCH IT UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO<br>  <br>  I've had mine done twice and my sister just got hers done 2 weeks ago :)|`|zih1Weanaa	Try getting it pierced with a clear stud so nobody can really see it. Also, some people use a tiny piece of bandaid the color of their skin to cover it up with. Then it just looks like a little mole or something.|`|2n1PbzbRaa	do you want to hide the piercing or the ring<br>  piercing: poop on it<br>  ring: take it out and poop on it|`|InslW3QMaa	nope because you have to keep the piercing in for 6-8 weeks or it will close up or get infected good luck|`|2DRWQxP3aa	make-up?|`|chPwS1BIaa	geta clear one|`|Qf4uCPo3aa	make up or something of that nature?|`|MaDN7knJaa	band aid will do the trick!!|`|SUxpgIfnaa	ok so this is what i do, you cant use the same cover ups over and over you have to switch em up a bit.<br>  <br>  first time u see them put some sort of cream over it just a little dap should do it, when they ask whats that for convince them you have a really bad pimple and ur trying this new cream.<br>  <br>  next time you see them put a small bit of bandaid over it, the might not notice but if they do just say you miss read the creamm and it said for it to work you have to have a bandaid over it.<br>  <br>  after that use a bandaid and if they notice say the pimple left a bit of a mark but it should go away.<br>  <br>  then repeat until its healed, then you can put a retainer in (clear ring) and they shouldnt be able to see it at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  hoped it helped.. it worked for me! (:|`|SoSy4SwXaa	well if you take it out for periods of time it'll grow back within minuites. so you can't really hide it.|`|PFm1dI55aa	You can't take it out in the beginning stages of the hole healing process. Try turning your head?|`|PXN5XGcBaa	You can use a band aid..you'll look funny but at least it wont be seen|`|xtcSsPPwaa	you can chop your nose off<br>  there you go...|`|RW3SzwINaa	'id say make up although if you did take it out there'd be a small hole|`|OheLX0Ibaa	dude dont even get ur nose peirced its retarted!|`|gGxEzhbiaa	am i the only one who thinks this is the dumbest question on earth?|`|0AQF8pnKaa	i don't think it works that way because they'll see the hole in your nose and your nose will be slightly red, plus the hole will start closing up if you do that. <br>  <br>  try just convincing your parents, it's not really trashy or anything.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Take it out and use foundation makeup to cover the hole then clean it out before you put it back in.
f36589e6e79860b7c91907c99e22a735aa	I don't have my ears pierced and I'm 17!  My parents just never did it when I was young, and I never really felt the need to.  I know 97% of girls have them pierced, but why not be unique?  Especially if you're 13 and your mom says no, just wait.  If you really want them later, then do it.

qPpzUAs8aa	I think a woman can look so amazing with a bald head. I think you have to have small features though.  And a nicely shaped head.  For sure do not shave it completely bald.  It is so much easier to shave your head if you are ethnic, than it is for a white woman.  Look at Halle Berry. She looked amazing with super short hair.  Yet Sinead O'Connor looked sickly.  If you are trying to help your scalp...just remember you may be able to get all your dry skin cleared up for the time being, but it will come back if you are not using good products. And it all depends on how you will feel about yourself with a shaved head.  If you think you would be too embarrassed to go to work like that, then you won't want to go out in public either.  A wig can be really nice, but when you wear it, your head can get sweaty, hence it may not clear anything up.  But if you just don't want to deal with your hair, then shaving it and purchasing a human hair wig would be ideal. They have a lot of beautiful wigs out there that you cannot tell the difference at all!  The first link I posted is a link for very dry scalp. I swear it's a miracle shampoo!  The second link is a very good conditioner for the scalp, also the shampoo would be worth a shot for regualr everyday use, but not to clear up dandruff.  The third link is wigs by Raquel Welch that you might find interesting! Good luck girl!|`|1NPVVxW0aa	It's likely people might assume you have cancer and lost your hair through treatment.

There is something about when your hair is short it seems to grow really fast. I think it is a very brave and courageous move to do. And I applaud anyone who does it. And if you really want to then do it. And as far as work and school you can always sport the do-rag. Who cares what other people think. Just be yourself and you will be fine.

It might even make it worse. A bald head with pimples....<br>  <br>  If you want to try it for a faddish fashion and think you can pull it off and are comfortable with it, go for it...<br>  <br>  Just don't be surprised if you get a negative reaction from some people or have people stare at you. It is not culturally accepted for bald women. I mean it is not with in what is considered "normal".<br>  <br>  I am for freedom of expression. Not everyone feels that way and some people will probably say something about it. People can be rude and criticize openly. Both kids and adults. We never really out grow it.<br>  <br>  If you are a strong woman and that type of stuff don't bother you then more power to you. You will get more respect if you wear it and hold your head high and not complain about it. <br>  <br>  I would also keep wig or two handy, in case your regret it later.

My daughter's have natural hair and it's easier to manage than relaxed (they are African btw). It's a myth that natural hair is hard to manage...many women with natural hair simply wash their hair, apply a curling product and walk out the door in under 5-10 minutes. You should make sure you are using a good flat iron.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to buy products that can help with your hair, the Mineral indulgence line is really good (I use the kid's line for my daughters). A technique that I picked up from one of their newsletters is when you press the hair with the Shea and cocoa butter hair cream or dress to impress styling pomade. You then distribute a teensy bit of Kiwi coconut hair smoothie evenly through the hair...then "wrap the hair" in a beehive. Take some saran wrap and wrap it tightly over your hair, and sit under a hooded drier for like 15 minutes. When you get out your hair should be REALLY shiny, soft and silky, and you shouldn't have to reapply product until your next wash. I did it and my kid's hair turned out really nicely. If you are relaxed it will do well on your hair...plus it's a natural product line, so some of the products can help you out with breakage and hair growth. <br>  <br>  I used the Kiwi Coconut hair smoothie afterwards to put really pretty deep waves in their hair as well. After you take down your "wrapped" hair, you braid the hair in four large braids and put on a silk hair scarf. In the morning you should have BEAUTIFUL waves. It acts as a deep conditioner as well...so you can use them in multiple ways.

jez0O0bXaa	Because you have already dyed it you will have to use bleach it to lighten it.  Have you thought about highlighting it to give it more dimension and cause less damage then all over bleaching.  Since you aren't experienced with bleach you should go to a salon because you can cause a lot of damage with bleach. Cost depends on where you live and what type of salon you go to.|`|I2gat01haa	you should do it in a salon even though it would be easier at home.<br>  but you dont want to really damage your hair.<br>  salon products are better|`|UVscrbwkaa	Well if you wanted to go dark, then you could just try dying it a darker brown.<br>  My hair used to be bright blonde and i dyed it brown. mine worked first time.|`|xJ0tDHSiaa	I had a friend bleach it at home, and he got blind in his right eye. Also it sucked too. Go to a salon with professionals, don't care about the price, well wait, do care about the price but care if its to high.|`|OdMUV49Jaa	salon i know its expensive but my friend bleached her own hair later on the day when she tried to straighten it, some of her hair fell off! :O|`|aSP60sZraa	With dirty blonde hair u should be able just to dye it.
9QF6GGyiaa	It will hurt yes. I've had my nose pierced for three years and to this day it bleeds when I change it. The reason why it hurts and bleeds is because the nose piercings I use  have this little metal ball at the end to prevent it from falling. When I first got my nose pierced I had a stud with a long end that bend to give my nose room for swelling. If this is what yo u have as well then it won't hurt as bad. Its just the cartilidge starts to grow bak around the piercing. Hope this helps/ makes sense. =)|`|I7a9vimkaa	im not really sure if it will hurt the first time because i changed mine a month after i got it...i deff dont recomend that, but i did it because the stud came out of the original one. i would recoment puting in one that twists not the kind with the ball on the end because they hurt alot to change and the twist kind dont hurt as bad.
ND4wPcQkaa	I'm a 34 C and i love Victoria's Secret bras. Specifically the Very Sexy bras. I've never found a better bra anywhere else. They feel so comfortable and they push-up really well.|`|gWSWRUAbaa	I am to bras how some women are with shoes...<br>  for me the best bra I have ever found was a cheap one at target. Yup out of all the places I've got bras my all time fav was a simple one from target.<br>  However, the best style of bras that work for me are the strapless ones. But I wear them with the straps, The cut of a strapless bra is the best that works for me. Lifts and looks fuller. and it gives my boobies that perfect smooth perfect shape. I suggest the Ambrielle bra from JcPenny. It's a little pricey but it's made of spandex and cotton.. it's great!|`|tXMDzQ9jaa	i don't think you'll be needing a "bigger look" if you're already a 36C. but if you really do, try push up. they are the best bra to give you cleavage and make them look bigger.|`|oCFLxIvoaa	well pushup bras definitely give u a bigger look. try calvin klein or victorias secret for nice bras|`|qq4Da51jaa	A push up bra. <br>  Go to Victoria's Secret or Frederick's of Hollywood.|`|FnR5anh5aa	any Victoria's Secret push up bra.

Pswqhimoaa	well, if you have a nice toned body guys are going to think you're hot...<br>  But i would drink eight glasses of water daily.

Get all your vitamins and minerals. that will help bring your hair more shiny, skin better, etc. Then curl your eyelashes [ you aren't using makeup... lol] to make your eyes pop a little more.<br>  Then just focus on styling your hair to frame your face.

idhcqr5Daa	Make sure your face is clean of any previous makeup. In general you don't want to over wash your face because that can dry it out. Just take a cotton ball and put either makeup remover or water and just dab or rub in small circles to remove old makeup. <br>  Make-up will glide smoothly onto clean, clear skin - so determine your skin type and cleanse, tone and moisturize with suitable products twice daily. It's quicker than it sounds - and it you have problem skin e.g. spots/blackheads like me choose exfoliaters etc. to use a well. <br>  Moisturize. Using about the same amount of lotion that you would toothpaste on your toothbrush, gently rub in an unscented, oil free lotion. The reason you don't want anything with fragrance or oil is because those can clog your pores causing acne. <br>  Find the right color of foundation. Get in a natural light and test the foundation to make sure it's the right color for your skin. When applying foundation, you don't want to overload on it. That is one of the main reasons for looking unnatural. Take a cotton swab and dot the spots on your face with foundation that need it. Most common places are under the eyes, side of nose, chin, forehead, etc. Then taking your finger or a sponge dab in the foundation, blending it until it looks like your skin tone. If you have bags or discoloration under your eyes, take the cotton swab and make 3 dots on the line of the circles under your eyes. Take your finger and dab it in gently. After you have applied the foundation make sure you blend! Blending is key to a natural look. <br>  Apply eyeliner only to the top of your eye and smudge it in. If you have fair/light skin or have lighter hair then use a brown eyeliner versus a black. A dark green, a darker purple, chestnut, and brown are all common alternatives to black liner. One of my favorite trick is to use white eyeliner. You're probably thinking, "White eyeliner? I'll look crazy!" Right? Nope! If you apply it right it can open your eyes and make you look more awake. Take a creamy white liner and line the tops of your eyes lightly. Then taking a cotton swab your finger or something else, smudge the liner so it looks blended. <br>  Concentrate on curling your lashes; it's is a great way to open your eyes without makeup. After you have curled your lashes you may decide if you need mascara or not. As before with liner, if you are fair then black mascara may be too harsh on your face. A brown or brownish-black will fit your face better. When you take the mascara out of the tube and see that clump of mascara on the brush, do you wipe it on the inside of the tube? Don't!! Take some triplet paper or a tissue and simply wipe of the extra clumps. If you wipe it in the tube then that only causes more clumps. Take the wand and start applying the mascara to the inside of the top lashes, brushing outwards. The apply to the outer lashes, brushing inwards. Finally, apply from the root of lashes to the top, zig-zaging the brush slightly to avoid clumps. If you see that your lashes are clumping together then rather than trying to fix it with the wand, take one of those eyelash brushes and sweep it through your lashes. <br>  Apply either bronzer or blush. <br>  Bronzer: Bronzer is a great way to make it look like you have a natural glow. Look in the images I have attached about the bronzer and apply it in the shape of a W as it explains. <br>  Blush: Cream blush works better than powder because it gives you a dewey look and lasts but either is fine. Make sure you have a natural colored blush. Fiery reds and bright pink can look fake. If you are using cream blush, rub a little on two fingers and then pat your fingers on the back of your hand to remove excess blush. Dab the creme on your check bones slightly, not very much blush is ever needed. continue dabbing until it is a smooth colour. If you are using powder, take an angled brush and swipe it through the power, then tap it on the side of the container to remove access blush. Pat the blush on your cheek bones lightly, and then brush upwards in small strokes until it is all blended. <br>  Take a damp washcloth and rub it gently on your lips to remove dead skin and make your lips look fresh. Put on some lip balm too. <br>  Apply a lip color that is the same color as your natural lip. Avoid lip gloss because it provides no lasting color, dries your lips, and your hair gets caught in it easily. You really don't need any lip liner for a quick natural daily look. However if you just have to, use one that is your natural color and blend! <br>  Cover up your skin a little, though - if you like, use a primer to help foundation stay, and then apply a little. You'll most likely only need it around the T-Zone (forehead, nose and possibly chin). Blend it so you have a light even coverage. Make sure it's lighter, the same or slightly darker if you've already bought it - but blended carefully - than your natural colour..or you'll have lines...the horror :O <br>  Use concealer on dark or red spots. Then, use a litt|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	make up makes you look old and tired|`|Yue2YKTnaa	different eye brushes and eye shadows and blush <br>  <br>  maybe foundation too if you need coverage for you whole face|`|Rg4YOHGhaa	BB creams :)<br>  <br>  The BB Cream, aka Blemish Balm, is the hottest beauty product in Asia right now.

SYUqU3Sgaa	A very hot style is to have your hair cut (very) short on the sides and leave the bangs, top, and back (very) long. This creates exciting, interesting contrast. It looks fantastic down, and, with a lot of product (like hairspray, gel, etc.), it can be converted into an humongous, awesome faux-hawk. You can have the transition between long and short more or less dramatic depending on how edgy you want it to look. You can also ask for layers on the long part of the hair. And, as always, go to a good hair stylist, the difference is incredible. This style would blow everyone away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	<a href="http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee136/suwarnaadi/000joejonas.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee136...</a><br>  this is what ui have.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	cut ur hair to a little below ur ears and then get side bangs that kinda flow into the rest of ur hair. straighten ur hair too. :]

5ZK9VGPCaa	Yeah try putting it in the dryer for a while. I have put mine in the dryer and I think they may have shrunk a little, which is good because I am in between sizes. Also try putting them on a hot wash, like for whites.. this may shrink them. I know that if you want jeans to shrink, you can sit in a v. hot bath in them and they shrink and shape to your body. It might work with shirts, you could try standing under a hot shower in it? lol. x
Ao5aSAWiaa	I have curly hair so when I take a shower, I leave my hair out to dry and I put a towel around my shoulders so my shirt doesn't get wet. After it air dries, I straighten it with the chi.

That will cause a dramatic dent in your hair near the top, which is really bad to look at. What you should do is corn-rows if you have skilled hands or if you don't, then french braid it. What this does is holds curls coming from your scalp so it looks more natural and more fluent, plus no ugly hair dent from straight to curly.|`|9Lhf9jiHaa	it sorta works but only put it in one bun cuz two was too small and when i did it with 2 and unraveled it it didnt really give me waves.. more like ringlets

But if you really want to know just keep looking for a made in China label. Real Louis go for $1500 to $5000 and up. And it's only $30 any ways its not that big of a deal and if it looks as real as you said it does then no ones going to know the diffrence. And the only way you can tell between a real Louis or a fake one is by the colour. And if your code number is in black its fake, real ones are imprints in a darker or lighter shade.

Some people may give me a thumbs down for suggesting a white lie, but in some situations, they are better than the truth. You don't want to hurt her feelings ~ and you certainly don't want her to become upset with you and give you a style that is not up to par (I'm not saying she would do this intentionally ~ but if she is worried that you might run off to another hairdresser, she may unconsciously not do her best work)    Anyhow, that is my advice ~ White lie to the rescue!

Also try using shampoo with fruit extracts they'll help strengthen your hair. A good shampoo would probably be garnier or herbal essances.

hLdIO43Xaa	Fleece shorts are usually more for comfort and lounging rather than a "I'm going out in public so I better look stylish!"   You can wear a similar A&F fleece hoodie in navy and a cute lace-neckline tank top under.   Tank top like this:  http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...    A knit halter or cute tee from there would be cute too! You should pick colors according to the shorts, since the lettering color is nice and if you picked a top that matched the lettering, your outfit will look very put together.

As long as you look good in the fur, well who cares right?*<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't buy fur.<br>  The fur ads you might see in magazines and commercials portray fur coats as a symbol of elegance. But these ads fail to show how the original owners of these coats met their gruesome deaths.<br>  <br>  PETA’s undercover investigations on fur farms have found that animals are killed by anal electrocution, during which an electrically charged steel rod is inserted into the animal’s rectum, literally frying his or her insides. Exposed broken bones, upper respiratory infections, and cancerous tumors were among the wounds and diseases that animals endured without veterinary treatment on one fur farm that we investigated.<br>  <br>  Animals caught in steel-jaw leghold traps are in so much pain that some actually chew off their limbs in order to escape. Since they are unable to eat, keep warm, or defend themselves against predators, many die in horrible ways before the trapper arrives to kill them. Others suffer in the traps for days until they are caught and killed. To avoid damaging the pelt, trappers often beat or stomp animals to death. Whether they are enduring the excruciating pain of a leghold trap or a lifetime of agony in a tiny cage, these animals suffer immensely<br>  <br>  Millions of fur-bearing animals including foxes, raccoons, minks, coyotes, bobcats, lynxes, opossums, nutria, beavers, muskrats, otters, and others are killed each year on fur farms by anal and vaginal electrocution and in the wild by drowning, trapping, or beating.|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	Why would you want to wear dead animals? It looks trashy and by wearing them you are indirectly supporting the slaughter of innocent animals for "fashion". Please don't wear real fur, get fake fur.

Pswqhimoaa	fix what?<br>  <br>  and i answered your question before. <br>  your body isn't that bad.. lol|`|G51N3XFsaa	If you are referring to lovehandles, cellulite, saggy bum, and extra overall body fat, then yes, exercise can fix all of those things. If you incorporate exercise into your weight loss plan, you'll be building muscle, which uses fat as fuel. Muscle also makes skin look tighter, which will dramatically reduce the appearance of cellulite (which about 80% of the female population has). Drinking water will also help not only because it hydrates and cleanses the body, but also because it gives your skin elasticity, which also reduces the look of cellulite and stretch marks. Dancing is one of the best forms of cardio, because it works all the major muscle groups in the body, so not only will you be losing weight all over, but you'll be toning your arms, legs, back, bum, and mid-section.<br>  <br>  If you follow through with your plan of eating smaller portions, drinking more water (and replacing other drinks with water), and adding cardio, you will begin to see dramatic results in a few weeks, and you WON'T need any cosmetic surgery because after a few months, you'll be amazed at the results. Stay motivated, and good luck!|`|KuJXcGZTaa	Why would you need surgery? Just stick to eating right and exercising. It pays off; just look at the Biggest Loser contestants.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Yes, it is perfectly safe--just be gentle. You're going to need to start at the bottom and work the comb through, then move up. Do not try to yank it through. Also getting a moisturizing conditioner with lots of slip will help. Right now I really like L'Oreal Vive Pro Hydra Gloss for dry hair. It virtually melts some of the tangles away. Also if you are having problems untangling it might be because you have dry ends, so try getting a trim. :)    Check out these curly links for more help:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    Hope this helps! :D    P.S. Just btw I don't think it's possible to have definition without a cream, mousse, or gel. Feel free to email me about it.|`|mxtWuadraa	I have EXACTLY the same problem!! if i comb/brush my hair when it's dry, all the natural curls (and i have a lot of them!) just turn into frizz and it looks awful!! what i do, is brush it through just before i wash it with a paddle brush, and then i shampoo and conditioner, and when it has the conditioner in, i comb it through. This gets all the knots out, so it's free just to dry naturally. Sometimes i do have to put some mousse in, just if i need to blow dry cos i have no time to let it dry naturally, and mousse stops it going frizzy!!     if you can, just let it dry naturally, because then the curls will fall properly and won't be frizzy!! =D|`|Nicf5B8faa	First of all you need to realize you got dry scalp going on. Trust me honey. I have curly hair was going threw the same problem just like you. Now my hair is hell lot o better.     What you first need to learn anything with too much alchol like Suave, Panatee = Wax will not clean your hair like you wish for it too.    I use treesme with remoisturize conditoner and deep cleansing shampoo. My hair comes out soft.    Too add shine you simply add hot oil twice week.  Hair serum daily.|`|roG7zEIvaa	I would recommend gently combing your hair whilst your in the shower. Shampoo as normal, then put the conditioner in. Try combing with your fingers first, then use the comb, concentrating on the ends then working up to combing from root to tip. When you come out the shower, squeeze the water from your hair by ringing it out, but DONT towel dry it as this will make it frizzy. Then use something like a leave in conditioner, curl creme, serum or even wax to wet hair and allow it to dry naturally for beautiful, frizz free curls! work the product in by twisting the curls in your fingers, as this will define them    hope this helps  xxx

wJ45gsyZaa	It depends on how much you need. I got extensions last year and for one package it was about 190 dollars (canadian). It also cost about another 250 to get them put it as they were glue in extensions. I DON'T recommend glue in! They got horribly matted behind the glue as they grew out and I ended up having to cut them out! Get clip in's. they'll last way longer and you'll feel a thousand times better.  Regis seems like a fine place to get them, but maybe just look around at a Sally's beauty supply or a shop specifically for wigs/extensions.  Good luck!!|`|qJMlzYQUaa	for a full head its usually about 30 id your gonna put them in yourself.  clip in ones are slightly more expensive, about 40  if you have them done at a hairdressers its about 180  but those prices are for 18 inch ones.  if you want any longer or shorter than that it will be more or cheaper.  prices vary everyhere x|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	I don't know about Regis Salon.

Then you can take them out and put them in yourself...they average at around 50 for a full heads worth. see how you manage them and if your ok with them you can consider sew-ins or glue-ins.  try www.brazillianhairextensions.com|`|Evz4rLODaa	you should reall consider clip ons and they're not that expensive... theres an indoor swapmeet by where i live that sells real human hair and they're pretty cheap.. clip ons don't look bad trust me. everyone uses them.. for ex. ashlee simpson had them on when she went on the ellen degeneres show and she looked pretty|`|8USyeYX6aa	they will kill your hair there like reli expencive too.|`|ynGeja7Waa	Well it depends whether you want bonded, clip in's or glue in hair.

qp4euvfoaa	In general tattoos heal in 2-3 weeks depending on your general health, the after care the piece received and the skill of the tattooist.     Generally, it will be sore up to 3 days, followed by about a week of peeling/flaking/scabbing, followed by a week of the newly regenerating skill relaxing over the newly healed piece.    Consult your artist with questions directly and they can look at your piece and answer your concerns.|`|LpDGxOD4aa	Your tattoo should be fully healed in 3 to 4 weeks (longer if you are diabetic).    Not everybody scabs.  Just because the scab has fallen off does not mean that it is healed.

If you can't tell & really want to know let the artist take a look at it & he will be able to tell you.|`|iGwRZNRkaa	It doesnt matter if it looks healed or not.

You'll be good to go - oh, and the whip is a nice addition too.|`|LOYALh7vaa	omigod.. i did the same thing for my sweet 16! ahh it was amazing.    well i wore this really really really cute balenciaga little black dress (on super sale, of course XD ) with textured tights    and i wore a black fedora,  patent black stilettos, and a baton.!   becuase you want to look like a ringleader, but not too masculine & stuff.  you still want to look/feel pretty!|`|905be95387730531f1b5a945a2b037e6aa	A top hat, a tuxedo style suit with tails, a bowtie and knee boots!
OtYAkRrRaa	I've heard teabags work for some people but I don't know how long that takes. If you've tried toothpaste, alcohol and aspirin you're less likely to respond to anything quickly. Go for Cover Girl's Invisible Concealer in the makeup section.|`|O71xlcG3aa	I don't know any way to get rid of them fast but I will give you some tips.  First don't use regular moisturizer on that spot, use a gel moisturizer.  If you ice it and put Visine on it it will take the redness and swelling down.  Just wash it twice a day and keep it clean, and if you get oily there get some of those oil absorbing cloths to use during the day.  My dermatologist told me that there really isn't a way to prevent them but if they get too bad you can get a shot of cortizone in it and that will zap it immediately.    Oh and I switched to bare minerals foundation and since then I rarely get the cysts anymore!|`|x8VmRaZZaa	okay try rubbing baking soda, it worked for me. Put a little baking soda on your finger and about a drop of water, rub it together and apply. I leave it on for about an hour.     I have heard that fresh orange peel works or you can grind the orange peel and mix with some water and apply.     I know the toothpaste thing doesn't work for me at all.     You can also make a lemon and honey paste and leave it on your face in the night, or on the spot.    You can also rub lemon on your face and then with a bowl of hot water, wrap your hair in a towel and let your pores open up. Careful not to go to close to the bowl incase you burn yourself. That should help.     But in the mean time along with whatever advice you're getting again, make sure and drink 6 - 8 glasses of water and eat lots of papaya. It's great for the skin.     Also try puncturing a hole in a vitamin e capsule and rubbing it on the spot and leave it for however long.     Good Luck, Hope you get the clear skin you want :)|`|1jt6WXUkaa	Apply warm compresses.  I find that Clearskin's Persa Gel works wonders on my breakouts.  Continue with the peroxide and rubbing alcohol, too.  Trust me, it helps!|`|0zxiLWdcaa	I'm an esthetician and I'm sorry to tell you, if you really have an acne cyst you cant get rid of it yourself at home.

G9liglrwaa	You're just thick..That is not a bad thing :-)|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	wow, running must be fun|`|EMYImof1aa	no!|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	no..if u like to run, u sweat when u do, and u don't necessarily pig the heck out everyday, ur not overweight for ur self and that is just ur natural frame...no one wants a person to have just unsweetened tea, 5 triscuits with plain spinach as the main course for a whole meal no matter what size ya are...its just ur frame and u have to love urself and accept that most of ur life, u wont be that size 2...and the person above is wrong. the ideal "weight" is 135-164 for a woman 5'7"....u r right in the middle of that scale making u average. besides, muscle weighs more than fat...since ur a runner, most of ur weight is probably muscle and the standard scale is there for skewed for u and u should not actually look on the bmi charts but go get it tested with calipers, and other machines u can use to actually find ur real body mass index to see where u sit on fat to muscle ratio in ur body. just go ot ur doc, or if u dont have the money, get a simple calipers test at a gym u may be going to or find directions on how to measure skin folds properly and do it urself with ur own calipers...often athletic peoples bmi are lower than the charts say which can make a significant difference on where u actually stand on how healthy ur body is...there are girls who are 135 and 5'7" dont work out at all, sit at home and eat potato chips and have almost nil muscle and because of that their body fat is high at let say 35-40 percent compared to lean muscle and water. they are concidered overfat...where someone 160 can be concidered perfectly in normal healthy range, have an alright slightly lower body fat percentage and a good amount of lean muscle because they work out everyday of their life.|`|TXXNLDVEaa	maybe a couple lbs over weight...hard to tell. if you run though it may just be muscle|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	LOL !

hLdIO43Xaa	Called textiles, they are woven either by hand or by machine.  Some fabrics are synthetic too!    An example: (I am assuming you are American.) Studying history in class, you'd know that Lowell Massachussets is infamous for their industry making fabric with looms---lots of girls worked in severe conditions from dark to dark (before the sun came up and after the sun came down) working.  Most cultures have woven fabric from looms.    Check this place out:  http://www.teonline.com/knowledge-centre...
4vqzkIr4aa	LC hit the nail on the head. Your piece is doing fine. Keep up the good work. Using A&D is what I always recommend or Zinc Oxide ointment or stuff like Tattoo Goo, TattWax, H2Ocean but most often recomend A&D. Some people will say use unscented lotions like Curel. I say don't use lotions unless you have a reaction or are allergic to the recommended ointments. Lotions should not be your first choice in after care ointments but a good alternative if primary ointments are not available or as I said you are allergic to them. Lotions are great to use once the healing is completed then if you use a lotion to take care of your skin well healthy skin means healthy tattoo. Just keep using the A&D until the healing is complete then switch to your lotion like Curel.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Well said LC!!!|`|y2nC8BUGaa	do not pull on the scab and don't pull off any of the flakes.  If they fall off on their own it's ok but if you pull them off before the skin under it heals it will pull the color out.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	it wont pull out the ink. my wrist and toe tattoo both did that and my back one didnt. the guy who did them said that the hand and feet area the skin is thinner so it heals diffrent. it will lighten though aand you may need a touch up, i did.|`|qp4euvfoaa	Scabbing is common in the healing process. So is flaking. So is peeling. It depends on the tattoo's location on the body, the application of the tattoo and the care recommended to you.    Always consult your artist directly if you have concerns - you pay for his or her expertise in the art of tattooing.|`|LpDGxOD4aa	Scabs & flakes are completely normal.  Like LC said, the tattoo is on a very hard to heal part of your body, the constant movement is stretching your skin (the back of the neck is another spot notorious for that) & it is just having a tougher time healing itself.  Your skin is a lot thinner & sensitive on the wrist, which may also be playing a big part in the scabbing.  Just keep applying your ointment as instructed by your artist & don't let it dry out.  You should be fine; worse case scenario...you need a touch up (which should be free, unless of course you caused the damage).|`|x03fAiG5aa	Mine did the same thing and it was fine.  The tattoo guy told me to put Vaseline intensive care lotion on it.  Definitely, do not pick at them, I know it's tempting but you will just have to get in touched up if you do!|`|iGwRZNRkaa	Ok first of all this new tattoo is on a very much used part of your body. You have to remember that you use your hands more than anything on your body. My sister got her husbands name on the back side of her wrist also. She said it was really sore and got red for a while. I told her to just heep her hands CLEAN and make sure to keep your tattoo wet otherwise its going to scab and look horrible when it heals. My husband is a tattoo artist so I know quite a bit about tattoos. just remember to NEVER put neosporin on them because because its made to fight infection and get rid of anything foreign in your body, so it pushes the ink out. Just keep A&D on it and keep it clean. Hope it turns out ok:]

mD7eAAoNaa	No you have unique eyes. The color is really cool! What makes them think you have weird eyes is that you can see the bottom of your eyes, I don't know if you know what I mean, but let me try to explain.

pqlhPnexaa	For starters, it sounds like you're a pretty good weight.<br>  <br>  If you're really wanting to drop more, though, you're going to need to do more cardio. 35 minutes is hardly anything. If you could step it up to 2 hours a day, I guarantee you'd see results.<br>  <br>  Also, you can always eat less. I'm not saying be anorexic, but if you cut back on the calories, you'll see weight loss. That's just the way these things work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

NB4QKLUiaa	ok so what i used to do when i wore them was when they were getting loose and tatty i soaked my hair, put on tons of conditionerr rubbing it where extensions are, wait about 20mins then slide the extensions out then comb my hair through with a really fine toothed comb, it just slides out the glue, good luck,,,, ohhh and also you can buy little pots (like the glue) that dissolves the glue!! ive never had a problem my way though.<br>  <br>  ADD: ok so i missed the point of the question here,,, so the glue is on the actual weft?? well if that is the case then i would buy some of the glue dissolvant, its quite cheap i think it costs the same as glue actually.... sorry bwt the above .... good luck|`|6OkIzEoQaa	<a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip034.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip034....</a><br>  <br>  checkout the above site it will be helpful..
AA12361679	Use a light to medium cover foundation and a bit of concealer on the extra-ruddy parts. <br>  <br>  To get fuller hair, go to Sally' Beauty Supply and get a FANTASTIC volumizer shampoo and conditioner set. They cost about...$12 per bottle if I remember correctly and each bottle will last you around a month to two, if your hair is medium length and you wash it every other day.<br>  <br>  To lose weight, make your daily caloric intake around 1,500 and get at least 30 minutes of cardio workout and 15 minutes of muscular (lifting small weights or doing pushups) to develop an overall great body.<br>  <br>  Good luck! If you have any more questions, feel free to email me or whatnot.|`|KuJXcGZTaa	Exfoliate your skin once or twice a week to get rid of the dead skin cells. This will make your skin softer. To get your hair more full, use a volumizing mousse or cream. Look on seventeen.com or something for a workout routine, because that is not my forte.|`|R0S8vknaaa	when you get out of the shower put lotion on your face also if your not weareing make-up put lotion on.  also try not to over wash your face that can dry it out wash it atleast once a day but if its still a little bit dry then go to every other day.  I have long blonde and thin hair to keep mine looking full i blowdry mine upside down with a rolling brush just before its compleatly dry spray some hair spray in it then blow dry it the rest if the way of let it air dry. also you might want to change up your part some if you part down the middle try it to one side or the other that can really help also if you are worried about how it might look try it on a saturday that way you can were it around and see how you like it. to loose weight in the winter i would exersise if you live somewhere that gets really cold do someting indoors like yoga i live in florida so it doesnt get that cold in the winter so i go for a run every morning.|`|DgCRryxFaa	Exfoliating your face will definitely make it softer.  Don't use too many facial creams or you could develop acne.  I tease my hair to make it full.  It really helps.  Mousse doesn't work for me because I have naturally curly hair, and after I straighten it, the mousse makes it curl again.  But if your hair is naturally straight, it could work.  As for losing weight in the winter, I need an answer to that, too!  lol|`|TPTnzRI3aa	St. Ive's Apricot facial scrub makes my face soft.<br>  Blow-drying your hair upside-down may work, depending upon how thick of hair you have.<br>  You could try sipping on tea or black coffee to loose weight in the winter. Drinking a good amount of water will fill you up as well as help your dry skin.
oHKpy4IRaa	Those are coon tails. This is how you dye your hair like that...<br>  <br>  1) # Prepare. Separate the section of hair you want to dye. Make sure all remaining hair is securely pinned out of the way. If more than one section is being dyed, choose one section to dye at a time. Curly hair will need to be straightened to makes the dying process easier. You should also try to ensure that the section of hair you have chosen is of a consistent length, and that the section falls together.; sections that do not fall together will not give you the desired effect when dyed.<br>  <br>  2) Prepare your stripes. Prepare pieces of scotch tape between 1 -3 inches long, depending on the thickness of your chosen strand, and wrap it around that section of hair. Putting conditioner on the taped parts will help stop it from being dyed, as well as allow for easier tape removal.<br>  <br>  3) Continue wrapping your hair with the tape, evenly spacing out the distance between each piece. Make sure the tape is tightly wrapped around your hair.<br>  <br>  4) # Prepare the dye. Read the directions of your hair dye carefully and prepare the mixture. Some dyes need to be applied to slightly wet hair while others can go on dry. Make sure to wear protective gloves, and an old t-shirt. Protect your hairline and ears with a layer of Vaseline, or you may end up with multicoloured skin.<br>  <br>  5) Apply the dye. Apply hair dye onto the exposed sections of your hair using your fingers or a tinting brush, whilst pinching the tape below it with your other hand to make sure the dye does not seep beneath the tape. Continue applying dye to the exposed sections, making sure they are thoroughly saturated.<br>  <br>  6) Wait for the dye to develop. Relax during the interval, and prepare your shampoo and hair styling utensils. Make sure to read dye instructions and leave dye in only for the recommended time period.<br>  <br>  7) Rinse. Carefully rinse your hair with water, removing the tape as you go. Make sure to remove all the excess dye. Rinse well, shampoo and condition. Try to avoid getting dye residue on your face, as it may stain.<br>  <br>  8) Dry. Dry hair and enjoy your coon tail. Hair should be re-straightened and possibly treated with a glossing spray for super sleek results.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|oSAPrV8jaa	its best to get it professionally done. tht way itll look alot better. ask for the hair cut and then a "coon-tail" dye. the grl in the pic most likely uses extensions for the pink color and stuff..but u can hve tht dyed too.|`|WW66AkgJaa	scene hair is out of style...|`|OpoETyfoaa	u bye a wig<br>  <br>  it is not real|`|zmjAccMFaa	Well the coon tails she has look like extensions.

9OUbBswXaa	The piercer will sit you down, tell you to stick out your tongue and will use a clamp to hold your tongue in place and then with some type of marker will mark where he/she will pierce it then have you check if its in the correct spot. He'll put a needle right through followed by the tongue ring. Yea of course there is pain but you'll live, its not that bad.<br>  <br>  When you get peirced you can't eat anything because it going to hurt and it takes like 3 weeks-4 weeks to get use to it. It varies with different people but for it to fully heal where you're able to change the tongue ring/balls then you must wait three months. When you get it just make sure you rinse your mouth everytime you eat with listerine for about a month.|`|f7bcycfgaa	OMG it doesnt hurt at all it feels kinda lik getting ur ears periced except on ur tongue|`|uP9SQhkcaa	I DON'T have a tongue ring, but have you ever bitten your tongue??

QjgxH7Ouaa	yes, but not on the roots.  The roots will be lighter anyway, so just use it on the length.|`|G51N3XFsaa	If you can't answer your own question, then you should be trying a double process haircolor. Best to leave this to the professionals, or else you may end up with brassy (orange) hair. Keep in mind that you need to first lift the haircolor, the dye, the tone....if you don't understand what I'm talking about then don't try this yourself.

idhcqr5Daa	Plug the sink you'll be using. Fill it about halfway with lukewarm water. Let the water run from the faucet a little bit while you do this. Set your towel (use a hand towel), on the rim of the sink where you will be leaning. <br>  Wet your face. You can splash it or use a washcloth. <br>  Squirt a dollop of blackhead clearing scrub onto your fingertips. Apply to your nose, chin, and wherever else you get blackheads. Apply in small, circular motions on affected areas. Rinse off very well. You may pat some access water off if you wish, but keep your skin wet. <br>  Put a half dollar size blob of cream cleanser into your palm. Dip into it with your other hand. Apply all over face (in small circular motions, avoiding lips and eye area. Let sit for 30 seconds, and rinse off. <br>  Apply the acne clearing scrub in circular motions all over face. Rinse off, and pat face dry with a towel. <br>  Apply an on the spot acne treatment cream/gel to pimples and acne affected areas. Dab it, rubbing it into your skin. Top with lotion. Spread lotion all over your face. Use a moisturizing or facial lotion. <br>  Do this every other night. <br>  You may use whatever brands you want to. They should have the same effect. <br>  In the mornings, when you wake up, wet your face (you can do this in the shower), and wash with the cream cleanser. Rinse. When you get out, pat face dry. Apply lotion to face. <br>  Don't over-exfoliate. It can be bad for skin, especially doing it every day! <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|u3LzUskJaa	Please do not even think of using Neutrogena Wave, it is a waste of your money.<br>  Try the aspirin mask. Crush two tablets of aspirin with a water and spoon and smooth it onto the pimples.|`|ye5O1iFzaa	The neutrogena wave would probably stop some acne from coming but it wouldn't get rid of the ones you have now. Try a neutrogena acne cream.|`|9cba01c1c84cdd8aebf0fc900eebeb21aa	put tooth paste on it, let it dry for 20 minutes, gently wipe the tooth pasteoff, the acne will dry off soon.<br>  <br>  :)|`|fsrLp3HMaa	toothpaste<br>  alcohol<br>  <br>  thats all i can think of :)|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	I've heard bad reviews on the Neutrogena Wave. I wouldn't bother with it. Somebody above said toothpaste or alcohol; don't use that either! Alcohol will irritate the skin, especially the skin on your face, which is most sensitive. It would probably even aggravate the acne patch, perhaps worsening it. I would suggest a simple face cleaner, such as "Clean and Clear" or "Boire" Wash your face with a gentle soap, specified for the face. Usually, normal body soaps could be a bit harsh on the face. Your "acne" doesn't even seem that bad. It seems like you could pick it off if you wanted to.

xqrwDmyUaa	I use Aveeno daily scrub in the morning and Neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser at night to take off my makeup but to fight pimples I use Clean and clear Persa-gel cream. I know it's the Persa gel that is working because if I stop using it my face breaks out bad within a day or so. If I miss using one of the cleanser nothing changes. Right now I have no acne, but I used to have severe acne, with cysts and everything and I have very oily skin. Oh and I have been using the Neutrogena for about a year, the Aveeno since I can remember (years now) and persa gel since I can remember (many many years, I'm too old for acne lol but it's still here anyway)<br>  <br>   If you have dry skin I would try the Neutrogena fresh foaming I use it at night because I can use it over my eye area (which is very dry) without getting any dryness and it takes off all the dirt and makeup.

There was this guy when I was younger[6th grade] that I had the biggest crush on and never had the guts to talk to him. I was head over heels. When he didn't talk to me I started getting self cautious of myself. But to my luck, when I got over him a bit I was partnered with him for a project.

Introduce yourself! its only a boy x] think of it that way.|`|BwvhafvLaa	Well try not to be too obvious like getting pushed into him.  Place yourself in the same room or event that you know he is going to.  Get him familiar with seeing you and used to you being there so he's comfortable when you do make your move.  Slowly move in so that you end up standing next to him and be very casual.  If it's raining hard, really an exciting game, whatever is happening, comment on it.  You also can't go wrong by asking him a question, probably something relating to what's going on at the moment.  And after you have his attention, you can say "my name is ____ by the way" and then that's his opening to introduce himself.  You'll soon get a feel for if he likes you or not.  I think making him comfortable with having you around is really the first step and see how it goes from there.  Good luck!|`|G9liglrwaa	Say "hi my name is"

qDFeUbM0aa	ask if you can have your hair cut to one length and definitely get side bangs <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|pWz8d8MBaa	the only way to get rit of layers is to cut  them off, so just explain to her when you get the trim that you dont need anymore layers and are trying to grow them out and then once ur hair grows a little more go back to get all the remaining layers cut off. .... i thiink side bangs are super cute just dont get them to short or they start to look chopppy.|`|1jYt6Bwpaa	you should get bangs like reese witherspoon and cut like hers too its a little bit shorter than urs so if u cut 2 to 3 inches it willlook just like that|`|QL56syElaa	Well if you don't want your layers anymore I would suggest any of these hair cuts:<br>  <a href="http://img509.imageshack.us/my.php?image=laurenconrad015060.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img509.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>  <a href="http://img179.imageshack.us/my.php?image=katiehair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img179.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>  <a href="http://img3.imageshack.us/my.php?image=hairstylesforshorthair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img3.imageshack.us/my.php?image=h...</a><br>  I like this one best..<br>  <a href="http://img14.imageshack.us/my.php?image=84563914.png" rel="nofollow">http://img14.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...</a><br>  Ok longer cuts:<br>  <a href="http://img24.imageshack.us/my.php?image=19752797.png" rel="nofollow">http://img24.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...</a><br>  <a href="http://img291.imageshack.us/my.php?image=99903501.png" rel="nofollow">http://img291.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>  But you cant ge rid of your layers immediately unless you cut your hair short..otherwise it'll take time for them to grow out =/<br>  <br>  And depending if you have a round face, long side bangs would look nice..If you have a long or slim face any bangs will look great honestly!<br>  And if you have trouble explaining, its best to just print out a picture of any haircut you like best!|`|sv61jElPaa	tell her to cut it blunt to the shortest layer if thats what you want<br>  and in my opinion side bangs are really cute i would dont strait bangs<br>  especially if you have greasy hair because that could give you acne.|`|KTHx4RXsaa	just tell her you want to get rid of all your split ends- meaning you have to get rid of all your lairs..<br>  your hair will become very short after that though..you could go for a bob  cut or something..or close to a bob :)
DpStw8RBaa	You could get something like a cross with a vine wrapped around it and the rose somewhere near the center.

Get a few ideas from some photos you find online and then consult with an artist. A good artist can draw something up for you using your guidelines|`|spXPpyP0aa	just have it customized|`|Cavz3kAPaa	I'm picturing something, but I can't draw to save my life. I'm thinking a cross with a banner across it with your grandmothers name, and I'm not sure exactly how, but a rose behind it? I don't know if that makes any sense. I can see it in my mind, lol.<br>  <br>  I think I've seen some stuff on tattoojohnny, I think by the artist Lee Little, but I'm not 100% sure. It may have been in a magazine I own, but I'll look into it for you :)<br>  <br>  If you have tattoo artist already, or know someone who has a good one, just go in and see them. Most of them are happy to draw something up. My studio will draw one up, and let you keep it (if you don't want to get your tattoo) for $50.

oxL8MEKPaa	10. plus it can cause your nipples to shrivel up and fall off.|`|lTLSqLOwaa	I knew a guy that had his nipples pierce, he said it was the worst mistake he ever did. You should rethink what you're doing.|`|5dMw30kMaa	Gross. Why would you want your nipples pierced? Get something like your nose or lip even instead. And of course it hurts, it's a needle through your nipple!|`|sbESha7Vaa	really for me it wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be. part of it even felt kind of good! just dont watch when they pierce. look away. <br>  <br>  its really really not that bad, but it is different for everyone. maybe like a 6 on a 1-10.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	It all depends on your body. Not everyone reacts to pain the same way.|`|alAtUXvyaa	umm, it's a needle through your nipple!! OWWWWWW!!!!|`|A8OVGLdiaa	never did this b4...but i would say a 9 or 10 <br>  obviuosly...its ur nipples...OUCH|`|tfRjjKgMaa	Well, in a word, yes. It hurts. People may say it doesn't, but I've had my nipple pierced, and I would place it as one of the more painful things I have done. I have had several piercings, so I will list them in the order of most to least pain.<br>  <br>  MOST<br>  <br>  Nipple<br>  Penis (not Prince Albert but through the shaft perpendicular)<br>  Tongue (2 in the same sitting)<br>  Lip (the side)<br>  Various tattoos<br>  <br>  The bright side though is that the pain is pretty quick, and it doesn't swell up and hurt like an SOB for days (like the tongue). <br>  <br>  Think about it and make sure that this is something you want. Good luck!|`|dlbMegDiaa	OMG my dad had them done once and he said it hurt like a b*tch. And trust me my dad can take pain so good luck with that.<br>  <br>  My dad does not have them any more because they where taking for ever to heal.|`|rK1nSum8aa	I would imagine it would be pretty painful. But I guess it all depends on your pain tolerance. Good luck!
piDDZ6Ywaa	I used Jojoba oil. But you can also use Vitamin E oil or KY jelly. Don't use Vaseline or oil-based products because it traps bacteria.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Water based lubricant only. Try surgi-lube or KY Jelly (not the warming or flavoured types).     Guide to safe stretching:  http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|xwG6e7IQaa	They make a special kind of substance for that.  GO to a piercing place/tatto place to ask for it. It's really expsensive but if you can't afford it vaseline always works...petrollum jelly.  When I was 16 (some 10 years ago)  I stuck a 10 penny nail (6G) into a reagular piercing....I couldn't wait for tapering and gauging down...lol.|`|53285333e8d9df82fe93c86cc332b765aa	Use anything natural.  Shea butter works good.|`|ypZvH5uHaa	EWW! Thoese streching things are so U-G-L-Y!!!!!! Take them out before your ears actuilly strech! EWWWWWW!

tFIS2HbVaa	neutral colors. maybe browns and creams... you don't want to attract to much attention to yourself in a funeral.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Black/gray and maybe a maroon combo. A nice burgundy would be pretty. No glittery eyeshadows, though... at least that's what I'd stay away from. Perhaps a cream based eyeshadow...|`|roGXVGFOaa	none|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Muted colors, matte finishes, nothing bright, neutrals would be fine, and definitely nothing over the top. Anything to glitzy and glamorous can seem a little inappropriate. I'd personally go for a grey smokey eye and nude lips. Good luck!|`|xrf7ScCTaa	Don't wear eyeshadow! It would seem disrespectful. If you MUST, then no colours. Stick to a brown/cream combo, or plain black. Don't put too much.|`|QKW3aHGUaa	Why wear makeup to a funeral... You cry and it gets all messed up...|`|pt2Oy2DBaa	If ur gonna cry ur make-up is gonna get messed up but if u dont care (i love wearing makeup)like me then i suggest wearing white eyeshadow. put kind of a lot on..well make it stand out and it looks beautiful. i wear it.|`|intuNZllaa	Greyish Brown, or Creams or a very LIGHT black.<br>  You don't want to have BLACK BLACK lids. It's a neutral look. Keep it as little as possible.<br>  <br>  If you can be without it, then it's best to just not put any on.|`|PFiVQeAUaa	Try shading with different browns. Go darkest right along the lashes and get lighter as you move up. Brown is a neutral colour so it wont bring to much attention, but your eyes will still pop, and look great.|`|zhzJoZ26aa	Stay natural. You're not supposed to look like your wearing makeup to a funeral. Funnels are sad...|`|rvthI0dIaa	Funeral is something sad. Dont do it.
sFfyZOJNaa	Here is a trick I learned in Cosmetology school. <br>  First wash your hair.<br>  Towel dry<br>  Flip you head upside down<br>  comb it as smooth as you can<br>  <br>  put it in a pony tail in the crown make sure your band is tight(THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP MAKE SURE IT IS IN THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD)<br>   <br>  after you get the band tight raise you head up  and comb your hair straight up and trim from the ends working towards the band until you reach desired length. You may have to take it down and put it up several times until you reach the desired length.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

fQ1qDMaqaa	I suggest getting a good friend to do it for you, just for good measure.<br>  But if you are really careful not to cut yourself, then go ahead and do it yourself. Whatever is most comfortable for you.|`|65lTdKNgaa	if u get a mirror and make sure u do it carefully at the back then yess <br>  GO FOR IT!|`|AA11485682	It can be hard to get some of the parts even, but with practice you'll be fine. I cut my own hair these days. It's very easy when you're just buzzing it.

pqdSSiTMaa	Pros: It looks good generally (although there are some guys that shouldn't get their ears pierced).  It's what you want, so it'll make you happy.<br>  <br>  Cons: It may hurt.  Some close minded people think it's "gay" or whatever.  Then again, there's always someone who'll not like something about your style.|`|I64JOuMKaa	isn't left ear considered gay?

Having your ears pierced and wearing earrings shows that you care about your appearance and have enough confidence in yourself to wear what you like rather than being a slave to fashion.<br>  <br>  My son was four years old when we pierced his ears.  When some people saw him with earrings they thought he was a girl.  He would grin and say that he was a boy who could wear earrings like that was a special privilege.  By doing this he changed a "con" into a "pro."|`|JsDmjphYaa	pros- some people find it attractive and tough<br>  cons- some people find it unattractive, unflattering and it makes you look like a homo/gay.<br>  <br>  Personally, i steer clear of guys with peircings- UGLY!

qOKFuXfLaa	I am 21 and would not purchase your product-sorry    For starters, I'm sure the robot isn't cheap.   Second, I don't really wear much makeup- takes 15 max for me to get ready  Third, I enjoy applying makeup (when I wear it)|`|bXl12I4Baa	Stacy, you have an excellent idea. But you asking something that never was don before. In other words you go to the extremes.        If you can, create this product? Avery woman and man will bye it.|`|AA10503158	No, that would be a waste of money when I could just do it myself. It would take me the same amount of time to apply the make up as it would the robot. Besides, putting on make up is no sweat, why would you need a robot?|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	I'm 15 and i wouldn't buy it,   1. The price it would be expensive to buy a robot which applies makeup to your face.  2. I wouldn't trust it! It might poke you in the eye with eyeliner or smudge your lipstick!   3. Plus i like to try different makeup styles and wouldn't the robot just do the same thing every time??|`|o298GAKcaa	well i think it is not really a good idea because where i live all i see is little girls plasterd in make-up it looks horrible i wear make up but not so i look plastic and it dnt show the true you thats my opinion.|`|pXTUMTdEaa	i wouldn't buy it because i find my makeup doesn't take all that long, i'm 19 how would you change the colors of that makeup in the robot?|`|NCl7B7diaa	no i dont think i would buy the robot.lol. i like to do my own makeup and it only takes me about 15 mins anyways. but its a cute idea!!  20's|`|b81H0vlYaa	Sorry, but no I wouldn't buy it.  I am 24 years old.    I don't want a robot poking me in the eye. (haha) Also, I don't wear my makeup the same everyday, I like to mix it up a lot.    It is a good thought, though, especially for a school project.  Maybe a robot that cleans the toilet!!  I'd buy that!|`|yAuzRWxiaa	i won't buy it because it will do only those kind of make up which is stored in its memory and it really can't see whether it is going with my dress or the weather.i'm 20.

CgKzxlU6aa	eyes always adjust...mine are hazel but sometimes they look green and sometimes YELLOW! It's mostly dependant on the amount of moisture in your eyes, like have you noticed when you cry your eyes get very deep in colour and sometimes change colour completely. I love the way my eyes look when I cry but I hate being sad :( hehe Anyways..that's why. My boyfriend's eyes are blue and sometimes they look almost darkish gray. If your eyes turn black i'd be concerned haha
TCpTlCTRaa	Excessive shedding is called telogen effluvium. Any physical or emotional disturbance or imbalance can cause more hairs than usual to retreat to the resting phase where they will then fall out 1-3 months later. Thinking back to 1-3 month prior to the hair loss may provide clues. Possibilities include new medication, vaccination, extreme diet, weight loss, stress, nutritional deficiency, illness, infection etc. The red spot may indicate a scalp condition. Any scalp condition can inhibit healthy hair growth and lead to hair loss, as a clean healthy scalp is the foundation for healthy hair growth. If it is just one red spot it may be unrelated. Aromatherapy scalp massage formulas made with essential oils are an excellent remedy to stimulate new hair growth and produce strong, healthy hair.|`|66e3a3c193f213cfebcfb2fed11c14c0aa	Solution to a problem begins when it is initially identified that the situation is a problem and needs solution.

Your hair is most likely dry/brittle and just needs to be revived. Also, if you use products (hairspray mostly) cut down or completely stop using them if it's possible! Just take care of your hair and avoid the damage. Talk to your hairdresser if it continues.. but it is treatable!!! Goodluck :)|`|CI86Xtmraa	best thing is to see ur doctor and get some vitamins that works for u, u can find some free trials online, there is one good product and they supply u with 2 months for free, enough to start seeing results or not before spend money<br>  hope will help u
02PXcC95aa	K so for your eyecolor, i reccommend using just a dark brown shade of eyeliner, like this covergirl eyeliner:<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=perfect_point_plus_eyeliner" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  plus it comes with a smudger, which i reccommend you use to make the eyeliner look more natural.<br>  for a going out look, i reccommend this shade of eyeshadow:<br>  <a href="http://x27.xanga.com/ad5c95f410335196732857/z152053831.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://x27.xanga.com/ad5c95f410335196732...</a><br>  but dont apply it like that, just brush it over your whole eyelid.<br>  that shade can be found at any drugstore.<br>  <br>  also an AMAZING mascara is Maybelline Collossal. I swear by it.<br>  If you curl your lashes, then apply a few coats, it really does make your lashes so much bigger and fuller.<br>  <br>  a tip for making your eyeliner (on your eyelid) stay on all day, is to take a very small makeup brush, and some clear mascara. take the makeup brush, and dip it in the clear mascara. then run the brush over your eyelid, let it dry, and it will stay on all day!<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|35PQUYqraa	gold eye shadow<br>  black eye liner (top and bottom lids)<br>  curl eye lashes<br>  black mascara|`|idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. <br>  Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes. <br>  Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown. <br>  Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it. <br>  Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes. <br>  Try all different shades of your color to find what looks best with your eyes! <br>  Don't use so much color that it looks so unnatural that people will want to avoid you because you are wearing so much make-up. <br>  Don't match your eye color to your eyeshadow. Matching your eye color to your shadow will "drown out" your eye color. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|39X48cWQaa	bys eyeliner liquid<br>  Revlon mascara|`|f68vMXQNaa	Tweeze tweeze tweeze girlfren!

CgKzxlU6aa	I've done it before, you won't sear the colour to your hair but you WILL ruin your straightener! Use a crappy straightener that you don't really like to do a quick touch up and do it in a fast stroke down your hair don't hold it there forever! Good Luck p.s. you should buy some blue clip in extensions, WAY less hassle PLUS you can straighten them and use them again !!

154dzJ1Faa	Bleaching is all the same, whether you do the whole head, only some streaks, the tips or your upper lip.  Bleaching means to remove hair colour.<br>  <br>  You apply the bleach mixture to any hair you want to have lighter.  It's that simple.  However, there are a few precautions you need to take to make sure you don't accidentally get bleach on hair you DON'T want to lighten!  Since you are only wanting the tips (how much is the tips?), then you need some way to keep the bleach only on the tips.  Be sure they are even all around!!<br>  <br>  After the colour is lightened sufficiently (you can remove some or all of your natural colour), then apply the appropriate red.  Remember that whatever colour the bleached hair is will blend with the red, so be sure it is the right degree of lightness.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, it's much safer to have a professional do this for you.  They know all the tricks to make it easier, and get just what you want.

I have been doing the same regimen for at least 15 years, which involves the following:<br>  <br>  Never let tap water touch your face!  Wash your face once a day with extremely mild soup (sandalwood is excellent) and fresh, pure water.  Use a mildly abrasive cloth to exfoliate.  <br>  <br>  Use cold, pure water! (Yes, your face will get clean.)<br>  I learned from a dermatologist 20 years ago that acne was related to hot water, hot oil gathering in the skin.  That is why people will get one-sided acne on their face when they sleep on one side predominantly.<br>  <br>  Use Aqualin as a moisturizer.  It contains 3 ingredients, and is the best moisturizer ever.<br>  <br>  Have a colonic irrigation.  Nothing clears the skin like internal cleanliness.  If you find you have irritation around the jawline, that corresponds with the intestines.  Parasites will keep your face ragged.<br>  <br>  I have an e-book I am presently giving away, that has the full shebang.  Check out the link.<br>  <br>  Also, 16 ounces of Aloe Vera juice daily (split between morning and evening) will keep your face clear, as well as tons of antioxidants!<br>  You'll be so happy you read the info on the link.|`|yiEUOwK0aa	I have the exact same problem !<br>  My skin is dry in places, but then oily in others. <br>  <br>  I've tried using Olay facial cleanser which cleanses without overdrying. <br>  I also use Loreal Pure Zone Foam Wash, which makes my face look and feel a lot more clean and unblemished.|`|C9iNXz1aaa	you should drink a lot of water, it will flush out all the toxins on your skins.<br>  last year i had a load of acne on my face but when i start drinking water, I didnt even had 1 pimple on my face
SRzL2Wexaa	Well, I have curly hair and it's a little coarse, so if this works for me, if should work for you.  I use John Frieda Frizz-Ease Take Charge Mousse, then after the hair dries, or I blow dry, I use Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum (you buy in hair salons).  I use a straightening iron I bought at JC Penney's, all I know is it's a Pro Touch Gold, just using a small amount of the serum while straightening.  My hair is totally gorgeous afterwards.|`|jHOmAoFHaa	The flat iron doesn't work on you?<br>  Did you check if the temp is high enough?<br>  Are you using it correctly?<br>  Make some research about using a flat iron.<br>  For the glossy look, when you take a shower, rinse off your conditioner with cold water.|`|CkABSeYmaa	one way is to blow dry yer hair more straight with one of those flat brushes, obviously that wont do the job so you will need to straighten the other parts maybe with a better straightener like a CHI and a higher temp. but it will cause the less damage of your hair because your not using the straightener as much on your hair. the glossy is from shampoos, conditioners, to mousses. ask your hair dresser about them and im sure she will recommend the right ones for your hair. hope that help!!!|`|1cc3f9945844b1718e5f5e8dcb404130aa	well make sure the temperature is high enough.<br>  i use TRESemme heat tamer spray, i got it at target and it makes my hair glossy and smooth....i should help:D|`|DxnkWYLqaa	how about rebounding???
vhVZFmGWaa	Hey honey<br>  <br>  It looks like you have warm undertones, so id go with black. <br>  But a deep glossy chestnut brown would look best. <br>  <br>  It would highlight your gorgeous eyes. I suggest going for some honey streaks aswell to liven up the colour and give it variation instead of it being a block colour. Straight black can often look harsh and wig-like.

UlUTQamgaa	If you trim your hair monthly, maybe an inch and a half each time it will stay healthy looking. Heat does indeed damage hair and the other answers seem significant, this is just in addition to them.|`|uly3aFqtaa	All Heating Irons damage the hair. Some Protectant Oils help, but they can actually 'cook' the hair because oil holds heat in and heats up VERY hot.<br>  <br>  Get the ends cut every 6 - 8 weeks. It will help your ends stay healthy, and there's no use growing out split ends - they'll split higher and higher up, which means in the longrun you'll have to cut off more which completely destroys the purpose of growing your hair in the first place!<br>  <br>  Only Shampoo the roots of your hair. The lengths of your hair will be cleaned when you rinse the Shampoo out under the water, and the ends of your hair don't produce Sebum [natural oil produced from your scalp].<br>  <br>  Use fabric-y hairties, not the ones make fully from plastic elastic. They tear on the hair and cause breakage which results in fly-aways. Avoid hairties with metal, too.<br>  <br>  Try your best to avoid using Hairspray. Laquer is even worse.<br>  <br>  These tips will help to keep your hair as healgthy and strong as possible, which makes it easier to grow.<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|mye6DFRAaa	MASSAGING AND A GOOD DIET...DON'T BE CURIOUS ABT YOUR HAIR TOO MUCH|`|n7ZH7cyxaa	Any heat applied to your hair causes damage.. like blow drying it, straightening, hot rollers, etc. <br>  <br>  Try to do everything naturally, like let your hair naturally dry and form style as it dries,<br>  if you have naturally crazy hair but you want it straight then make sure you use a serum on your hair made FOR heat protection. There's one called "heat glide" I'm pretty sure.<br>  <br>  Also if you want healthy strong hair make sure you have enough protein in your diet! Your hair is 95% protein so if you don't have enough of it in your diet your hair will come out weak and breakable.<br>  I just take protein suppliments :) Trying to grow my hair out really long again.|`|baj33W9Yaa	Definitely, sometimes even blow-drying your hair can damage it because of the extreme heat. The best way to keep your hair is to condition it and avoid using straighteners and curlers.|`|r7uGMC29aa	As long as you have a heat protect-ant spray it wont damage as much if you don't.|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	Keeping it natural<br>  Don't blow dry your hair, use straighteners, hair gel, hair spray...etc.<br>  use all natural conditioners like amla fruit in hot water and henna...and for dandruff its good to rub lemon into your scalp<br>  trim your hair every two months...and leaving your hair to dry naturally gives it some moisture causing it to grow.<br>  and if you oil your hair an hour before washing you can have it grow without losing color!<br>  hope this helps :)
YrQ7GX9Laa	I never spend a lot on makeup, and I must admit, my makeup rocks. My most exensive makeup comes from Victorias secret, because they make KILLER eyeshadow. <br>  <br>  Maybelline is the best overall, in my opinion. The Pure foundation is a great deal for only 5 bucks.<br>   <br>  Neutregena makes a great concealer/eye cream that's about 7 bucks.<br>  <br>  I always use Maybelline mascara, and it's about 6 or 7 dollars. The stuff with two sides works very well and I always get complimented. <br>  <br>  Now, as for blush, covergirl and maybelline make nice blushes and there are a variety of colors, but for the past few months I've used the cheapy brand for blush. Cheap, like 2 dollars cheap. You'll know when you see it cuz the name will not be familiar to you. Lol. <br>  <br>  I also use the cheapy brand for eyeliner. I love Almay eyeliner but it breaks and thats annoying when you drop a lot of money for a stick of black stuff. And Maybelline makes lovely LIQUID eyeliner that's about 6 dollars, but once you get the hang of it it's awesome.<br>  <br>  What you will want to spend SOME extra money on... is brushes. Cuz the brushes that come with most makeup suck. And a good brush can make even the cheapest makeup go on beautifully. :)|`|C4cS33Hbaa	I only wear expensive makeup. I'm not a snob, but you really do get what you pay for. Color is truer and easier to blend, and the mascaras add much more volume. Beauty products are made in laboratories, and what paying for is technology. The finest cut microglitter create the highest shining lipglosses and the prettiest eyeshadows. Not all brands deliver what they promise, but some of my favorites include: Dior, NARS, MAC, Guerlain and Urban Decay. Try out small sample sets to see if it's right for you. Hope I could help!<br>  <br>  love.|`|mUUStnNwaa	Hey the makeup brand that i find the best and works with my skin is covergirl. you know the old saying you get what you paid for so i would say don't go for the cheapo povo stuff but then again you dont have to go out and buy the most expensive stuff either. sometimes you've got to just try alot of different brands and see what one works best for you. hope this helps :)|`|UCuBOYsFaa	Your situation sounded like mine until a few years ago.

You seem to be the type to look bad if you put too much make up on.  I would avoid sun tanning because you will regret it when you get older.  You have good skin so take care of it with plenty of water and sleep.  Also focus on the hair.  Long hair always looks good.  Try evangeline lilly's hair style in this season's Lost.<br>  <br>  You can be a model since you got the height, but just so you know, models don't get paid well.

The blonde looks sort of.... i dunno.... tacky? sorry.|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Blonde FTW|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	Brunette, when your hair is blond is washes out your face, when it's brown you can see your eye's better and your pretty facial structure, but either way it's up to you. Even if you like the blond but you still like your brown hair, just add some blond high lights.

AA11538195	I agree with the first answer. Your poor hair is dead. It must be cut off and start brand new. What you can do to not just shave off your hair. hehe Is to cut it as short as you would like. Then as the natural starts growing keep cutting the dead ends off.  If the dead hair is colored I suggest coloring only the dead hair to as close to your natural color as possible so the new roots won't be so noticable.  And figure out another way to style your hair without killing it with heat.|`|N8C1p3sBaa	The best thing you can do is get it cut off.  Hair is dead so there is no way to repair it besides starting over and letting it grow out healthy at the root.  A diet high in protein will keep your hair healthy.  But stop using heat on your hair so much and go to a professional salon where they can tell you how to embrace your natural texture so you can stop damaging your hair.|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	Fried hair is usually unfixable.The best way to fix it is just have the damaged hair cut off.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	Once you put you hair in the deep fryer its toast, you just got to shave your head or that nappy headed fairy will visit you every night!
AfnOU04paa	You have dramatic and exotic facial features.  I would call you good looking and intriguing.  Rating you on a 1 to 10 scale is difficult because of ethnic and cultural ideas of beauty.  Don't try to look like anyone else.  I see you growing into a very unique style that your friends can't match.  Have the courage to do it--be a little different.|`|cygJuXroaa	You have beautiful facial features!|`|NrK3oTnMaa	Fix your eyebrows.

NZ4iWM9maa	Depends on what kinda concert it is. Obviously the outfit would be different between a metallica concert and a yo yo ma one.  Rule of thumb would be, just to wear whatever fits in with concert you are going to, just make sure its tight enough on you to show off whatever your best feature is, without actually showing it.|`|AA11043457	I was going to say a simple slim black dress.  However, with the summer there are a lot more choices.  I think the spaghetti strap dresses are really neat and can gt them with a full skirt that will move when you move or one that is very slim.  It has an innocence and sort of an island look that is neat and maybe more "cool" than hot, but I think it would be very attractive and not slutty.  The spaghetti straps can make the difference from cool and innocent to slutty.  Could wear no straps, but then you are approaching the slutty look. Can be otherwise if you don't go too much on makeup.  I think really dark eye makeup looks slutty.  So keep the look natural, but  you can use a bit of blue or green eye shadow for color to match the dress or your eyes (or better - both).|`|UrUpWmA7aa	a tuxedo|`|K77UUk2iaa	tight hollister shirt and tight cute shorts|`|qoCqfgKgaa	a really cute playsuit over a tank top or something <br>  like <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asos.com/Pepe/Pepe-Jeans-Ticking-Stripe-Shorts-Playsuit/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=548453&cid=2640&clr=WhiteMulti&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=20&sort=_None" rel="nofollow">http://www.asos.com/Pepe/Pepe-Jeans-Tick...</a><br>  <br>  or shorts and tank <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asos.com/Something/Something-Super-Trash-Pastel-Shorts/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=460494&cid=2640&clr=Grey&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=20&sort=_None" rel="nofollow">http://www.asos.com/Something/Something-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_13007_10201_480138_-1_12607_12552" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a>|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	Well shorts and a t-shirt that you think suits you (e.g suits ur figure) sorry if that wasnt much help but i  don't know what you look like so i gave the advice i cood ;) hav fun at the concert!|`|SGjSk5WTaa	I would do some tight legged jeans with an animal printed corset top and some flats or something with a bit of a heel since you will probably be standing so It will make you look hot but still conservative!|`|AxGFz6qQaa	Well, I don't know your style, but I recently read a magazine article on concert dress.

For example instead of black eye liner try a grey, dark blue, or purple. a light bronzer or mineral foundation that is slightly darker than your natural skin might work too.

154dzJ1Faa	Yes, this is very common, and she should have been warned not to go into chlorinated water.  Oh, this was a home bleach... <br>  <br>  The bleached hair is open and absorbent, so a lot of things will get inside, some of the having a colour.  Chlorine is one of them.  She needs to now remove the chlorine... you don't try to remove the colour!  There are special shampoos that she should have used right after being in the pool.  An acidifying rinse will usually help as well: vinegar, lemon, tomato juice, etc.  Careful to dilute with water.<br>  <br>  You can use a mousse that has some pink in it (beige works) and that will help to neutralize the green somewhat.<br>  <br>  You can also try a rinse of baking soda in water (about 1-2 tablespoons in 8 oz water) worked through the hair, and shampooed off.  Follow with an acid rinse.  You may need a couple of treatments to get all the green out.  And she should wear a swim cap if she is going into the pool again.  It really helps, in so many ways.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	yeah you have to wait at around 2 days before reaching in chlorene<br>  <br>  you can color it blonde again and this time you will know what to do|`|IIztioS3aa	if its green from chlorine try the sheer blonde line. i think its john frieda. they are a little harsh for every day use, but once or twice a week will get rid of the build up causing the color change. plus it will bring out her the high lights and make it look blonder.<br>  <br>  i wanna say its $5 or so per bottle. so maybe 12 bucks for the set of shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	get clarifyin shampoo|`|gXBPLitzaa	Dye it a color darker.<br>  But wait a few days.|`|dyHKPlgZaa	im afraid not. next time go to a hairdresser.|`|BbWk7RNgaa	They have special shampoos that can get the chlorine out.  You may also try mixing some baking soda in with a regular shampoo; leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing it out.<br>  <br>  If it's chlorine from a swimming pool, oiling her hair and putting it in a swim cap before swimming might prevent this problem (and add moisture!).<br>  <br>  If it's chlorinated water from the shower faucet, the baking soda thing may become a long term solution, or else buying a showerhead filter.|`|jr5Z03qaaa	buy a clarifying shampoo. have her use it twice a week. it will eventually fade. but DO NOT color it. the chlorine needs to completely wash out or else her hair will break from chemical damage.<br>  <br>  next time she goes into the pool, have her soak her hair in regular water and add a leave-in conditioner before jumping in.<br>  <br>  blonde hair is really thirsty, so once it has something to "drink" it won't soak anything up anymore.|`|2hMhANqDaa	There are special shampoos out there for blonde hair that safely remove the chlorine from the hair.

Ux1xMyxvaa	i don't think so. i have really curly hair and i straighten it everyday. i am loosing the curl in it but i think that that is due to my hair getting really long. it's grown so much and i find that it doesn't go very curly when i for instance get out of the shower and leave it. i can get really nice curls if rain water ends up reaching it which is wierd. i went off topic abit but yeah, i'm sure it wouldn't take out the natural wave. :) xx|`|146ZRXhmaa	yup! :(<br>  so sad but true, i used to have really really naturally curly hair, and i have a chi- and for about 1 month straight i did my hair with it. it my natural curl is gone. all i have left is a wave type thing.<br>  <br>  if you want straight hair once in awhile that's fine<br>  but i would recommend only once a week or so and than natural the rest. <br>  <br>  my hair eventually went back curly. it grew back in naturally (thank god ) lol|`|NffE7Nz8aa	No, straightening is only ever a temporary thing no matter how much you do it.<br>  There is something you can have done in a salon or whatever that 'relaxes' you hair so to speak; it helps straighten out wavy or curly hair, but it doesn't work the same for everyone.|`|OgQOVsxPaa	Nope..don't worry! :)<br>  I have really wavy hair naturally, and even though I straighten it a lot, it always goes back to being wavy after it gets wet or when I wash it!<br>  <br>  :)|`|pmqK7oGIaa	no but it can damage your hair|`|MszhN849aa	NO!<br>  it is coming with ur DNA.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	Nope, unfortunately it actually makes your hair more wavy !

SPF 30 would be better, and wear it every day - even when it's not sunny.  Wear hats to shade your face as well.<br>  <br>  I think that's pretty much all you can do.|`|qhKP68eiaa	use plenty of sun screen based products.  There is not fast cure, but just stay out of the sun for a little while and your skin will start to lighten.  If you're natrually dark, you might be stuck!  You could also move one shade up in your make up to give you a lighter complexion.|`|dyHKPlgZaa	unless you wanna go all 'micheal jackson', im afraid there's nothing you can do but be proud of who you are , what you look like including your skin colour.|`|sy4zpf3paa	try using a paler coloured face powder? or a lighter foundation or something.<br>  <br>  :)|`|n48Riql8aa	well theres nothing you can really do<br>  but let me give you an advice<br>  do not use a foundation lighter then your skin<br>  it looks really bad<br>  just sitck with your own skin colourr<br>  or die your hair jet black<br>  it makes you look lighter :)|`|atn30lRPaa	powder and staying out of the sun|`|6UKd0Gedaa	you cant its your natural skins colour, sorry x|`|czAbrzcUaa	Kojic Acid Soap (google it).<br>  (:
Pp7ThhNmaa	needs to be a little bit longer in the front, and yes it will probably need some layers, and when it grows out you may need to straighten it, but that doesn't take long to do. When you go to a salon take a photo of Chace to show the person who is doing your hair, because then they can show you how to style your hair and tell you what you need to do at home to keep it the way you want.

4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	Just explain to them that you want them. Tell them you are young and it is probably the best time in your life in which you can afford a more non-conformist hairstyle.<br>  Also, tell them that you will take good care of your dreads, they need some caring and you still have to wash your hair with a special lotion.<br>  <br>  If you're gonna pay from your own pocket money, might make them more permissive.|`|szOefQzZaa	srry personally I dont like dreads and they r dirty and they are not hot srry i didnt help : (|`|utZyz90Waa	The first two reasons for you wanting dreads are awful! No way will your parents go with that.<br>  <br>  Ok, well I went trough this a while back, I just never asked my parents, and forgot about it. However I'll share with you the things I looked about at.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://quinnster.fqdn.net/dreads/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://quinnster.fqdn.net/dreads/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  I looked at this site so, so much! It's all about DIY dreads, how to do them and everything. My favourite thing about it is though you don't actually dread your own hair. You buy the dreads and use a particular method (there are lots of different ones on the site) and attach them to your hair. A lot of them are things like tight braids, so your own hair won't actually be damaged at all. This is a very good point to make with your parents - if there's no damage, then why the fuss?<br>  <br>  As for the dirtiness issue:<br>  The synthetic dreads (the ones I mentioned above) are very easy to take care of, you can get things like dread sprays which is like conditioning spray especially for dreadlocks - it keeps them smelling nice and from going dirty and things. Also they are very easy just to soak in water and let dry. <br>  <br>  If you really want your own hair dreaded, then I don't really think I can help you. Because in a way your parents are right - bums have them because they have no way to wash and comb their hair regularly!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, if you want any more info about the synthetic ones just type it into google, find lots of respectable pages, print them out and show them to your parents.<br>  <br>  If all else fails...<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Black-with-Pink-Clip-On-Extension-Dreads-Falls-wig-wigs_W0QQitemZ390008885610QQihZ026QQcategoryZ60188QQssPageNameZWD10VQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp1638Q2em127" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Black-with-Pink-Clip...</a><br>  Something like this may work for you. :)|`|xZ6azOPWaa	Tell your parents that they're unique and you are at an age where you'd like to set yourself apart from the crowd and express your individuality...

If you don't wash your hair of course it will be dirty so just wash your hair!<br>  <br>  As for your 'rents....I would let them know that nothing will change except your hair.  I'm a parent and as long as my children (they are grown now) kept their marks up, where respectful, kept their rooms clean and stayed out of trouble the least of my worries was if they got piercings, cut, dreads or extensions to their hair.<br>  <br>  Just talk to them and let them know its just hair and it does grow back.|`|HP0a2HeZaa	just stop brushing your hair<br>  <br>  or...<br>  tell you parents it will express your individuality and you want to try something new.

I had a really bad reaction to hair dye recently , it made me really wonder just how safe hair dye is .<br>  It's not so much your hair either , its what it could do to your scalp , it's really scary. <br>  I would suggest highlighting/ streaking your hair over a period of 3 weeks. Sure it might not look as good as you want it for a while , but it will be much healthier in the end.

I know it sounds crazy but i did it and loved it. It keeps your hair long but kinda looks like you have a bob on the top. Sorry i think i need to explain more. After they do the layers they grab chunks of  hair and pass the blade by them lightly. You dont end up bald or nothing. You have less hair but when you blow dry it you get fabulous volume or if you straighten it you can see all the layers and blade work and looks totall hot.|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	what's wrong with your eyes? we cant really say about your hair because we cant see if it goes with your face, half of your face seems to be sunglasses|`|MXQYAUuXaa	get side bangs and then curl the rest|`|ApimMSHZaa	yhu should get lots of layers & a side fringe that is quite far across!<br>  <br>  yhu would really look nice with it!! :)|`|GIxctDDuaa	Puts some layers and take the glasses off|`|ZxYxB9jCaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  I would say that you should go with blunt bangs.|`|1He8DWmQaa	I would say either more wavey and sideburns. if not thenshorter and curlier|`|ZrRYTShHaa	get side fringe and highlights|`|nuFCByKJaa	mullet all the wayy<br>  jkjk side bangs would look cute ;)|`|5a9xejLBaa	You have a oval tubing head.<br>  I would go for a flat top.<br>  You would look mental.<br>  <br>  I would so fancy you with hair like that.|`|JqR2XIBeaa	You have an oval shaped face so you could go with pretty much any style you want. An oval shape is the ideal shape for a face so you are lucky. Some styles now are side bangs and lots of layering which would look good on you. Lately blunt bangs that go straight across your forehead are really stylish and not many people can pull it off, but because your face is thin and oval you definitely could! If you did the blunt bang I wouldn't do too many layers because blunt bangs and choppy hair would not compliment each other.<br>  <br>  But basically you can do just about anything, long, short, choppy, straight, w/e look you like. I would just look at a magazine or on the internet at different hairstyles and see what you like and show your hairdresser the picture. You could also just go to the hairdresser and ask her/him what they think would look good.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

If not then use a dye like this <a href="http://www.superdrug.com/invt/499315" rel="nofollow">http://www.superdrug.com/invt/499315</a><br>  <br>  Don't use any heat stylers on your hair for a while, Go to the hairdressers get a cut and a conditioning treatment.|`|iMn9jSOjaa	Firstly you need to buy a hair mask and give it a deep conditioning before you attempt to dye it again.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest a brown hair dye, going any lighter won't work, it'll just damage your hair more and turn it more ginger. Dying it brown will tone down the copper and you'll look more natural. It'll also be better for your hair.|`|154dzJ1Faa	I have to agree with Mad Hatter that you should have gone to a hair dresser in the beginning.  You think you are saving money.  I can see that you did!!<br>  <br>  You made the first mistake by using black tint. (it's not dye -- if you used dye, you would be out of luck!)  The second mistake was using a bleach -- that is never done to remove black.<br>  <br>  Alright, you compounded it further by trying to put highlights in the orange (whatever for???) so now we are really in bad shape.<br>  <br>  No product ever makes a mistake -- it's only the person using it.  The products always (always!) do what they are supposed to do -- we sometimes forget to read the directions to find out what it does!  Yes, you will get orange when you bleach black tint!  That is a given.  We all know that.  But there are things to do to correct it... and that is where the training and skill of an experienced hair dresser is invaluable.  I think you would agree with that.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you do a deep conditioning treatment (with something good this time, and not an oil please!).  You will need a good moisturizer (water) and not oil!  Since you want to get rid of the orange, you have two options: bleach further to make it lighter, or use a darker tint.  I would not prefer more bleaching just yet until you have a proper analysis done to know if it is safe (I can't see your hair very well from here).  I would say a colour would be the best best for now, and it doesn't have to be dark.  Because of all the different shades you have now, I am hesitant to suggest any one colour.  You are going to have trouble in so many areas here: some hair will absorb too much colour, some will still have the orange, some will pick up off-shades like violet or green/blue.<br>  <br>  I would try some coloured mousses and see if you can tone down the brightness somewhat.  You have to re-apply the mousse every time you shampoo.  You may want to use a semi-permanent colour, in the correct shade -- but I honestly can't tell you which one that is.  It's going to be tricky.<br>  <br>  You really should have a consultation with a colourist, and see what they can do for you.  Get some suggestions for alternatives, ask about cost, damage, up-keep, etc. and then decide.  Try a school for less costly repair work.  It's not really as bad as you think!  It can be fixed.|`|G658OZ4waa	All i can say is ouch<br>  mabey u could wear a hat<br>  or a wig till u can fix it|`|6Tx8Opmraa	This is why people should go to the hairstylist. If your hair is dry, and strawlike, DON'T Bleach it. Hell, I wouldn't touch it now, Your hair is probley close to being overprocessed. Go to a Cosmetology school, It's cheaper, and they can get it done just as good as a licensed hairstylist can.|`|4JHF4KVOaa	go to a salon they will fix it|`|76fa193634e47a7a06961dde2e863ef2aa	Black is the hardest colour of all to lift with bleach.<br>  Shop bought bleach will never be strong enough in comparison to salon professional bleach as hairdressers are trained to use the strong strengths of product. <br>  Bleach on black hair has to break down the following pigments black > brown > red > orange > yellow > colourless, which is white. You would have to leave shop bought bleach on a lot longer than a salon bleach to break down these colours, and in turn take out all the goodness of your hair which is what you have done. <br>  To bleach it again may break your hair especially near the crown which is the warmest part of your head  and heat activates the product, which is why your hair maybe feeling more damaged in this area. <br>  To dye it back now you would have to put all the colours back into it a shade of red  then a brown (the red is needed, to put brown on it as it is now would turn it khaki ! ) The only thing i can suggest is to be as gentle as possible with it don't brush it when its wet use a wide tooth comb. put on  loads of treatments and conditioners and try and get some toners which may tone the orange down. When you have treated it and left it alone for a couple of days get a professional to look at it as there are a lot of gentle colurants available now and depending on the shade it is now and the condition only a pro will be able to help.<br>  If you have no money ask if your salon has a model night ? it could work out a lot cheaper and its all done under supervision.|`|IIztioS3aa	wait a week or two. in that time do some INTENSE moisturizing. lots of deep conditioners and lots of hot oil treatments. don't use shampoo on your hair if it doesn't look dirty during that time. that will help soften it up and repair some of the damage already done to it.<br>  <br>  you can try using a color corrector on it, but thats gunna be pretty harsh on your hair as well. your best bet is to dye it a medium tone after that two weeks, a caramel to medium brown and go progressively lighter. you *can* dye it every 2 weeks or so to lighten it up, but it sounds like your hair is already pretty fried so i would really recommend waiting 6 weeks between color changes until your close to your natural.<br>  <br>  good luck!

To do this, brush your hair then tip your head upside down. Get someone to spray hairspray underneath your hair, stand back up and fluff it a bit. This should make your hair look a bit choppy and layered.<br>  Or you could make it quite nice just by getting a handful of your hair and twisting it round, before spraying it with hairspray and letting it down again. This will make big curls. If you want you can put it up in a big ponytail with a big flower bobble - yellow/white flowers work best with darker hair.|`|CSfAwV3caa	Well, first if you mean braids? Or bands? Well, either way, I would personally wear my hear down and loosely curl it. Just use a curling iron and hold it in your hair for about 30 seconds (or shorter/longer depending on how easily it curls). But, if your hair is naturally curly, try straightening it and leave it down. Sometimes it looks good if its straight and you use a barrette and pin back your bangs onto the top of your head.|`|nsxtItYhaa	I always have the same problem when it's time to go back to school! The best thing to do is leave it out. Maybe if your hair is curlly, leave some of your hair products and put some anit-frizz to make it calm and not un-ruly.

On one hand, they may be extremely cheap(or expensive) yet sell only mediocre stuff. On the other hand, they may be extremely cheap and sell fantastic things.

I think she thinks she's beautiful but she's just around average is all-|`|YlGjkF4gaa	idk o_o|`|hkupacP3aa	Yes, I will judge you based on your clothes, your hair, and your face.<br>  That is what I judge on first.<br>  Then I will judge you on your personality. <br>  <br>  I am a very judgmental person.<br>  DEAL.|`|gQUiisuHaa	i really don't judge by clothes or style, for me i mainly judge people by their hair style!!! really stupid no but it's just the thing i notice.|`|IW0p51tIaa	I judge people by their personality not by their looks!!!|`|yPdKsMiSaa	The less fabric she's wearing, the less I tend to think of her.|`|YJH5YcjBaa	i judege them on how they look at me or treat me<br>  <br>  like if someone just stares then i stare back ,chances are she'll role her eyes or smile<br>  <br>  <br>  if she smiles then i think she might be nice<br>  <br>  if she roles her eyes i figure shes a *****<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  in style well it depends<br>  <br>  <br>  if shes not in style i ffigure shes like poor and feel pity<br>  <br>  <br>  or has no social like and feel empathy|`|awio5lIjaa	slutty girls are no good for me; meaning short skirts and/or skimpy tops. i don't think less of her if she isn't in style, but i think someone wholesome who isn't colorblind is the best to get to know.|`|hWqYrIW3aa	I think less of her if shes dressed in a barely there skirt, heels and tight top.

HtwhcFdfaa	Yes! I HATE knockoffs. I think they should go and get a purse that's cute and affordable or hit the outlets and not something that is illegal. <br>  <br>  Plus, they do get just as many compliments for a bag that wasn't even half the price.|`|DAqKrFLLaa	I hate knock-offs! All my friends have them and I just want to tell them how stupid they look with them.  We all know they can't afford Louis Vitton and Chanel purses.  I can't afford the real thing so I don't buy them.  You will not catch me using a knock-off either.  I think it looks desperate! Buy something you can afford.|`|Idt6DUmmaa	i do hate them but you cant stop people for buying them... i think if someone wanted a cheap bag they should just rent them on that bag borrow or steal thing at least it would be real...|`|3pzTBC7Caa	their master was a butt. but i hate knockoffs too!|`|iOrYfXF3aa	YES !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  It's sooooo poser !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4x0rKorHaa	I hate hate hate hate knock offs to!!!!!!! Thier master was being a goober!!!!!!!|`|3GhDbVVYaa	i somewhat agree with you. i agree that it is cruel to do that and i don't like the whole knock off thing, it makes people look like they are trying to hard. but the fact that girls with fake purses get the same compliments as you; its not their fault. a lot of people today cannot tell a knock off from a real one and i bet the girls are just trying to fit in with everyone else. and the fact that they treat the people that make the purses like this just makes me appreciate the quality of a real designer purse even more. and anyway going back to the girls that have the fake purses in your school, as long as they like it that's all that matters, if that is what makes them happy that's great. i think its better to have a regular no name brand bag that is really cute though than a knock off logo covered purse. (i am really getting sick of all of these c's and db's and dg's and that kind of stuff everywhere)|`|vFCxdraNaa	I find it extremely irritating that people buy knock off items because initially they are not helping the American economy buy purchasing a fake purse from a guy in a dark alley. Knock off items create a pretentious image for you and everyone knows you can not afford a Channel or Burberry bag! So who are you trying to impress?|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	I hate knock offs too its like if you want it buy the authentic one.|`|G0KEMulSaa	yah i do<br>  id rather on a teeny tinyy designer bag  than a hugee knockoff bag

OHfZFR31aa	The pictures won't open, but unless you are at least 5'6" for commercial modeling you can pretty much forget it<br>  <br>  Why not try acting instead where height doesn't matter. Start out in school plays and community theater to get as much experience as possible

Roll the curls very loose!!!!<br>  if you roll to tight, than your hair will have tight spiral curls and you'll look more like Shirley Temple.<br>  The looser the better.<br>  When you wake, your hair will have those nice loose curls, like Miley.<br>  Don't brush through them, use your fingers to comb them out and add more hair mousse if necessary.<br>  Hope this can help you out a bit!|`|CpUJI8adaa	you need the really big curling iron or the big hair rollers and some curl activator|`|F4DIjrajaa	I have curly hair and I can tell you that is definately her natural curl because they are different tightness and widths.  That is a signature of natural curly hair.  You can also tell because the top has little curl because her length pulls it down.<br>  <br>  To duplicate you can try using 2 different widths of curling irons, 2" and 3"  Use the tighter one for the shorter lengths of hair and the bigger curl for the longer ones.  Curl only to the shoulders and use the John Frieda curl setter stuff.  IT will cut down on friz and hold the curl all day.|`|iG6Hq2XDaa	I highly doubt that is Miley's natural hair.<br>  You would need a larger barrel sized curling iron.<br>  Put some heat protection on it and some defrizzer before you start then take small strands of your hair and roll horizontally up toward your head. Hold for about 10 seconds, release. <br>  After you finish your whole head or whatever you want to, spray with a finishing spray.|`|2An1XVQxaa	i love Miley's hair you can use rollers to curl your hair, Trust me!|`|yVDaoZTpaa	hair curler?<br>  <br>  answer mine please and thanks!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aupoxa645Y5rvuS08b8hROLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219122559AAxvaJ0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|41V2tsVlaa	Ok what you do is go to target or CVS or somewhere and buy some plastic jumbo hair rollers. When your hair is damp, spray it with an anti-frizz serum (garnier fructis works great!!). next you put all your hair in the rollers, and take a blowdryer and blowdry youa hair (still in the rollers) on low heat. then cover your hair and go to sleep. when you wake up, take the rollers out, spray it, flip your hair a few times, and youll have that look!!!!|`|yte0BzXKaa	That's Miley's natural hair, it will be hard to pull off.

I am ok with bald and short but I prefer long. Each guy is different, each girl that is looking is different. It's good to match them with what one likes I guess.

So you need a picture to show how you look. cuz for all i know, you could look 16!!<br>  <br>  but if you don't, what i do is i wear eyeliner on the top of my eyelid as well as the bottom, heels [that you can walk in], a push-up bra[not to be creepy its just a way to make you look older], try and stand with a straight back, and wear some fitted jeans to make you look taller. <br>  <br>  hope it helps!!!|`|wGrRvFePaa	It's not really about how you dress. Between 13 and 14 is hard to tell. Just say you are 14, and act confident. Confidence can make you or break you.|`|M6PsYn56aa	Straighten your hair and wear loads of make up especially foundation|`|t8utvEZIaa	Im sure it will be fine, its easy to look 14, if i were you:<br>  - Straighten your hair (often this makes people look older)<br>  - If possible, get an adult like your mum or an older sister, to do your makeup how they do their makeup, so it will be mature but not too over the top<br>  - Be confident, as long as your confident and stand up straight then they have no reason to doubt your age<br>  <br>  these places are never very strict so i wouldnt worry, usually they are just so desperate to get customers they dont stick to their age restrictions, so im sure you will get in without any hassle.|`|sT0m1Dslaa	wear high heels (it'll make you look taller - but it might give you blisters though), don't put too much make-up on, be confident and just be your normal-self! ^-^|`|NoOLyY1Xaa	I think if you put on black eyeliner on the bottom lid and get some really great mascara, you will be great.|`|RuG0StRHaa	Grow a few years older tonight.|`|u7Ti22Dhaa	let your hair down and dnt put too much make up|`|kvmWDuOJaa	I always go to 14+ rock concerts, and honestly I have never seen anyone ask for ID. There was a guy in front of us in the queue once who looked about 8, and nobody asked him how old he was.<br>  You honestly don't have to worry about it, and you're nearly 14 anyway so it doesn't matter! You won't suddenly look older on your 14th birthday.<br>  <br>  If you still want to make yourself look older, experiment a bit today and take pictures of yourself after each try. Then compare the photos and see which you (and your friends) think you look older in.<br>  <br>  You should probably put a little bit of makeup on.<br>  I say a little bit, because if you put loads on you will make yourself look silly, and probably younger than you actually are. If you don't usually wear makeup, get a friend or family member to help. You just want a little bit of foundation (preferably powder/mineral) to even out your skintone. Also a tad of eyeliner on the inside of your lower lid, and maybe a thin line close to your upper lashes. You could smudge it a bit to give it a more smokey look. A quick layer of mascara will help open up your eyes. Instead of wearing lipgloss, try just lipbalm to give your lips a subtle shine but not make you look immature.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to do something with your hair. To make you look older I'd either recommend curling it into loose ringlets with straighters or curling tongues, or straightening it with a flat iron.<br>  <br>  Have a good time!<br>  Spare a vote? www.piczo.com/votehills|`|hkTwclOsaa	hair- straigten and tease<br>  makeup- eyeliner, mascara, smokey eyeshadow, and bronzer|`|nidCgr73aa	Well I'm fourteen (just turned in January) and I recommend just being yourself, like someone else said you won't just suddenly look older on your fourteenth birthday.<br>  <br>  Just remember most fourteen years old straighten their hair, maybe straighten then curl if your hair's long enough. If it's not just straighten it nobody around the age of fourteen goes out looking like a poodle.<br>  <br>  Also wear make-up me and my friends wear this (it may seem like a lot but it's not really if you don't cake it on):<br>  <br>  Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse foundation (and then the Dream Matte Mousse concealer on top on spots, under eyes, eyelids etc),<br>  Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder (make sure you get this, there is hardly any shiney forehead and nose fourteen year old around),<br>  A bronzer of some sort; put it on your forehead, nose, (make fish lips so you get dimples) then put it on your jawline, act like your making high cheekbones, don't make yourself orange and blend it in (don't have a neckline - most fourteen year olds have grew out that stage.<br>  <br>  We also wear (these are also musts):<br>  <br>  A orangey/bright pink blush, smile and put in on it moderation then rub it to blend in,<br>  Curl your eyelashes to make them longer then apply a lot of mascara and I mean a lot. Apply your mascara in a sort of zig-zag fashion then just normally, they will stand out more. Remember do the same on your bottom eyelashes! It doesn't matter if you get some on your skin, try and get it off your eyelids but underneath your eye is fine.<br>  <br>  Add a slick oflip glosss and make sure to top it up all the time, well when it comes off apply more.<br>  <br>  If you can walk in heels it's a added bonus, make sure you ask an adults opinion of your walking as I think I walk great in four inch heels while my Mum has different ideas and she's always right in the end. Even one and a half inch heels would be fine, probably two and a half would be best though. Although if you do your hair and make-up right you shouldn't need to bother with heels.<br>  <br>  Oh and paint your nails. Not multi coloured though. Just one normal colour on all nails and no patterns, I suggest a red or dark blue but make sure it goes with your outfit. <br>  <br>  Colourcoordinatee too, make sure your bag matches your shoes and your shoes match reasonably well with your outfit.<br>  <br>  It may seem like your trying to hard but you shouldn't look it.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you should get in no problem if you do at least two of the things listed above. <br>  <br>  If you do get asked your age, just say fourteen. If you say thirteen by mistake just correct yourself and say "no wait I'm fourteen, just turned last week this is a birthday present", it always works as basically everyone forgets their age when it's just been their birthday.<br>  <br>  Any more questions e-mail me. You can maybe post a picture of your outfit and I can tell you if you look fourteen or older maybe? It's up to you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

3FL3zIKsaa	Oh my gosh, I had the same problem once. I suggest pinning them back with a bobby pin. :] that's what I do with mine till they grown out. and once they're in the awkward swoop stage, I pin them to the side :]]<br>  you could try straightening them to make them longer, but it make look weird if your whole head isn't straightened depending on your hair style. anyway, try different techniques tonight and pick your fave before the party|`|ssVPKXhFaa	U Should bobby pin  them back and curl ur hair|`|Fy9H18Xkaa	To me, it depends on the face structure. I look horrible with currly hair, so i always go with straight, or even wavy. For style, try putting it in a ponytail, with your bangs down, straighten you hair too. Useing bobby pins, pin your bangs back leaving a small but yet noticable bump.

Just don't get too much to cover up you're obviously good body type. If you get tan in the summer, a white one. If you don't get tan, red. Try a string bikini, to a bandeau top. To go with the string bikini try a frilly skirt, and for the bandeau top a simple bikini bottom should do! (Maybe tie strings?)|`|iMaYLGECaa	Erm well if you're comfortable with your body a bikini would be good maybe not the halter top one though or a cut away one piece those are really good for making your body look absolutly amazing but only if its a high leg one and doesnt have to much cut away from it
l6bpyjqZaa	For homecoming I strongly suggest getting it done at a hairdresser!

iYwtPsttaa	Your hair should go with your skin color. I think you should dye your hair and see if it sort of matches your eyebrows. If it doesn't, then dye your eyebrows the same shade, but don't keep the dye on very long because eyebrows are way more sensitive than the hair on your head and they will go way too bright. Hope I helped.<br>  =)|`|9GDFLNyiaa	NO! Leave your eye brows brown. Beleive me.|`|n17Wm6Vtaa	Oh, I am exactly the same i have medium brown hair and i dye my hair chestnut red a deep auburn, I do not dye my eyebrows i think it would look funny. It looks absolutely fine without dying your eyebrows, so no i wouldnt. : )|`|JzY8x9Umaa	When you have your hair dyed the hairdresser will lighten them up to blend in with your hair.|`|tKfOcgDlaa	You don't have to dye your eyebrows too.|`|AA10771601	fill them in with an auburn brow powder or pencil so they match.|`|4k5AAm8Daa	dyee them|`|Pq7M33d6aa	Your eyebrows will look fine brown. Most people's eyebrows don't exactly match their natural hair color anyway. Just don't dye your eyebrows because it will take way longer for them to grow out than your hair will and it will look really bad.|`|CRYRkoYzaa	Leave them brown. It'll look bad if you dye them.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Leave your eyebrows alone, they'll look fine your natural color.|`|tkZPxErVaa	do the eyebrows to it will make your hair match with it. and p.s. im not gay. holla|`|Xr1bmvWkaa	keep them brown..
UByvC54Xaa	If they are well looked after and washed regularly - then they are hot. Really, really hot.<br>  <br>  If they are dirty, smell like old dog and have mould growing in the middle of they dread, then I'm sorry but that is disgusting!|`|5FgAyh86aa	in my honest opinion NOT HOT AT ALL.|`|LCNAI6AOaa	fug.|`|4JHF4KVOaa	not|`|wXyoo8mNaa	it looks cool but have u ever tried running your fingers thru one.I don't care for it. not hot|`|gb4VzNXQaa	With about anything else I think it just depends on the person.  Different things look great on some people but not so on others.  I've seen some people that look pretty neat with dreads and others who just look odd.  If you want, give it a shot and see if you like it.  The great thing about hair is that it always grows back if something doesn't go right.|`|VMoDsdREaa	i liked the way lauryn hill wore hers when she was popular, she made them look stylish and beautiful, i just think  if people keep them neat looking and not matted up and stinky looking, they can be nice.|`|ZrRYTShHaa	it depends u go with ur opinion i bet theyll look great :]|`|UojyaVglaa	it depends on how well they are taken care of, if you have the right facial shape, and the right personality to pull it of.<br>  i think it looks beautiful on alot of women.
eXDYvvuxaa	They dooo genereally work, the more expensive the better, it may take serveral treatment though for your hair to repair it wont repair all in one go.
NFmKKyQNaa	The first one, the vest doesn't look like it's for men, but it doesn't look like it's for women either, so I say no to the first one. The vest thing has stuck to guys...<br>  The second one I love, the belt gives your legs the longer look, and the pattern is simply timeless :) fun & flirty all in one.|`|MKOHaPktaa	I like the second one more.<br>  The first one (the vest) might look good with a close fitting shirt underneath and possibly a belt around your waist on top of the shirt and vest. I like it, but don't wear it with a flowy or loose fitting shirt.|`|Cm7AsR26aa	i dont really like the first one. it looks like a nerdy kind of shirt. lol no offense.<br>  the second one is cute but im not sure if i would wear it. but if you think you would look good in it go for it<br>  besides its only your opinion that matters|`|lPvJI2mNaa	no, and yes. The first one is guyish and unshapely, the second is cute and would look adorable with skinny jeans and a cute pair of heels. Or regular jeans and sandles.|`|pfq2L9XIaa	1)no<br>  2)it's alright|`|hGUYTMGRaa	The first top looks a bit guyish.<br>  The second one is pretty cute|`|Cc3rFatJaa	Maybe and yes.|`|tsADb5uYaa	The first one is really cute, but I dont really like the second one!|`|5ae1beef8e47339abfbcd9e8002ffd45aa	I love the second one, over skinny or slighty flared jeans with flats or black heels would be adorable.|`|4YFFb2kGaa	1) i just got a shirt like that from forever 21 this weekend :) so yup i like it !<br>  <br>  2) i like it alot !|`|kmAMgkiraa	The first one is just not pretty. I love the seoncd one though.|`|eookSo36aa	ehh not really the first but its okay<br>  the second one is soo cute!<br>  great taste :D|`|RFCcWPliaa	1. yes<br>  2. no|`|sNr9Od89aa	they take the right kind of person to pull them off
MmmcKU52aa	nordstroms<br>  -their website is more organized (im addicted to online shopping, lol)<br>  -i think that they have cuter, better quality clothes there<br>  -and their return policy is amazing!<br>  like honestly, you could buy a dress, wear it to prom, spill fruit punch down the front of it, go back to nordstroms the next day claming that it didnt fit or something and they'll take it back in a heart beat! haha|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	I think that Nordstrom is better than Macy's because they carry more cosmetics, and they tend to have better quality clothes! :)<br>  But Bloomingdales is way better than Nordstrom and Macy*s combined!!!!! <3333333333333|`|8gxezOSlaa	I agree with Sheila S. I like macy's b/c it has sales & is usually less expensive. Hope this helped:)
JSBU3atRaa	Wetseal adn Forever 21.  Urban behavoiur and sirens have rilly awesome clothes.|`|TJTB6PJhaa	Marc Jacobs, Lacoste, Juicy Couture, and Ralph Lauren are my go-to's. Marc Jacobs offers so many different styles in his brand with everything from preppy to bohemian, and the other three stores are all deliciously preppy and perfect. =)|`|AWc52vOMaa	Forever21<br>  or Wetseal|`|KuJXcGZTaa	Oh my goodness! You have to shop at Forever21! They have adorable clothes. Some of their accessories are like 2 dollars, so they're cheap, but good quality, too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/Default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/Default.asp</a><br>  <br>  I know the pictures of the models are a little much, but that's just how the person who is in charge makes them look.

JSBU3atRaa	The Lamborghini one its so irresitable|`|tP2NScAiaa	axe or<br>  hollister cologne|`|AA12365169	axe is pretty strong.|`|PfgtUCRyaa	L'Homme by YSL is sooo intriguing! I love that. Also, Ralph Lauren Black is very good. Do not go with something cheap and common like axe and pacsun and everythign these people are saying. Go for something high end and classy!

OJn8QwEZaa	OMG, that all black outfit looked good enough by itself.<br>  I'd say you're more of a laid back yet, still high fashion girl (based on the pose you made).<br>  <br>  So I'd have to say:<br>  <br>  Nordstrom<br>  Ed Hardy<br>  Juicy Couture<br>  Forever 21<br>  Charlotte Russe<br>  Wet Seal|`|1k6UUC8qaa	Well at your young age and figure it looks as if you can ware any thing you want I don;t see you in wild punk-ed out clothes but something in the style of bebe, guess Abercrombie and Fitch. j crew you get the picture classy but not boring and when in doubt ware something that is classic even if bold you'll be fine and remember for sure the shoes make the outfit put it to the test a great sexy classy pair of shoes ad the perfect touch to any outfit no matter what you ware if the shoes are not nice it doesn't make a statement. Even jeans look good with a nice shirt and a terrific pair of shoes ready to wear anywhere|`|3BD4rDAUaa	My god you really don't need anything. You look really good in what the picture shows. Try a skirt, blouse, tights, boots and a nice jacket. or a nice pair of jeans that make your body look nice.|`|OoHN2qjDaa	oh FOR heavens sake, you look fine already, and you know it.|`|IPuL2U14aa	You look fine, but since you are wanting opinions, I can see you with a trendsetter style. Try dressy clothes, like black slacks with high heels, and a white top with a thick belt going around the higher part of your waist. you could probably get away with wearing the thicker jewelry too, like big beaded necklaces and thick bangles. I can also see you with a crazy print, like a zebra print top and leggings with heels. You've got a pretty versatile look, so you can pretty much do whatever.|`|TsvKSMtsaa	you look fine|`|tQgSKOtwaa	Abercrombie, Ed hardy,Hollister, Ruehl etc. you should definitely check these sites<br>  <a href="http://www.discountshollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountshollywood.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.raininghollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.raininghollywood.com</a><br>  shipping is FREE !!!!|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	i see a bead fetish so try not to wear a necklace with everything you wear. nice heels do you have a clean lines little black dress to go with them? try to soften your look with clothes that don't hug the body so much and occasionally try tops with sleeves.
CRYRkoYzaa	I think this is the best site I've used:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.instyle.com/instyle/makeover/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instyle.com/instyle/makeover/</a><br>  <br>  :)
YrgDYOixaa	i like skinnyish jeans on boys .. like .. loose with a really skinny cut .. actually i like regular straight cuts but a little more narrow 8-)..|`|4REeX6lbaa	depends on the guys style. if they dress emo/punk its fine because its in their style. But i dont like it when the sports jocks/preppy guys wear tight pants cuz they just flat out look awkward on them.|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	definitely!!! boys look awful in them...they make theyre feet look 80times bigger than they actually are and theyre just too tight and awful!!!!|`|nKyZaPguaa	It really depends on who wears them. I'm not personally for them, because I feel they just don't look very good myself. But, they do look better on some than others.|`|3iB7bnJGaa	makes them look gay.|`|k2ZKQuyGaa	umm, i disagree. I think guys look really hott in skinny jeans!<br>  and it's supid how everyone thinks that guys wearing skinny jeans makes them look gay. Just cause they wear them doesn't mean they're gay, they just like how it looks.|`|czAbrzcUaa	I think skinny jeans look hot on guys :)|`|IfGTdMvAaa	I LOVE IT! esp w/ a nice pair of shoes and a cardigan! i melttt. just not the tight ones, they should be kinda loose in the thigh area but tight at the calves.|`|ss3QPHKIaa	I think boys should be allowed to wear them. I think some of them look really cute in them. Some girls wear men's jeans, so why not.|`|LCfnGwVHaa	DISAGREE.<br>  <br>  I think ALL guys should wear them<br>  they look so hot lmao.|`|s3puz5zWaa	they should, just not to tighttt
xT024KMsaa	No. If it is only making things worse, it is time to try another. Look at the active ingredients. Most face washes for acne-prone skin will either have salicylic acid, OR benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. If one of these is breaking your skin out, I would try getting a new wash that contains the other ingredient.|`|AA11828439	Duh, NO!|`|FF4J59pMaa	No don't keep using it! I have the same problem because my face gets really oily. I wash my face with jergens and I use a lotion called Concha Nacar. Its a Mexican cream that my dad use to use when he was younger cause it helps with scarring. We saw it on the t.v. but it was to expensive. Well we found it a few weeks later at Rite Aid. It really helps my face because it doesn't make it extra oily. I put it on before bed and when I wake up. If you do find this stuff then make sure you was your face cause if you leave the cream on your face for over 24 hrs then it makes your face start to break out. Hope this helps!|`|UlNYBygVaa	STOP using this type of face wash, if its only making you break out.<br>  Either you buy a new face wash. Or you might have sensitive skin, visit a dermatologist so they can recommend you something.|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	hmmmm, lets see.<br>  it makes you break out, but it's supposed to get rid of acne. Should you or should you not use it???<br>  <br>  hmmmmmmmm|`|SZDPqdDkaa	idk some time it could be cleaning your pores but if a few week goes  by and your still breaking out stop using it|`|cf9ae0f89a594d9500ac4952aa3df5b5aa	I'm not an expert, but give it one more week, after that, dump it and try something new. I read an article about skin care, wish I knew the website to give you, sorry. Anyway, it advises that you don't over wash your face, no more than once a day. I have oily skin, so I wash once a day, and wipe my face with a damp cloth when I get oily. Also, soaps that foam up seem like the foam is proof the soap cleanses well, but the foam is actually a sign that the soap contains harsh chemicals for your skin. Also, the article said that when you shower, don't wash your face till you've rinsed out your conditioner or any other hair products because hair products have ingredients that may be healthy for your hair, but make your skin break out. The article said that expensive products are a waste of money, use simple stuff that has retinol in the ingredients, retinol is very very good for the skin. Personally though, I use proactive, and it's expensive, but it's perfect for me. That doesn't mean it'll be perfect for you, but doesn't hurt to try it. I don't follow the proactive directions though. For instance, I'm supposed to rub the toner on my face after I've washed with the proactive soap, but I break out really bad when I leave the toner on my skin, so I mix the toner with the soap when I wash my face and rinse it all off. I only use a pinhead size dot of the repairing lotion and the oil control lotion and leave it on my face all day. If I use more than a dot, where you can actually feel it on your face, I break out again. But when I just wash with soap and toner, then put a dot of the 2 lotions afterwards, my skin is sooooo clear. Sometimes you've just gotta try new products, give them adequate time to work, it's true that you will break out initially before it clears up. Also, you just gotta tweak things to see what works best for you, all skin is different, so there's no one special product for everyone.

5fZsA7sUaa	Make sure you catch her gaze for longer than usual and look deep into her eyes. Do a lot of staring and smiling. Do the same stuff that people do to you when they flirt. Find excuses to "accidently" touch her arm, hand or etc. When you go past her lightly brush up against her... and if you want to be real flirty smile and look at her while you do this. Find a way to compliment her often... especially telling her she's very attractive. <br>  <br>  Eye contact is the major key though.|`|3pzTBC7Caa	dont flirt with guys<br>  lol that sounded kind of mean sorry XD<br>  [the avatar is not me]|`|Or6RoRWDaa	What I would do is get her drunk and take it from there.|`|RLK401pgaa	i would make sure she was bi too before flirting with her, because if i found out some girl liked me i would not like that...<br>  <br>  edit:: well if shes gay too then i would just try and become friends with her and tell start hanging out. then after being friends for a while you can tell her how you feel.

You can also purchase a deep conditioning treatment at pretty much any store (like Wal-Mart or something). <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|JKUJpsNzaa	Hello there, i have very curly hair 2. My hair always splits at the ends and it frizzes alot. My advice would when you take a shower/bath wash your hair normally but keep the conditioner in. Then, when you're done with the shower/bath towel dry your hair, leave it damp, and put in the conditioner you used during your shower/bath. Btw, do all this during the night time so when you put the conditioner in you won't have to wait and can just sleep in it. Also, since we both have curly hair it is a good idea to put in shine spray (found in barber shops) and cut the ends of your hair every month. Hope that helped!<br>  <br>  Many blessings,<br>  Samantha|`|N1qV2CbZaa	Apply serum.

DCDSaF2Saa	If i were you i would choose any of the dillard ones.I know for the pageants i do the dress has to be a certain length usually around an inch above floor length. Keep that in mind while choosing one. You also want one your very comfortable in as your going to be in it for awhile and dont want to look like your in pain haha.<br>  Have fun!!!|`|FNdsPNrJaa	I think the 2nd one.  The red/pink one is very pretty.  Also the blue one is very unique.( I would chose this, but thats just my taste!)  However It also depends on the look you are going for. Classic? Sexy? Ballroom? I also like the XOXO one and the purple halter but they are second to the ones I first gave and also concentrate more on the "sexy" than chic. :)|`|zRjU9uvIaa	The first one.  The color will allow you to stand out, while all of the white dresses would cause you to blend in with everyone else.  The style is gorgeous, and will completely flatter your body type.  <br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|qoYQsox6aa	<a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=363641&CategoryID=42814" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  It would look great with a nice tan.|`|37IfyNnkaa	The shoes are HOT  and i would go with dress 1 at Macy's and I would also go with dress 1 at jcpenny !|`|WrZNoq36aa	the pink jessica mcclintock oneeeee|`|YaBU1OPFaa	i love them all but its hard to imagine which one would look best on you because i have never seen you before<br>  and btw why are you in a pageant at 57??|`|4bWUiIVdaa	The purple one, but I think deep blue looks best with blonde hair...|`|PUUXbVK2aa	<a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357867&CategoryID=42815" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www5.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=54692&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=157df12&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455|51280|54692&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=7&CmCatId=50455|51280|54692" rel="nofollow">http://www5.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a>|`|L9Q6r42Qaa	I like the 1st one from dillards and the 1st one from Macy's.

9qXHUkf2aa	That design is pretty new, but I don't think Juicy made it in that color this season. The only colors I've seen for that Daydreamer are the brown, pink, and black ones.  It looks fake to me. Just because it has a tag doesn't mean it's real. Tags are pretty easy to copy. And at that price, it's fake, no doubt.<br>  <br>  Don't buy it if it's less than $70. I got a new and authentic Juicy for $65 at TJMaxx a few months ago, and that was a pretty rare find as well. On my Daydreamer, the tag is attached with a plastic loop on the right handle, although I'm not sure if all Juicys have their tags there. Anyways, if your bag is less than that price or even at that price, I'd say it's too good to be true. Generally authentic Juicys sold online are no less than $100.<br>  <br>  Keep adding details if you need to; I'll check back and edit my answer.<br>  <br>  I don't think that Juicy even released a Daydreamer with that pattern and with the flowers, so it seems like a knock-off to me...And it's DEFINITELY a knock-off if it's 10-15 dollars.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	First off, you're NEVER going to get an authentic Juicy Couture handbag for that price! You might as well get a fake! So, no, that purse is def. not authentic Juicy. Just go to the official Juicy Couture site and look at the prices of their purses! Then you'll get why it's practically impossible to get authentic Juicy for that much of a low price. I think that you'd stand a better chance if your price range was in the 100's, or even the 200's.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Most designer stuff on Ioffer is fake.  If you really have to question it, then its probably fake.  Counterfitters make fake tags, serial numbers, boxes, everything to make the stuff look real.|`|3GhDbVVYaa	if you show me the link i will be able to tell you in like 5 seconds|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Why would you think someone would spend hundreds of dollars on a purse only to resell it for hundreds of dollars worth of loss?  Of course it's not real!!!!  My God!|`|Oti6JXJIaa	i cant answer that without looking at it, but sometimes on website like that i know they have it on ebay it can tell you how to tell the difference between a fake juicy couture and a real one.

Maybe Old Navy, too.|`|gxjAt77Jaa	take a look eshopintuition.com or ebaycom, there are many fashion stuffs on both sites, such as bags, Bathingsuits at low prices.<br>  hope you would find your favor.|`|ztug2gLjaa	OLD NAVY has everything and is cheap!|`|p3GZERIsaa	Asda =]

You just find one you like make sure that you take in a picture or give them and idea of what you are looking for and they will be able to do something amazing with your hair.Then just keep the stylist you went to at the salon and that way you will get to know her and she knows your hair so you will never get a bad hair cut again.|`|AA10771601	I prefer mitchell's products but it really depends on the stylist.|`|SsHNOtAGaa	I'm pretty sure it depends on who does your hair.|`|AA11617912	Aveda Salons|`|VlygJOJuaa	mitchells|`|rvoo4rBjaa	It depends on your hair and every stylist is different.

AfnOU04paa	Some people seem to have a lot more hair than they need or want, and I am one of those.  I doubt is has anything to do with your menstrual cycle.  And it doesn't have anything to do with your weight either.  Laser is outrageously expensive, and maybe later in your life you will be able to afford it. <br>  Yes, shaving makes the hair feel bristly as it grows back. I had tried a product called Hair No More, $25.00 for two ounces. I used it after waxing, and it seemed to make the regrowth slightly softer, but nothing more. Most of these types of products contain glycerin, aloe vera, green tea, other botanical extracts. Aveeno has Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion--about $10.00, and it softens the hair also, but has to be reapplied a couple times a day. The theory is that softer hair is less noticeable, but obviously that depends of how dark and thick the hair is to begin with. <br>  I have used Laser and electrolysis, both work, and unfortunately are expensive. <br>  I wish there was something out there for you. I know just how miserable it can be.<br>  Right now the best you can do for free is work on your weight.  Go to drphil.com, he has a very good program.  Having confidence in yourself is extremely important, and anything you can do to increase your confidence is imperitive. Once you have gained a little confidence by losing weight, you will be able to talk to guys more easily, and you may make a best friend rather than meet a guy who just wants to cop a feel or get laid.

nIEvbq6daa	Buy a dress that  you absolutely love that is approximate. Let me explain: It's better that you pick a dress that is a bit too big for her, then after you give it to her, take her out for an afternoon and stop in at a seamstress or a tailor with the dress. Not only will she love that you picked the dress, but that it will fit her like a glove. <br>  <br>  The best thing a woman could ever have in her wardrobe are clothing that fits her and only her. Getting items tailored to her specific body shape will make her feel more comfortable and it'll look fabulous. <br>  <br>  Another option is to take her in to a seamstress or a dressmaker and have them lay out fabrics that  you pre-chose for her and have them size her up. Keep the dress and style a secret so she doesn't know what she's getting out of this seamstress session. <br>  <br>  Lastly, don't be afraid to politely ask another woman in the store or mall that is an approximate frame  to your fiance for advice. Provided you're polite and respectable a woman won't mind telling you her size or suggesting a shop. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember it doesn't have to fit perfectly. Nothing will make a woman feel more extravagant the a perfectly tailored dress.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	You cannot get clothing smaller than a UK size 4. She must be anorexic. Tell her to get some help.|`|a7af1498bf28d2d09a7253c7e912f958aa	Yeahh I don't think there are many size 4 cothes in the shops and there isn't anything less in the UK. It's weird how you know all her measurements and not know what clothing size she is and you could work that out by the label, try not to go by one standard size though, there are different sizes in different shops aswell so she could be 4 in one shop and 8 in another.|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	Your a liar.<br>  A 32, 22, 33 is a size 6 at least. NO WAY would a size 4 be too big for her...you can't even get size 4 in the shops.<br>  She's a 6 or 8|`|5I4imquJaa	jesus....you could get away with buying her teenagers clothes|`|cygJuXroaa	I'm just a bit bigger than your fiancee, same height only about 6 pounds heavier.  I wear either a 0 or a 2, American sizes.  You might be able to find some shops that cater specifically to smaller women, or look in petite sections of larger shops.<br>  <br>  If she hasn't got much "curve" to her, you should also pay good attention to fabrics, maybe even more so than size, when looking for this dress.  Something with stretchy fabric that will hug her shape would work best since most women's clothing is made significantly bigger at the bust and hips to fit your "average" woman.|`|4q4jG7A1aa	you cant get any smaller than a size 4 so if she wants clothes to fit her she will have to put on weight sorry.x

BCbA1c9raa	I am currently using it, been on it for 5 weeks and i must say there is a major improvement in my part. I got the pkg which incl both the vitamins and the topical. I use it once a day every evening. The area which i was balding in was the top middle portion of my head, not sure why cause no one in my family is loosing hair accpet me so its not genetic. I have regrowth in that area, few strands are coming up and my wife says its so much better than it was before. I still have time to go, think you are suppose to expect good results in 4-6 months. So far 5 weeks and i do see improvements so my hope is up. So from my point of view, it works and no side effects.

EUsIDbHsaa	Well the best way to train your hair to lay the correct way is to comb it that way right after washing and then blow dry while brushing it in that direction.  It should stay very easily if you do this.  Good Luck!|`|HJrTuihcaa	Don't worry sophiee, I had the same thing happen to me. Everyone is probably going to say, "oh you will get used to it" or "your going to grow to love it" and you're probably going to just be like whatever, but those are true. You have to keep it in the side part EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY! or else it won't work. Good luck!|`|GvVSDiwBaa	I used to have the same problem. Try brushing hairspray or gel through at the part to keep your hair to stay put, or try using bobby pins or a clip to pin back the side that keeps wanting to move back over, just until it's trained to stay on its own. I'm sure you could make it look really cute. Good luck! :-)
BbWk7RNgaa	First of all, ignore that jerk who says you need to lose weight and get a nose job.  All of your features are lovely and distinctive, and if you need to lose weight than the entire free world does too.<br>  <br>  Second, I think a chin-length bob with short bangs would be very flattering, especially in a darker color;  a shade darker and perhaps a tad redder than your roots.<br>  <br>  Then, if you are extremely patient, growing out your hair to mid back while keeping the dark color and bangs would suit you as well.|`|pwC0bEmHaa	you have a nice hair cut but i think if you colour your hair with dark brown or any colour you will be more nice.|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	I think some more layers and maybe a dark brown with blond high lights would look good. You have more of a round face shape so Google search hairstyles for round faces that should help you out some. I personally think that the blond is washing you out a lot, not that you can keep the blond even if you just the the under part of your hair a darker color that would help. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|mGvSEY6Saa	you really look like one of the girls off of Worlds Strictest Parents...o_0'<br>  <br>  and i think u should get a sweeping fringe and dye it brown?|`|s3FRQJ3Xaa	Go darker.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	yeah ur average.<br>  nicest pic is the last,with messy hair :)<br>  it does suit you,really :)<br>  xoxo|`|jr5Z03qaaa	i'm loving the cut it's compliments your facial features, but i feel that your hair is too pale for your skin tone. you have a warm skin tone with medium color, so your hair shouldn't be lighter than your skin color.  think of putting some lowlights in there. even if it's soft blonde lowlights or some chocolate lowlights. it will make your style seem more edgy and make your hair cut look totally different.<br>  <br>  keep the cut, add some color. =]|`|maqCRmehaa	You are already very pretty.  I think a bob with long side bangs would look really great on you.  I like the blonde but it looks a bit unhealthy and over-processed because it is all one color.

Ponytail is the easiest but if you have a straightener and some time, try straightening it. If you're in a rush and cant straighten all your hair, get bangs and only straighten the bangs. Anytime you're busy and the bangs are in the way, you can easily clip them back and make a perfect "bump" or "puff". Happy style'n :-)|`|R3WAqTCHaa	I would get an expensive straight iron, like a $60-70 one. Yes, it costs more but you get what you pay for. I would put gel in my hair to keep it moist when I wanted to wear it down, or Pink Oil Moisturizer. Then, if you want to wear it down and tame it, straight iron it with something ceramic that gets really hot. My best friend has wild hair but a straight iron helps a lot. I would do hi lites..and maybe let it grow a little more.|`|rlfaVhlxaa	i really like the look of dreads on a girl and your hair sounds perfect. look into it... dont make them dirty smelly hippie dreads. its very possible to have clean dreadlocks with a little care that arent nappy and gross.<br>  <br>  why is everyone suggesting straighteners? you really want to spend an hour every day straightening it and frying your hair? and putting all kinds of chemicals in it to make it straight is gonna damage it.<br>  <br>  two thumbs down... tidy group of little fascists. alright spend all your time straightening your hair and looking like everyone else.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v684/waldomier/dread%20time%20line%20-%20one%20year/1234tryuiu010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v684/w...</a>|`|Iptnp2zCaa	I have an oval face and thick curly hair.  Any close to your face haircut would be a disaster.  It would make your face look too long...<br>  <br>  Have you tried straightening it?  It takes a long time but you don't have to wash it every day...|`|gYv1XUwzaa	Well thick hair can be a bit of a pain to control sometimes because their is so much of it. However, ideal hairstyles could probably be you having it layered so there is less hair there to contend with, or maybe feathered. Other ways u can put it up could be some hair in a pony tail, and the bottom of your hair be left down. I tend to wear that hairstyle when i like to see the length of my hair. Also you could curl it easily with straighteners, the best ones being GHD's because they are some of the hottest temperature wise. Or you could simply have your hair down and straightened and take a bit of hair from the front and make a quiff and pin it back.Should go nicely|`|jTN50b5Haa	Your hair sounds just like mine... its a nightmare I know!<br>  One think I would definitely say is don't get it cut short, cos its thick and curly if you have its short it tend to be even harder to mange and just sticks out.  I've had mine cut short a few times cos hairdressers manage to convince me it'll be great, and it is.. until the first time I wash it and style it myself.. it never looks good like they can do it.<br>  Personally I'm growing mine out at the moment... the length helps manage the curls as with length they tend to fall into a more natural curl pattern rather than a frizzy bush! Just keep some long layers through the back to take out some of the bulk.<br>  A good book I have 'Curly Girls' by Lorraine Massey (think thats her) has some really good tips for managing curly hair and they get nice results.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|C0SA4QNwaa	get it layered with sidebangs. Straighten the underneath part of your hair a leave the top part curly. Pull back the curly part and leave the straight hair down. Also straighten the bangs. Leaving your hair down and curly and pulling back the bangs with a cute clip looks good too. Headbands are awesome for bad hairdays and look really cute but they don't work well with bangs. Low Side pony tails are awesome and different than regular pony tails. They look really cute if you leave the bangs out and keep them kind of curly.|`|ir5w4rswaa	you could get it chemically straightened or get ghd's.

fU1WLz6Qaa	Try this: Do what you normally do after you get out of the shower but don't put the mousse in all the way to the scalp, just the ends. Then, with a bunch of mini chompies, twist up your hair into little rows and let it dry.<br>  I can't find a picture of what exactly I'm talking about but I've done this with my hair and it works really well.

Your brain is hard-wired to release dopamine and other neurotransmitters when you feminize yourself.  These are powerful chemicals, and they produce sensations of well-being, pleasure, sexual gratification and self-identity.  They affect the reward centers of your brain, so it mimics the addiction response.  You feel as if you NEED to cross-dress.  You can't stop.  You can't stop your brain from producing neurotransmitters, and you can't stop noticing pretty feminine things.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of men with this condition (about 10% of the male population) consider it a problem.  They don't understand it.  It makes no sense.  They long to live normal, healthy lives, with a loving relationship with a woman.  They want to get married and have a happy family.  So their compulsion for self-femininization makes no sense.  They feel shame, insecure, question their sexual orientation and worry that women will reject them.  So they keep their cross-dressing private, very private, even secret.  They place limits on their cross-dressing.<br>  <br>  That's okay.  By placing limits on their complusive cross-dressing they are taking control over their lives.  Remember this mimics the addiction response, so you have to control it, or it will control you.<br>  <br>  These men normally do get married.  They are good husbands, and they eventually have to tell their wives that they just like the feel of women's clothes.  They work out compromises with their wives so that their needs can be met.  They are okay.  They live happy productive lives.  These men realize that there are more important things in their lives than constantly indulging in their fantasies.  Their wife, their job, their children, are all more important to them than cross-dressing, and that is just fine.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Sure you're a real man...you're just expressing your feminine side...<br>  check out this cross dressing website<br>  <a href="http://cydathria.com/ms_donna/cding.html" rel="nofollow">http://cydathria.com/ms_donna/cding.html</a><br>  ...it will probably help you to better understand ...many women cross dress all the time and society doesn't bat an eye...don't feel bad or that there's something 'wrong' with you or that you're somehow therefore less of a man...because that's not true.<br>  <br>  --->>>and keep this in mind--some women really like a man who is into that...be proud and mingle with others who share the same fetish...it's harmless and a fun way to express yourself.|`|CpNVSJpmaa	You are a real man .

I personally like it when guys wear boxers like this:<br>  <a href="https://www.grindstore.com/UserData/Poster/CopiedImage_42273.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.grindstore.com/UserData/Post...</a><br>  Something funky and a bit individual is always cooler than plain ones.

Skater jeans should naturally be kind of low.

6jXuUCdraa	Youre very pretty!<br>  I think the reddish hair you got going on brings out the red undertones in your skin, which isn't very attractive.<br>  In my opinion, a warm brown hair color would look amazing, and would make your skin look a bit tanner. I think choppy layers would look nice, with maybe even some bold sidebangs.<br>  If you go to a nice place, the cost for a cut and color would be about $80-100.<br>  <br>  Here are a few pictures of some cuts that would look awesome on you...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bangs.hairresources.net/winona_ryder_hair_styles_bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bangs.hairresources.net/winona_ry...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/4198_5751_Caldwell-Kimberly-01-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a><br>  (the hair color for this cut is blonde, but it will still look wonderful in warm brown.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.haircontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/bob_curly.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.haircontent.com/wp-content/up...</a>|`|CfvgcYMhaa	aww, cute kids!!!<br>  <br>  I think you should layer your hair shorter: <a href="http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/short-layered-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/sho...</a><br>  if you don't want it that short then maybe: <a href="http://justabouthair.com/layered-hairstyles-/short-bangs-layered-hairstyle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://justabouthair.com/layered-hairsty...</a><br>  <br>  and dye it brown with blonde streaks.<br>  that would be pretty on you :)

MfcTIdlraa	I'm going to be a little mean here... I'm sorry.<br>  The suggestions about hair and make up are good.  try a string of pearls (fake) and go for mature but trendy jewelry.  Wear clothes that show that you're a college student, not some High School kid.  Suits and "go with" shirts and trousers or skirt and good heels always helps.<br>  <br>  Now, mean:  Try to take an English Grammar course while you're in school.  Your word responsible pertains to the word "work" a verb.  That modifies the verb making it an adverb.  OK?  Almost all adverbs end with -ly so your word should be responsibly. <br>  <br>  The better you speak, the more success you will be once you hit the outside world looking for a job.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|xgui1LAFaa	you sound like a 15 year old that wants to look 20 lol.

You wouldn't have a picture of your friend's bag you can provide a link for?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Did your friend's bag look something like this:<br>  <a href="http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/b/0/0/1/8/AAAAC1iMbhgAAAAAAAGIqw.jpg?v=1225832388000" rel="nofollow">http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/b/0/0/1/8...</a><br>  or<br>  <a href="http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/9/0/5/3/5/webimg/229079322_tp.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/9/0/5/3...</a><br>  <br>  If it is, that bag is called Steve Madden Fairytale bag.  It is from their fall 08 line so I don't think any of the Steve Madden stores carries it.  You can call them to see if you can special order it (they may scour all of their stores and do a store search for you) at 1-888-SMADDEN.<br>  <br>  I know that Baker Shoes Stores used to carry this bag.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope that is the bag you are looking for.

QODJNf1oaa	I loved the first ( light brown) and the last (with the blonde bangs), but the dark one didn't really look as cute as the others. Plus, I hate how trendy it's become to die hair that dark. Since you have olive complexion, I think it's best for you to stick with lighter stones so that you don't look washed out. I would go with the first color hair, with light brown highlights (6 on a hair colour scale).|`|Rnjpqif6aa	try a dark brown with a light brown underneath<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219134709AA5xiRC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|yjQOeuTGaa	dye it dark, dark brown and add some black lowlights. if u want a pop, add a spalsh of blonde. :)|`|FNkE6UEWaa	I think a really deep brown would look nice, almost black but not quite.

4XVAMsL5aa	Hey try bohemian. On my website, I highlight all of the fashion trends i've seen in fashion shows around the world-and Bohemian has taken spotlight this year. Think long and flowing with bold patterns, and a nice, long, wavy, loose up-do. Beyond that, try bright, geometric-patterned jewelery such as bangles and dangle earrings. Oranges, blacks, reds, and greens mixed into exotic, safari-inspired patterns will wow them all.

Bzuo6xt5aa	I live in Toronto, so I'd know.<br>  <br>  Sherway Gardens still has plenty of sale/clearance items left over. Nawt many sizes to choose from (usually ranging from XS -- M) but still all cute. And if you don't see your size in that white Hollister tank, go up a size. You'll grow!<br>  <br>  Oh, and since you ahb-viously like Hollercrombie stuff, I suggest Abercrombie and Fitch, abercrombie (kids), and Aritzia. All are having huge blowouts.<br>  <br>  Eaton Centre -- nawt so sure. Probably nawt as many as Sherway, because it's more popular.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|Ov83HJEFaa	The last time I went to Hollister at Eatons (not so long ago), there were these sweaters at the back hidden for only $22.
