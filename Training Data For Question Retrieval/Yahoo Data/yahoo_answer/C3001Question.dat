20090202154700AAuJ01c	Local Businesses;Other - Local Businesses	How do I know I'm not being racially profiled when applying for a job?	My friend works at a grocery store and I was asked to apply there. I thought that it was a great idea and decided to go and apply there myself.      So, I applied and went in to check on the status of my application only to hear that they were not hiring right now. My friend said there indeed was an opening available!      A week later, I found out that they gave the job to somebody else! I got so upset. Now every time I apply for jobs, I feel like they are not wanting to hire because of my race. How would I know that for sure?      Thank you and God bless!   -MAD DOG
