Most objects weigh less when warm than when cool (bouyancy), but that is not a mass change.<br>  <br>  possibilities: 1. weighing error - check your data carefully, repeat if necessary. 2, If a mass gain is truly indicated ( you found no errors), then you may have to conclude that the copper reacted with the air around it - possibly to form the oxide.<br>  <br>  Repeat the experiment three times to be sure of what has occurred and to eliminate any procedural or weighing errors|`|3vbjGlYAaa	The original copper powder was just copper and nothing else. When you heat the copper it becomes oxidized, meaning it picks up oxygen atoms, thus increasing the overall mass of the powder.

In order to improve health for ourselves and for animals, we need to learn about our bodies and how to fix ailments. There's no other solution.<br>  But not it's not simply for the benefit of humans.<br>  There is currently cancer trial underway at Duke. It started out with rats, and now it's with dogs (people's pets who have cancer, whose only options were to put the animal down or remove a limb). If it continues with success, researchers will move to primates, then to humans. But because of animal research, people's pets are benefiting.<br>  <br>  And I have to reply to the previous poster.<br>  I believe there is a whole department of the NIH, which is federally funded, that does nothing by supports the investigation of alternative medicines. There has been clinical trials for years that investigated herbal supplements and actually a large amount of our current drugs actually come from plants. Have you heard of Taxol? It's right now the leading cancer drug, it's comes from a certain tree bark. And just because something is "natural" doesn't mean it's a cure, alcohol is natural (grapes normally undergo fermentation)- but too much of it will kill you. <br>  Corporate America and the government is not trying to kill you or keep you sick, try not to be so ignorant. What's killing you is your lifestyle, put down the fork and work out. Pharma benefits from you NOT doing that, America's keeping themselves plenty sick by not taking care of themselves- there's no conspiracies needed.|`|OkrEh1LTaa	Unfortunately most of the research done on animals is cosmetic and cruel. Scientists aren't even allowed to explore natural cures for diseases because they wouldn't be able to patent the cure if it can be grown in just anyone's back yard.<br>  <br>   So all of these helpless little animals are being sacrificed for capitalism, not for health care. There is a monopoly on health because it has been privatized just like everything else. <br>  <br>  I know this gets off subject on animal testing but I truly believe that if we were able to explore natural cures we wouldn't have to do these mad scientist experiments with man-made poisons on animals. If you really care for little Timmy, look past the smokescreen and see who is REALLY killing him, corporate America,<br>  <br>  The Health care industry has a vested intrest in keeping you sick. If you never get sick, they don't have jobs. So when looking at animal testing, they don't see the life of the animal as any less important thatn a human's, both are expendable for profits.|`|1UPwDfJgaa	I do animal testing at my work.

YrOTZsjtaa	I tried recently to solve this very same problem and blew it. The reason why was because I added rather than subtracted in eqaution (2), below. I think these answers are correct.<br>  <br>  The law of conservation of momentum says that the initial momentum is equal to the final momentum. In equation form :<br>  <br>  m?v?(i) + m?v?(i) = m?v?(f) + m?v?(f)<br>  <br>  Call the 0.060kg ball m? and the 0.086kg ball m?. So the equation becomes :<br>  <br>  (0.060kg)(7.70m/s) + (0.086kg)(3.10m/s) = (0.060kg)v?(f) + (0.086kg)v?(f)<br>  <br>  0.7286kg?m/s = (0.060kg)v?(f) + (0.086kg)v?(f)--->eqn (1)<br>  <br>  Since there are two unknown speeds, another equation is needed to find their values. The equation (derived from the laws of conservation of energy and momentum) to use is :<br>  <br>  v?(i) - v?(i) = -[v?(f) - v?(f)]<br>  <br>  Using the initial velocities from the problem :<br>  <br>  7.70m/s - 3.10m/s = v?(f) - v?(f)<br>  4.60m/s = v?(f) - v?(f)<br>  <br>  Solve this expression for either of the unknowns. Take v?(f) :<br>  <br>  v?(f) = v?(f) - 4.60m/s------>eqn (2)<br>  <br>  Plug this into equation (1) :<br>  <br>  0.7286kg?m/s = (0.060kg)[v?(f) - 4.60m/s] + (0.086kg)v?(f)<br>  v?(f) = 6.88m/s<br>  <br>  Substituting this into eqn (2), you can find v?(f) :<br>  <br>  v?(f) = 6.88m/s - 4.60m/s <br>  = 2.28m/s

7if78wn7aa	First, you should know that Michael Jackson's floor was not automatic- there was a propman with a box full of switches. If you watch closely, you can see him light up one that wasn't quite stepped on.<br>  <br>  However, you could make it light up automatically. Make a grid of 2x6 timbers on the floor, cut out thick squares of plexiglass and mount them on top of some kind of pressure sensor. I would hesitate to rely on a switch, because if the square must dip more than a small fraction of an inch, you will have a ledge that your son could trip on.<br>  <br>  This is a bit advanced, though.

Can't remember where I read it.<br>  <br>  I will pass on to you a little prayer that I have been told always works!<br>  From a book titled "Unified" by Roger Lanphear :<br>  "To all uninvited influences in my aura, I send Love and Light.  You were created as Love and Light, and you still are Love and Light.<br>  You are safe and healed and whole and you have a perfect place<br>  to go.

Go in peace, each of you."<br>  then " I close my aura to all except my higher self, and I send<br>  Love and Light to any thought forms in the area"<br>  <br>  Make a habit of using that prayer daily and anytime you feel an unwelcome presence, and at times you feel depressed or fearful.<br>  <br>  Another great prayer to use daily," There is but one presence<br>  and one Power in the universe - God, the Good, Omnipotent."|`|b6d778325abf39d72f52c74b7068dca2aa	The land your home is on could be haunted.

Get mad if you have to, but be forceful in telling it to leave you alone... The other thing you can do that I recommend for anyone moving into a new place or after getting into an argument or fight with someone or wanting to clear a place/space of spirits or negative energy is to buy a sage bundle and light one end, hold a plate or bowl underneath it and walk around each room of your house (making sure to get into the corners and around doorways) and say "You are not welcome here, you don't belong here, leave now."

I cannot advise you on how to rid yourself of the problem, but can suggest that you examine when the events began and see if there is an event (trip to a burial or scene of a violent ending, etc) by yourself or a household member that coincides.

Coastal water pollution produced by humans and systematic increase in sea water temperature have also been implicated as contributing factors in red tides. Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the Saharan desert are thought to play a major role in causing red tides.

The chemical formula is CuO, and the reaction would look like 2Cu + O2 - 2CuO. Copper is a transition metal, which means it doesn't have a predictable charge. When dealing with transition metals in compounds, it's always a special case except with Ag, Zn, and Al.
AA10929714	You are told that dy/dx = 2y - x.<br>  <br>  dy/dx is the slope of the function y(x). In this case, the value of the slope is expressed "implicitly" as a function of both x and y.<br>  <br>  The slope is positive whenever dy/dx > 0, which is the same as saying that the slope is positive whenever:<br>  <br>  2y - x > 0<br>  <br>  2y > x<br>  <br>  y > x/2<br>  <br>  Similarly, the slope is negative when:<br>  <br>  2y - x < 0<br>  <br>  2y < x<br>  <br>  y < x/2.<br>  <br>  And, of course, the slope is equal to zero when:<br>  <br>  y = x/2<br>  <br>  From what you are told in the question, you do not know the function y(x) (you need to solve the differential equation to do know that); all you know is the slope of this function. For the record, the function that has the derivative above is:<br>  <br>  y(x) = 1/4 + x/2 + c*exp(2*x)<br>  <br>  where c is an arbitrary constant.|`|NuXv6YLWaa	You do realize you can pick both points x and y right?<br>  <br>  The slope is positive when 2y>x and it's negative when 2y <x.

Divide by 2 and the angles of the other two are 60 degrees.<br>  <br>  separate the rhombus into 2 triangles and a square (or rectangle in the middle). since the hyp of the triangles is 6 and you have 30-60-90 triangles. use the rule to find the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle. Then once you find the long side, square it to get the area of the square. Then add all the areas together to get the area.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this is close to right.

qBkJAlQ1aa	actual yield = the amount you actally measured in the laboratory using any weighing or measuring instrument. It is different from theoritical yield. theoritical yield is the expected amount after computation. yield means the result or product of a reaction.<br>  <br>  example. when A reacts with B it produces AB<br>   if 2 grams A reacts with 2 grams B, and your computation revelead it should yield 4 grams, then your theoretical yield is 4 grams. However upon actual measurement, you obtained only 3.5 grams then your actual yield is only 3.5grams. It does happen because errors may come inot play when we are actually reacting substances and also errors in measuring.<br>  <br>  Percentage error is the percent difference between actual yield and theoretical yield. formula is theoritical yield - actual yiled, then the differnece divided by the theoretical yield x 100.<br>  <br>  %error = [(Theoretical yield - actual yield)/ theoretical yield] x 100<br>  <br>  When two substances react their amounts may just be enough, however in most cases, one or two may be in excess. remember we determine these excesses in terms of the moles.<br>  <br>  example. 2moles of A is needed to react with one mole of B.<br>  if you are given 3 moles of A instead of 2moles and you only have 1 mole of B, then A will be in excess by one mole because you will only use 2 moles out of the 3 moles. Your B is the limiting reagent because you are going to use all that is present. A on the contrary is the excess reagent because there will be something of A that will be left unused after the reaction.<br>  <br>  in most cases, we are not given moles but mass in grams. What you must do is to convert the given mass in grams into mole equivalents. to do this follow the formula<br>  <br>  mole = given mass in grams / mole mass<br>  <br>  if you don't know how to get the mole mass, just compute for the sum of the atomic weights of the elements that comprise the substance.<br>  <br>  example: water -------> H2O<br>  it has 2H and 1 O<br>  H weighs 1g, but there are 2, then 2 x 1 = 2 grams<br>  O weighs 16g and thers only 1, so for O its = 16grams<br>  add them up 2 + 16 = 18 gram /mole<br>  so mole mass is 18 g/mole<br>  <br>  lets say that we only have 9 grams of water, then converting this to mole is<br>  mole = 9/18 = 0.5 moles...<br>  <br>  hope you can follow..<br>  <br>  anvil ltd.|`|T7QSEsaYaa	Actual Yield - How much product you get in ideal laboratory conditions.<br>  Percentage Error - Your experimental percentage error to the accepted value.<br>  Excess Reagent - What is left over after the reaction.<br>  Limiting Reagent - The limiting reactant that dictates how much product will be yielded

AA11432707	It depends on what the needle is for.<br>  <br>  Usually, the smallest needle that will do the job is what is used.  For most injections, it's a tiny needle.  It's pretty rare to inject anything thick, but ages ago bicillin was used, and that's like glue, and requires a big needle just to get the drug through it.<br>  <br>  Having blood drawn is a different story, because if too small a needle is used, it can damage the red blood cells and cause the results to be inaccurate.  We see this all the time with elevated potassium levels which are due to hemolysis (damaged RBCs)<br>  <br>  For other needle-related injections, like nerve blocks, epidurals or spinals, needle choice depends on a lot of factors.|`|pVwyu6Fuaa	hi,<br>  <br>  the easiest way to understand needles is to think of this,<br>  <br>  big veins, big needles,<br>  tiny veins, tiny needles.<br>  <br>  If you are taking blood from a patient, you choose the needle to suit the vein.<br>  If you are giving medication via medication, it depends on the amount of medication and the size of the vein.<br>  <br>  There is much more that you would need to learn to understand needles, but this is a VERY basic run down.|`|tBMxNaPTaa	In general, if you are injecting a liquid that is basically water, you can use a smaller guage needle, such as a 21 guauge. If you are injecting a thick viscous medicine, use an 18 guage. It injects easier, and doesn't shoot out of the needle with as much force compared to a 21 guage, hence causing less discomfort to the patient,

AA11217846	Law of Large Numbers is an assumption that is not realistic. To say anything definite about a population characteristic is impossible if you don't have an infinitely large sample size. <br>  But the point is, some things come pretty close.<br>  <br>  Statisticians must go through rigorous procedures to make sure that their sample is random, unbiased, and of adequate size. Assumptions about population distributions must be checked; conclusions and inferences must be qualified. <br>  <br>  If this is the case, then the Gambler's Fallacy is no fallacy at all--provided the Gamber's sample was unbiased, adequately large, and that his assumptions about the distribution of the population he's investigating are correct. <br>  <br>  But of course, you are right in saying that this does pose some limitations on statistics, as well as some philosophical questions about the nature of mathematics.<br>  <br>  Statisticians can never be certain, but if numbers are large enough, they can get pretty close. Still, you'll rarely hear a statistician say that he or she is 100% positive about anything. A large part of statistics is investigating such limitations, qualifying your conclusions (intervals of confidence, levels of significance, margins of error, etc.)<br>  <br>  And for someone like you who seems to have an inclination for the more "rigorous" and "pure" mathematics (yes, I've browsed through Yahoo Answers profile), remember that even these branches require a level of faith. I believe it's from Godel's Incompleteness Theorem (don't really remember), but here it is: every mathematical aspiration is founded entirely upon a set of assumptions--assumptions that are taken for granted, unfounded, and can never be both complete and consistent.|`|mNr3SIUEaa	Your question indicates that you don't fully understand the law of large numbers and how it is used. Wait a few weeks and let it sink in. If you are really interested, you can try to read a proof of the theorem, but I doubt that will help you.<br>  <br>  If you can't understand the proof, it's best to simply accept it and let the mathematicians and statisticians worry about such things.<br>  <br>  EDIT---<br>  <br>  Wow, a bit defensive, huh? You should really work on the flaming thing.<br>  <br>  Anyways, the law of large numbers does not in any way predict the future of a sequence of random variable outcomes. It relies on the fact that the sequence comes from iid process. The law of large numbers gives the measure of the sigma algebra for which sequences sequences deviate from the expected value of the iid process. It does not in any way say that "things will eventually even out" as you seem to think. Rather, it states that the measure of the number of such sequences goes to zero as the number of trials goes to infinity. You may also look into sequence entropy and cylinder sets to get a different take on the law. The ergodic theorem is a generalization of the law of large numbers that has more physical meaning that is easier for some to understand.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...pwned.

That's why in the morning for breakfast you need to have a little protein with your breakfast, (protein blocks the serotonin), so you are not sleepy.<br>  Maybe have a backup alarm clock, so you will not worry about oversleeping.

That leaves R and S as possibilities.  If you put a right angle at either R or S you will have a side with slope -1.  So the first two slopes add to 1 - 1 = 0.  That means the third side would have to have a slope of 1.  But that would make the third side parallel to RS and triangles can't have two parallel sides.  So the answer is None.<br>  <br>  A. None.

SoxwuryNaa	I worked this problem out by integrating with respect to x.<br>  <br>  So if you plot y=e^(3x) and y=e^(5x) onto one graph, you get two curved exponential functions, with one being slightly larger than the other.<br>  <br>  The area we want to find is that enclosed between the two graphs (it kind of looks like a banana-shaped region). The limits of integration will be from negative infinity to 1. Since exponentials approach zero but never reach it, the lower integration range is negative infinity. 1 is the upper integration range because it is given in the problem statement, and both functions reach 1 when x = 0.<br>  <br>  The area (A) will be:<br>  <br>  A = integrate[e^(3*x)*dx] - integrate[e^(5x)*dx] from the range of negative infinity to 1.<br>  <br>  Upon integrating, we get:<br>  <br>  (e^3x) / 3 - (e^5x) / 5 (from integration range of negative infinity to 1)<br>  <br>  = 1/3 - 1/5<br>  <br>  = 2 /15<br>  <br>  Cheers

lhB213Imaa	Blood has a lot of water, which has a high heat capacity.  So, the blood can carry a lot of heat through the body.<br>  <br>  When blood is near the outside of the body, this heat can be conducted or radiated out through the skin.  In fact, when you become hot,  the blood vessels in your extremities (arms and legs) relax so that more blood can pass through to release heat.<br>  <br>  Conversely, when you are very cold, the body will reduce flow to the extremities, so it can save the heat for the important organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain.  In dangerously cold weather, the body will actually sacrifice the feet and hands in order to prevent central organs such as the heart from losing heat.

Work is energy needed to push something against an external force (work= -external pressure x change in volume). Heat is energy used to raise the temperature of a system. When doing thermodynamic chem problems, always think of it as energy of the system. When a system does work, it loses energy, therefore it is negative. When work is done on the system, it gains energy, therefore it is positive.
AA10929714	From gas kinetic theory, one has the result that the total internal energy of a mole of ideal gas particles is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of each of the particles.

So each wavelength's frequency (including that of the fundamental) is multiplied by 12.<br>  <br>  2. If the linear mass density is reduced by 1/9, v is multiplied by 3, so the frequency is multiplied by 3.

For the wind instrument, you can only change the speed by changing the temperature or the humidity - neither of which are much under control of the musicians. So, that means that when wind and string instruments play together, the tuning has to be led by the wind instruments, and the strings have to accommodate.|`|O0zfwHnwaa	I didn't get that last part from the last answer, so just in case you didn't either.  <br>  When you tune a stringed instrument you adjust the tightness of the string, which changes the speed of the wave that travels down it.  <br>  When you tune a wind instrument, you change the length of the actual instrument by adjusting a valve or the mouthpiece connection.  <br>  Both have an impact on the frequency of the notes, but they use different tactics, one adjusts the speed of the wave, the other adjusts the resonant wavelengths.

AA10501379	The harder the material (and the material it is bouncing against) the more energy is transferred back to the object doing the bouncing.  Conservation of momentum rules apply and the formula involves the "e" coefficient.  <br>  <br>  For example, if you could bounce a perfectly hard ball (e=1.0) against a perfecty hard surface (e=1.0) then 100% of the momentum energy stays with the ball.  But if one of them has an e<1.0, then energy begins to dissipate...think of a basketball bouncing lower and lower and lower each time it bounces.

zs8SdIZRaa	Amino acids all pretty much have the same peptide backbone.  But various types of amino acids have different side chains.  For example, they can be big or small, charged (positively or negatively) or uncharged... you get the picture.  So in a protein, a bunch of amino acids are joined together in a chain.  This is called the protein's primary structure (the actual amino acid sequence).  But in addition to that, proteins fold up to take on a specific 3D structure that usually dictates their function.  And the 3D structure that a protein has is governed by the sequence of amino acids in the chain.  So if you think about it, if a normal protein is partially held together by a charge interaction (side chains adjacent to each other, one is +, one is -), but we take the same protein and make that + side chain a -, then those adjacent chains would now repel each other.  And this would likely have structural/functional consequences to this protein.|`|Ms9ArphRaa	Amino acids make up proteins and the order they appear determines which protein you have.  Proteins are more than just long chains of amino acids.  As the protein is built it begins to fold on itself to get a three dimensional shape.  It is the shape of the protein that is important.  If the sequence is wrong, then the protein will not fold correctly and can not do its job.  Think if you have directions to build a bicycle and you leave out the part telling you where to put the wheels.  Wouldn't be much use even though you have most of the directions.  This is the basic idea.  Its all about the shape.|`|5TyWhEbGaa	each amino acid codes for a certain protein.  a different combination of amino acids will create a different combination of proteins.  the structure of a protein determines its purpose, so if the amino acids are in a different order or shape it would change the shape of the protein.

The number Three invokes expression, versatility, and pure joy of creativity. Three is also a time identifier as it represents Past, Present and Future. Consecutive Threes in your life may symbolize the need to express yourself creatively, or consider your present directional path in relation to past events and future goals. Three may also represent promising new adventures, and assurance of cooperation from others whom you may require help. Three typically symbolizes reward and success in most undertakings.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the following in from here: <a href="http://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meani...</a><br>  <br>  n this number we have quite a new set of phenomena. We come to the first geometrical figure. Two straight lines cannot possibly enclose any space, or form a plane figure; neither can two plan surfaces form a solid. Three lines are necessary to form a plan figure; and three dimensions of length, breadth, and height, are necessary to form a solid. Hence three is the symbol of the cube--the simplest form of solid figure. As two is the symbol of the square, or plane contents (x2), so three is the symbol of the cube, or solid contents (x3).<br>  <br>  Three, therefore, stands for that which is solid, real, substantial, complete, and entire.<br>  <br>  All things that are specially complete are stamped with this number three.<br>  <br>  God's attributes are three: omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.<br>  <br>  There are three great divisions completing time--past, present, and future.<br>  <br>  Three persons, in grammar, express and include all the relationships of mankind.<br>  <br>  Thought, word, and deed, complete the sum of human capability.<br>  <br>  Three degrees of comparison complete our knowledge of qualities.<br>  <br>  The simplest proposition requires three things to complete it; viz., the subject, the predicate, and the copula.<br>  <br>  Three propositions are necessary to complete the simplest form of argument--the major premiss, the minor, and the conclusion.<br>  <br>  Three kingdoms embrace our ideas of matter--mineral, vegetable, and animal. <br>  <br>  There is more to it but I couldn't paste it all so check out the websites I provided.

As you pull the elastic band stress and strain builds untill the point of failure when the friction cause by the brick on sand paper releases causing the brick to move, ever so slightly, then come to "rest" in a new position. This theory can be applied to transform faulting.

FT4mVJMzaa	What do you think a radar gun *IS* ??<br>  <br>  It's not insane, we measure the speed of light every day in freshman lab with a laser and a rotating mirror. The laser bounces off it, to another mirror across the room, and back. In that time, the mirror has rotated slightly and the beam is sent off in a slightly different direction than it came in. The angle of that deflection is obviously directly related to the speed of light, and it works every time. <br>  <br>  And that's just in a crappy freshman lab.|`|AFOz6Nt6aa	In short, they use VERY sensitive equipment. In layman's terms, think of someone bouncing a laser off a mirror...but doing this at such a steep angle (and on such a huge mirror) that the laser bounces back and forth thousands and thousands of times. If you bounce it enough, you'll eventually be able to measure how long it takes to reach the end (probably in microseconds). Figure out how many times it bounces and how far apart the mirrors are, and there you have it. <br>  <br>  I think that's how they do it. That's how I'd do it, anyway.

yKZQoLDoaa	SOLVENT FRACTIONATION <br>  <br>  <br>  This is the simplest way and sometimes the most efficient for separating a group of lipids of interest when the others are without value. This approach depends on the differential solubility of lipids in organic solvents. <br>  <br>  Separation of polar lipids:<br>  <br>  Acetone precipitation is currently used to separate in one step polar lipids (phospholipids and glycolipids) from all neutral or non-polar lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol, some pigments..).<br>  <br>  Procedure:<br>  <br>  - Evaporate under nitrogen an aliquot of lipid extract and add about 20-30 volumes of acetone. <br>  - Mix by vortexing one min. and leave on ice one hour.<br>  - Centrifuge and collect the supernatant.<br>  - Repeat the same procedure and mix the acetone extracts.<br>  - The pellet, rich in phospholipids and glycolipids, is dried under nitrogen and vacuum, weighed and re-dissolved in chloroform/methanol mixture for further analysis.<br>  - The acetone extract can be used to analyze glycerides, sterols, sterol esters, carotenoids, lipid soluble vitamins. It may contain also monogalactoside diglycerides and sterol glycosides. <br>  <br>  It was recently shown that the purification of phosphatidylcholine from a lipid extract can be rapidly made by mixing 2 hours at room temperature the dried lipids with 5 volumes of acetone, filtration of the suspension and leaving the acetone extract 5 hours at -20?C. The rapid filtration of the mixture gives a precipitate of phospholipids enriched in phosphatidylcholine (Baudimant G, Thesis, Paris 1996). Further trials are needed to define the yield of the different phospholipid classes according to the used lipid extract.<br>  <br>  A simple procedure, similar to the previously described, was reported for enriching the phospholipid content in commercial soybean lecithin (dried gums) (Vandana V et al., JAOCS 2001, 78, 555). Briefly, lecithin (50 g) was dissolved in acetone (20 ml) and slowly added to chilled acetone (230 ml). The content was kept in a refrigerator for 60 min at 4.5?C and centrifuged. The acetone layer, containing neutral lipids, was decanted, and the acetone-insoluble material was extracted with chilled acetone (2 x 50 ml) followed by centrifugation. The acetone insolubles (light yellow precipitate) are enriched in phospholipids. In adding that fraction to a determined amount of crude lecithin, fractions with higher phospholipid contents were prepared. Commercial lecithin can thus be enriched to any required percentage of phospholipids for various applications.<br>  <br>  Instead of precipitation or direct extraction of tissue lipids with selected solvents, a less common practice consists in a partition of lipid classes, previously extracted, between different immiscible solvents, this procedure is known as:<br>  <br>  <br>  solvent partition<br>  or<br>  countercurrent distribution
ca2dAbWxaa	So the problem gives you .10M of Saccharin which is why the initial is 0.10M.  H+ and NC7H4SO3- initially is 0 because they aren't present when you first put HNC7H4SO3 in water.  Since the products are 0, you have to make more products with the reactants therefore its +x on the products and -x on the reactants.  After that you just add the initial and the change line together to the get the equilibrium line. <br>  <br>  To find what x is you have to use the equilibrium expression which is the ka expression you wrote above.  You just plug in the numbers from above into the equation and you get x = H+ = 2.19 x 10^-2.<br>  <br>  You know that pH = -log[H+] so you just plug 2.19 x 10^-2 into that equation and u get 1.66 as the pH.<br>  <br>  ADDITION: To get 2.19 x 10^-2 you have to plug in the EQ line into the equation .......HNC7H4SO3(aq) ? H+(aq) + NC7H4SO3-(aq).  So...... 2.32 = (x)(x) / (0.10-x) and solve for x.
txC0p30daa	This equation has no rational roots.  <br>  <br>  There are several ways that you can solve this equation without a calculator, but most involve mathematics that you might not be familiar with.

If we choose one of these pairs to make our fraction and it results in a value of zero for the original polynomial, then it is a root. See the following examples:<br>  <br>  f(1) = (1)^3 -7(1^2) + 14(1) -7 = 1 - 7 + 14 -7 = 1<br>  f(-1) = (-1)^3 -7(-1^2) + 14(-1) -7 = -1 -7 -14 -7 = -29<br>  f(1/7) = (1/7)^3 -7(1/7^2) + 14(1/7) -7 = 1/343 - 1/7 + 2 - 7 = -1763/343<br>  f(-1/7) = (-1/7)^3 -7((-1/7)^2) + 14(-1/7) -7 = -1/343 - 1/7 - 2 -7 = -3137/343<br>  <br>  Since none of these pairs produces a root, we can assume that the only solutions will be irrational. I would recommend the Cardano method of reducing the cubic equation to one without a quadratic term, them using the necessary formula (tricky, but gives exact solutions).<br>  <br>  If you look up "Cardano-Tartaglia" you will see many places with the formula listed with the appropriate symbols, which I cannot include here.

6f4545987db8cc09b8bec883d38d82faaa	Our Sun isn't massive enough to go supernova.  Instead, it will go through a red giant phase.  When it runs out of fuel (hydrogen) the core will contract in order to stay hot and when it reaches a certain temperature and is dense enough it will start fusing helium.  It's like it doesn't want to die :)  The outer layers expand and cools, our Sun is now bigger and more luminous.  Oh, and it's red.<br>  <br>  Then after some time the red giant will eventually run out of helium so the core contracts even more to stay hot and I think even hotter.  It becomes more luminous and its outer layers expand again.  Then, because the push of radiation is stronger than the pull of gravity, the star will lose its outer layers.  The outer layers are glowing beautifully because of the hot core, that's what a planetary nebula is - the glowing material surrounding the core.  That nebula is just weakly held by gravity and will eventually disappear.<br>  <br>  What was once our Sun will now remain a white dwarf and, supported by degenerate electron pressure, will no longer contract.  It will cool down verrrry slowly.  Suprisingly way slower than me lol, I take forever in writing these Astronomy & Space answers but it's how I can learn.|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Our sun isn't going to supernova.<br>  <br>  Our sun is too small to go supernova, or even nova. Look up Chandrasekhar's Limit -- named for the astronomer who determined this, it gives the sizes at which a star can go nova (1.4 times larger than our Sun) or supernova (3.2 times larger than our Sun).<br>  <br>  In either case, a star goes nova or supernova (depending on its mass) after it has first expanded from the heat of its internal fusion; if it expands enough, the fusion energy drops (because there isn't enough material close enough together to fuse). This causes the star to cool, which makes it shrink. The faster it shrinks -- due to the inertia of the mass out at the edge -- the denser it gets, which causes fusion to heat it up again. Only this time, the mass moving from the edge to the center has a lot more momentum, enough to compress it much more rapidly by the time it gets close to the center of the star.<br>  <br>  Stars above a certain mass (again, 40% or more larger than our Sun) do this quickly enough that instead of fusing continuously as a normal star does, the star fuses in a matter of moments, releasing millions of times more energy in a few seconds than the star normally does.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	A man in the audience of an Astronomy lecture was drifting off..<br>  Suddenly he started up, and interrupted the host.

Instead, as it uses up its hydrogen and then helium fuel, it will expand in size to a red giant; extending out beyond the orbit of Mercury and Venus.  Earth will be vaporised in the intense heat, then when the sun's energy is used up, it will shrink back down to a white dwarf, very dense, and smaller than the earth.<br>  <br>  For a star a lot larger than the sun (about ten or more times), they might go through several phases of swelling up and shrinking; finally becoming unstable and  exploding in a massive supernova.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	It will never have one. <br>  <br>  The Sun is too small to go supernova.

Time is just our perception of change in the universe. people tend to think of it as this even dimension, that everything in the universe travels foreward in time together, that we could...go back in it, that obviously implies it being some sort of dimension that can be traveled across. but thats not true. its completely relative.  Whats an illusion is not that things change and we percieve it as time, but that this change is even and absolute.|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	Theory's like string and m-theory(possibly super gravity?) say that there are 10 spatial dimensions and time is the 11th if I'm not mistaken.

The time from the beginning of our universe to the end of it. If the third dimension is mapped (X, Y, Z) then time would be the fourth coordinate determining WHEN we are at that location<br>  The fifth is all the universes, it requires you to actually believe there are completely separate existences out there not anywhere on our grid, where we live.<br>  The sixth is like stacking transparencies of every one of those universes created by the same initial conditions (here, the 'big bang') on top of each other and seeing every choice you could have, or will possibly, ever make. Or even the existence in which we were never created, the world never formed, or that existence didn't exist, except as void, but it's still possible. <br>  The seventh is every possible universe created by any possible initial condition. Like the sixth dimension, but with every initial condition and every one of those conditions possibilities.<br>  The eighth require you to shrink all of the seventh down to a single point, and consider it one infinity. Then compare infinities similar to it, without taking yours into account. (I think of it as just acknowledging the existence of other infinities other than your own. I might be a little off here.)<br>  The ninth is every set of infinities with different initial conditions. Every possibility of evolution, creation, or else. <br>  the tenth is a mystery as we've already covered every possible existence out to it's infinite stretch. At this point, there's nothing left. <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe this could be heaven, or even something we don't understand one hundred dimensions before heaven. <br>  <br>  The dimensions are hard to grasp, but an awesome concept if you care to think that hard. The most important thing to remember about time though is for in order for it to make sense, it must exist. Like numbers.

AA10854273	The actinides (or actinoids) are the chemical elements with atomic numbers between 90 and 109 inclusively. They occur between Groups 3 and 4 in Period 7 of the periodic table. All elements in this family are radioactive. Five actinides namely: thorium, protoactinium, uranium, neptunium, and plutonium have been found in nature. The other actinides have been produced artificially in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. For many years, the list of chemical elements known to scientists ended with atomic number 92, uranium. Scientists were uncertain as to whether elements heavier than uranium would ever be found. Then, in 1940, a remarkable discovery was made while University of California physicists Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson were studying nuclear fission. During their research, the duo found evidence for the existence of a new element with atomic number 94, two greater than that of uranium. This new element was the first transuranium (heaver than uranium) element ever discovered. McMillan and Abelson named it neptunium, after the planet Neptune, just as uranium had been named after the planet Uranus. Later in the same year, McMillan and his two other colleagues found a second transuranium element, which they named plutonium, after the planet Pluto. At that point, the race was on to develop more synthetic transuranium elements, but the research process was not easy. The approach was to fire subatomic particles or small atoms, like those of helium, at a very large nucleus by means of a particle accelerator. If the smaller particle could be made to merge with the larger nucleus, a new atom would be produced. Over time, techniques became more and more sophisticated, and ever-heavier elements were created: americium (number 95) and curium (number 96) in 1944; berkelium (number 97) in 1949; californium (number 98) in 1950; einsteinium (number 99) and fermium (number 100) in 1952; mendelevium (number 101) in 1955; nobelium (number 102) in 1958; and lawrencium (number 103) in 1961. Studies of the actinide elements are among the most ingenious in all of chemistry. In some cases, no more than one or two atoms of a new element have been produced. Yet scientists have been able to study those few atoms well enough to discover basic properties of the elements. These studies are made even more difficult because most actinide isotopes decay quickly, with half-lives of only a few days or a few minutes. With the discovery of lawrencium, the actinide family of elements is complete. Scientists have also found elements heavier than lawrencium, but these elements belong to the lanthanide family (or rare earth elements). Uranium is a dull gray metallic element, relatively abundant in Earth's crust, ranking number 47 among the elements. Although perhaps not as well known, it is actually more abundant than more familiar elements such as tin, silver, mercury, and gold. By far the most important property of uranium is its radioactivity. Natural uranium consists of three isotopes of mass numbers 234, 235, and 238. All three isotopes are radioactive. Its most abundant isotope, uranium-238, decays by emitting an alpha particle with a half-life of 4.47 × 109 years. The half-life of uranium-238 is about equal to the age of Earth. That means that about one-half of all the uranium found on Earth at its moment of creation is still here. The other one-half has decayed to other elements. Knowing the half life of uranium-238 scientists can estimate the age of rocks. The amount of uranium-238 found in any particular rock is compared to the amount of daughter isotopes found with it. A daughter isotope is an isotope formed when some parent isotope, such as uranium-238, decays. The more daughter isotope present in a sample, the older the rock; the less daughter isotope, the younger the rock. The second most abundant isotope of uranium, uranium-235, has the rare property of being fissionable, meaning that its atomic nuclei will break apart when bombarded by neutrons. The fission of a uranium-235 nucleus releases very large amounts of energy, additional

One posits a hypothesis to explain some observed phenomena. Experiments are devised to test the hypothesis. If the experiment produces the expected phemomena the hypothesis desribes, the hypothesis becomes a theory. The experimentation must be confirmed independantly by others (also know as peer review) to ensure that there were no errors in formulation or execution. Peer review is the bedrock of the scientific process. Now comes the fun part. Now that we have a theory, it can possibly tell us new phenomena we should be able to observe that were previously unknown. We can construct new experiments to confirm these heretofore unobserved phenomena. (for example high energy particle physics attempts to observe the subatomic particles predicted to exist by quantum mechanics) If the experiment produces the expected result, this confirms the theory in more completeness. If the experiment does not produce the expected results, either the theory is flawed or incomplete. This is the process that moves science forward. For example, Newtonian physics breaks down in relatavistic frames (acclerated, or in large gravity fields). It takes relatavistic physics to correct the problems. Einstein found these problems with newtonian physics which resulted in his theories on relativity. Not to worry, relatavistic physics when utilized in "normal" everyday situations, just reduces to newtonian physics that we already know. The ongoing work of science is to find the testable and reproducible explanations to the things our current set of scientific theories cannot explain. The current holy grail is to develop a theory that resolves the contradictions between gravitaion and quantum mechanics - theories of gravity correctly describe gravity, but conflict with quantum mechanics, while quantum mecanhics correctly describes the subatomic, it conflicts with our theories of gravity. Science develops the new theories that complete the gaps in our current theories.<br>  This is theoretical science. Applied science and engineering then takes the theories and applies them to practical purposes. For example, lasers were devloped from the theoretical understanding of light and optics. Electronics were developed from the theoretical electrical properties of certain substances. Medicine is the practical application of biological theories.<br>  Key terms would be experimentation, testability/measurability, predicted results, peer review, reproducibility.|`|AA11150649	*  Firstly by not misusing the products of science.<br>  * Making products for humans which can equally cause them progress.

Sqmp88Ufaa	Le géographe est capable d'aborder la société humaine en étudiant son espace, et non en se basant sur des principes abstraits.<br>  <br>  Comprendre pourquoi les gens s'entassent en ville revient à comprendre pourquoi ils quittent les campagnes. <br>  <br>  Je vous renvois donc, pour les systèmes agraires en Afrique, à cet ouvrage, qui date un peu, quoique réédité récemment : <br>  LEBEAU R., Les grands types de structures agraires dans le monde, Paris, A Colin, 7e édition, 2000.<br>  <br>  Il montre que les structures actuelles en Afrique peuvent se rattacher aux grands types agraires en Europe : bocage et openfield. Beaucoup de systèmes agraires ressemblent techniquement un peu aux n?tres au XVIIIe siècle, mais avec des relations sociales très diversifiées d'un peuple à l'autre et sur des sols tropicaux fragiles. <br>  <br>  Lorsque les pays du Nord ont voulu moderniser l'agriculture africaine, ils ont calqué les schémas de l'agriculture capitaliste européenne ou américaine du XXe siècle, sans prise en compte des systèmes agraires existants, des relations sociales, de la perception des espaces vécus par les populations. <br>  <br>  Résultat : exode rural massif et entassement dans les villes.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Pour penser le cadre urbain et le "vivre ensemble", je n'ai pas d'ouvrage en tête, mais l'idée la plus importante est la capacité à penser à plusieurs niveaux scalaires :<br>  <br>  - L'espace vécu des individus et les migrations pendulaires journalières des individus ;<br>  <br>  - L'environnement immédiat de l'individu, les contraintes de sa vie quotidienne (transports en communs adaptés ou non, dans la négative, les problèmes de parking, les conséquences de la politique autophobique de certaines grandes villes et le stress que cela génère).<br>  <br>  - Les relations foncières dans l'espace (les couronnes) et le co?t du logement. Les éventuelles politiques visant à réduire la ségrégation socio-spatiale. Les stratégies des gens pour accéder au logement (là où ils vivent correspond-il à une position définitive ou provisoire en attendant la maison ou l'emploi souhaité ?)<br>  <br>  La situation locale de l'emploi. <br>  <br>  La relation avec les villes voisines. Quelle est la ville la plus proche ? Comment se recoupent les sphères d'influence des villes dans le pavage urbain régional ?<br>  <br>  La position de chef-lieu. La ville étudiée est-elle un chef-lieu, une capitale ? Est-elle capitale purement administrative (type Brasilia) ou centre économique (type New-York).<br>  <br>  - Les temporalités courtes : si tout le monde travaille de 8h00 à 17h00 du lundi au vendredi, il y a des engorgements et de la congestion. Si les administrations sont fermées à 15h30, comme en France, cela crée des soucis pour les gens.<br>  <br>  - Les temporalités moyennes : cycles économiques ; cohortes et classes d'age des arrivant et des partants de la ville. <br>  <br>  Les temporalités longues : la structure centre-périphérie de la ville résulte souvent d'une histoire pluriséculaire.<br>  <br>  - La "nature" en ville : parcs, espaces verts. L'approche paysagère en relation avec les représentation et la perception des individus, les nécessités écologiques ( de ce point de vue, une friche est beaucoup plus riche qu'un jardin bien entretenu).

vtzdMnvkaa	1 millimeter = 1000 micrometers|`|zjNkhKOkaa	1000 μm|`|VvRENINJaa	Whenever you are doing conversions it is easiest to start with the conversion for meters to micrometers. <br>         1 meter = 1 x 10^-6 um<br>  Always start from here when doing these problems. The second step to solving this problem is determining how many meters are in 1 millimeter. A simple mnemonic to remember how the decimal place moves when doing such conversions is Kind Hearts Do Good Deed Christmas Morning, khdgdcm. Where, from left to right: k=kilometers, h=hectometers, d=decameters, g=grams/meters/liters, d=decimeters, c=centimters, and m=millimeters. When counting from millimeters (far right) to meters (grams/meters/liters) you must travel 3 places to the left (c=1; d=2; g/m/L=3). Therefore, to convert millimeters to meters, you must move the decimal place 3 places to the left. So:<br>       1 millimeter = 0.001 meters. <br>  Next, convert 0.001 meters into micrometers. <br>       0.001 meters x 10^-6 = 0.001 x 10^-6 micrometers<br>  <br>      This is also shown by: 0.001meters x (1 x 10^-6 um/1m). The meters cancel out, leaving 0.001 x 10^-6 um. <br>  <br>  Any value that is in meters can be multiplied by 10^-6 to get micrometers. Next, simplify the above answer into scientific notation:<br>      0.001 x 10^-6 micrometers = 1.0 x 10^-9 micrometers. <br>  That's it! 1mm=1.0 X 10^-9 um.|`|iGyIvxfxaa	1mm=1000μm|`|sKZpRF5naa	The standaard would be 1 meter. <br>  so 1 dm=1m/10<br>  1cm=1m/100<br>  1mm=1m/1000<br>  <br>  and from 1 milimeter to micro meter, you mutiply that by 10^-3 from micrometer, meaning 10^-6 to 10^-3, you add 3 more zeros. <br>  <br>  So it becomes 1000.

73D8PfMQaa	Fibrinolysis by definition is the process of degradation of fibrin (fibrillary protein mesh-work that forms at the site of injury to stop bleeding along with entrapped blood cells.)<br>  <br>  When injury occurs, vasoconstriction happens to slow bleeding almost instantaneously, then a platelet plug develops and finally activation of the coagulation system and formation of the fibrin mesh-work with entrapped blood cells.<br>  <br>  Following repair of the injury after several days, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is slowly released into the blood by the injured endothelial cells which then cleaves a liver produced zymogen (inactive form of an enzyme) called PLASMINOGEN into the active enzyme PLASMIN. Plasmin then cleaves the fibrin meshwork into soluble peptides called FIBRIN DEGREDATION PRODUCTS (FDP) ie. D-Dimer, one such product. These degredation products are then cleared by the liver and kidneys, or broken down into amino acids by proteases.<br>  <br>  Blood D-Dimers can be measured quantitatively by immunological methods (ie. antibodies against the D-Dimer proteins.) These  measures are very useful to assess patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms, as well as myocardial infarcts (MI), strokes or other thromboembolic diseases<br>  <br>  Because blood clothing occurs spontaneously in the vessels, it is very important that the fibrinolytic system degrade these cloths. Together the fibrinolytic system and the coagulation system maintain normal hemostasis, that is the homeostasis of the blood ensuring that the blood is liquid and flows smoothly in uninjured vessels and rapidly cloths at the site of injury.<br>  <br>  Today several enzyme drugs exist on the market that can cleave inactive zymogenic plasminogen into the active enzyme plasmin, ie streptokinase, urokinase, staphylokinase, alteplase, etc. used to treat patients with thromboembolic disease such as deep vein thromosis, pulmonary embolism, or occlusion of any artery by a thromboemboli|`|W1esWDPHaa	Fibrinolysis is the process where a fibrin clot, the product of coagulation, is broken down.

me0na9CCaa	OK so im pretty sure this is how you would do it but i guess i have to describe it in words and im not 100% sure. First pretty much leave out the bottom of the fraction until later and solve for the top. First find a common denominator and then add and multiply the whle top so it is one nice fraction. Then take the bottom one from earlier and flip it to multiply with the fraction you just got. Then at that time you can proceed to cross stuff out and multiply. Hope thats it.

UcAQzunraa	If you take the tan of an angle to get the value given, 1.376, then in order to find the angle you just work backwards.  You can take the inverse tangent (tan^-1) of 1.376.<br>  <br>  angle = tan^-1 (1.376)<br>  <br>  If you punch that into your calculator you should get 53.9924 degress, which you can round to 54 degrees since you are asked to give it to the nearest whole integer.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|yucYuF4Oaa	take the arctan of 1.376 which equals 53.

siQjKX0laa	Not a bad question, and I bet you know somehow that derivatives are involved. Yep! A little pen and paper shows<br>  <br>  f"(x) = 6ax + 2b<br>  <br>  and that tells you the point of inflection is at x = -b/(3a), right? So how about a bit of trickery: make a new variable z = x + b/(3a). If you look at f now with z instead of x, well the inflection point's been shifted to z = 0. A bit more detail: use g(z) = f(x) = f(z - b/(3a)). Now you want to figure out where the extreme points are. Here's what you should do:<br>  <br>  Figure out what g(z) is, then double check it has an inflection point at zero: g''(0) = 0. Once you have that, you can find where the extreme points of g are. That'll mean you'll have to solve a quadratic equation, but when you're done, you'll have the maximum and minimum points in terms of a, b, c, and d like you wanted.<br>  <br>  --- <br>  Another way to go is continuing down the path Mr. Gerry started. The extreme points of f are where f'(x) = 0. That means<br>  <br>  0 = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c<br>  <br>  and the quadratic formula in your notes gives you<br>  <br>  x = (-2b + sqrt(4b^2 - 12ac)) / 6a<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  x = (-2b - sqrt(4b^2 - 12ac)) / 6a<br>  <br>  Pick it apart a bit; I'll do the first one of these and you do the second, okay?<br>  <br>  x = -b/(3a) + sqrt(4b^2 - 12ac) / 6a<br>  <br>  Nice thing is that, like above, -b/(3a) is the inflection point. The other part, sqrt(4b^2 - 12ac)/6a, is how much to the right you have to go from it to get to one of the extreme points. By jings! same as how much you have to go to the left.

CCeRdaoLaa	Science deals with the observable natural world.  Spirits would be supernatural, and thereby above the natural world and outside of the scope of science.<br>  <br>  I agree with Labsci.  The science points towards materialism - that consciousness is rooted in the physical matter of the brain.  That doesn't entirely exclude the possibility of a spirit (since you can't disprove something that you can't measure), but the science fits together just fine without it.<br>  <br>  You have to be careful not to fall into "dichotomy mode" when you're talking about science, though.  Scientists are *very* precise when they make a statement, and it's incredibly frustrating when other people try to infer things beyond that.  For example, when I say that "science doesn't point to the existence of the spirit,"  that's what I mean, nothing more.  No subtext, no hidden meaning, just a simple statement.  Unfortunately, people infer from that that I mean "science shows that there is no spirit," which is just not true.  Unfortunately, science journalists fall prey to this all the time, which is why there is often a lot of confusion in the public eye (and the misconception that scientists commonly make grand, sweeping, "I have spoken!" type statements).   It's a very subtle, but important difference.<br>  <br>  But, like I said, the science doesn't need the existence of the spirit to explain consciousness, but it doesn't rule it out either.  In the end, scientists are regular people, with their own personal beliefs.  I've met some who are strict materialists, and others who are very religious.  I personally fall somewhere between materialist and spiritual - I'm open the the possibility that there is more than we can observe... but I make no claims to understand what that is, so to introduce it into my science would simply add an uncontrollable variable with no real benefit to the research (which would make for bad science).<br>  <br>  Trying to stereotype the beliefs of the average scientist would be like stereotyping the beliefs of the average American - there's just too much variation to be accurate.|`|AA11177194	Scientists are just like any other people. They often have religions and beliefs, but that cannot get in the way of science. You cannot say that maggots come from raw meat because of miracles or spirits, but have to observe and experiment.

GJtXDuGPaa	The onion has been traced back as far as the Bronze Age and was worshipped by the Ancient Egyptians (and eaten by the Israelites during their bondage in Egypt). Onions were rubbed over the muscles of Roman gladiators, used to pay rent in the Middle Ages and eventually brought to the Americas, where today we fry, caramelize, pickle, grill and generally enjoy them.<br>  <br>  Many of us burst into tears when we cut into one, too. It’s the price we pay for onion-y goodness. Here’s a play-by-play breakdown of how we go from grabbing a knife to crying like a baby:<br>  <br>  1. When you cut into an onion, its ruptured cells release all sorts of goodies, like allinase enzymes and amino acid sulfoxides. The former breaks the latter down into sulfenic acids.<br>  2. The sulfenic acids, unstable bunch that they are, spontaneously rearrange into thiosulfinates, which produce a pungent odor and at one time got the blame for our tears. The acids are also converted by the LF-synthase enzyme into a gas called syn-propanethial-S-oxide, also known as the Lachrymatory (crying) Factor.<br>  3. Syn-propanethial-S-oxide moves through the air and reaches our eyes. The first part of the eye it meets, the cornea, is populated by autonomic motor fibers that lead to the lachrymal glands. When syn-propanethial-S-oxide is detected, all the fibers in the cornea start firing away and tell the lachrymal glands to wash the irritant away.<br>  4. Our eyes automatically start blinking and producing tears, which flushes the irritant away. Of course, our reaction to burning eyes is often to rub them, which only makes things worse since our hands also have some syn-propanethial-S-oxide on them.<br>  It only takes about 30 seconds to start crying after you make the first cut, that’s the time needed for syn-propanethial-S-oxide formation to peak.<br>  Why Don’t Green Onions Make Us Cry? The onion’s relatives, like green onions, shallots, leeks and garlic, also produce sulfenic acids when cut, but they generally have fewer (or no) LF-synthase enzymes and don’t produce syn-propanethial-S-oxide.<br>  How Do I Avoid Crying?You guys owe me for this one. Since I usually go through a good deal of onions while cooking at home, I’ve been road testing some of the different methods the Internet suggests for reducing or avoiding the effects of the Lachrymatory Factor. Here’s what I tried:<br>  Method #1: Chill or slightly freeze the onions before cutting, the idea being that this will change the chemical reactions and reduce the gas that is released.<br>  Result: The onion from the fridge has me crying just as quickly as room temperature ones. The one that was in a freezer for 30 minutes leaves me dry eyed for a bit, but by the time I’m done dicing my eyes start to burn a little.<br>  Method #2: Cut fast! Get the chopping over with before the gas reaches your eyes.<br>  Result: Just hacking away at the onion, I get in the frying pan without so much as a sting in my eyes. The onion looks awful, though. Doing a proper dice, I take a little too long and start tearing up. If you don’t mind a mangled onion, this is the way to go.<br>  Method #3: Put a slice of bread in your mouth, and cut the onion with most of the bread sticking out to “catch” the fumes.<br>  Result: It seems the loaf of bread I have has gone stale. I stop the experiment and put bread on my shopping list.<br>  Method #4: Chew gum while chopping. It keeps you breathing through your mouth, which keeps the fumes away from your eyes.<br>  Result: This seems to work pretty well as long as you hold your head in the right position. Leaning towards the cutting board or looking right down at the onion puts your eyes right in the line of fire again.<br>  Method #5: Cut the onions under running water. This prevents the gas from traveling up into the eyes.<br>  Result: An onion in the sink is a hard onion to cut. I think Confucius said that. My leaky Brita filter is spraying me in the face and I’m terrified I’m going to cut myself, but I’m certainly not crying.<br>  <br>  Method #6: Wear goggles.<br>  Result: In an effort to maintain my dignity, I try my eyeglasses and sunglasses first. Neither do me any good. The ol’ chemistry lab safety glasses make me look silly, but help a little more. I imagine swim goggles would really do the trick, but I don’t have any. Any readers interested in testing this for us? We’d love it if you also sent pictures.<br>  Method #7: Change your onion. “Tear free” onions have been developed in the UK via special breeding and in New Zealand via “gene silencing” techniques.<br>  Result: My nearest grocery store, Whole Foods, doesn’t sell genetically modified produce or onions from England. Tonight, we eat leeks!<br>  If you’ve got a burning question that you’d like to see answered here, shoot me an email at flossymatt (at) gmail.com. Twitter users can also make nice with me and ask me questions there. Be sure to give me your name and location (and a link, if you want) so I can give you a little shout out.|`|AA10854273	Onions are a member of the Allium family of vegetables that also includes leeks, shallots, chives, garlic and sharp scallion. The tears come from volatile oils containing substances called amino acid sulphoxides, which give the members of this family of vegetables their characteristic smells. So why do we cry? Well, when you cut the onion you also release substances called allinases which break down the amino acid sulphoxides to something called sulphenic acid which then turns into something called syn-propanethial-S-oxide which irritates nerve fibres on the surface of the eye, triggering tear production. Because it takes time for this substance to form, this explains why we don't start to cry until at least 30 seconds into cutting up an onion. So how do you solve the problem? There are 3 ways. 1) Heat the onions before you cut them. This destroys the allinase which causes the reaction to happen in the first place, so the onion cannot make you cry. 2) cut the onions outside in a well-ventilated area 3) cut them under water.

INAFwW3Saa	Well, for starters, the whole reaction would be:<br>  Mg(OH)2 + HCl → MgCl2 + H2O.<br>  <br>  It's important to write the water as well so that you can balance it correctly.  <br>  <br>  First, to make balancing easier to see, you should write water as HOH, that way you can see the -OH group.  Then, you're equation would be:<br>  Mg(OH)2 + HCl → MgCl2 + HOH<br>  <br>  Starting with the left side of the equation, we can see that there are 1 Mg, 2 OH, 1 H, and 1 Cl.  On the right side, we see that there is 1 Mg, 2 Cl, 1 H and 1 OH.<br>  <br>  The Mg's are even on both sides, so we can pretty much leave that alone.  Attached to the Mg is the OH, which has 2 of them.  On the right side OH only has 1, so we add a 2 in front of HOH.  But that gives us 2 H's on the right side, so we have to add a 2 in front of the HCl on the left.  That also gives us 2 Cl's on the left, but that will match the right side of MgCl2.<br>  <br>  So, in summary it's:<br>  Mg(OH)2 + 2 HCl  → MgCl2 + 2 HOH|`|66ae92d2cce51274f11213f71597bd09aa	well you need the other part of the equation first, HOH (aka H2O but i think its easier when you look at it like HOH)<br>  so itd be Mg(OH)2 + HCl = MgCl2 + HOH<br>  <br>  so in the first part you have 1 Mg 2OH 1H and 1Cl <br>  on the right you have 1Mg 1OH 1H and 2Cl <br>  you need the numbers to match <br>  <br>  so you add a two infront of HOH and you have<br>  1Mg 2OH 1H 1Cl = 1Mg 2OH 2H 2 Cl<br>  <br>  then you add a two infron of HCl and you have<br>  1Mg 2OH 2H 2Cl = 1Mg 2OH 2H 2Cl<br>  because you only have 1 Mg you cant reduce it anymore so your final equation is 1Mg(OH)2 + 2HCl = 1MgCl2 + 2HOH<br>  <br>  also you dont have to write the ones it, just putting to help show you

It would be unwise to with not knowing how this is going to react in your system. They are taking precautions as well to have you build up the dose slower to get your system to accept it more so and not be as likely to cause a reaction, allergy, intolerance,etc. Be careful and do not over do any and do not jump ahead with no known reactions to this.<br>  <br>  It seems this is a new medicine and should be taken with caution, not anxiously to not jump into any unknown reaction you'd have to confront.

AA11824362	As these materials increase, so does the explosiveness of the volcanoes. When silica content in a mineral goes up, the complexity of silicate molecules also increases. Minerals with low silica content (olivines, for example) have simple structures and do not cohere easily. Minerals with higher silica content (micas or amphiboles, for examples) do cohere, and eventually can form a cap on their volcanoes. Water vapor (and other gases) build up pressure until they exceed the roof strength of the volcanic cap, which causes a caldera or other explosive volcanic eruptions.|`|Rx67UTNDaa	The higher the amount of both the greater the explosiveness of the volcano<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoe...</a>

3kLOvTskaa	Conservation of mass is a tough thing to 'prove' - though you could put together an interesting demonstration.  Using alka-seltzer and water, I assume the idea is to dissolve a lot of it and see that even after it all dissovled the mass of the system is the same as the inputs.  Clearly the gas has a mass, though I'd be surprised if it's mass were measurable using a triple beam balance (but I'll assume it can be).<br>  <br>  Run two experiments.  Put a beaker of water and a pill or two of alka-seltzer next to the beaker on the balance and figure out how much it all weighs.  Then move the pills into the water and after the reaction is over, see if the mass changed.  Assuming it would (losing gas from system) you have a baseline for the amount of change you'd expect.<br>  <br>  For the second experiment, either add a balloon (or rubber glove) to the setup.  Find how much everything weighs to begin with, then put the tablets into the water, cover the top of the beaker with the rubber and then watch as the pills dissolve but the mass remains constant.  Could also do this in a soda bottle - but the seltzer may not dissolve once the bottle gets pressurized (or it may go bang!).<br>  <br>  Sounds like fun either way.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	What do you mean by "conservation of mass"?<br>  <br>  Einstein thought Energy = Mass x C (speed of light) squared.<br>  guess what, the atomic bomb really did go BANG!

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Given no friction, the only work is in lifting the weight of the hanging chain back up to the table height.    The hanging weight is w(y) = m(y) g; where w(y) implies the hanging weight depends on y the amount of chain hanging.  m(y) = rho y = (m/L) y is the hanging mass and rho is the chain density.  Thus the weight lifted at any y is w(y) = (mg/L) y; where m, g, and L are given constants.    Each increment of work dWE = w(y) dy = (mg/L) y dy and WE = INT(dWE) = (mg/L) INT(y dy) = (mg/L) |y^2/2| for y = 1/4 L to 0    Thus WE = (mg/L)(1/16)(1/2) L^2 = (mgL)/32 QED.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Since the table is frictionless all the work involved is raising the effective center of mass for the hanging part to the level of the table (were it really this easy)  The effective center of mass of a uniform chain is half way along its length so 1/4 of the mass has a center of gravity 1/8 of the length below the edge of the table.  so it becomes m/4 * g *L/8.

l0Ojx5DCaa	Slope, as in a ratio of two distance, or as a rate of two quantities? Constant slope or dynamic slope?<br>  <br>  Slope, in general, is defined by a fraction relating the relative change of two variables. It is most commonly used to define the ratio of two changes in distance. As well, examples which show a constant slope are very different from examples which show a changing slope.<br>  <br>  One interesting example of slope that doesn't just use distances is price. When an item is expensive, people will often say that the price is "pretty steep", meaning that you spend a large amount of money relative to a small object or quantity. The price of gas last December was pretty steep, especially compared to the price in December 2001 ($0.89/1 gallon compared to $4.25/1 gallon). This is a comparison of rates/slopes.<br>  <br>  More interesting is dynamic slope. If you chart the elevation of an object thrown off of the Sears Tower, the slope of this path is represented by the velocity of the object (distance travelled/time passed). As speed grows, so does the slope (in absolute value). The speed at any given moment is the slope, but gravity forces the slope to change. Thus, the graph of a falling object compared against time appears as a curve (constantly changing slope) instead of a straight line.|`|txC0p30daa	Pay per hour, number of pizzas you need per kid for a party, cups of flour you need per cake, miles you can go per gallon of gas in your car.  <br>  <br>  Hope that's enough.|`|580f0323cc6aff55ee771dc0cf43ec21aa	Slope of a ramp, such as one used for disabled people.

AA11513203	Doc is right.    1. You have to be able/willing to mate with it;  2. The mating needs to be able to produce offspring;  3. The offspring have to be fertile.     1 is not enough, because (as stated) someone's willingness to mate with a pig doesn't make it the same species.    And  1 and  2 is not enough because without fertile offspring, there is no continuation of the gene pool.   This is *critical*.   Horses and donkeys will continue to get more and more genetically different because half-horse/half-donkeys (mules) don't continue the gene pool.    That is why it is NOT arbitrary.   The genetic boundary is a very important feature of biology.   Populations that can continue exchanging genes, can evolve *as a single thing* ... a *species*.   Once the genetic boundary is established, and two groups A and B cannot interbreed to produce fertile offspring (i.e. there are no fertile AB hybrids) ... then A and B *must* continue to get more and more different.    >"I was thinking about bacteria too, perhaps we need to rethink our definition of species, as an arbitrary classification scheme for our own convenience?"    Scientists do NOT apply the words 'species' to bacteria ... for that very reason.    So no  redefinition is necessary.|`|T7b7tKvraa	technically not true.     When the creatures mate, they have to give birth to viable offspring in order to be called of the same species.  Meaning, not only must the chromosomes match up, and create a living animal, but that animal must be capable of reproduction itself.    A donkey and horse are not the same species for this reason, a mule is always infertile.    But that doesnt mean the horse and donkey can't get it on...just like you could with a pig...if you really wanted to.|`|X4UAMHhRaa	doc is right but not generally true for all living organisms.

B8IPlF8Baa	The first one is meaningless as written.<br>  <br>  2 times 4x is 8x.  I'm not sure why one would want to square the x. If you're confused about anything like that, work through a few examples.  x = 0 and/or x = 1 often suffice.  When, as in this case, they don't, try x = 2 too.  What's 4x when x = 2? What's 2 times that? Does it equal 8x? (It does) Does it equal 8x^2 (It doesn't.)<br>  <br>  And when simplifying or factoring, don't write a "times 1" as part of the final answer.

One of the simplest is to make a table of all the possible outcomes:<br>  tttt, tttf, ttft,tftt, fttt,ttff, tftf,tfft, fttf, ftft,fftt, tfff, ftff, fftf, ffft, ffff<br>  and simply count (13), then divide by 16   (13/16)<br>  <br>  You could also use the binomial distribution, which describes this exactly.  There is a formula that is not easily provided in text like this (try googling binomial distribution).  At any rate, the formula describes the probability of getting exactly k true answers in n trials, with a probability of p.  We know that  n = 4 (four questions), p = 0.5 (equal probability of true and false), and that you will add the answers for k = 0, 1, and 2 true answers.  <br>  <br>  I hope that helped a bit.

Use the limit law for a composition of functions:  lim {xa} f(g(x)) = f(lim {xa} g(x))    Thus,  lim {x0+} tan^-1(ln(x))  = tan^-1( lim {x0+} ln(x) )    as x approaches 0 from the right the ln() function approaches -    Now we have:  tan^-1(-)    As the tan^1() function approaches - the value tends towards -/4.

R9KvEhMxaa	There's a very fine sheet of muscle that runs from the top of your head down into your shoulders. Your conventional headache arises from tension in this sheet. This is painful. It is not actually in the skull, or having to do with the brain. Conventional treatment involves things like NSAID analgesics, which block part of the chemical reactions that make this painful. Think of it sort of like a muscle spasm or cramp, only in a very thin layer of muscle.    A migraine headache arises from something more complicated, and is far more painful. Basically there's a wave of depressed neuronal activity that eventually results in dilation of the large arteries feeding the head. This puts pressure on certain large cranial nerves that connect to areas of the face and neck. This is excruciating for the most part. Migraines are usually treated either with drugs that stop that wave of depressed activity, or using drugs that reverse the dilation of those arteries and relieve the pressure on the nerves. Many OTC migraine medications include caffeine, as it's a mild vasoconstrictor, and can help with this.|`|rkSFshQPaa	brain freezes bro|`|FYs2TaZHaa	an ache of the head.|`|nR0dxezGaa	Constriction of blood vessels in your head.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Its pain felt on the head.

Beyond the anatomic similarities, there are a number of prehuman fossils which show more common features with apes.  Then you get into molecular homology.  The variation within the human population is about one tenth the difference with chimpanzees.  The structure of human chromosome 2 shows how two ape chromosomes fused, complete with one inactivated center.  Humans share genes with chimpanzees that are not share with gorillas or orangutans.    Two populations can co-exist if they do not compete for resources or if they are in different geographic regions.  This objection to evolution is based on confined competing species, but the modern great apes do not share habitats or resources.  The evidence is too strong.  Evolution deniers clutch at straws which have nothing to do with reality.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Read up on evolution again. Humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor, not from each other. In one particular habitat and environment, the evolutionary process favoured apes, allowing them to survive and flourish in areas not suitable for humans. In other areas, the process led to the development of humans.    Look at the DNA comparisons between apes and humans, and for remains of ancestors found; the matching percentages are too great to be statistically coincidental.    Also, you believe that animal evolution occurred; primates (including apes and humans) are also animals.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Consider this    The Young Age of the Earth  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

What about the commonality of Human and chip blood types, so similar that you can take a transfusion from a chimp, which you can't do with any other animal.    You miss the point of evolution, the best fitted survive.  Chimps are better fitted to a forest way of life than humans, they have evolved into a niche that we couldn't fill.  The same goes with Mountain Gorillas, they are much better adapted to their lifestyle than we are.    Evolution branches, with each population going it's own way.  It's not an either or equation, you can and do have both.  What's perhaps interesting is that Homo Sapiens Sapiens is the only survivor in the line of decent from the branching with the chimp line.  There were other Homo species, such as neanderthal and we seemed to have out competed them.  The problem you have is looking only at the now and not through time.    What is certain is that neither ourselves or chimps or bonobos or gorillas or.... are the same as the shared common ancestor.  We have all evolved since that point, variations arising and being selected do to the environmental pressures.  Some variations fitted best with the genome and phenotype in one species, but wouldn't have been selected in the other as it wouldn't have fitted.   Change upon change and millions of years means we are distant cousins now, but we are still related.|`|XmLJ84YBaa	Evolution is a unifying theory of biology. Since it is a theory scientists cannot "prove" it. Instead, they seek to disprove it. With each failed attempt to disprove something the theory gains strength. Also, try not to think of strength and weakness in terms of physical strength and power. It simply means that one species is more adept at living in a certain situation compared to another. Dogs and wolves, for example, shared a common ancestor much like apes and humans. Each adapted to its own way of living depending on its particular strengths. Also, evolution has a way a weeding out certain traits that are weak from certain species, but not necessarily always an entire species.|`|AA11606721	"humans and apes coexisting completely obliterates the idea of evolutionism."    To make this statement reveals that you don't know what evolution is.    Here's some help:  http://www.abarnett.demon.co.uk/atheism/...|`|FLgE0xAJaa	One the problems here is that many evolution skeptics get their information from creationist sources, which are noted for lying about the evidence for evolution, the age of the earth, and other relevant areas of study.    Survival is not necessarily between the strong and the weak. It is the most fit that survive. What is meant by most fit is those individuals that are best adapted to their environment.    Your statement about living apes is irrelevant. For example, if the wolf was the ancestor of dogs, why are there still wolves? The fact that there are still wolves is not evidence that dogs are not descended from wolves.    The great apes and humans had a common ancestor about 12 million years ago. The line leading to chimpanzees and man separated from the other great apes several million years after that. Then, about 7 million years ago, the line leading to humans separated from the line leading to chimps. This has been well documented in genetic studies, which show that humans have over 98% of their genes in common with chimps, and a bit less in the gorillas and even less in the orangutan.    There is no evolutionary requirement that all apes had to evolve into humans. Speciation occurs primarily because some populations of an ancestral species are separated from others of their kind and are subject to different environmental pressures. If a species is well adapted to a particular environment, there is little pressure for evolutionary change. That is why the apes have not changed much from their ancestral form. The common ancestor of human and chimp was not a chimp, but it would have looked something like a chimp. The branch leading to humans expanded to a different environment and came under selective pressure to change and adapt to that environment. That is why humans evolved as they did.    Here is some interesting evidence for human evolution. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while all the other great apes have 24. Evolutionary theory predicted that two of the ancestral chromosomes must have joined together in the line leading to humans after the separation from the line leading to chimps. That has recently been confirmed by studies showing that human chromosome 2 is the result of the joining of two separate chromosomes that existed in the common ancestor, which resulted in the reduced chromosome count in humans. Those two chromosomes are still separate in the chimp and they are virtually identical genetically to the combined human chromosome 2. There are even non-functioning leftover telomeres and centromeres in the proper locations in the human chromosome 2 as would be expected if a joining had occurred. That is only one example of the enormous amount of evidence for evolution.    See http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome...     Add to that the numerous fossil remains of human ancestors, and there is sufficient evidence for human evolution.

For example, is 18.19 "closer" to 18 or 19?  What this question is asking is do you understand what "rounding" means.  What it means is, what integer value is the given value closest to...    Of course, you can "round" to a non-integer value, but the same principal applies.    A rather common problem is what value does 10.5 "round to?  In this instance you must select a "rule" to apply, such as all values equal to or above .5 will be "rounded" up (which is the most common approach.)|`|wZbez89uaa	18, 80 , 25   wtf kinda question is that this is dumb|`|tLLts6HFaa	18  80  25|`|zpXTgUpiaa	18, 80, 25

Some byproducts can cause health problems in cattle, others are not palatable and would need to be mixed.      Others, need special equipment to store the by products to avoid spoilage or mold growth.    Cattle need nutrients to remain healthy.  Some by products will not provide enough nutrients.  Most need to have a special mix of different byproducts to create the right nutritional balance.    All of this can be a great deal of work and extra expense.  It is not feasible or advisable for all cattle operations.    There are studies regarding distiller grains that suggest that ecoli infection increases with the use of this type of byproduct.    I raise beef cattle.  I would not risk my herd for it and the expense and extra labor would not be feasilble for my operation.    I'm not sure that convincing your neighbor is the best idea.  It may not be an option for his cattle farm and it could cause harm to his cattle.
AXwLhT5Uaa	CAT scans & MRI 's are used for imaging the blood vessels in the brain for bleeding. There are two kinds of strokes, one that results from a weakened blood vessel (bleeding into the area) and one as a result from a blood clot that traveled to that area of the brain and blocked/deprived that area of oxygen. These tests determine how the Dr will treat the stroke & the faster they can diagnose the sooner they can begin treatment and a better outcome for your grandmother. Hope this helped you out.

So , if they wanted to a MR Angio, and are sure about the cataracts, they could still do things the old fashioned way.

One of the reasons that you should not take more than the amount prescribed is the Acetaminophen, (Tylenol), part of the medication.  Taking too much Acetaminophen can Damage the Liver.<br>    For example:  If someone has the flu and takes Tylenol, thats ok at the prescribed amount on the label.  But if they also decided to take Theraflu,(which has Tylenol in it), they may then have taken too much Tylenol without even realizing it.   You have to read the labels.

Gmvldblraa	If a prism is transparent that means it isn't a reflector - equilateral prisms are not usually used as reflectors..<br>  <br>  "When light beams enter glass they slow down and if the  angle of incidence is something other than 0? , their path will bend. High frequency light ( blue) slows down more than low frequency light (red) and so the blue frequencies in a beam of white light will bend more than the red ones. This results in a fanning out of the beam with the colours ( frequencies) separating. When the spreading beam reaches the angled face on the opposite side  of the prism, the beam exits the prism with an even larger deviation. This separating of white light into its separate wavelengths is called dispersion and results in the formation of rainbows."<br>  <br>  There is so much more - prism  can be used as mirrors ( as in binoculars) but for that you have to describe total internal reflection and  show an  understanding of critical angle. <br>  <br>  Consider using diagrams in your explanation - they make the points you want to get across much more clearly than words alone.

AA10335036	A. Full or new. Then the moon and sun are in roughly the same or opposite angular locations in earth's sky, so their gravitational effects add. It may seem odd that the opposition configuration is also a maximum, but that's because each grav. field tends to "stretch" earth and its oceans in both directions. For instance, the moon alone creates a near bulge which you expect and also a far bulge because that's the part of earth that is least accelerated by the field, sort of "left behind".   See the ref. and for more information google "gravity gradient".

In fact, we know what it converges to:    1 / ( 1 - 2 / e^i  )    So your answer can be:    Im[ 1 / ( 1 - 2 / e^i  ) ]    or you could simplify it a bit. You can get it as trigonometric functions:    2 sin(1) / [ 5 - 4 cos(1) ]    or as a numerical approximation:    0.5928376206979425

WVPYem5Vaa	Nope, it is all designed to cause panic.    Nibiru is a myth. It is supposed to fulfil the 2012 doomsday "prophecy" by crashing into Earth. It is claimed that it is about 1 light year away, because it hasn't been spotted. At this distance, its speed has to be 1/5 the speed of light to reach us in time of the prophecy. The most that has been measured is about 1/12th, and this was matter spinning about a black hole, which can give a much higher angular momentum to matter than other things in the Universe. Also, at such a speed (1/5th light speed) any solid body with appreciable mass will tear itself apart.    Also, if there was even a remote chance of anything hitting Earth, chances are the major countries would have nukes ready for it. Only the asteroid Apophis was ever seen as a serious danger (reaching 4 on a 10-point scale, where 0 is no danger and 10 widespread devastation), and has been demoted to 0 after observations. I doubt we'll have to worry.    Other things that are said about 2012 are also nonsense. Galactic alignment is a crazy thought: a line can be drawn between Earth and the galactic centre at any point in time, and most of the time, something else will align with it.    The only thing that has been predicted by scientists is the opening of a hole in the magnetosphere in 2012, causing more intense bombardment by solar radiation. However, the discovery of this phenomenon is not yet widely accepted or observed again, therefore it may be completely wrong.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Nibiru is a load of manure.    The planet claimed to exist by the Nibirunuts is completely physically impossible.    Any planet which had an orbit that returned it to the inner solar system would have noticeable gravitational effects on all the orbits of all the planets.   The solar system is billions of years old.  Even a planet on a million-year elliptical orbit (and I think they claim it has an orbit of a few tens of thousands of years) would have made many thousands of trips through the solar system during its lifetime.      By now, it would have disrupted the entire system, and there's NO way that the rest of the planets could be in the nearly circular orbits they are in today.  Nibiru's gravity would have pulled them all to hell.    (Nibirunuts are retarded, when it comes to physics)    The photos are fakes, and very amateurish ones at that.

In his story, it does not return before the year 2085.      The name Nibiru comes from the name that the Babylonians and Sumerians gave to the planet we call Jupiter.  Zecharia, at the time, was working on old Sumerian documents.  That is where he got the idea.    Planet X was invented by charlatans who used it to explain their "prediction" of the end-of-the-world for... 2003.  They had a book for sale on how to survive the 2003 end-of-the-world.  They supposedly got their information through Nancy Lieder, who gets "messages" from aliens on a planet around the star Zeta Reticuli (in many languages, this word rhymes with ridicule).    When the world failed to end in 2003, they changed the date in their book to 2012 (a date that had already been made popular by another joker named Jos); they then added features from Nibiru and Nemesis to their Planet X.    When Zecharia heard about that, he published a rebuttal, confirming that Nibiru was unable to return before 2085 and it could be even later (he says as late as the year 3000).  Zecharia, you see, still believed his story.    But people ignored poor Zecharia.  "His" fictitious planet was hijacked by charlatans and forced to participate in the Big 2012 Hoax.    Since they are all non-existent (Planet X, Nibiru and Nemesis), all pictures, rumors and predictions about them are fake.    ---    I suspect that the charlatans are already working on the next version of the book.    Personally, I am waiting for the September 2020 end-of-the-world.      Sure, it will be just as fake as the other predictions, but I have already lots of material on it...    Should be fun.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	The current recycling of the fictional Planet X/Nibiru is for it to hit Earth in 2012. It is supposed to be a giant planet in the outer Solar System. Please note, in this old article, that Planet X was predicted to encounter Earth in 2003. In reality, Planet X does not exist. After 2012 is past and the hype dies down, I'm sure this tired old horse will be flogged back to life for a new doomsday prediction. After all, they do need to sell their books.    "Doomsayers seem to pop up every few years. Last time, it was the alignment of the planets that somehow managed not to destroy the Earth in May 2000. Now, we have Planet X. A few people are claiming that a heretofore unknown planet in our solar system is on a very long, elliptical orbit. In May 2003, it will pass close enough to the Earth to affect it in some way, causing it to flip over (what many call a "pole shift") and spur many other huge disasters. The end result will be the deaths of many billions of people. There are a large number of web pages, chat rooms and books about Planet X and its horrible effects on the Earth. So the question is, does this planet exist, and will it come by in May 2003 and cause all this horror? No, and no."    "Let me be very clear here: Nancy Lieder, Mark Hazlewood and the rest of these Planet X people (hereafter referred to as "PXPs") are completely wrong. No rogue giant planet is about to destroy the Earth, in May 2003 or otherwise.    Zechariah Sitchin bases his entire theory of the existence of a tenth planet on ancient texts, including Sumerian and biblical writings. However, he is known to misinterpret Sumerian, sometimes grossly. His key finding is based on a seal that shows a diagram that looks like the solar system, with the Sun at the center. It appears to have eleven planets around it. Since Sumerians counted the Sun and Moon as planets, Sitchin says the extra one must be some unknown planet. He also says it has aliens on it who communicated with the ancient Sumerians.    For Planet X to be here in less then a decade, it can't be farther than a billion or so kilometers away. Even at that distance, it would be one of the brightest objects in the sky. Remember, tiny Pluto is 5 billion kilometers out, and can be easily detected using modern equipment, and Pluto is way smaller than Planet X is supposed to be. There is simply no way a big planet so close to Earth could have escaped astronomers' detection (even amateur astronomers, who even Lieder and Hazlewood must realize have no reason to lie) all these decades."|`|OGw6Upv8aa	utter nonsense. the power of mass gullibility.
SvmZlLdaaa	Do you mean genetically, physically or behaviourally?    Cheetahs and lions are both members of the cat family, Felidae, but belong to different genera - Acinonyx and Panthera respectively. A lion is more closely related to other members of its genus, such as tigers, than it is to cheetahs, but cheetahs and lions are still more closely related to each other than to any animals from different families.    Physically, both share a basically 'feline' body-shape, but the cheetah has numerous adaptations that enable it to achieve its high speeds. Its head is small and rounded to help with stream-lining, its legs long and slim and its spine very flexible to extend its stride, its tail long and rather flattened to help it change direction rapidly, its claws only semi-retractile to help it grip the ground, its nostrils large to gulp in large amounts of air, and its lungs and heart large to extract oxygen from that air and pump it swiftly round the body. Lions are much more heavily-built and muscular, since they rely on stealth rather than speed to hunt and need greater strength to bring down much larger prey. Their jaws are large and powerful to help them kill that prey, and their claws are fully retractile, like all cats with the exception of cheetahs. Also, the male lion is the only cat to possess a mane - this makes him appear larger and more intimidating to other males and more attractive to females, and helps protect his throat and neck during fights.    Lions and male cheetahs are the only social cats. Lions live in groups called prides, which consist of related females and between one and eight males, who may or may not be related to each other (but are not related to the females). They hunt co-operatively and help raise each other's young - a lactating lioness will suckle any cubs in the pride, whether they are hers or not. Whilst female cheetahs are solitary, brothers from the same litter will stay together for life. These coalitions mean they are able to hunt larger animals than a lone cheetah can, and also help in holding territory. Cheetahs are shy, cautious animals - because they are so lightly-built, they lack the strength to take on other predators, and often lose their kills to stronger animals like lions, hyenas or leopards. They cannot afford to get injured, since they rely on speed to hunt, and will back down rather than fight. Lions are much more confident, being top predators and much stronger. About the only things a lion is afraid of are elephants and other lions.|`|HyUE9ON0aa	They are both mammals and from the Felidae family (Feline/Cat family)    They are both Predators/Carnivores    Other than that not much similarity because Lions live in groups and Cheetahs are loners.    @@@@@    Felidae is the biological family of the cats; a member of this family is called a felid. Felids are the most strictly carnivorous of the sixteen mammal families in the order Carnivora. The most familiar felid is the Domestic Cat, which first became associated with humans about 10,000 years ago, but the family includes all other wild cats including the big cats.    Extant felids belong to one of two subfamilies: Pantherinae (which includes the Lion, the Tiger, the Jaguar, and the Leopard), and Felinae (which includes the Cougar, the Cheetah, lynxes and the Caracal, along with the Domestic Cat).    The first felids emerged during the Oligocene, about 25 million years ago. In prehistoric times, there was a third subfamily known as Machairodontinae, which included the "saber-toothed cats" such as the well known Smilodon. There were also other cat-like mammals, such as Thylacosmilus or the Nimravidae which are not included in Felidae despite superficial similarities.|`|k4T1Jgblaa	Not very similar at all actually.    Both species are in the cat family (Felidae), but Cheetahs are not very closely related to any of the other species of cat.    Because Cheetahs rely on speed to capture their prey, they do not have retractile claws (as other cats have).  Instead they have paws similar to the dogs.    Lions, on the other hand are fairly typical cats, with retractile claws and rely on getting as close to their prey as possible, followed by a short burst of speed.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	umm lets see 4legs 2 eyes 1 tail 1 mouth both cats 2 ears both mammals ohh yahh teeth and claws|`|sTKJkvFsaa	Cheetah: cat family, fast, small, spotted  Lion: fluffy mane, big head, big paws, gold, king of the jungle    so, um. not very similar.|`|kwl0MW6Taa	In evolutionary terms, all felid species share a common ancestor that lived about 10.8 million years ago.

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	For the following, please refer to this link :<br>  <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~jarmel/math4c/Unit_Circle_Angles.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~jarmel/math4c/...</a><br>  <br>  A slope of 1 or -1 means that rise divided by run equals 1; therefore, rise = run.<br>  <br>  On the unit circle, a line of slope -1, runs (compass-wise) from the exact north-west<br>  point, through the origin, to the exact south-east point. Or in other words, from the<br>  centre of the arc of quadrant 2, through to the centre of the arc of quadrant 4.<br>  <br>  Starting at the X-axis (between quadrants 1 and 4) and moving counter-clockwise,<br>  we find the line has rotated through A = 90o + 45o = 135o.<br>  Call the line OP, where O is the origin and P is on the circle in quadrant 2.<br>  <br>  Now draw a line from P, vertically down to the X-axis, meeting it at N.<br>  Triangle OPN is thus right-angled and has angle NOP = 45o.<br>  The other angle, ONP, must therefore be 45o, and so the legs are equal..<br>  <br>  The definition of sin(A) is : the projection of OP on the Y-axis divided by OP,<br>  that is, NP/OP, or opposite/hypotenuse.<br>  The projection of OP for 135o is the same as for 45o, so sin(135o) = sin(45o).<br>  <br>  The definitions for cos(A) and tan(A) are also the same for both angles, so we<br>  need only concentrate on triangle OPN, but we have to remember that the angle<br>  we are interested in is 135o in quadrant 2, not 45o in quadrant 1, so we must take<br>  into account any associated positive or negative signs.<br>  <br>  If we let NP = 1, then NO = -1, and by Pythagoras, OP^2 = 1^2 + (-1)^2, so OP = √2.<br>  <br>  sin(135o) = NP/OP = 1/√2 = √2/2<br>  cos(135o) = NO/OP = -1/√2 = -√2/2<br>  tan(135o) = NP/NO = 1/-1 = -1<br>  <br>  Continuing around the circle, we have to go another 180o to reach the point in<br>  quadrant 4. So the angle we are seeking is 135o + 180o = 315o.<br>  <br>  Now we have NP = -1, NO = 1 and OP = √2.<br>  <br>  sin(315o) = NP/OP = -1/√2 = - √2/2<br>  cos(315o) = NO/OP = 1/√2 = √2/2<br>  tan(315o) = NP/OP = -1/1 = -1|`|B8IPlF8Baa	A is 135 degrees or 315 degrees.  That's because they've told you that it's the line x= -y. You should know what sin, cos, and tan of those two angles are.<br>  <br>  Up to +/-, another way of looking at it is that you must have an isococles right triangle, so tan = 1 and sin = cos = sqrt(2)/2. But it's hard to be concise about which is + and which is - if you take that approach.

Xf7w6dY4aa	Chemistry is just one of those subjects that can seriously make a person go insane. I have to admit that in high school, chem just did not make any sense whatsoever. Yet, when I came to college it seemed like evrything just clicked. Do not feel discouraged if you are not getting chem, because I bet in a year or two, things will start to fall into place. You also have to remember that out of all the sciences, Chem and Physics are the most analytical in the sense that it is crucial that you understand the material and all of its aspects. Biology is pretty easy since it basically borderlines on memorization. Again its ok, that you dont get chem now in high school. In a couple more years you will prolly be a wiz at Chem and forget your struggles now. Good Luck in High School and your Future =)|`|gOKkFxnqaa	The concepts in chemistry are rather simple.

lJhQG4lPaa	It's well known that onion is one of the highly potential healthy flavoring food, since it gives us few phytochemicals, nutrients, etc. for eg; one of the major constituent is Quercetin, which is an anti-inflamatory as well as antioxidant.<br>  <br>  But, why it irritates our eyes while slicing them? here comes the reason<br>  <br>  When we slice the onion, cells get break down which releases the enzyme called "Alliinase" (look at the picture) and it converts the more abundant sulphoxide of onion (a aminoacid called "1-propenyl L-cysteine sulphoxide") into sulphenic acid (1-propenylsuphenicacid), which is unstable (never isolated) and it ultimately rearranges to the more volatile Propanthial s-oxide. Since this s-oxide is more volatile it can easily spread over the air and it reaches our eyes, where it reacts with water and converted into diluted sulphuricacid, this acid stains our never system and triggers the tear glands to produce tear for the purpose of diluting this sulphuric acid.<br>  <br>  Some tips to reduce your tear while chopping onions,<br>  <br>  1. Usually root of the onion releases maximum amount of sulfuric compounds, so it's better to cut the stem (top) of onion and peel downwards to the root, chop it without cutting off the root until the last.<br>  <br>  2. Cooling in refrigerator (enzyme will be less active) or washing the peeled onion in water or slicing under water flow also suppress the s-oxide to reach our eyes.<br>  <br>  3. Chopping near to the flame (for eg; near to gar burner) also helps.<br>  <br>  4. Use sharp knife for slicing, which could reduces the amount broken cells.<br>  <br>  Reference:<br>  1.

Though I am sure the stimulation it is referring to is electrical, this is not the load they are looking for. I am no neurologist, but I can tell the load they are talking about is the reaction to this stimulus. If it is physical motion, the load may be measured in degrees of motion, or total force. If they are looking for a reaction in a nerve or other part of the brain, it may be an electrical output. This example leads me to believe it will have a physical reaction though.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Eukaryotic cells, in general, are more sophisticated at the following types of transport:<br>  <br>  (1) Protein targeting. Protein targeting or protein sorting is the mechanism by which a cell transports proteins to the appropriate positions in the cell or extracellularly. Sorting targets can be the inner space of an organelle, any of several interior membranes, the cell's outer membrane, or its exterior via secretion or exocytosis. This delivery process is carried out based on information contained in the protein itself. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors can lead to diseases.<br>  <br>  (2) Ion channels. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of all living cells by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient. They are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells.<br>  <br>  (3) Translocons. The translocon (commonly known as a translocator or translocation channel) is the complex of proteins associated with the translocation of nascent polypeptides across membranes. In eukaryotes the polypeptides are transported into the interior (cisternal or luminal) space of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the cytosol. This process requires the protein to cross a hydrophobic lipid bilayer. In prokaryotes, a similar protein complex transports polypeptides across the plasma membrane. Bacterial pathogens can assemble translocons in their host membranes, allowing them to export virulence factors into their target cells.<br>  <br>  SecY protein is main transmembrane subunit of eubacterial protein secretory pathway and protein-secreting ATPase complex, also known as translocon. Secretion across the inner membrane in Gram-negative bacteria occurs via the preprotein translocase pathway. Proteins are produced in the cytoplasm as precursors, and require a chaperone subunit to direct them to the translocase component. From there, the mature proteins are either targeted to the outer membrane, or remain as periplasmic proteins. The translocase protein subunits are encoded on the bacterial chromosome.<br>  <br>  (4) In eukaryotic cells, the electron transport system is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. In prokaryotic cells, the electron transport system is located in the cytoplasmic membrane.
