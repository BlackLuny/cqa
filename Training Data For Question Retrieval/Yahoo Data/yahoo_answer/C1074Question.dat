20090130203630AAe7oVt	Sports;Wrestling	WWE vet. quiz vol 2.?	Well I did the first one a long time ago,and Im hoping this one is a bit harder.Ok Like last time Im going to use my knowledge from the attitude era,but use the older guys as well.Also I'll have trick questions.I'll also have questions that are more about the wrestlers than actual wrestling,so keep on your toes.Too keep things more mainstream I'll mostly stick to WWE to give better chances to you guys.      1.Evan bourne is a good wrestler and face,but not always,what ring name did he go under most recently,before using evan bourne.      2.Some WWE divas are actually very good wrestlers,unfortunatley they tend to be used for "jobbing"later in their career against rising newbies.Which of these divas have been able to avoid that curse.(It must be against someone who they've lost to occasinally"more that twice in one story line"bonus points if you can name who)      Victoria    Melina    Trish Stratus      or           Mickie James      3.In WWE things tend to get reused.From storylines to gimmicks,but the main thing(in my opinion) are signiture moves.Which of these wrestlers were the "First" to use their moves as finishers in "WWE"      JBL-Clothesline from hell(Running Lariat),Randy Orton-RKO(Cutter),Rhyno-Gore(Running spear)      4.Which of these wrestlers(acording to their billed height) is the tallest?Shortest? John Cena,Chris Jericho,HHH,or Edge.      5.Mick Foley has many personas.Which one did he use when he first entered wrestling in general?Which one was the last one he "officialy" used in WWE(Mick Foley wrestling as himself doesn't count)When did both of those take place.      6.Which(if any) of these wrestlers "did" win the world championship(WWE or World heavyweight title only,ECW title doesnt count).  Bobby Lashley,Jimmy Snuka,Kane,Bob Orton jr, or Scott Steiner         7.Who said this:" What'cha gonna do when the, wait that's not it,that's not it,oh this is it,WHOOOOOOOO ya gotta beat, wait that's not it, oh this is it, OOOHHH YEAH,god dammit that's not it either.......

20090130103406AAbIytM	Sports;Tennis	Why does Rafael Nadal always have to play after Roger Federer in Grand Slams?	I initially thought it was because Federer was #1. But now, even though Nadal is the top seed at the Australian Open, Federer gets to start his matches earlier. If there are any interruptions, then Nadal will end up playing consecutive days, while Federer gets lots of rest. Remember how badly Nadal was affected during WImbledon 2007?       I also think they should have both played their semifinals on the same day. Federer is a great player. He doesn't need this kind of help from the organizers to win.

I haven't seen the All-Star list yet, so I can't comment on who's in it. But it's definitely disrespectful that we continue to do work every year with nothing to show for it.

I believe they should since many players like Alex Rodriguez could either play for the USA or for the Dominican Republic,it's about building the strongest team possible and if Mexico were smart they would include Mexican-Americans like Carlos Quentin (.288 avg.,36 hrs and 100 RBIs),Andre Ethier (.305 avg,20 hrs and 77 RBIs) Evan Longoria (AL Rookie of the Year),Adrian Gonzalez,Michael Young,Eric Chavez,Nomar Garciaparra,Jorge Cantu,Matt Garza,Dan Haren,Joel Zumaya along with players from the Mexican baseball league.That team can compete for the World Classic title in my opinion.You probably can tell I'm Mexican-American and I'd like to see a strong Mexican team.Can't wait till the World Classic starts!

My parents are pretty cheap so I doubt they will get me a board over $250. I picked up snowboarding pretty quickly and will be going a lot more now (mainly freeriding).      1. Are Morrow boards unreliable/low-quality? I was looking at the House Boardshop and saw that all of the Morrow boards were less than $200.      2. Since my boots are size 11, would it be too risky to get a board that has a width of 25.00 cm.? I know that size 11 is categorized as wide/mid-wide, but I used the FrostyRider snowboard sizing guide and many of the snowboards that were recommended for a size 11 were only about 25.00 cm. wide or 25.2 cm.      3. At 5'6" and about 145 lbs., would a 155 board be appropriate? I am specifically looking at the Morrow Lithium 155 board.      Thanks.

20090130192031AAXGHcp	Sports;Baseball	Should the Mets sign Manny if it means they can't sign Oliver Perez, Ben Sheets or Randy Wolf?	At the beginning of last season, it was 137.4 million. At the end, through incentives and transactions, it was 143 million. The Mets payroll is right around 127 million right now, including an expected salary for Feliciano. It's fair to say the Mets probably would spend at least 143 million, like last season. That leaves the Mets with at least 16 million, but it's possible that can go up to around 23 million. They've publicly always said they don't intend to go over the luxury tax, which is at 160 million. Signing Perez at 10-11 per year plus Manny at 22-23 million per year would push them into paying the luxury tax. Signing Sheets or Wolf plus Manny would make it tight. Another option could be to trade Delgado for prospects freeing up some salary, and move the Murphy/Tatis platoon to 1B.    I hear people screaming Manny without thinking though. People think it's Manny's personality that's been a turn off, but I think it's the market. If they expressed public interest though, it could gauge his market value. Honestly, right now if they were to go into the season with their current rotation, I wouldn't be happy. Santana, Pelfrey and Maine would be as good as you'll find. But 2 out of 5 days a week is a question market. You can have one day be, whether that's with Redding, Garcia or Niese, similar to how the Phillies will do with Kendrick, Happ, Carrasco or Park. Obviously, the Mets intend to sign a SP, but I don't know if it's possible while paying Manny 20 million+ a year.    Just to get a feel out there though from Mets and other baseball fans, is it worth signing Manny to a 2 or 3 year deal if it meant they can't sign Perez, Sheets or Wolf? I won't include Pedro, because he's no better than what the Mets have at the back end anyway. It'd mean the 4 and 5 starters would be filled out by Garcia, Redding, Niese and Parnell. Honestly, I don't know if I could be comfortable with that, even if Manny's awesome. A combination of Perez and what's left over (ex. Abreu or Dunn) is probably more worth it than Manny and no pitchers.  Of course if they really wanted Manny and pitching, they could search the trade market and try to make something happen there. Maybe Andy Sonnastine? Both markets look pretty dry though.

20090130185747AAzDAqG	Sports;Tennis	Is Serena Williams the best "comeback" player of all time?	Seriously, I honestly can't think of a player who has come back from match point down or when her opponent was serving for the match, only to break back and run off several games in a row to steal the victory.       2009 Australian Open Quarterfinals- Kusnetsova is up a set and a break in the second: Serving for the match, Serena breaks back to even, the pulls ahead and dominates the third set to win.      2009 Sydney International QF: Wozniacki has 3 match points against Serena serving at 6-5 in the third set. Williams breaks back then dominates the tiebreak winning in 3 sets.       2009 Sydney International 1st Round: After winning the second set tiebreak to force a third, Stosur serving at 5-4 has 4 match points and is then broken by Serena. Serena wins 3 consecutive games to win the match.       2008 US Open Quarterfinals- Venus serving for the first set up 5-3 fails to convert 2 set points. Serena levels the match and wins the tiebreaker. Set 2 Venus again up 5-3 fails to convert 7 set points. Serena comes back and wins the tiebreak and the match! Serena then goes on to win the tournament!      2007 Sony Ericcson Championships Final- Henin dominates the first set 6-0, then serves for the match at 5-4 in the second. Henin holds two match points before Serena breaks back and dominates the third set to win the tournament!      2007 Australian Open 3rd rd: Serena wins the second set after dropping the first to Shahar Peer. Peer is two points from winning the match when Serena comes back and wins the match 8-6 in the third. Serena goes on to win the tournament!      2005 Australian Open semifinal: Serena loses the first set 2-6 to Sharapova before leveling the match at 7-5 in the second. Sharapova serves for the match and Serena saves 3 match points before coming back to win 8-6 in the third. In the next match, she looses the first set to Lindsay Davenport before coming back to win the match 6-0 in the third to win the tournament!      2003 Australian Open semifinals: Serena is down 5-1 in the third against Clijsters who is serving for the match. Serena saves 2 match points and wins the match 7-5 in the third. She then goes on to win the title!

This question excludes Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and even Tim Duncan and Chris Paul and I can also say Deron Williams    It seems as if great players ability to make teammates better has become a lost art even among the elite players in the NBA...this is what the NBA loved about players like Magic, Jordan and Bird...for example we never really heard of John Paxson before he was in Chicago, you then pair him with Michael Jordan and he's extremely effective as he was able constantly to knock down open shots and even though he was a defensive liability, playing alongside Jordan and Pippen improved his defense greatly.....you can make further cases for Magic and Bird.....but now when I watch the great players like Kobe, Iverson, T-Mac, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo, ....players aren't improved playing along side these great players.....In the Lakers case players are improved playing in Phil Jackson/Tex Winters Triangle offense and look good with the many parts and versatility they have....moreso than playing alongside Kobe Bryant...Is the ability to improve your teammates a lost art for some Superstars of the NBA?

20090130194437AAvVye4	Sports;Tennis	Isnt Rafael Nadal an annoying bugger?	Dont get be wrong. I dont hate him. But the way he chases down everything & brings it back into play is both unreal & annoying at the same time. He doesnt have that flair you know....Relies too heavily on brute power & topspin.      I mean Verdasco hit 95 winners yesterday but still lost. It seems kinda unfair. But Nadal plays on your patience and forces you to make those unforced errors. But I will give Nadal his due....he has got some really fast wheels to chase down everything.      Lastly, the pick on the pants everytime he gets ready is irritating too.      I repeat, I have nothing against Nadal. He is a great player but its just my observation.

Is there any way that I can know if this board is going to be the right size for me, and if it's gonna fit my shoe size?
