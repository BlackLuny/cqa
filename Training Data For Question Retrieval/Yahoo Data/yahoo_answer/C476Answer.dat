TrbzmQAhaa	It is a weird question, but not an inappropriate one, since blood meal is a product commonly available on the horticultural market.     In addition to the  caveats of the previous answerer, I would lik eto add that not only fresh blood but blood meal itself is highly exciting to all carnivores. When I had my farm, it was not possible to use blood meal in the outdoor gardens because the bears would travel for miles to rip my vegetable garden to shreds. Also, coyotes, possoms, coons, weasels, and others will add their excavation skills.     In the home, cats, dogs and other household pets will tear up your houseplants to get at the fascinating scent, which, as the previous answerer stated, is not going to be so fascinating to you after it sits for a bit and begins to rot.     This course of action is not at all advisable.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	I do some flower gardening, but not being a Horticulture expert, this will be a layman's answer.    I am aware of using a fertilizer called "Blood meal," which is a dry granulated product made from blood combined with other ingredients.    I do NOT recommend using pure blood for several reasons:    1.  It will stink during the rotting process.  2.  It needs to be composted first because raw blood will probably be too "hot" for your plants, and probably cause damage to them.  3.  The raw blood will draw all kinds of bad actor insects like flies,gnats, etc.  4.  And possibly most important, raw blood could contain many different organisms which could be medically unsafe for you and your family.
vj2pOgT7aa	Here is what I used to do:    1.  Clothes.  2 piles clean & dirty. Put the clean away, dirty in laundry.  2.  Papers.  Pile them in one pile. Glance at them as you pile and throw away any that are definitely trash.   3.  Art supplies.  Pick them all up and put them in one contained or place. (To be sorted later)    Anyway.. you are probably already done, but I am answering anyway.    Since it is now "tomorrow"  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!    =0)|`|baR28Sq4aa	hire a maid....    start with one item,such as art supplies,then clothes(throw them in the wash while youre cleaning another area)..before you know it,its all done...

Start off by making small piles... compartmentalize the things that have to be organized...and don't be afraid to toss out crap you don't need. ( Even better, donate to charity ). I find using the start in a small section approach to be best.      B. Toss in a hand grenade & collect the insurance money...|`|g2QUNwZzaa	clean up the biggest stuff first, like the clothes...when you get rid of those, the room will look cleaner, and you might be motivated to finish the job|`|0TtLt667aa	I'm not so good at suggestions for this sort of thing.   However, I've seen your art and I would be willing to take this from you to get it out of the way. No doubt, it would even be worth it to stick around and help with the rest of the cleaning.    HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	Separate all the items into piles. You will need a vacuum,garbage bags,windex,furniture polish, and definitely alot of storage containers from Walmart, and mostly alot of time!! You will also have to tidy things everyday(it sounds much)to keep things looking clean afterwards.|`|P1VoMS36aa	pay someone, then next time don't make such a mess.  at least your room don't sound dirty!|`|S9B8Fr4daa	When you find out...Could you let me know?  My beast has been waiting for just as long and is in DIRE need of attention.|`|1gf0BwcXaa	If you like art, then you MUST have a desk. So, if your desk is messy, stack books nicely on top of each other. And for the art supplies, stack them (one again, nicely) in your closet. Fix your bed, and "Wow! Your room is great, (whatever your name is)!"|`|i2SiEsU0aa	Start with the hard stuff like your clothes and papers. Get them all out of the way.  Then just get to work|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	I tend to start with the items that I feel are getting most damaged by being in the mess, like the clothes, books/homework, computer equipment.  That sort of thing.  Then I clear away as much trash as I can and put it in a big trash bag.  Then I clear the bed (usually by making it) so I have a decent size area to organize things that need to be organized, and I start putting those there.  Then I do the surfaces, like my dresser, desk.  Finish the organizing and clean up any residual garbage.  Then dust, then vacuum, and do the corners, baseboards, cobwebs and under and behind the furniture.  And you're done!    While all this is going on, I like to play motivating music; the type of music that makes you psyched about getting going and being productive.  It may become your "cleaning music" in the future.  For me it's the soundtrack from the movie 1776. :-)  I know that a lot of people work well to techno-dance music, though.    Keep thinking about how you deserve a clean and organized room.  It's a gift you're giving to yourself.    Good luck!  Get going!|`|FjekAwGmaa	Unless you are in some kind of rush, do it at your own pace. A little bit every day or every other day.

IF you just keep doing what you're DOing--you'll just keep GETTING  what you're Getting:  NOTHING|`|COCVO3gcaa	pile everything on the floor onto your bed. Then vacuum the floor.     Now, put everything on the surfaces (bed stand, dresser, etc.) on the floor by the furniture it goes on.     Now dust those surfaces and put back WHAT YOU NEED! anything that doesn't belong there put on your bed.     Throw away all the trash you find.     Now go to your bed, pick up an item and put it away... and repeat.     Try getting a few bins for our art stuff. Put drawing stuff in one, painting in another and random in another. make sure it's all neat and easy to get to. If possible, store these under your bed. If not, find another place for them.

djmu98oUaa	The Whirlpool washer coupler takes the place of the belt that is used on the older style washers. If your washer does not agitate or spin, there is a good chance the coupler is broke. The best way to change the coupler is to remove the cabinet. This is easier then it sounds. The first thing you need to do (after disconnecting the power) is to loosen the control panel, in my opinion visit the website it will help because in this website I search the industrial water treatment plants so if you were interested visit the website which is given below.|`|p8wEnCZDaa	It can be done but you didn't give enough information for us to tell you haw to do it.

The bad things are inherent to the plant itself.  Getting from a tobacco plant to a smokable product is a lot of work.
ElBaODCCaa	Most trim is painted in oil based enamel. If you did not use an oil based enamel this could explain why it is chipping. I would suggest that you lightly sand any badly chipped areas, then paint the trim with an oil based primer ( they make low odor primers). When dry paint with an oil based enamel of you color choice. Make sure you use a brush that is meant for enamel. I believe Majestic paints make low odor paints and possibly primers as well.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Sounds like the old paint was oil based and you just painted over it with latex (water base). You should've first painted it with an oil based primer, like Kilz, then latex paint. Go to you paint store and ask them for help they will know what to use to correct this problem.|`|AA10948768	Find someone in your area (do some research and find the best deal) who you could pay to strip it one weekend and you and the kids could go away for the weekend or stay with relatives while it is being done.  That would be way less of a headache for you.  Then paint it yourself.|`|6d7mzfUoaa	get your kids to stay someplace else until its done??|`|Yqrr8q2Faa	it is chipping and peeling because you didnt prepare your work well enough before overpainting. for best result...90%preparation,10% perspiration.if the wood is in good condition,sand down all loose flakey stuff with a course grade abrasive paper working down in grade till you get the finish smooth,lump and nib free. if the wood has rotten patches chisel back to good wood and if a large infill is needed use a piece of wood cut to fit, i always use car filler to fill wood frames the results are good, it dries quickly, sand with a block.  You may very well have lead based paint in an old house.. sanding it poses a risk.there are products on the market to identify and assist..you can research this yourself.   Use good quality primer and undercoats sanding all nibs between coats until ready to apply top coat.... i recommend LIQUID gloss not that modern non drip gel stuff. thin it in a cheap plastic kettle 90% paint/10% thinners or white spirits(you will find it flows better ). sand between coats for great finish. Sounds like a lot of work? it is but its your house also in the future all you will need is a light rub down to key and paint straight on top. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PREPARATION.
vBcN2WM9aa	try some intr. decoration bks. U can remodel it by, 1st changing the wall color. U can hve the same color, or the different colors on all 4 walls. I would prefer opp sides of the walls same...a good combination would be..ummm...purple/yellow, magenta/banana yellow, lime green/bright red, baby pink/baby blue....then u could rearrange ur furniture, buy a new study chair etc...  also u'd be surprised @ how even garden objects make ur room look good. If u could get some old solidly colored plate, and put, 10-20, colored sea glass in it, it would look wonderful...also, streching an ordinary washng line across ur shelf, and 'hanging' pics  or u/ur friends/family etc would give it the hang-up-washed-clothes look...    U could get a new mirror, a a new bedcover, a new carpet, even second hand ones will do, u can just dry clean them if they're dirty, thats really cheap. Also, I was reading an intr. decoration article, where this guy had a 2 coloe bedroom (i mean, a bedroom with only 2 color combinations in it), and instead of a wardrobe door, he had just strecthed a mini-curtain, which acted as a door. Try patchwork quilts...    U can also hand curtains higher than the windows to make the windows look taller. and if u hve a sofa in ur room, make new cushion covers, withthe opp sides of different patterns, so u can turn them over n e time for an entirely 'new' look    U can panel ur room, with a woody touch, and put a fuzzy kind of carpet on the center...  U can paint ur furniture in 2 or three color combinations, which would be the same for all other things      hope it helped...:D      PS: I really liked =)' s answer, I would give her a thumbs up, but I cant vote right now, I'm on level one...siniff...sniff|`|kj507W26aa	Look at magazines or websites or visit some nice furniture stores and take a look at their displays.

v3xEtuLLaa	This is definitely not a DIY project.  There are a lot of issues to consider, such as attached walls, windows, the roof, a second floor if you have one, and just the structural integrity of the house.  Your best and safest bet is to call a foundation contractor.  This is what they do, so they will take care of all of the details and fix this situation without causing other damage.  Hope this helps.|`|WgruZkHRaa	You should jack the garage too. But if you just do the kitchen, do one turn a day on screw jacks, or one pump if hydraulic. Inspect house daily for distortions. Walls will crack but that's normal, you are looking for bowing in walls, and roof. Your house is fairly flexible. I am jacking up my house too. I'm up 6" in spots. The worst needs a foot, I haven't even started jacking that part. I also need to build up stone foundation underneath jacked areas. The worst part is my windows were installed after the house sagged. A few windows are now trapezoid shaped. Replacement windows are flexible too, they still work even though grossly distorted from jacking.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Jacking up the floors should cause no structural damage to the rest of the home. Jack a little at a time over a period of several days.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	If you are going to invest in a nice kitchen and there is something that affects the quality of that job then don't hesitate to do what is necessary. Get a Water Level and map out the elevations of the entire house and garage. Investigate a little into,why the house is sagging.Determine if the garage was built before or after the sag. Determine if you have adiquit footings,etc. Then jack-up as necessary,house,garage walls whatever. Then do the kitchen and you will have peace Grasshopper. Best wishes....Edit...woodtick is right, jacking a house is serious business not to be taken lightly. Any safety not heeded can result in injury,death, and compromised structure (not to mention liability and voided insurance coverage). When I helped my friend move a structure he rented Beams,blocking,jacks,air compresser,jack-hammer,and the Movers Dad (retired but available).Dad knew the Business and "lined us out" step-by-step,thus we did a good job.
13qQYRX0aa	first of all the pump that you will put in the pond has an outlet to feed a waterfall.you take a plastic tube and the other end goes to the top of the waterfall.It will be possible to to feed two waterfalls by putting a y piece in the tube and feeding two waterfalls.  You will have to get expert help from your local water pond stockist as the correct pump will have to be purchased.  The height the water has to be pumped has to be considered also you will have two waterfalls. The sales person will be able to recommend the correct pump|`|dXrHoLMCaa	you can get a pipe fitting called a 'splitter' that will go on the outlet of the pump.... one side will feed water to the waterfall, the other side's tubing will feed your fountain... now, that means your pump will need to be strong enuff to power BOTH.... if it isn't the water in the waterfall won't be as 'lively'.... and the fountain won't go as high as you'd like it to.... so..... either ONE new pump that's stronger or two pumps, one for each, and where you plug in the one, you just add a connector that will let you plug in more than one thing to the outlet.... I do hope your outlet is a GFCI so you're protected from shock when around the water and the pump!!|`|Vv465eJMaa	You get a waterproof junction box from B&Q with connectors.Then cut the wire of one pump and attach wires from both pumps into one end of connectors,the other end that runs to the plug attach to other end of the connector,and it will work for both (connectors are available in the same aisle as junction box)  Or run both wires into one plug and that will operate both pumps|`|hxycleHraa	yes but depending on the size of your pond and the power of your pump ask your local aquatic centre for advice double or even triple circuit breakers can be lead from a junction box  to power another pump if one is required i have a double waterfall leading into my pond as well as a spitting fish running into my pond at the same time with lighting if your not to sure consult an electrician

Blue rug, or do Lime Green with Pink, or Lt. Blue with Pastel colors.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	You can add color to your room with accessories like your bedding, curtains, throw pillows.  Other ideas include framing whole sheets of poster board with black poster frames and hanging them on the walls in a line or a group, whatever you like.  Poster board comes in a lot of colors, you could have all the same color or a mix.  It's up to you!      Layer your window coverings; don't just do a simple curtain.  Put up sheers over the entire window, then curtains and a valance, either straight or swag.  You're looking for volume to draw the eye.      If you collect something, display them together, not one here and one there.  A group of similar items makes a bigger statement.  Same with photos of family & friends, instead of scattering them around the room, make a couple of displays or groupings.    Have fun and keep tinkering with it!  You'll get what you like!|`|KiGQV0MSaa	why dont you just paint one or two walls (preffereably opposites) a different colour? x|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Seeing that your walls are white and your carpet is light blue why don't you hang some light blue curtains and also get a light blue comforter for your bed.  Also purchase maybe a couple of "dark blue" throw pillows to put on your bed.  You can also purchase maybe a dark blue throw rug too. This way everything will tie together.  If you buy posters try to stay with your color pallet which is White/Light blue/Dark blue.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Wall decals can add lots of color and design without painting.

But don't spray the trees until next spring,, And then only once. <br>  Any good acid fertilizer in a spray bottle can be used.<br>  <br>  Hopes this helps good luck.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to spikes so you know what to look for .<br>  <a href="http://www.easygardener.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_ID=111" rel="nofollow">http://www.easygardener.com/index.cfm?fu...</a>|`|iZ4JugiAaa	The picture is an arborvitae.  It's quite pale and yellowish compared to any I've seen, yours are (or were) better specimens than this one.  <br>  <br>  I'd recommend that you call your County Extension Office and ask them about your problem.  They have the knowledge about your local area, if there are any particular problems with arborvitae they can tell you how to deal with them.  |`|qy88kFplaa	The picture you showed is a golden thread branch cypress. It sounds like you are describing an arborvitae. Arborvitaes like a lot of sun (some shade, but not too much, is ok) and well-drained soil. I've seen arborvitaes die because of lack of water (esp. if newly planted), too much water, being planted too deeply (a common mistake...most plants should be planted a tad shallow, not deep), and then there are a variety of insects that can infect an arborvitae, most notable spider mites and bag worms. If I were guessing, I'd say it is probably one of the first three I mentioned. Unfortunately, with conifers, like arborvitae, once they begin to brown out, it is usually tough to bring them back around. I hope this helps.|`|th1vDfEaaa	I know this might sound funny but it's happened to us before so my question is are these in an area where an animal such as a dog or cat could be using them as their private restroom?  If that is the case the solution is to remove the critter from the equation and clean out the surrounding soil, give it a good hose down, and replacing the soil you took out with something with a bit of nutrient feed.<br>  <br>  If there are no animals involved I'd check with you local nursery and ask them.

I form them into what I call “Duster Bunnies” or “Boo Boo Bunnies” and give them as gifts.  They work well in every cleaning situation.  They grab onto dirt and soil and hold on.  Spay glass with cleaning solution such as 2 drops of “Basic H” in 16 oz of water.  Drying with micro fiber cloth leaves a streak free shine.  Spray them with the Basic H solution until they are cool but not wet.  Dust with them and they will attract 420 times their damp weight in dust.   The dusted area will stay dust free longer than expected.  These cloths are even great as scrubbers. They work as well as magic erasers.  For the most cost effective micro fiber clothes look in the automotive section. |`|3G11U1qhaa	Baking Soda - it's not just for baking!<br>  <br>  I use this for cleaning greasy areas in the kitchen and grill.

AA10286336	NEVER leave a candle unattended!! But if the tealight has a metal base, it should go out on its own. I have never trusted mine though. I usually blow them out once they are almost done and replace it with another. They do make tealights with plastic bases instead of metal and I know those have a reputation of going out on their own. (Yankee Candle Company sells tealights with plastic bases) I just usually stick with the cheapie metal ones I can get at Walmart. Anyway, I hope this answers your question.

XxbVH7HDaa	A nice cool color, like soft blue, light sage green, pale aqua is a great color to make a small room look larger.  Whatever color you do, I always paint the ceiling the same color as the wall in the bathrooms I paint.  People think this will make the room look smaller, but it actually has the opposite effect because it blurs the lines of ceiling and walls and your eye won't stop at the top of the wall but continue on.  For one of my personal bathrooms, I have a pale aqua color with pale ivory spa rugs and towels which makes the room seem like a high end spa.  |`|mIYNLMKtaa	In the bathroom I would use white tiles for a clean, fresh feel, maybe with some feature tiles with blue swirls to bring it to life a bit. If you're just painting it, how about at warm pale blue or sea green.

iZ4JugiAaa	If you're going to be using it as general lighting, fluorescent tubes will be cheaper.  Tubes are rated at 10w per foot, but they last practically forever.  We have't had particularly good results with the new CFL bulbs, they don't seem to last long no matter what brand we've tried.  |`|ispQWeQmaa	The efficiency of compact fluorescent bulbs and 4-foot fluorescent tubes is not that far apart. According to a Wikipedia article on luminous efficacy cited below, a 5 to 24 watt CFL has a luminous efficiency around 45-60%, while a 4-foot fluorescent tube with magnetic ballast has a luminous efficiency between 60 and 100% depending on the tube type (T12, T5, T8 in order of lowest to highest minimum efficiency rating).<br>  <br>  I don't think you could cost-justify the conversion based on this level of savings, unless you use the space many hours each day or your electricity rate per kilowatt hour is very high. You would probably be better to wait until ultra-efficient LED lights become more affordable. Even now you can buy ones for around $20 that can replace CFL bulbs and provide directed, task-specific lighting for 2-3 watts per bulb.<br>  <br>  I've included a link to an LED house lights article on my little energy efficiency website - enjoy!

AA11706426	Please keep well away from thee infected area, whether the plant is dead or not. Nobody knows for how long after the plant has been dealt with, it will continue to be effective. As far as your Hosta and other roots and bulbs are concerned, no, the ivy will not have affected them whatsoever. The poison is contained in the plant itself and is only used as a defensive mechanism, much like the Nettle really. If at all possible it might be better for you, if you could find someone less alergic, to deal with the bulbs in the area, meantime I hope you are better now. .

AA11785060	Definitely want to have them walk into your booth, so you have the right idea. I did some shows and the first one we just had a table across the front-- almost no one stopped.  You need something that will grab their attention across the back-- Maybe a scale model home mounted vertically on a board, or some various high end accessories you used mounted, like faucets or specialty trim or SOMETHING that will draw their attention and show your attention to detail or quality for your homes.  I've seen concrete steps brought in, mailboxes, partial countertops, built in appliances, etc.   Fairly easy to make some stand up panels out of waferboard that you can bolt together and have braces to hold them up, or hinge so the side panels help hold up the back.  Spot lights help a lot too to highlight a specific feature or product, or a floor plan.  You could even just cover a wall you bring in with decent sized photos of homes you have constructed, or show interior shots. Another idea would be to buy some 4 x 8 PVC lattice and the connector trim pieces and use it with perhaps a fabric backing or not (you will have drape on the back most likely anyway) and mount your featured photos or products on that.  Would be different, and eye catching.  Your contract will spell out what you can and can't do (like balloons for instance and how high your wall can be).  And whether you will have access to power.   People like something that grabs their attention.  I was between two booths one time- (I was promoting energy star and giving away light bulbs, so I stayed busy), one side had Temperpedic beds people could lay on, the other side had particle board cabinets that are installed in garages-- unpainted.  Nothing else but brochures there.  The cabinet place stayed dead all the time, the mattress people had the best gimmick-- you could lie down on their product.   So be creative.  Use bold colors or fabrics too.        Tip--if you just ordered the carpet for the floor, buy some rubber mats to stand on-- killer on the feet.  Or better yet if you did not get carpet, buy some of the interlocking mats to cover your floor. And invest in Dr scholls gel inserts,  the concrete floor all day, even with the cheap carpet, is a real pain.  We also bought a small folding stool to sit on that could be folded up and out of the way when busy.  But was there to sit on when there was no traffic at the beginning or end of the day.  And of course, wear coordinated shirts, if you have logos shirts. If no logos, buy some identical polos in a bright color for everyone who will staff the booth, looks professional even if you don't have logos on them.   Bring snacks and water in an ice chest too you can hide under your table drapes.  Good luck!|`|FXnHE7mmaa	If you are at a home show and trying to get out info to drum up customers for your floor plans, I would not do anything that will look cheap..it could be interpreted into your work.

jipKf0f2aa	With the coil being iced over there is most likely a leak in the system. You can look at all the connections for any signs of refrigerant oil. You will need to call a service company. If you remove the inside cover where the inside lines go into the evaporator coil, you may thaw this out with a box fan blowing on it. Leave the unit turned off until thawed.  You may then turn it on and see how long it runs before re icing. Be sure to replace all covers before turning back on. <br>  The inside fan could also cause the freeze up. If it isn't blowing,  the coil will also freeze.|`|YfU0X6PSaa	Could be low on refrigerant. Just because it is new doesn't mean it is not leaking somewhere. Look around the ground or on the casing for oil. If you see remnants of oil than you have a leak somewhere. When you have a leak, then you will get ice.

Call anyone you can get hold of tonight, cause you will have to be in a que for service this time of year.  The fan in the attic is not running, and it may be a limiter switch or something more serious.  You have two fans involved, one on the compressor unit outside, and one in the attic in the air handler which moves the air through the pipes and into the rooms.  The second one is the malfunctioning one.  Goodman units have a classic problem with this.  Cheap electronic parts.<br>  <br>  Shut off everything so it melts the ice off.  Just be sure and tell the tech how much ice was on it.  If you continue to run it, you may damage something else.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  IN the future, run the fan on "ON' all the time, as it will save the rheostat that trips the unit on.  Turning the unit off and on all the time is what wears it out.  That will leave the room more comfortable, allowing you to raise the thermostat a few degrees, and it will cause the compressor to come on less often.  Your electric bill will also be cheaper, and the universe will thank you for less greenhouse gasses.

7daaf53d7b5644f2e5620b5ef3e9b316aa	Ooh! Coleus is an easy one. It wants to root. In the greenhouse, we take coleus cuttings of 2 or 3 nodes (the joints where leaves emerge from stems), trim off the lowest leaves and stick the cutting into sterile medium (Potting soil works fine.) in such a way that at least one node is covered with soil. Keep the cuttings moist and warm and they should start making new roots from the node in just a few days. No rooting hormone is necessary, but it won't hurt anything if you want to use it.  One more thing: If the variety you're propagating is a large-leaved one, you might want to remove any mature leaves on your cuttings. This way the plant has less foliage to support while it concentrates on rooting. Even a bare naked coleus stem will root and take off fine!  Many many other annuals behave in just the same way. Impatiens, begonias, geraniums, trailing petunias...most branching annuals will root thus. You probably won't have the same result with plants that grow from a central crown, like pansies or lobelia...but anything that grows like a coleus should work.|`|AA11896942	I don't have much experience, but I know there are products you can buy at your home improvement center or garden center called root hormone.

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	If the lock is frozen, try using a commercial deicing spray or thaw the cylinder with a hair dryer.  Using graphite will cause the lock to become gummy if the humidity rises.   Don't heat the key (for example using a cigarette lighter) it will weaken the metal in the key and perhaps cause the key to break off.     If you need to improve the smoothness of the lock cylinder, use a penetrating oil vs. WD-40 ( the penetrating oil is heavier and won't freeze or fail in it's properties).

AA11419397	Things Youll Need:    Facial tissues   Clothes iron   Flat butter knife       Step1  Let the wax cool and solidify. When it is cool to the touch, scrape up the solid wax and throw it away. A flat butter knife works great for this, but you can also just use your fingernails.     Step2  Set your clothes iron to its lowest setting and allow it to get warmed up. In the meantime, create a layer of about five tissues and set the stack over the stain. If the stain is on a vertical wall, you'll have to just hold the tissues up against the stained section of the wall at first.     Step3  Gently run the iron back and forth over the stack of tissues. The wax should begin to melt and get absorbed by the tissues. If you see wax bleeding all the way through the stack, continue with a clean stack of five tissues. Keep repeating this process until all of the wax has been lifted up and the stain is gone.   ________________    Tips :    Keep a close eye on your tissues. If they become singed, replace them right away and consider turning your iron down to a cooler setting, if possible. One of the important reasons why tissues are used in this process is to prevent you from burning or scorching your surfaces.     This method should not be attempted on plastic surfaces, surfaces that have been covered in any type of plastic or synthetic coating or any surface that would otherwise melt or warp under high temperatures.|`|AA11409431	Try using a brown paper bag or towel, heat up and iron and try ironing the stain up.

Exr0iP5Aaa	Try peanut butter.  If you rub it into the gum it will loosen it and then you can easily pull it off of the clothing.  You then can use vinegar if you have a small oil mark.  I have found that peanut butter works 90% of the time and Ice only works about 40%.  Good luck!!!!!|`|pMCspswHaa	Get an ice cube and rub it against the gum, when you think its cold or frozen enough start taking it off with a tooth pick, it takes a lot of patient but it works, my mom taught me that :)  Good luck!|`|2j3NzrFIaa	with acetone|`|eZtBCRvkaa	i heard if you tried to freeze it with ice it'll get hard and you'd be able to pull it off all at once haven't tried it myself but it might work good luck|`|898f20a257695abc9115e62cda6828e3aa	If you hold ice on the gum it will harden to the point that it breaks off the cloth.  If it is imbedded into the fibers, use the ice to remove all that is on the surface then, as crazy as it sounds, you can put a small amount of peanut butter on the rest and rub it in then let it set for 15 minutes or so and it will desolve the gum.  Don't know why this works, it just does.  Using these techniques will be better for your fabric than harsh chemicals that may fade the colors.  When all the gum is out, handwash the soiled area in the sink with a good grease fighting dish soap like "Dawn".  This should take the oils from the peanut butter out so it does not leave an oil stain.  Then wash in the machine as usual.  Hope this helps!|`|ZUpy2flGaa	Stick to using ice.

Many holistic health experts think it is not only less expensive but better for your health to eat in harmony with the environment and climate.       Plan your meals in advance and try not to go to the grocery store without a shopping list    Avoid buying nonfood items such as detergent, toothpaste, shampoo, napkins, and facial tissues at the grocery store. Usually you can get these items much cheaper at discount or warehouse stores.       Buy cheaper cuts of meat and cook them in a crock pot to make them tender and flavorful.       Use up leftovers to make soup. Make soup broth from leftover meat, bones and vegetable scraps.     Go out to eat for lunch instead of dinner. The menus are often the same, only with much lower prices for lunch time.       Avoid buying packaged and processed foods. Make foods from scratch using preservative free ingredients. You'll save money and be healthier for it, too.       Look for coupons in the paper each week for restaurants and save them in a folder for future use. I keep my coupons and carry out menus in plastic cover sheets in a big binder so I can find them easy for busy nights.    And my own tips:    Take your own lunch to work - Cook large portions and freeze    Only buy vegies/fruit as you need - I am amazed at how much food I throw away - I buy things at the grocery store with the intention of using them.     Plan you meals to avoid wasting food like above    Hang washing out! So much better for the environment and execise too! Bend and stretch! hehe     Turn appliances off at the switch - appliances on stand by burns alot of electricity    If you have kids, do simple things with them. Kids think they need expensive toys, outings etc, but they wil have so much fun doing things like making their own cubby houses out of sheets, having picnics, making cupcakes etc etc etc    Finally ebay all the things you dont use/need anymore. You will be amazes at how much you can earn. Or hold a street garage sale - you will attract lots of people when a more people join you.|`|Z8pnrAgJaa	Use Clorox for disinfecting instead of ready made cleaners,it kills strap and strep. Dilute with water and of course keep out of the reach of children. Never,never mix with any other cleaners like ammonia as it can kill you from the fumes.Read the label for cleaning tips. Use baking soda for a soft abrasive to clean cook tops and stoves.Vinegar for glass and to run through coffeepot then several rinses with clean water to keep them from getting clogged.Your washer too,rund a gallon thru a regular cycle. Use half lemon juice and half water and put in the microwave for a minute or two and clean it without the expensive clearner this does a great job.Recycle plastic grocery bags to pack Christmas packages you mail instead of bubble wrap.Line small wastebaskets with the plastic bags.Insulate your water heater with a insulation jacket sold at Lowe's of Home Depot they cost about $20 dollars but saves on your electic bill. Make sure to keep toliets and faucets from dripping or running and replace gaskets or ball in toliet tanks,you could be paying for wasted water.Keep drafts from your houseuse "draft catchers" or make them yourself if you sew.

You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "white raisin" (  7685) might be a good choice.

v3xEtuLLaa	Did you use oil-based stain and water based polyurethane?  They do not bond well.  There is no real way to remove this without sanding and refinishing.  You can try to use a scraper (gently) to remove the polyurethane, but you are most likely going to have to resand.  Hope this helps.|`|Gd4f7VD1aa	It sounds like an adhesion problem.  Brand A doesn't always adhere to brand B and so on.  Another problem cold be that there are remnants of wax from previous coatings that are not allowing adhesion.  Best bet at this point, is to take back down and start all over.  Use the same brand of product (Patch, Stain, Finish) all the way thru.  I know it is a lot of work, but It won't get better by itself.
