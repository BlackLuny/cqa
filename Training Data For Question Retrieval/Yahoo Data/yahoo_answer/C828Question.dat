I read a recipe on here that said something like cutting them into cubes, adding flour - removing the cubes then adding salt and pepper, garlic and onion to the mix... then throwing the chicken cubes back in. Does this make sense? Is there anything else I can do with these chicken breasts that's EASY and delicious? Thanks.
20090128135306AAGHsaG	Food & Drink;Ethnic Cuisine	What is a good french finger food to make?	So our french class is having everyone bring in some food for a relatively relaxing class. While it isn't required that the food be french, a majority of the class will likely bring something that is of french origins. What kind of finger foods can I make that would go well for something like this ( about 20 people )? What is common here and what is less common?  If you have a recipe for something that you list, feel free to include it.    Also, out of curiosity, I've heard truffles used with the idea of french desserts before, but I've also heard it used in so many other contexts. Are truffles of a french origin? Is there anything about a truffle that can make it *french*?

I've got an awesome recipe for jalapeno poppers. I'd like to prepare a huge batch and freeze them before baking them. That way I can just grab a few out of the freezer and bake them when I get the craving for them.   The recipe is fresh jalapenos, cut in half lengthwise and seeded. The filling is made of cream cheese, shredded mont. jack and sharp cheddar, crumbled cooked bacon, and spices. You then spoon the filling into the pepper halves, roll in breadcrumbs and bake for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.   So, can I make a bunch up and without baking, freeze them?

I have asked this question in the "Cooking & Recipes" section because I had to pick between that section and this one, looks like I went with the wrong section the first go around! Hopefully (which I think is the case) you guys' will be more knowledgable about this! Okay here's my question:      I'm new to cooking but this recipe calls for dry sherry. It's a wine I assume? This probably sounds stupid because now I know it's a TYPE of wine?? But I went to the grocery store and there wasn't anything that was called or labeled "dry sherry". So what exactly would I buy? White wine? A certain brand? I have looked up the definition for dry sherry but still doesn't tell exactly what to buy for newbies like me.         2 days ago - 5 days left to answer.    Additional Details   2 days ago      Thanks for all the answes guys... but I'm sort of hearing stuff I already know. I know WHAT sherry is (foritfied wine). I don't want any substitutions... I want actual dry sherry. I think I may just have to go in to the grocery store and ask someone. When I'm looking at the wine aisle...what am I looking for? A white wine? will it say on there "dry" or "sherry"? There are so many types, what's a genuine dry sherry? brand?? Maybe if you have a link of a picture of the stuff you use (ACTUAL DRY SHERRY, no cooking sherry or substitutes) that can be found at a regular grocery store. Here's the link to my recipe I'm going to try right now, although I have many recipes that call for dry sherry that I have yet to try because Idk what exactly to buy!       http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Thai-Peanut...

20090128144322AAoyQrY	Food & Drink;Entertaining	What should i do for my sixteenth birthday party?	Kay, so, in April i'm turning sixteen and i'm totally and utterly confused about what i should do as a party,   i was thinking either to have a big party and invite all my friends,   or invite just a couple of my closest girl friends and go to dinner downtown and rent a limo and go sleep at a hotel downtown.   Now, here are the problems for both ideas.   idea one, i don't know where to have the party and cause i recently moved so i have friends from the place where i used to live and friends from where i live now and im afraid that it would be awkward if i bring them all together. and i want to have alcohol at my party but i cant think of a public place who would allow sixteen year old's to have alcohol.   idea two. im on a budget, and i cannot go over it. i know it may be very expensive to rent a limo and go sleep at a hotel. i know which hotel and which restaurant i want to go to and i've done some research for limo but came up with nothing inexpensive.      help me!?   :)

20090128144737AA9bMTx	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Can Eating Meat Cause Stomach Pain?	I am trying to become a vegetarian. I've been eating less and less meat. But today I ate some ham. I notice every time I eat meat, my stomach cramps really bad, and it feels like someone is punching me in the gut. Why? Sometimes it's worse than others. I am totally going to try Not to eat meat anymore. My stomach can't handle the abuse. Oh yeah, I have IBS and Acid Reflux. Could that have anything to do with it? Honestly it feels like I got a rock in my gut. OUCH !!!

20090128152553AAx8LWQ	Food & Drink;Entertaining	I Need help with ideas for a chick flick slumber party for a few girls! All the advice I can get Please!?	Ok, I'm having a slumber party for my sixteenth birthday. It's not until may, so it should be pretty good weather. However, I don't really want to go outside because my neighborhood is not good. I only have my three best friends coming, and one of them is 13, but the other two are 16. So I need some ideas for some things we can do, games we can play, food we can have, music, decorations maybe, and prizes I can give out for winning the games. Real prizes along with booby prizes. My friends and I are kind of like little kids at heart, so things for 14-16 year old would be great. My party kind of has a theme, but not really. The "theme" is chick flicks, so obviously, I will have some chick flicks, but I don't want to just have movies, because people will get bored. Movie ideas would be great too. I have like a trivia game planned for the chick flicks, possibly. So pretty much any ideas you have would be amazing. It doesn't have to follow the theme. Thank you sooo much!!
