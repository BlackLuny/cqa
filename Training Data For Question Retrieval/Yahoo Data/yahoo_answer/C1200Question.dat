I carried out three analytical experiments.   Two of the experiments were spectroscopic techniques and one was a chromatographic technique.   In the spectroscopic technique experiments I was provided with river water evidence sample and had to determine whether it was unpolluted (no coloured dye present) or if the sample contains any level of the pollutants in the water.   In the first experiment I used a colorimeter to determine the absorbance values for the river water at a range of wavelengths.   In the second experiment I used a colorimeter again to determine the absorbance values for the water reference samples of known concentration.   In the third experiment I placed the river water sample along with five dyes on a chromatogram to determine which dyes the river water contained.

20090203165214AAHn7s2	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Gain with LM324 OpAmp?	So the question gives a story about how you designed a car with an electronic steering system, but when you turn right, it goes left. The problems are that the control signal is backwards and it takes twice as many steering wheel revolutions to go from "lock to lock" as required by design specs. The question is, when you add this LM324 OpAmp, what is the gain? From the book I gather that A(o)= 100,000, R(i)= 1.0, R(o)=20 for a LM324 OpAmp, but this was not stated in the problem. How do I calculate the gain? Thanks.

The ball is then swung overhead in a horizontal circle making 4 revolutions in 1 second. find the speed of the ball and the centripetal force on the ball. what is creating the centripetal force?   i need to find frequency, time, ac<--small c and velocity and Fc<--small c.      if anyone could just explain how to get the anwsers that would be great. You don't have to give me anwsers. I just want to know how to do it and the formula. I have some of the formulas but i cannot piece everything together.

Thanks.      Now the question-      A wire is stretched out so that it's length increases, but its cross sectional area decreases, while the total volume area of the wire remains constant. Will the resistance be 1- greater, 2- less than, or 3- equal to what it orriginally was?

The caravan is connected to the car by means of a light , a rigid tow bar. the car exerting a driving force of 1270N. The resistances to the forward motion of the car and caravan are 400N and 600N respectively you may assume that these resitances remain constant.    Q1 = show that acceleration of the car and caravan is 0.15ms-2    Q2 = draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on the caravan along line of its motion. Calculate tension in the tow bar    Q3 = The driving force is removed but the cars brakes are not applied Determine whether the tow bar is now in tension or compression    Q4 = the cars brakes are then applied gradually. The brakes of the caravan come on automatically when the tow bar is subjected to a compression force at least 50N  (iv) show that the acceleration of the caravan just before its brakes come on automatically is -0.65ms-2 in the direction of its motion.

In my opinion no one knows the exact date, only God. However, I was checking out an ad's website on myspace (www.instituteforhumancontinuity.org) and it really, really DID scare me. I think that there are many factors that contribute to this theory especially the aztec calendar. Also, this website I just posted (which you should really consider exploring) has a lot of information, well not that much but interesting. So my question is, do people really think this is going to happen? Honestly I think that there is no organization or place that can save us other then Jesus. Any other information is welcome.
