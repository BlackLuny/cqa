Here are the premises for my argument of thinking there should exist a news websites that only has neutral or happy reports:      1) Arsons, murders, earthquakes, heat waves, floods, fires, causing xx amount of death and destruction, sex scandals, rape, etc I already KNOW exist.  I ALREADY KNOW they are happening constantly.  I have no interest in constantly learning about what new incidences such as these occur because it is simply a REMINDER, not news.      2.  I think I can learn more about the world and actual things that will affect me if the headlines aren't covered my the above mentioned things.      I tried google, and I got happynews.com which isn't much of a website.  Can someone suggest a different one?

20090131194427AAZK1iP	News & Events;Current Events	Can anyone explain to me what Obama meant by this speech?	In today's globalized world, the security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people. Whether it's global terrorism or pandemic disease, dramatic climate change or the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation, the threats we face at the dawn of the 21st century can no longer be contained by borders and boundaries.      The horrific attacks on that clear September day awakened us to this new reality. And after 9/11, millions around the world were ready to stand with us. They were willing to rally to our cause because it was their cause too - because they knew that if America led the world toward a new era of global cooperation, it would advance the security of people in our nation and all nations.   The American moment has not passed, the American moment is here and like generation s before us, we will seize that moment and begin the world a new.      I asked something similar a couple of minutes ago and got really blind & ignorant answers, what do YOU think he meant by this speech?      No borders, no boundaries....
20090226074600AAd9kV8	News & Events;Current Events	Need help, re Obama's Tuesday night speech!?	My Comm 101 professor is new to teaching, and is still sort of getting the hang of the whole thing. Last night, she sent out an email for us to fill out, asking questions about Obama's speech, saying that if we missed it we could watch it online somewhere. Well, she sent this out at 10 last night, I didn't get it until just now, and most of us have class all day today! So as much as I hate to do it, I'd be grateful if anyone would answer any of these questions for me.      1: Give an example of something persuasive Obama said. Was he using a "cause and effect" approach, or using a "problem and solution" strategy?       2: What is his specific purpose? In other words, what is he trying to accomplish/convey by communicating with the nation in this speech?      3: Give 5 examples of verbal and nonverbal techniques he used during his speech.      4: List 3 ways he gains the audience's attention.      Again, I know this is a lot of information to remember two days after the speech, and I hate myself for getting homework help here, but I don't see any other way to complete this assignment in the time we were given. Thanks to any help you can give!

I'm just curious because of all the drama over the New York times cartoon. If Bush would have still been president and that cartoon came out no one would have cared. So now why all the sudden is it racist? Is Obama's being black going to have a "If you don't like me your racist" ideology for his term? All the negative press given to all of the presidents of the past was allowed so now after all these others why are we setting up a "Be nice to me" boundary? Whats so special about Obama that the press isn't allowed to take shots at him like the others? Is him being black going to have this big of an effect on the country? Whats next?

I think that they are the ones causing cancer.  Think about it, the population is extremely high and it is a good cover up.  When they want to raise money to cure it i think they are keeping it and not even trying.  The government also has very advanced technology. Stuff that you wouldn't believe, but yet they can't find a cure for cancer. Oh and 9/11, the government planned it.  If you ever watch a video of it the building is exploding underneath the falling part of the building, almost llike somebody set off charges. I think they did this to scare americans so they can scam people into letting them put voice recorders into phone lines to prevent terrorism from happening.  And they are probably trying to dampen the population by keeping the soldiers in iraq for so long.  I just think that our government is a joke they always know where you are, kinda creepy huh.  Well post your opinion.

The great one is trying to punish the old already while at the same time He is pushing to give to the illegals and idle masses that refuse to support themselves. The socialist world of Obama is beginning to act like the old indian tribes, putting the elderly out in the desert while feasting on the accomplishments the elderly provided. The elderly built this country but the present washington crown want to take away from them. When illegals get 600 rebates while the elderly get 250 that is gender warfare in my book.

Ok so I was watching the stockmarket(bloomberg) channel when I saw that ''crude oil rose by $11 a barrel because just a few days ago it was at $33.97 per barrel and now it is up to $44.97 per barrel.So what are these speculators trying to pull?.This is just how it started back in early 2004/2005 and cause oil to go up to $147.50 a barrel.Do you'll really want to see this happen again.PLEASE ALERT PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GO AFTER THESE OPEC OIL SPECULATORS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE AND OIL IS ONCE AGAIN AT $147.50 A BARREL.THESE OIL SPECULATORS MUST BE CAUGHT EARLY AND STOPPED,even though it is under $50 a barrel(but for how long).I thought that the weakening demands due to the global financial crisis would have decreased oil prices,but these speculators are trying to drive it back up again.And yes oil speculators are fully responsible.Donot forget when the last administration started going after the oil speculators oil came down tremendously.Now speculators are sneaking back in to try to hike up the price on a product that has weakening demands for it(which is why opec started cutting productions in the first place)
