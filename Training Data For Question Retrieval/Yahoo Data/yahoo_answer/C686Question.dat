20090310025830AAtQY4R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do(ex-girl)?	We broke up about five months ago. I broke up with her because a long time ago she cheated on me with this guy. I told her if it happened again I was gone. Well, I kinda jumped to conclusions because of a past experience with her, and ended a three year relationship.To make a long story short I was wrong. Now she is with some other guy, and it's eating me alive, so I guess I'm a little jealous. I dream about her every night(not sexually, lol), I wake up and just want to call her, but I'm scared of being rejected if I call her, and I'm not a home-wrecker, I want her to be happy. She runs through my mind all day, every day, I've all this love for her and I don't know what to do with it.      Oh, I don't know what to do. Should I just move on?

He will say little things like "subtley" flirt with a stranger at the register.  I hate it, he will do it with women of any age, or even men.  If someone is close to us in a line or something he will raise his voice and make a clear comment.  Should I call him on it?  That's what I've been doing.  Or should I just leave him?
20090310024957AAKQ8o4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I get my boyfriend to do things around the house?	For example, I will let the trash build up for a while to see if he will do it himself.... but no, he never does it.  I ask him occasionally and he doesn't like being told do to "Everything!!!!!!!' around the house.  Well I rarely ask him to do stuff, just to do well in school and be a great friend.  But nagging him to do things isn't my forte.  I don't want to cut him out for his shortcomings but these little things are bothering me.  Is there a different way to tell him what I want,  my mom would just tell me to kick him out.  sigh.  So, thank you for your opinionss :)

20090310025237AA51wH3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I want sex to much how can i stop it?	okay I'm married and i think about sex way to much. i mean i want it all the time even after i have had sex 30 minutes later I'm thinking about it again.and its almost triggered by nothing  simply just touch he bear skin and its all i think about. But he doesn't want it as often as i do he wants it one or twice maybe 3 times a month and some times its worth the wait and other times not so much. I some times think a have a sexual problem. i don't like masturbation its boring and just nasty and in the end im never satisfied. I even tried using a dildo but its still no satisfaction sure i get off after 45 minutes but its not what im craving. I used to have a thing for watching porn but  i have grown bored of it. keep in mind i will NEVER have sexual relations with anyone other then my husband EVER. some times I start to get irritated after a while from lake of sexual activity. so how do i stop myself from wanting it so much?

Do I dance with my husband the whole time and then pick a different song to dance with my grandpa or do I take the six minute song, give my husband three minutes, and then give my grandpa the other three?      I'm only asking because I don't see how you would transition from the first dance to the father/daughter dance. Btw, I'm choosing my grandpa because my dad died when I was a ten so my grandpa took that father role in my life.      Thanks in advance.

20090310030609AAmzdtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does love have the same intensity when you are older (any mature advice welcome)?	I have had the same boyfriend for twelve years, we started dating 4 months after his wife left him for someone else. We don't live together as we both had a young child each when we first got together, but we live five minutes walk away so no problem. My boyfriend had been hurt twice by his exes' so even though we had a great relationship on all counts he always said that he could never trust or love me entirely, there was no chance of us moving in together. Twelve years later the kids are grown up and we still have a relationship where we share hobbies and get together for days/nights out,  holidays and although our sex life isn't as often as we would like it is usually exciting when we make the time. Now that my boyfriends son has left home to join the army i thought we would have more quality time together without being interrupted by boys and there girlfriends, not the case. My boyfriend has suddenly wanted a break in our relationship, saying that even though he cares for me a lot he doesn't love me and seems to think he is missing out on "That sizzling Love felling" he is 56 and I am 48, I think that he is worried that when he retires in 4 years I will still be working and won't be able to spend the time with him . He has a property in Spain which he was hoping to move to. Perhaps we should move on, but we have shared so much together over the years that I find it so sad that  the good memories we have can't sem to hold us together. anyone been in the same place with their lives

20090310031931AAomlhr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I continue fighting for him?	About a month or two ago, I was placed into a different house. Because my father had anger issues and the court wont let me see him for two yrs. Until 2011. Well I was in a relationship with a incredible guy, I moved a half hour away not even that. But, it started ggetting rough. His mom was mad at me for sending a message over myspace. It was a forwarded message sent over a year before. But I guess she was upset about that, and there was a rumor spreading after I left the shool that I was pregnant. But his mom was angry with me. My parents sat down with my boyfriends dad and he seemed fine. But I havent seen joshua after that. His mother hasnt called me. Nothing! its been a month, But I have a friend that is friends with Joshua, and I was told I wasnt legally aloud to talk to Joshua any longer. Im guessing his parents said that so he wont sneak and try and call me. But I guess he misses me etc. But he doesnt want to get me in trouble....      what should I do?

I'll like a guy and it seems like he likes me back but he actually likes my one friend. I started liking my ex again awhile back and it really seemed like he liked me back but he liked my friend and asked her out. I might like my one guy friend but it def. seems like he shows interest in her too. And the thing is: she says no to everyone. I'm not trying to say this in a mean way but it's like she's so friendly with a guy that she gives them a signal that she likes him and he'll ask her out and she'll say no and then it's too weird for them to be around each other. I don't get it. I'll admit it she's a very pretty, natural girl and I try to be too it's just that it seems like she beats me out every time. I''m kind of ready to give up. what should i do?
20090310035003AAXjUD2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any ways to stop missing my ex?	i cant stop crying atm cos im missing my ex,    ive tried everything but i cant get over and stop missing my ex. i was with him for 4 yrs. we broke up about may last yr however we still kept seeing each other 2-3 times a week to hang out and have sex and he told me we were exclusive without being a serious cpl till about mid september last yr however in this time period he was still making plans for the future for us. e.g booking a trip for us to go away in in january.         the problem was that in may when we originally broke up he dumped me and i was very heartbroken because he dumped me after trying for 3 months to convince me to move in with him and maybe get married. iam not into marriage or living with a partner so it took him alot of hard work.. roughly about 3 months to get me to come around to even consider it. the week before he dumped me, he told my parents what he wanted wich is what made it more heartbreaking for me.      i guess he either just got cold feet or changed his mind and then dumped me, so when we were still seeing each other till sept he told me he can see that iam still heartbroken and upset about it and we had a series one after the other of long serious stressful talks wich resulted in huge arguements each time wich the arguements never got this bad. it was sooo bad, we were throwing things around the rooom, both of us and we never ever did that to each other. anyway so thats the brief history on me and him and i havent seen or spoken to him since.       the fact is that i still think of him as my best friend. we were together for 4 yrs and i still think of him from the moment i wake up till the time i go to sleep. ive tried everything. for the first month after that till about early december i got very depressed nd just stayed home 24/7 being depressed but since then ive tried everything, i got a new job, new friends, worked and hanged out with friends more. started looking after myself more and kinda tried keeping myself busy and take up new things.however inside i still feel horrible and miss him all the time. no matter what i do, weither iam busy at work or hanging out with my new friends iam still thinking of him.       ive heard some people post bad and good points about their ex and usually the bad points overweigh the good and makes u feel better howeer you do not understand this guy (my ex) he ultimately is the prince that are made up in the fairytales.he was hot,sexy,had a great body,respectable,funny,rich,had a good job,caring,responcible and other than the fact of the timing of when he dumped me wich was 1 week after conving me and my parents to move in with him, i cant think of anything bad about him. so its very hard for me to even try to date other guys cos ive tried and i just think of the other guys as losers cos this guy was just so good at everything. sorry this is long.

20090310033326AAZngOr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What might happen if I approach this guy?	There's this guy I've interracted with, we play on the same coed bball team, and I see him at my work all the time (I work at a gym and he's always using the courts there). I've pretty much initiated talking for the most part and the response has been positive. He's given me attention in the form of talk, smiles, and jokes and I figure that I have nothing to lose by testing the waters. The only thing that really initiated this random spurt of boldness is the fact that I caught him looking at me and he looked away after we locked eyes for a second. So my plan is...      I want to ask him tomorrow if he can call my phone and pretend I've misplaced it and when I find it I'll say in so many words, "Now that we have eachother's numbers we should hang out some time."      Is this weird? Will he appreciate the creativity of what I intend to do? Or will it put him off? I'm naturally a very headstrong kinda' person and before I was intimidated by him...I never feel that. I'm taking this whole thing into my hands just because...well I dunno'...if he can't handle just this random little thing I attempt...then he might not be interested in me as a whole once he gets to know me better.      I'm not asking for us to go out or anything all immediately...I just want to hang out either one on one in a casual setting...even something as shooting around at the gym or sharing a Jamba Juice or something.      So I guess I'm wondering what's everyone else's opinion on this?

20090310035500AA9JkGw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please tell me what your opinons are?	I have a lovely husband except when it comes to drinks.I have a one month old baby.My husband runs a business of our own and I am a stay at home mom.   My baby like all babies gets wind sometimes and will cry and be unsetteled for that reason.    So one day I was really exhausted cos my baby was like that all day and when my husband came back from work I said to him..I think our baby has wind or colic..and so for me to last all night if the baby will still be unsetteled I need to take a nap for 2 hours or so!! I said to my husband I will bath,change his nappy and feed him...If he still cries.. please comfort the baby while I nap!! well my husband said he cant possibly work 12 hours and look after the baby for 2 or 3 hours too. That he needs to go to unwind and have a drink or 2 after work.He says the job is stressful and he needs to unwind after work.BUT..I do get exhausted too.Not all the time.My baby doesnt cries everyday or evertime.He has his days which I think is wind or colic...so these days I need help from my husband.         Am I been selfish? Is my husband right to want to unwind in our local bar after a long day at work for a pint or two no longer than an hour? or do u think I should not go and help me out sometimes when i need? Do u think I shouldnt ask for his help because he is working and I am a stay at home mom?
20090310034422AADB55T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I bore my girlfriend?	She would spend more time with her business than with me. She's always not in the mood for conversations. My hobbies/interests does not interest her. She doesn't wanna cuddle even when its just the two of us in the room. She doesn't initiate a kiss unless she did something wrong and she knows I'm mad.       It's like we're not meant to be together, at all. I would like to believe she's giving me signals to call it off. But when I try to confront her about it, she'd always deny or use her charms and sweet talk me and I would always end up believing/giving in to her. Then same things happen over and over again.
20090310034956AAUeQMU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Back to my previous question"Does love have the same intensity"?	I don't think I am a vitim in this relationship I am a strong minded person. I have a good circle of my own friends, a large family, I sail have an allotment and a good job. Perhaps I have left my boyfriend behind along the way and he might need someone that he feels he can give more to. He has done sailing but has lost interest (we started sailing together) he is not a very friend orientated person and only has a small immediate family. Perhaps we should part ways. I just thought the future may be better once our kids didn't need us so much and we could do all the things we once talked about doing together.

20090310033756AAGt8Vl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce Issue - Please suggest me!?	I need your suggestion regarding my marital issues.       Am 27 yr old man from India. We got married in aug-2008 (6 months). She was there with me for 4 months at my home. She went back her home couple of times for silly issues and came back after I spoke to their parents. Right from day 1 we had problems. Their people have initiated in the marriage itself regarding some cultures. They have abused my people infront of me and I didn't like it at all. I was upset and I was not happy with her for the initial 2 months. But after 2 months I started opening up myself with her and I started being happy after I spoke to their people. At the end of the 4th month she went back her home and they didn't respond to me even if I went to her place. They shut their doors on my face and abused me a lot. It happened for sometime. They never responded my calls and e-mails. One day we had a meeting and she said she has the doubt that I have some affair with somebody else. She said she will get back to us after a week with the proofs. There was a meeting after 2 weeks and I've arranged the meeting at my friend's place since they are not willing to come to my place. That meeting was not successful as both the parties started abusing each other. Their people scolded my people and my people abused their people. So it was not a successful meeting. After that I went to one of their closest relative and I begged him to help me out in sorting out the things because I love her so much and I know that I never had any extra marital relation. They showed me some prrofs. They include: 1. The history of calls that I dialed and received 2. My e-mails that I received 2. My orkut profile 3. And a girl's picture when she was at work. I clearly explained them that I have lot of friends and I do spend most of the time with friends  but I do not have any extra marital relations. I agreed that I spoke to a lady even at odd times but that doesn't mean am in relation with her. She is a celebrity and we are a group of friends that we will be in touch with each other at any time even before my marriage also. I introduced my wife every girl whom i speak to. I never thought she will take the things this seriously. Even if she has taken seriously, she should have told me atleast once and I would have stopped doing everything that she doesn't like. I told her all my activities and I introduces all my friends (both genders) thinking that everything should be known to her. She made a mess of everything and their people discussed everything infront of all the relatives which shouldn't have happened. After this I even gave her some assurances as well that I will add her name in my property documents for her security and for her security if they are worried about it, I said I'll go to the police station and tell them everything and I'll give it in writing that we'll be happy together. I also assured her that we'll stay seperately somewhere else. After all the patch up is done, they asked me to stay near by their parent's flat which I didn't like but I agreed to stay to prove my commitment towards her. I thought of staying nearby to our offices. I took lot of pains, insults and hatredness from my prople in acheiving the patch up. But now, after the patch up is done, they started digging out all the past issues and they are scolding and abusing all my family members on a daily basis. My wife is blackmailing me for divorce on each and every issue. She scolded all of my people very nastyly especially she targetted my sister and mother. My sister was very friendly with her in the past in fact. Now she is saying that she will not talk to any of my people for the life time and she said she will not allow any of my people to touch our kid in future. I had lots of love for my wife because of which i took lot of pains for patch up. With this kind of behaviour she lost all the respect that she had. I am afraid how can I be happy if this is going to continue though out my life? I want all my family members to be happy and I want my wife to be a part of it. Not only her, but their people as well. But they said they are not ready for patch up. If am trying to patch up the two families, they said they are not interested and they are scolding everyone of us, including me. I feel like am in hell if this is going to continue. They threaten me for divorce for every silly issue. My wife is very childish and immature but her mother is making her stubborn and develoing a negative thinking in her from time to time. My parents are dependent on us (me and my brother who stays in UK). I'll have to take care of my parents and these guys are imposing restrictions on my care for my parents. Its really hurting me a lot. She is at her home with their parents and her mother is not even allowing me to talk to her seperately though I tried to talk to her many times. She switched off her mobile and she is not in contact with me at all. I came back home coz I couldn't resist their insults anymore.

20090310040210AAlTpnF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can me and my wife reach our personal 'business' goals and not fight with each other?	My wife got fired (unfairly) from her job last November. Since then, she has not wanted to work for anyone again, and now she is opening a fashion shop. I have helped her, altho I work full time - and I would like to work for myself too - my job is going nowhere and the company may not be here in a year. I teach martial arts part time and accepted her help, via getting a lodger in to help me with the mortgage and bills.      I have given my wife a lot of financial help and it is in my interest for her to succeed. I wnat her to. But I have been approached to teach group sessions (i do personal tuition only) and it's a big chance for me.      Problem is, after booking a day off work yesterday to help her in part at the shoop but also to have a meeting with the stadium who wnat me to arrange the group class, I wanted to go back to the home - 1/2 mile up the road to do my work - reply emails and so on. I needed to do this but she rounded on me and said I was being condescending. I was'nt - I had told her I had things to do and needed an hour - in the quiet at home to do it - no loidger,no wife there to interrupt me...because they always do, and I never have any personal space.      How do I make her see what I am doing is important to me. And if all went bad, I would work in Aldi, McDonads to keep money coming in. She has said she has the worry of the shop rent - but all this has been her decision. I suggested she do it from home because she did before and it was successful. And then to do the shop in 2010.      But she never listens to me !!

This girl was totally in love with me - we went on our first date last friday. She would not stop staring at me for 3 hours looking at me all wide-eyed and we acted like girlfriend/boyfriend. It was really obvious we were a good match.      Today in class (we're in college), she came in and still sat next to me. But she didn't flirt much as before. She said she was on medication today because she's really sick. During the class she joked, "so you gonna give me some of your cash or what?" I said, "depends on how well you cook :)" And she smiled and said "cook for you as your girlfriend?" (she made it a bit hard to hear but this was what I made it out to be)      At the end of class I said "I'm going to dinner...You wanna come?" And she said, "I'm going over to the cafeteria because I have un-used meals. And I have a stomach ache and I'm feeling sick." 2 minutes later she says "so is it cool?"      We walk out for a minute then she says "okay, I'm going to the cafeteria, see you later!" And walks off. Usually she follows me all the way down before departing.      Why hot to cold so fast?

20090310043646AAJGAdz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I contact this guy again?	This guy I went out with for three months really hurt me a lot. He broke up with me as if I were some animal (no sorry you would treat an animal better)... and I never did anything to hurt him.      I understand that he might have not liked me, or that there might not have been chemistry, but he could have broke up more smoothly.      We were talking one day and he just asked me to stop calling and said we should play it cool. He didn't mean to hurt me I guess but he just said it. And only a few days earlier he was so nice and so caring.      I want to call him now and just tell him what a ****** up *** he was! I want him to know that what he did in un-doable, especially to a nice girl who liked him. But I don't know if I should do it or just forget and move on??

20090310045615AADsYEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i approach women, need help please?	Hey as title states I just wanted some advice on approaching women, being confident, and taking it further from there, my description is going to be long so if you dont want to read, just give me some general tips and state so, also please note that i am not trying to be a pick up artist or anything, i actually care about my friends...      Alright, as title says im 20, 2nd year college student. I dont know why but I just have trouble making good friendships especially with women. I never had a girlfriend, i had an intimacy back in high school, i am guessing this has been too hard on me, which would explain all this.      I like fashion, technology, cars, science, lazyness, and lots of people consider me intelligent. I do have good amount of close guy friends and people i know. And for some reason all of them are VERY good with women, i do go out with them as a sidekick, and i dont even know what im doing wrong, when i ask them about it, they get so suprised, they think im joking or something. (sarcasm).      When i try to approach, I can usually get into the conversation, but dont know what to do afterwards, it just dies in first 20 mins.      So any suggestions hints tips will be greatly appreciated, Please feel free to email me with further detail, I would greatly appreciate it and will do you favors as well :)      Also sorry for the length :( its fine if you didnt read it

20090310052515AASG1tX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to overcome shyness around men I am attracted to?	I am perfectly fine around guys I am not attracted to, and have my usual awesome personality going on that guys love me for.  But as soon as there is a guy I am attracted to, I get quiet and I am to shy to even make eye contact with them or speak to them.        Which my friends/family say makes me come off as a bi**h and they say I am intimidating.  I am told all the time by men and woman how pretty, sexy, beautifull, funny I am but I just can't convey that around some guys I like lose my confidence.  Ahhhh!  Help me!  Lol.

She said that her boyfriend well to put it short fingered her and that he (got off) in her hand.

20090310045901AAAc6zh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this bad? lost some respect for my mother-inlaw..?	I have always had a lot of respect for my mother-in-law even though there are some annoying things about her.      Recently she has been out of work because of an accident and is at home with my sister-in-laws... she has become a lot more in to idle gossip and favours her daughters.      She recently had a mood with me because my husband took me out, we had a late one and I woke up late. I'm usually always the first one to wake up and she's the last! Then I went to see my family and she got annoyed.       Now yesterday there was a massive row (I wasn't there) where my sister-in-law said to my mother-in-law that i didnt see her as important because I asked my own mum for advice on something. My mother-in-law agreed even though she doesn't know the full story.      My husband flipped at my sis-in-law and mother-in-law to say that because all the way I have respected for her. I can't even remember asking my mum about it...it's so nit-picky.      My husband says the main thing is she (as in I) respects and loves you and he completely went mad at my sis-in-law for initiating the whole thing.      My mother-in-law even let me carry on washing dishes for everyone even though I didn't eat a thing...her daughter sat down with her and left me to it. She didn't even think to tell her daughter to help me...      Do you think I'm wrong for feeling this way?

First off, I know I'm too young to be doing it but face it; it's my life I'm glad you guys are taking time to warn me about STD's and pregnancy but I try my best to be safe. I feel like I'm ready for sex not because I'm pressured to but because I love my boyfriend so much and it relieves stress (I desperately need it. My hair is going gray already!). We use protection and the pill and we got checked for STDS but we forgot one more hill, our parents! Last time we did it we almost got caught so I was wondering is there any way we can have sex without our parents knowing and if so where and how? (We live across town)

I asked him if he's coming today to the mall he told me he doesn't think he can make it, i told him you have to come[ in a joking way] he smiled then he told me i'll see.      he also raised and lowered his eyebrow toward me although i didn't know what he meant      i was in the car and he was on the sidewalk, i lowered the window and smiled and he smiled back and when the car pulled off, he looked back at it. i always smile at him and he smiles back.   The next day he talked to me about it, he told me I saw you in the car      he's so sweet, if we're both next to a door for example. he'll always let me pass first, he doesn't move until i pass first      once we were talking and his phone rang, he told me one moment, when he answered the phone i was a bit behind cause i felt that it was rude to listen to what he's saying, he talked for like 10 secs and closed then he stopped and  waited for me to come next to him and walk together      Thanks      ?

20090310051837AAPL2TC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this girl. does she still like me?	We went out twice. We both had to go to separate schools for a semester (16 weeks). We stayed in contact only through texting (she’s not a phone girl).?Over the winter break I took her out a few times again, where I told her I liked her. She said she liked me too. I told her I was going to start calling her more. She said “ok”. The spring semester started and i called but no answers ever. But we would always text just like before. I told her we could chill over spring break. We kept texting almost everyday and right out of the blue she stopped texting me. I was the only one contacting her. I didn’t want to feel “needy” so I stopped too.  It kinda hurt but I was fine leaving her alone. On her Facebook page, she posted that she had a boyfriend.  But her status was “single”. After a week, she CALLS me on Valentine’s Day.  (This is what threw me off)  she had to hang up qwick cause of a family thing.  I told her that she owed me a phone call (just playing with her)   She never called me so I texted her and asked her if she had a boyfriend.  She said “no”. She said she posted it because there was an annoying boy at school who always kept looking at her page and she wanted him to stop. Later on i  texted her just asking “what’s up, what happened to all our texting?” She said she had been sick and not been doing much. (That would mean she had been sick for about a month). So another week went by with no contact. Just the another day she texted me saying “what’s up” just like before all this happened. We talked but through text again. 5 days went by and she text me again with one of those FWD FWD FWD things about Jesus. I asked her if they work (just playing around) and she said "lol sometimes" and asked me if I was coming home for spring break. I said yes.  another week went by and she texted again last night.  We use to talk every day.  It SUDDENLY changed and that’s why it doesn’t make sense.  My question is What’s going on with this girl. Does she still like me?

20090310051055AAe4nQQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl is just f**king with me right?	i wouldn't be asking cos i hate people that do this but im extremely insecure and totally girl retarded and quite like this girl. and sorry about writing this ridiculous essay lengthed question.      quick history - someone told this girl sophie i thought she was a mega babe a few months ago, she didn't really seem interested. talked to her for the first time in a month or so at a party on friday.      - friday firstly rather than just been like hey she came up and hugged me and we talked for a while and seemed quite interested (i thought) which shes never done b4 and then l8r on i was just chilling on a bed in this room by myself (didn't ask me why haha) and she just came over and lay down next to me and we had this really sweet d&m for like an hour b4 this other girl came in the room and tried to hook up with me and then when i finally managed to get this other girl off me and out of the room i looked over at soph and she was just lying on the bed turned away from where this girl was trying to hook up with me and then a couple of other girls came in the room and ruined the rest of the convo so i left and didn't get a chance to try kiss her (except for the whole previous hour but anywayyyy lol) then a bit l8r on a caught her checking me out once or twice and each time i looked at her she just looked down really fast. and she left pretty soon after that.      i then saw her again on sat but only for about 30 mins cos i couldn't stay at this party for long and when i arrived at the party she came over and talked to me again for a bit but then we got surrounded by a bunch of other ppl and couldn't really continue the convo and then i had to go so i went over and said goodbye and she hugged me and then kept holding onto me (but in one of those weird one armed hanging on hugs not both arms and she didn't really look me in the eye just at the ground) and said 'as if u have to leave already we didn't get to have a d&m like yesterday' but i asked her if shed be at this party nxt sat and she was like 'yeah... well we can go and find a comfy spot (referring to the bed from friday) and d&m then' or something.      now the bad things - i was talking to one of her friends who said she has very high standards and is waiting for a prince charming or some bs (which i definitely am not) and she was drunk both times i saw her and before that i had only seen her sober and her friend was telling me she becomes a lot more talkative and easy to talk to when shes drunk and relies on being drunk to talk to guys (in other words she never seems interested in me when shes sober). and we only talked shortly on facebook and that was about how she had lots of hw and hadnt been online cos she got distracted too easily (she wouldnt care about that if she liked me right?)... also after doing some serious facebook stalking i saw one of her friends left her a comment on sunday asking if soph remembered talking about maybe going on a blind date on sat night and if she was interested in doing it nxt weekend but she replied that she didnt really remember and that she didnt think she was a set up person but maybe one day she would meet up with him because the both have this weird thing in common (cbf explaining but it has to do with how they watch tv in this really weird manner). so yeah this whole thing could just be a product of drunkenness+my imagination. i realise im being obsessive but thats just how i am :) and yeah opinions.....?

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 months now and we are both in the military. He just went away to a special school and asked me to write him while he was gone for 2 weeks. I knew that it would mean alot to him so I wrote him everyday and sent him packages and put alot of effort into it. When he came back he started discussing going to the same duty station to be together and that he would want to live together. Although, since he came back from the training he has been very sketchy. I will call him to talk and he always has to go. He only calls me when it is like midnight and he knows I can't talk long because I have work at 0500. He used to call me at all times of the day just to talk because he missed me and now if we even do talk he is always distracted with something. Then last night he tells me that he needs a little space... I am so confused right now, but I am really crazy about this guy. Help, I have no idea what to think...

20090310045248AAGyyb7	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do when family steals from you.?	I had a large sum of money stolen from me and I thoroughly believe it was one (or both) of my husbands grown up girls who had access to the room it was stolen from.  They came up for the day to help my husband create a resume.  I was gone for the day and my husband says he left the room a few times for different reasons leaving them alone in there.  My husband is totally sickened by this and does not want to believe it, but there is no other explanation as they were the only ones that had access to that room and the money went missing.  Of course, they both deny it.  Should I have gone to the police?  I listened to my mom who said I should drop it as it is family.  This would have been a felony if convicted as it was $900.00.
20090310045324AAc0lSu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he a controlling boyfriend?	I've been with my boyfriend for a year and 2 months and the issue of him being controlling and overly protective has never been much of a big problem until now. I've recently became friends with a guy that I've grown to be somewhat attracted to (I can't deny it). We've talked on AIM and in class for about 2-3 weeks. My boyfriend got kind of jealous after I told him that I talk to this guy at school and on AIM that he actually spied on me in our class. We had an argument about this but didn't really resolve anything. I did the stupidest thing a few days ago and went to this guy's apartment to hang out and play some video games. That was all we did. I told this guy that I had a boyfriend and that my bf gets easily jealous and that I would be in so much trouble if my bf knew I was over at his place. This guy friend tried to help me out and came up with a "great idea" lie to my boyfriend and say that I was napping. I was desperate and so I did that so as to avoid getting him mad again. My boyfriend caught my lie because he spied on me and drove by my house to see if my car was parked in front of the house. We proceeded to have another fight and my bf wanted to break up with me but I didn't want to lose him so I told him that I would do anything for him. We're back together now but I'm not happy about our relationship anymore because he wants me to cut off all communications with this guy friend. My bf told me to never speak to this guy friend on AIM ever again and to block him permanently. He constantly asks me what I'm doing every second. He gets upset when I leave to go back home. He keeps saying that he has a right to spy on me anytime and that I have a lot of making up to do. He tells me that I need to regain his trust. He tells me that I should wear glasses instead of contacts, etc. I feel really tired and annoyed of him behaving this way. I feel guilty because I know it's my fault that I lied to him but it's not like I cheated on him or anything. I was afraid that he'd get mad if I told him the truth so I lied. Now I just feel like his prisoner. I still love him but he made me cut off all contact with my guy friend without any closure. My guy friend ignored me the whole day and hasn't talked to me since. Any advice on what I should do?

20090310050643AAyuJz0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i being selfish or wat?plz answer!?	His dad’s out of work, his mum’s working but they’re still not able to make ends meet. My bf has to teach for like 9 hrs a day to earn enough money to get to college from next year. I know it’s a hard life and it’s something I can’t possibly understand it completely since I’m from a well-to-do family. He’s been working from when he was 14 and now he’s 21.his work hours have been progressively increasing. He manages to make time for me at the end of the day but he’s always really tired out.   I don’t have that many friends and the ones I do have are quire nasty people. They piss me off completely and my days usually end quite badly. He’s the only one in the entire world I trust completely so I like telling him about my problems and stuff just to feel better. But these days his patience levels have gone down like hell and so our usual talks, even 10 min long, usually end in fights.   I hate having no one to talk to. I know he has his family but I hate coming 2nd to everything. He keeps saying he’s earning so much only so that he can become richer and get my parents to like him so they’ll agree to our marriage in the future.   But I can’t help thinking I hate that the present doesn’t matter all that much.   Am I just being selfish?   Plz answer.   Thanks for answering.

20090310051136AADkObC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Know What I Want in  a Girl?	I am currently engaged to a wonderful woman, though our differences make a lasting relationship seem far out of reach.  I love her, though I do not know if it is what I want anymore.  We have our differences and arguments, and sometimes I wish I could just move on.  We have been together for almost four years and I don't know who I really am anymore.  What should I do?

20090310052118AAzhvbn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to take nude pics of a gf?	i just moved to another country and before I left my bf (now ex) took nude photos of me (i never allowed him before until then). he said he wanted something as i keepsake and that he will just look at my nude pics whenever he has urges. We decided to take a break during my 1.5 month away, but I decided to end it with him cos it's too much distraction (I'm very busy with my work) and I don't wanna hang on to false hope cos he hasn't promised me anything. There's no guarantee. And I don't wanna get hurt.      I broke up with him over an email. i wanted to ask him to delete those pics but i didn't dare say it.       The relationship wasn't so serious so it was more out of lust than anything. But i don't wanna get anymore attached cos he's never offered me security, so I just dont feel comfy knowing he still has my nude pics.      he's old and not so computer savvy, so I don't think he will post them on the net.
20090310052239AAa23Qw	Family & Relationships;Family	How do we deal with my brothers?	Okwe are having a bit of a dilema here.My mother is going to be turning 88 this year and so far she has lived longer than anyone in her family. She has some health problems and has been disabled since 1998. My father passed away in 1987 after a long battle with cancer. Since I was the youngest and wasn't married I moved in with my folks after I got out of service and have helped with upkeep and everything on the house and yard and after my dad pawy I made my mom get out and about instead of just staring at four walls all day. Due to severe oseoatheritis in her kness and legs she has been confined to a wheelchair for almost ten years but I put a lift on my van and on my fifthweheell trailer so she could still go with me differant places.A couple ofyears go I was diagnosed with cancer of the Pancreas and Liver and had to take social security disability. Now here is the problem my Mom has a living trust that is set up for the three boys to get the interest of of until we are gone then it goes to the grand children. My mother has decided that since I've stayed with her and taken care of her that I should get a little more out of the estate basically I'd draw 1,000 a month until I die. We know at least one of my brothers is going to pitch a fit over  this but he is able to work and has a wife and kids of his own to look aafter him where I don't so do we tell them now or wait till after mother isone to let the cat out of the bag. They will each get a portion of the sale of this house all her personal items and 3 vehicles as well as 100 grand each, so the only thing affected by her decision is the living trust they will get the interst of thir portion where I'll have a minimum amount comming each month.   So dowe tell them or wait?

20090309154234AARd8pW	Family & Relationships;Friends	SO LOST. CONFUSED. AND JUST PLAIN ANNOYED.?	pre-view   i'm in such a bad situation. so me and one of my guy friends live pretty far away as in a 3 hour plane ride. a couple months ago i started getting more and more feelings for him, more than a friend. we were talking one day and he pulled the "your like a sister to me" i was shocked and i still am. i know that means whatever i feel is just one sided and i need to forget about him like that, but its sooooooo hard he'd s really good friend and he's such a great guy that i don't wanna just forget about him. i'm going down there in a couple of weeks to visit a college i'm def going to be seeing him because he told me he'll come up from college to come see me, but i don't know if i can do it. its gonna be so hard. i'm a wreck and i don't know what to do about it? i don't know how to handle the situation? its makes it all the worse that he pulled the sister card on me a couple days ago and i can't avoid him because i'm going there. what should i do.....(btw he's also my cousins best friend, and me and my cousin are really close hes my brother)      now   so the trip down there could not have been anymore awkward. i was extremely quiet and barely talked to him. and he was like "why are you not talking, you're so boring now" little does he know how uncomfortable i was. we went out on Saturday my cousin, him, my sister, me, and his cousin. we were drinking and i got pretty faded. i basically clung to him all night and he didn't in anyway push me away. my sister said he was pretty much attached to me and was holding me and what not. the next day it was really awkward and we barely talked at all. i texted him before i left telling him thanks for taking care of me and he said it was no big deal he didn't want me to fall or anything.         my sister is convinced that he likes me, but he can't pursue anything because i'm his best friends sister, and the only reason he was holding me and clinging to me was cause i was faded and it would look like he was taking care of me, so my cousin (his best friend) wouldn't get mad.      does this make any sense? i'm not sure i totally believe my sister, then again i don't remember everything except that he walked with me all night.

We finally had sex last night (after 7 weeks) which only last 15 minutes and did nothing for me, i was so upset and mad, I told him thanks for wasting my time and went and slept on the on the couch.

20090225084727AAo5Qwr	Family & Relationships;Family	Question about parental rights?	My sister just had a baby boy this morning, and the guy that she has been dating off and on for the past 2 years, and has been there the whole pregnancy is ready and willing to sign the birth certificate. We know there is a big possibility this baby isn't his, but he doesn't care. He wants to sign the Birth Certificate, and wants 100% responsibility of the baby. My question is once he signs the acknowledgment of paternity, and Certificate does that mean he is the father to this baby. Or if by some chance another guy wants to order a paternity test do they have to agree to it, knowing the birth certificate was already signed, and her boyfriend has take the father figure in the baby's life. And what if something happens to her and the boyfriend. Say they break up. Does my sister have a right to draw child support on the baby through the ex, or will a paternity test be ordered, and another question if something does happen between the 2 of them, and he is on the birth certificate as the father can he fight for custody of this baby? I worry for my little sister, and I don't want her to get herself into a place where she could loose the baby if it came to a custody battle. I want this baby to have a mother and a father, even if that means never knowing who the real father is. I am also concerned that if this guy isn't the father and someone else wants to know if they are or not does that give them rights to a dna test if a signature is already on the birth certificate?

I actually cant even think clearly anymore because of the pressure. I cant even sleep properly...      Ive really had enough of them.  how can i get out of this situation? Im also thinking about getting my own flat..where do i begin? i would love to live in london..somewhere that has affordable flats..

Well, my bf is older than me. we were sitting in my high school autitorium for my little sisters band concert. i started to make out with him because of something that he said. well, my mom saw us and we were keeping the fact that we were dating and she flipped on us. She called the cops but they couldnt do anything because we never had sex. my mom is pissed and is kicking both of us out of the house. i dont think that my bf wants to be with me anymore because of it. i dont know how to tell him that i dont want to live with out him. im afraid that he is going to leave me.

So I love her, there is no woman who I'd like to see become the mother of my children than her. But she's 20, I'm 24. She doesnt know herself. She finds it hard to remain faithful.

20090309153704AAQJzyA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should i move on? I need advice (10 points)!!?	My boyfriend has been hiding a female coworker friend he has since Febuary.My instincts came over me and i had to do some investigating and put 2 and 2 together. When i confronted him he totally denied even knowing her number he did a very good job at it. So i asked here what could be going on and got some great answers.      To be honest i admit that i give him a reason to hide female friends from me because i made it clear to him that i find that disrespectful. But he went on  and did it. I also understand that sometimes guys want a female friend. But when i confronted him it was a big denial.   He calls her most of the time when he comes out from work and the latest he has called was at 2:28 AM.. After reading out lous some of the answers i was given from here to him,  Finally he comes true to me and tells me that he  has been speaking with a female friend and that there is no sex,flirting,hanging around, is just conversations. And that he hid her from me because of my reactions and i would nag about it.. I called her today and talked nicely and asked her what type of relationship did she and my boyfriend has. I told her who my boyfriend was and i hear her and a friend in the background say illllllll!!! and they laugh. She tells me that there is nothing to worry about that they are just friends and that she was a lesbian, has two kids and a baby daddy.       He told me that he will end the relationship with her because he loves me and does not want to loose me.  I feel confused and need the best advice. Thanks

20090309153458AANWQtZ	Family & Relationships;Family	I've honestly wrecked everything?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309153520AAuuYGw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do in this situation? is it the worst case of denial?	Thanks for any help with this one...      the thing is, much to my surprise, me and my best friend (who is also a girl) fell in love with eachother 7 years ago. We didn't expect this as we never had been with girls before hand, so it was a bit of a shock.      The thing is, she could never except the relationship in the open as she was scared of what people would say as her gay sister has been disowned by her family.      so after 5 years, she got engaged and moved in with a man. we carried on seeing eachother for a while but that stopped as she said that she didnt think her relationship would work with me around and she loved me but had to forget me to move on with this man,      I tried to move on too, and saw other people...but after a year of not seeing her, i still felt the same about her.      I had a phonecall in tears from her on Saturday...the first time in a year, and she was saying that she has slept on the sofa for the past year and she doesnt have sex with her fiance...and that she has tried to forget me but she can't.      She wont split with her fiance as she is too scared, but she is miserable and is making him miserable, and me.      I'm not sure what I can do is its breaking my heart as it doesnt make sense if two people love eachother but are not together....but she wont leave him as she said that he makes it look like she is straight...      Has anybody got any ideas?      thanks loads

20090225083844AAPLlwg	Family & Relationships;Friends	PLS. HELP! How do you know when a friendship has ended?	How do you know when a friendship has ended?   Hi guys! I have a friend whom I pretty much considered as a brother, as I though I was to him (I Think). And last year, we were pretty close, he was the one I shared everything about, and I was the first one he shared stuff too as well. I did everything, I did my best in fact, to make sure that I was deserving of that title "brother". I've gone to him at two, one o clock in the morning at great risk from my parents just to help in his assignments and the like...Heck, I've even made his thesis proposal, including the intro, scope, and importance...(But then again, I like those kind of things, simply because I knew that, for the first time in my life, a person needed my help.) But now, well, he ignores me...For about two or more months now the only long conversation we've had through text was him asking whether or not he could borrow my final output in a duty I had, and that was in January (which I readily complied to)...The rest, the how-do-you-dos, what-are-you-doing, and the like, he ignores...He doesn't invite me to drink or to even talk, nor does he go to our usual place to hang-out. He now has a friend you see, an older friendship, whom he shares and confides stuff too now, and the one that he now invites and spends time with (Due to their both having the same problems, and with the same girl). But every time we see each other at school, he hugs and greets me like nothing happened...I know that he's busy, or that he has girl problems, but for two and a half months?! It hurts like hell, but I just want to be sure...How do you know when a friendship has ended? And what do I do Here? Pls.help...

Basically...I DONT HAVE A LIFE   i can never argue with my dad, i never have in my life, i have to follow his pathetic rules, even my mum does, and my mum is so pathetic to marry a man like him!! who orders her around!!       what should i do? its not fair i watch every teenager i know is having fun, and living the life!       so my question is " why dont i have the right to do what all average teenagers do?"          VERY UNFAIR I MUST SAY, i dont want to be like my brother or my parents who just sit in the home, sleep, eat, sit, and carry on the whole process!!      i would apreciate an answer from any 1 out there, including parents.
20090225084141AA2QB0w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should or stay or should I go?	My girlfriend of just short of a year is 24, and I'm 31.  We are pretty serious, and have previously committed to each other, but have had a pretty rocky relationship.  Yesterday, my girlfriend broke up with me because she somehow has convinced herself that she is unable to have children.  She told me that she knows that sometime in my future I will be wanting a child (which I do, and don't necessasarly want to adopt),  and says she doesn't want to get 5-10 years in to our relationship, and then have me break up with her because she can not have my baby.  She then told me that I need to make a decision, but though I do understand where she is coming from,  I don't want to leave her now... but I do want a kid in the future, and I'm pretty sure she won't let me have one with someone else.... so what do I do?

20090225084550AA00fL4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I forget her?	My girlfriend has no more feeling to me. She doesn't love me anymore, everytime I ask her to go out, she always rejects. Through her action, it makes me see inside her mind. So I decided to stop our relationship and she didn't say a word when I told her about this.      I am very sad because still love her. We are working in one place and it's hard to forget her since I see her everyday. Please advise what I have to do to forget her easily?

20090225084719AADbWzM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has my boyfriend lost interest in our relationship.  Is he looking for something else?	We have been dating for 6 months.  It has been a rocky relationship.  First, he was emotionally unavailable and commitment shy.  Also, he was still talking to his ex wife, and his 20 year old daughter had issues with him seeing a woman.  We have  overcome these hurdles to an extent.  But lately, he has withdrawn and doesn't seem to want to put any energy into our relationship.  A few weeks ago, I came across some emails to another woman in which he was telling her he had been chasing a woman for awhile, but she turned out to be a dud.  He tells her he misses her.  She replies she missed him to and called him "My cowboy".  He swears it was just harmless flirting, but there are other signs too.  We have had a strong sexually healthy relationship, and he has degressed in this area drastically.  Not only does he not make advances or loving touch me very often, but he rejects my advances.  We still have sex, but it's not as often or as loving.  Admittidly, I do worry and obsess about what he's doing, and I know it's driving him crazy.  But he's given me plenty of signs and signals.   He does really strange things, like get up in the middle of the night, set his alarm for  the middle of the night , and on occasion leaves. The last 2 mornings in a row, when his alarm goes of in the morning, He has reset it for 9:30, when I questioned him about it, he became defensive and told me he was still asleep, It was just a coincidence  that it was for 9:30 both times, and I was crazy.  On the other hand, we spend alot of time together, he calls everyday, and we're together most nights.   He tells me he loves me and I believe he does, but my instincts are telling something's wrong.  He spends hours at a time on the computer instead of going to bed.  I don't know what he's doing, and he's secretive about his emails.  Two of our friends have had dreams that he was with another woman and dumped me.  I don't believe that these dreams are neccessarilly true, but I wonder if they see signs that I am trying to ignore and these dreams are a result of that.  Confused.

20090225084952AAgbYJQ	Family & Relationships;Family	What's wrong with my little brother?	Ok, so my 16 year old brother's being skipping a lot of school recently and taking drugs, drinking too much etc. It's all a bit scary.      Yesterday my mum said he was going to tell her what was wrong, what had happened, but then he chickened out at the last minute and decided not to tell. But today he did tell her.      I told her not to tell me, because I would be upset if she told him something like that about me. But I'm worried and I want to know what's wrong. She said "It will have to come out in the open anyway" and that I would find out sooner or later, and "It's not a bad thing".      What do you think it might be?

20090225085513AATf8xy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need serious relationship advice?	Ok, so I have been engaged since late Decemeber to the guy that I truly thought I was going to marry.    This past saturday he told me that he had a work meeting at 4pm and that he would be back at my place by 7pm to hang out... well at around 8 I still hadn't heard from him so I called his cell and got no answer. At about 9 I called his work and talked to a co-worker only to find out that there never was a meeting. So I continued to call his cell phone and he accidentally answered and I heard a girl talking... she said "just answer it then", and he said "no, it's my exgf... she won't leave me alone... i don't want to talk to her"... and that was it. So I got REALLY upset and text him and said that's it... I heard everything. Well, he called me around 10 telling me that he was out with some work friends, but didn't want me to know because he knew I would be upset. He said the girl was some girl that he met that night (which I think is weird because why would she be in his business about who he is talking to?)... and he also said they were at a restaurant just drinking and talking... a resaurant for 4 hrs?? And if that's where he was then why didn't I hear any background noise when he accidentally answered?      I was so upset... we talked about things and he said that he just needed time to himself to "think"... to decide if this is really what he wants because "forever is a long time"...   For whatever reason... I'm still sitting around waiting for an answer from him... everytime we talk he tells me that he DOES want to be with me, but he's not sure if it will lead to marriage... he says he just needs time to himself to "think"... I don't understand! If you love someone... you will be with them! I am so frusterated with myself... I just want answers! He told me he loved me last night, but just to give him time...      What does that mean??? What should I do???

20090225090625AAfO9mV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What can you gather from this?	Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but being the bride, I thought this was a little weird....      My fiancee finally convinced my future sister in law to go try on the bridesmaid dress we picked out to see how she liked it and what size to get.      It's on a Monday, which I work.  But, my co-worker suggested I tag along on my lunch.  I was thrilled, and brought this to my fiancee's attention.  He, too, loved the idea.      Then, to just make sure, he texted my FSIL.  She responded with "Less is best"  and my fiancee again stated "So, would you rather it just be you and me?" and again, she said "Less is best".      Am I in the wrong here to think that was a little rude?  I know she didn't come out and say she didn't want me there, but I get that vibe...

I just don't see him in the way. He agrees that we can be friends, regardless. Every time I mention on myspace that I have a date, to a girlfriend, he snoops on my page and then he will be like, "So, you are going out with a guy this weekend?" and he even has the nerve to ask me after I go out with a guy, he always ask "how did it go?, or what did you guys do?" Almost like it is stalking in a way and it makes me feel uncomfortable. In my situation, is this normal? Because it is pushing me away from my friend.

20090227144128AAPkWwp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do girls really care about personality more than looks or is it a bunch of garbage?	My personality is great.  I have only had one girlfriend, but she turned out to be a fake.  It seems as though most girls will say personality matters, but if someone who is taller, muscular, and more handsome comes along they grab their attention right away.  This is based on personal experiences not only with me, but my friends also.  I am on the shorter and skinnier side so this might be a problem for me in the future if all girls are this shallow.  Before anyone throws anything at me, no I don't care about looks.  My one girlfriend I had many people would make fun of her because of her looks, but I liked her inside (at least initially).  Thanks for any honest answers.
20090227144229AAqpWD8	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i become better friends with this guy?	I got off on the wrong foot with a friend of a friend (Sam). I mean, we started out (in the beginning of the year) hating each other. Sam it two years older than I am, and though I was insane- because I am a girl and I had too much energy. Over time, we've learned to put up with each other, and we aren't bother by the other as much.       But I think we can be friends. Sam's a great guy and we're so alike. We're both stubborn, are quick to judge, short and have a great sense of humor. I think that if we gave each other a chance, we could be good friends.    How can I strike up a friendship with Sam? He's the kind of guy you want to be friends with.    All advice and answers appreciated! Thanks!
20090309165145AA3xc4y	Family & Relationships;Family	Please tell me how this is fair?	Me and my sister both really want to go to Florida to visit our grandparents over spring break. Well, my sister's 16, she has a job, and she's paying for her plane ticket down there. Me on the other hand am only 14, and no place in my town is hiring 14 year olds. And it's too late to get a job and make enough money since spring break is in 3 weeks and plane tickets are a few hundred dollars. Anyways, my sister is allowed to go to Florida since she's paying. And my parents won't let me...money isn't an issue...they said it wasn't money...they just...won't let me go! I haven't done anything bad to make them not let me go, my dad just said "Oh well, you went last spring break (A FREAKING YEAR AGO) and you don't need to see them again right now." WTF? So, my sister can see them, but I can't. That makes sense. I'm really sad and mad about it, because I really like spending time with them, it's not because of disney world and the beach and all that. That's one of the reasons I like going so much, but I really like being with them also. And I can't get a job! I'm 14! And it's too late! How is this fair?

20090309161007AATlf9G	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it better to speak out or remain silent?	I've found that people say they want you to "keep it real" with them and be honest with them but when you do, they don't really appreciate it.      When I have a problem with my friends I always tell them about it through phone, letter, or in person. I tell them straight up (in a tactful manner) how I feel and they almost always get offended and on the defense.      Is it better to just keep things to yourself and try to ignore problems or is it better to tell your friends when somethings bothering you...even if it means they will be mad at you and look at you differently?

20090225090655AApj2iE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend wants to take Adderall?	My friend at university was talking about getting Adderall to help her stay awake late at night when shes cramming or doing essays. She also mentioned it will lower her weight as well in time for the summer ball at our university. Couldn't she become addicted? Also, what can I say to her to put her off? Aside from saying its addictive, as she seems very set on it. I just don't want her to drop dead because she took too many milligrams (I've read up that you can get it in 5,10,15,20,25 and 30 mg tablets O_o) of whatever is in them. I'm panicking that it could give her a heart attack or something equally frightening. She has no parents that I can mention this to, as her parents passed away when she was 15 and she lived with her sister (Who has now moved to the US) until she was 18. Can anyone offer me some advice on how to approach her, or if I really can't stop her then maybe some signs I should watch out for if she is dumb enough to take it? I'm really scared that shes going to get really hurt by taking something she doesn't need.
20090225085926AAAqGCe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just move in with my boyfriend? Help with this please?	I will be 20 yrs old on friday. My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. I "live" at home..meaning my stuff is there, but I go straight to my boyfriends house everyday after work, go home (my moms) in the mornings to take a shower/get ready for work and then do this all over again. On the weekends I never go home unless I need more clothes, stuff like that. I even take my dog with me. I cook dinner at my boyfriends every night, and help pay his electricity/water/rent every now and then if he needs help. My mom does not support me financially, except for my car insurance,which doesn't really count bc my car added to her insurance plan actually makes her plan cheaper.      SO, the thing is... I have always said I wouldn't move in with a guy until the day we got married. And many people in my family (my grandparents in particular) look down on living arrangements like this..to the point where if I move in with him before we're married, my grandfather is going to treat me completely different and make it very clear to everyone that I'm a disappointment to the family. However, the older I get the more I realize that my decisions are MY decisions and I need to stop worrying so much what people think about them. But its not just my family stopping me...for some reason I just keep telling myself "you're too young for this...you're not old and wise enough..etc". My boyfriend is about to move into a new house and he really wants me to move in with him - ALL the way. I don't know what's stopping me from moving my stuff over there and making it official.       So what do all of you think I should do? Do you think 19 is too young to make a decision like this?

20090309155751AAYArqH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Just need a little advice.....?	My girlfriend of almost two years left very suddenly without any explanation.This was 9 months ago.

Why not just call or email me direct ???
20090227151322AAv9vX2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could you be serious about someone who was the best lover, but not so bright?	Would you want a lifetime of the best sex and affection you could hope for, with a person with a simplistic world-view?       Or would you give that up, and seek an intellectual equal, even if you knew your sex life would not be as rewarding?      This is a very real dilema in my life.
20090227145537AAcJlB9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I filed a motion to quash child support and my ex filed an opposition. Should I file against the opposition?	I need to know this becouse the other party said I never paid any support until my wages were garnished but that is false. The things the other party said in it were really crude & all untruthful. As a matter of fact, my child is almost 19 & she continues to receive support. It will not stop until my employer receives an order to stop it. Anyone with this sort of knowledge, I sure would appreciate hearing feedback on this as we go to court soon & this is for the state of Nevada.

20090225091147AAeJHyM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Death- such a hard concept..?	I just found out that two of my friends died last night in a car wreck. They were also my boyfriend's best friends, and I had to break the news to him. He took it so hard- we all did. I just want to give a bit of a tribute to all my friends that have died, that I didn't get to say goodbye to, and hope that it will give me a bit of closure. Some of these things that will make no sense are inside jokes, so if anybody gets offended, I'm sorry.       And thank you for reading this tribute.          THE GOOD ONES DIE YOUNG:   **Cole Parker**   age: 15yrs   cause of death: car wreck   year: 2004      Cole, you were such an amazing friend. You took me under your wing when I first came to our school, and you taught me that no man is worth my tears, and the ones that are wouldn't make me cry. You were the big brother that I never had. When your momma died, the strength that you carried gave me hope, and strength. I wish I had half the strength that you did. I miss you Cole Andrew Parker. Your truly buried in my heart. In all of your friends hearts. You had such an amazing impact on so many lives.....I miss you.      **Brady Alexander**   age: 21   cause of death: gunshot to the head   year: 2005      Brady, oh how I rejoiced the day that your murderers were sentenced to life in prison. But that glory hardly compared to the dispair of everyone that had the chance to know you. And those who did, we know how lucky we are. You, too, were an amazing guy, and those who think otherwise obvisiouly never took the time to understand your twisted sense of humor. I miss you brady.      "Dr." Drew   age: 15   cause of death: drowning   year: 2006      Drew, my only friend in Agriculture. Thank you for making me laugh when I was feeling down. You always wanted to help everyone, which eventually lead to your death. You're such a hero for jumping into the river to save that girl, but not even the strongest hero can out swim the currents that pull you under. I miss you and wish we would've had more classes together so that I could've known you better.      **Lakin Garrett**   age: 16   cause of death: suicide   year:2008      Ahhh, my sexxy butt twin. Nobody can pull off those non-exsistence butts like we could. I'm so glad that I had the privilige to call you my bestie. I carry so much guilt in my heart because I never detected how much you were struggling with day to day life. You were such a good secret keeper...Nobody expected this...nobody. I wish I could go back, and look harder. Maybe then I could be there for you, and be the shoulder that could soak up all your tears. Maybe I could help you to see that killing yourself is not the way to go. Maybe I could help carry your burdens, and then maybe you would still be here. I think to myself all the time how I called myself your best friend, but I wasn't there for you like besties are suppose to be. I should played my bestie role better...but that's the thing about life. No matter how much you hope, and wish, you can't change the past. I still have our notebook. I've tried to read it, but it hurts too bad. I'm still not ready....but I will frame every page in due time. I miss you my precious lakin, my sexxy butt twin.      **Desire Blood**   age: 20   cause of death: house fire   year: 2008      Desire, you were so young, and your death was tragic. After your death, I swore to God that my lips would never touch a cigerette. I didn't know you as well as I would have like, but I'm glad we had the time together that we did. Even though I hate that you passed, I'm glad that you did with your baby, so that little Zyler wouldn't have to grow up without his mommy, and you wouldn't have to leave this earth without your world. Everyone's heart still goes out to you.      **Kadem Ray**   age: 18   cause of death: drowning   year: 2008      Haha, Kadem. I had the biggest crush on you and still plan on naming my baby after you. You made me feel beautiful when nothing else did. You had such a way with words. Every time I see a hat with the letter D on it, you insintely pop in mind. I hate that your son is going to grow up without knowing his wonderful father. But I promise, every story that I can ever remember will be told to him. I miss you Kadem.      **Mark Vanderpool**   age: 19   cause of death: car wreck/ drowning   year: 2009 (early this morning)      Mark, Mark, Mark....What am I gonna do with you boy? How is the world going to turn now that you're gone? You made the most horrible things fun, and nobody, nothing will ever take your place. You laughed constantly...to be honest about it...I couldn't understand half the things you were saying because you were always laughing when you were talking. And I will never forget the time you and Chad wanted to ride desperado, and jumped all the way over that horse and fell off on the other side. How both of ya'll did that, I'll never know. Mark, you're dearly missed.      **Chad "Weak-*****"   age: 15yrs -so close to 16-   cause of death: car wreck/ drowning   year: 2009 (early this morning)      Chad Wea

20090309161501AAMEj6K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does She Like Me? (Could I get any more cliche?)?	Here is my story.  I have NEVER had a girlfriend (not because I can't get one but because my standards are HIGH and as soon as I get attached to someone I leave them).  There is this girl that I see in the lunch line everyday.  And let me tell you, she is ADORABLE.  I can catch her looking at me if I look at her.  I haven't spoken to her or know her name.  BUT, I know she is good friends with a friend of mine.  So, I'm thinking about asking my friend what her name is.  I assume me asking this will result in her telling the girl that I am attracted to.      Do you guys think I should go for it?  I mean, I think she is really cute, but I am so frequently disappointed with girls who are already in a relationship.
20090227150649AAs98Jk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Losing interest in boys????	I started talking to a guy who is older than me last august. I started liking him alot and we went on a few dates. We talked on the phone all the time, so we were basically dating. It was great but then we just started drifting apart. Actually it was him who started getting distant and we gradually just stopped talking last month. I was kind of relieved but also sad and wanted him back.       And now my problem is that I have no interest in boys. I am positive that i am not a lesbian, but ever since this guy, i am just not interested in anyone else. Before him, i was completely boy crazy, but now even when really attractive guys ask me out, i have no interest in going out with them. I have no idea whats wrong with me? Does anyone know why i am like this all of a sudden?? I really need some advice??

Just recently she told her ex that she still has feelings for him.      She tells me the reason she is marrying me is because she is in love with me and she could herself.   In the same conversation she had with her ex, she told him she didn't know why she was marrying me and wasn't even sure if we were still going to go through with it.      She tells me how miserable she was with her ex and how he tried to change her (tried to get her stop smoking, drinking and clubbing)   She tells him if she had it all to do over again there are a few things she would change.      She tells me I'm a God send to her and that she is blessed to have me.   I know for a fact she said the same thing to him when they were together.      Now I love this woman and she says she loves me...she accepted my proposal. She seems to be very happy and tells me the same. If this were you, would this confuse you? I know when I sit down and talk with her about this, I may not like her answers but I want to make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions...

20090309162948AAyUSAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is swear, this is so annoying. Please answer.?	So, I live with my boyfriend, so we were just sitting around doing nothing, until I saw him being completely shocked. It looked like he was about to hit me in the ******* face, I was just like wtf? What's wrong with him? Then he just said "Oh I thought those were hickys." My neck looked like it had hickys on it. It worries me somehow how jealous he gets. He's become really protective and uptight about cheating and stuff. He doesn't even let me drink. I think it may just be because we get into a lot of fights, I don't show him a lot of affection, and I don't show him that I can be trusted since I just kissed another guy last week by accident. I'm not a cheater, but how do I show him that he does not have to be jealous and violent?

Ive heard stories from my mother in law of all the emotional abuse he has caused the family.I get along fine with my mother in law. its my father in law that needs an attitude check. He is 80years old and an a retired air force person. All he likes to do is go onto his computer and be on there all day long. He has a woodshop busniess that he trys to do professionly. My MIL is retired. But what i dont like about her is she smokes. And when i get sick the smoke makes me sicker. I try to tell her nicely please stop smoking try smoking outside or smoke in the air vent in the kitchen. And my nosy FIL yells at me saying " Stop attacking my WIFE" and im like im not attacking her im asking her to stop smoking for the sake of everyones lives. The doctors have told her she needs to stop smoking cuz she has a small hole in her heart caused from smoking. and whats worst is my FIL buys her the cigerettes. And i attacking her or should i just keep my p's and q's ps i cant move out since we have alot of debt plus paying my IN LAWs 400 a month rent
20090309162919AAZKxi3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I keep on thinking my mom's gonna die?	Hey, I'm 14 years old (male) and I love my mom SOO much. We are best friends and very close, she always helps me with my homework, buys me anything I want, we hug each other every day, and share our emotions. I keep on thinking that she is gonna be gone... If she ever dies, I may commit suicide. I wouldn't know WHAT to do... Can you please tell me why this is happening?!?! Thanx..
20090227144730AAjvbnW	Family & Relationships;Friends	Sometimes my best friend gets on my nerves!?	Okay so I love my best friend to death! But sometimes she gets on my ******* nerves. She is very different then most people, she's not mentally retarded or anything but she is crazy and does weird things. I guess she just wants everyone to pay attention to her, and I try my hardest to stay focussed on her but like when I'm talking to some one else for like 2 seconds she starts screaming and running around. Lots of people are scared of her but not me. We are so close and I love her to death. She just sometimes gets on my nerves. What do I do?
20090227145730AA3zc8Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it normal to be this jealous?	I'm grounded this weekend, but all my friends are hanging out and I'm getting really jealous. I got a little mad at lunch because they kept talking about it, even though I told them to stop. Shoul I really be this jealous? I get so bored all the time it gives me times to think about these things, which makes me even more jealous. What could I do to maybe get my mind off of it?

20090309161913AAFhS4k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Career or Relationship?	Let's say you had to make a choice between your career and someone you love.  When I say career, I don't mean some 9-5 office job.  I mean something like professional boxer, CEO of leading edge engineering firm, the next Ghandi etc...      If you had to choose one which forces you to sacrifice the other for the rest of your life...which would you choose?  Hollywood and fairy tales would have you believe love is more important.  But what does reality have to say about it?  Isn't the story of Scrooge just antiquated propaganda?

20090309160139AAGCeYY	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm 13 and have a very bad relationship with my mom...(WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG!!!)?	OK... This is pretty long, but I will try to make it as simple as I can...      So, ever since my mom got married to my step-dad in November 2008, my mom and I have had (and still have) relationship problems. I don't like my step dad at all. My hatred for him is so unbelievable that you don't even want to see the thoughts that I want to happen to him. This is because he has caused my only 2 siblings, that I was very close to, to leave the house and now both my brother (or siblings) hate our step-dad AND OUR MOTHER. My mom chose to represent his side and not stand up for us. She has a greater love for this man. One day, my little brother's teacher called our mom and said that he was behaving very poorly in school and class. When my little brother got home that day (when he was living with us last year), my mom and step-dad beated him with their hands and a belt. I would hear my little brother scream and his body bang against the wall as hard as you can imagine. On that same day, my little brother was so mad that he decided to go live with our dad (whom lives near Fort Lauderdale, FL). Before all this occured, my parents got divorced and my father moved out on my 11th birthday (May 17). OK. Let's skip to this year... So, sometime last week, I was working on my homework on my mom's computer until I came across some photos. When I looked at them, I was so in shock that I couldn't believe it. They were pictures of nude, old people and my mom and step-dad were in them/it!!! I saw my mom sucking other guys dick(s), being eaten out by other men and women. I even saw here posing naked in our jacuzzi!!! My mom never was like that/this until she met my step-dad. I always looked up to her as a big influence in my life until I saw those pictures. Now I think of her in disgust and as a **** and whore and everything bad. I get so mad when I look at her face and when ever she touches me (kiss, hug, handshake, etc.). She gives out the worst punishments ever! My cell phone is my life and my biggest protection. Where I live... It's very unpredicatable. There are a lot of creepy, old(er) guys that watch girls walk home after school and I have a big fear of getting raped. She could at least take away my radio or computer or something. And now when I look at the future, I see that it is horrible. I want a good future. If I do the same thing that my little brother did, which was move out and move to my dad's house and live with them, then I will be able to start thinking positive and do every thing to have a brilliant future. But I feel as if I can't do that if I continue to live down here. My step-dad kicked my oldest brother, of 21 years, out when he was 19-20 years old. My brother is stuggling as of today and I feel so bad for him. He wants to go to college and get a good job, but he's so low of money. I am so pissed with both my mom and step-dad. I want to tell her, "EITHER I GO OR HE GOES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THE SH** HERE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD ANY MORE!!! IT'S NOT FAIR THAT LUKE AND MATTHEW DON'T HAVE TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND FACE THIS CR** EVERYDAY!!! I WANT OUT!!!". Did I mention that they both argue everyday, non-stop, over the stupidest things?! It's so rediculous that I can't even barely find the love in that relationship. Anyways, I went to school today and got some transaction papers for me to move to a school that is closer to my dad's house because after I finish FCAT this month, I'm going to try to make this mission successful. I want out and I am so for real. I'm done with what I'm going through today. My mom has countinously gotten worser. She doesn't cook, clean, lazy. Everything oppostite that a good mother is like. I don't know what to do. Should i just leave forever and not talk to her anymore or just deal with reality?

My ex broke up with me last thursday, but we still text and talk on the phone...and we are in all of the same classes for our major. Last night I said that I agreed with the break up, he said "oh..this is new...you agreeing" and said yeah that I need time and he needs time, but that if somewhere down the road we get back together then cool, if not thats cool too. He said "well I am not going to say never..." and i said really...he said "I dont burn bridges, but it prolli wont be soon."      WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?      Yes I totally want to get back together but does it really sound like he does or is he just being nice. He is NOT the kind of guy to lead anyone on. And when he broke up with me he said that he still loved me, but that we just fight all the time....which we did lately. I told him try one more time, he said no...but now hes saying he "doesnt want to burn bridges" and that "it prolli wont be soon"      HELP

My wife has been trying to make difficult my life since the separation (even when she was the one leaving the house). I see my children regularly in the weekends and yesterday my oldest son (4 years old) told me that he is going to a therapist (a talking doctor he said to me) I asked my ex and she said that she is taking both kids to the therapist starting several months ago. She does not want to tell me the names of the doctors. I just want to be involved in my kids life but she won't tell me anything. I believe she is trying to make me look as a monster or something.  What do you think I can do? I believe that the therapist should contact me but maybe my wife is telling him or her something bad about me...I don't know what to do. Please help. Thanks.

20090309160630AALDw7l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I move on after I found my husband had an affair?	I had to move away for a job for 6 months at the end of 2007. At that time we were just married for about a little more than a year. Our first year was kinda rough and we argued over small silly things very often. But I always thought that things would get better as time goes by. Long story short. I went back to visit him twice. The second time, last May, was for his graduation and I found out that he was having an affair w/ a female friend when I was away. Evidence was solid and he couldn't deny it. He apologized again and again, and hoped we could work things out together. I love him a lot and I miss how much fun we used to have when we were together. So I decided to stay with him and we moved out of that town together in one month and started our new life together. It's been a year, but I still think of the affair every now and then, and it tears me apart every single time. I found out about the affair from their IM history by accident and ever since then every word they said is like a nightmare, torturing me. It's so hard to forget and not to get angry every time I think of it. My husband has been very nice, sweet, and caring like before. I know from the bottom of heart that he really wants to make our relationship work. It's my problem that I couldn't move on. It's harder than I imagined. The feeling of being betrayed by someone I love so dearly is like a burden in my heart. What can I do or what should I do to move on and live happily like my husband and I were used to?

20090309161559AAkOqmY	Family & Relationships;Family	Why must they be so over protective?	My parents split a few years ago, and my mom is the the one who has full custody except for when my dad comes out on some weekends. So because she doesnt have another parent to confide in she always asks my uncle about stuff like "is Catheryne old enough to go on Face book, give me the ups and downs" then since my uncle is like a computer whiz hes all like " face book isnt safe because of these bajillion reasons" ( i must say these reasons i think are pretty stupid, there like "your friends could leave there facebook on and then there friends that you dont know could steal your identity!") and im like what the? and then my mom believes everything he says, and when i tell her that my dad think its ok, shes like well i still have to think its ok too. and it really annoys the crap out of me, like serioulsly she believes everything my uncle says but not my actual dad? hes a guardian to right? Well anyways, i was just like whatever, my dad thinks its okay and plus their reasons are stupid, so i was trying to get a facebook acount, but then it was blocked! The site was blocked! I knew that my uncle had did some funny stuff because before i couldnt go on youtube, and other sites with viruses, but seriously, i wonder if he did this on purpose! I would be so mad! when i had asked him about youtube, hes was like "maybe your mom can fix it" and i was so mad. like seriously he doesnt have to be so protective of me, hes not even my dad! my mom listens to him and not my own father! i hate him.My brother has facebook, so why cant i? its so unfair. Its like she confides in everything about us to him it annoys me. Am i over reacting? do you think he was just trying to be nice when he was blocking out the viruses? or is this some evil plot? And what should i do about this situation?

Hey, I'm a good and cool guy and a good looking guy and have been with all younger or women my own age my whole life. I'm 23 I'm looking to have a relationship with an older women, preferably like 26-36. I have no clue what to say to start a conversation just out of no where in like a random place. The only thing is I don't want a women too mature, because I'm not real mature for my age. I mean I act mature but the things I like and stuff. Like I still watch cartoons, and I'm kind of a big geek ha ha.        I need to know what to say?    and what they like?    are any older women even into young guys?   would they be into me, or just be freaked out?   would they be freaked if I tried to seduce them? Or would they like it, even if i didn't know her that well?

20090309114411AAlDsIE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just looking for a problem? She said yes.?	If you have read some of my past post you should know I have trouble when it comes to talking to girls. Well you don't have to read them I am telling you that.       So for a really REALLY long time I have had a crush on a girl I who works in the office (well its a lab) right by where I work.       Long story short I have wanted to ask her out for a long time, and normally when I tried I would chicken out, so finally today I did it, I asked her out, not even so much that I wanted her to say "yes" but I wanted to prove I was not afraid of hearing "no." My friend was saying I was being a coward and I wanted to prove them wrong.       So I asked her out and she said "Sure." And she said it with such ease too. Like she barely had to think about. I think I am in far more shock that she said "yes" than I would have been if she said "no."      My fear is.... how could it possible be this easy? She never really sent me signals before that she was interested, sometimes she would ignore me. I probably would not even have asked her out if my friend did not say give me an ultimatum of "just do it, or I will do for you."      I feel like I am missing something, like there has to be something terribly wrong about this situation and I am just too blind to see it.      Am I worrying for no reason, or do you think there could be something, and if so what?
20090309124206AANpa3R	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did I do the right thing?	I have this EX-best friend. Her name is Amber. We are no longer friends because she's bossy, mean, and too controlling. But I still love her and I miss her a lot, but at the same time, I just hate her and never wanna see her face again. I don't know if I want to ever trust her again. Now that me and her aren't friends anymore, she has been doing really mean things. She has been making up rumors about me, sending my house prank calls, and everything a mean girl could do. But I realized that she's doing all of that stuff because she misses me and she doesn't wanna show it.      Today in science class, I wrote her a note saying, "If you have anything you want to say to me, then call me today. You really need to stop talking about me because your not making yourself look any better. I still care about you as a person, and I want things to be good between us. Call me if you want."      She hasn't called yet.      Should I just move on and forget her? i don't know what to do. Because if I'm her friend then she won't talk crap about me anymore.       When you love someone, you wanna believe their good, and I can't stop forcing myself to believe she's good. But she's not good. I'm so confused right now. Help? :(
20090309115312AAWUB8l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Leave husband or not.  What would you do?	My husband and I have been married for 2 1/2 years, during which, he was deployed to Iraq for 15 months. He's also a wonderful father to our 16 month old little girl.      Since he got back from Iraq a year ago everything has been different. I realize that after 15 months of separation we wouldn't go back to the same little life we had before the deployment...we magically became parents somewhere in there too. But we changed it ways I didn't anticipate. He's become more easily angered, closed off, and just plain mean. I find myself looking forward to him leaving for work. And when he comes home I become immediately stressed and extremely emotional. He didn't used to say things just to be mean, but now it’s a daily occurrence. I've been miserable for months and not one day has passed without me thinking of leaving him.  My husband has repeatedly told me that we don't have any problems and doesn't think counseling is necessary.  I have talked to my husband...many times, over many months. I've done it calmly, I've gotten angry, I've cried...nothing I say to him seems to get through. I tried again the day before yesterday and was so calm it surprised even me. I told him how miserable I am...I have been. I told him I'm highly considering leaving. He looked shocked, but said nothing. I just felt nothing...not sad, angry...just tired of having to tell him the same thing over and over again and never have it sink it.  He knows I'm on the brink of leaving him and asks me not to go, but does nothing to show me he wants me to stay. I don't want to raise my daughter in a home where her parents are constantly fighting or ignoring each other.      I’m a stay-at-home mom right now (he’s Army) and I don’t know how I’d support my daughter and myself if I did leave.  My lack of finances are keeping me here right now.  And fear…I’m afraid of doing something so huge before I know I’ve given my marriage all I got.  I just don’t know what I have left to give…   Should I stay?  Would you leave?

20090309062600AAAQ63k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like my best friends boyfriend!?!?	My best friends name is Briana. She is going out with Ricky. She asked him out last Friday. So they've only been together 4days or so. Before they were going out. I told her I liked him and I still do. Then she asked me to ask him out for her. He said maybe. Then later that day he told my other friend that it was a yes. So they are official. She offered him a chocolate, he took it. They walk home together from after school, because he lives one block away from her. They haven't hugged, kissed or held hands. Today in GYM, I got pared with him. We had to do an exercise where we had to hold hands and try to push each other off balance. That's what we did. He and I both started laughing because we couldn't push each other off. We did the exact same thing. We had so much fun during that exercise. But Briana kept on looking at us every 5seconds. I think she just doesn't want anyone near him...you know. I know for a fact he was flirting with me because he was saying stuff like. You suck and then teasing me about other stuff..but not in a mean way. We made eye contact a couple of times and he smiled and started trying to push me off balance. Even if he knew I liked him. He wouldn't go for me. He's too nice to dump someone for another. But that's not bothering me. It's just...it feels awkward having a good laugh with my best friends boyfriend....who I coincidentally like. Do you think he might like me back? or was he just being friendly. I really don't know. But I feel guilty every time I talk to him or something. She is always staring at me if I'm 1meter close to him. Things are getting really awkward. What should I do?
20090309123048AAr1ST9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this lad?	i'd known this lad a while, we were pretty close and i'd never really considered liking him in a "more than a friend" way. i introduced him to a close girlfriend of mine, and it was obvious that he liked her straight away.   and now im insanely jealous :/   they've met a few times, and he was telling me that she's been distant and stuff.   he came round to mine, and i honestly had no intention of anything happening. but we kinda got together..   now i can't stop thinking about him, even thought it's obvious he's still hung up on her.   She's got no intention of anything happening between them, as she's basically just messing him around, but i don't think i should tell him incase he thinks i'm some jealous psycho! :) So not only am i hung up on him, i'm also so p****d that she's hurting him.      should i just leave it? :/

20090309090806AAkFsKG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will I always be just a good guy friend to girls?	All my like I have been the good guy friend. Females have been a have always labeled me as such. I guess it is because I don't try to get into their pants right away and I am not feeling all over them. I will have girls that are attracted to my looks but as soon as they get to know me they feel like they could never date me. I have had girls say they couldn't date me it is so frustrating because of who I am. No matter the race they feel like they can tell me anything like I am their best friend as soon as I meet them but they never see anything more than that. I am 26 years old and I am still having this problem but I do date younger girls so maybe that is the problem. I am thinking it is time to date someone my own age or older. What should I do and will I always be the good guy friend?

I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.

There's this girl in my neighborhood who I've known since kindergarten Who constantly acts like she's somehow better than me.  She was like that growing up and now that we're both in out late 20's it hasn't changed. She's constantly bragging about how well things have are going for her and how popular she is.

20090309125218AAYDAg6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell an Ex GF that the reason I don't want to date her is her weight?	We used to be really hot and heavy and were even considering marriage, then she kinda got cold feet and decided she still wanted to sow her wild oats so to speak. So we ended up splitting up. That was like 8 years ago and she recently found my work email in one of her old emails and anyway she emailed me and asked how I was etc. I always had the hots for this girl and even though she kinda dumped me before I was over that and raring to see her again (she had a killer body the last time I saw her)...so we meet for drinks and the girl has gained at least 30 lbs, I would estimate it's actually closer to fifty. I have kept myself in great shape. Anyway I played it cool and was polite but the flame was def gone for me...so when we are ready to call it a night and I'm not making my normal moves to get her out of her pants she says it's my weight isn't it? For a guy, we recoil when asked that so I just said no I'm just playing it slow and she accepted that and we said goodbye. Well she has been emailing/calling and I don't know what to do....suggestions please?
20090309102130AAqcCD7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my christian boyfriend try to have sex with me?	I met this guy on a christian dating site.We have been going out a couple of months and are exclusive. What I don't understand is that he thinks it's not sinful to have sex in a loving relationship. I don't get it if he's a christian shouldn't that mean he believes in no sex before marriage? Anyway we have only kissed but he made it obvious he wanted to have sex with me on Saturday. I had to say no! But I don't think he should be putting me in that situation. He is a really nice guy and good looking and I admit I am very tempted to do things with him. Maybe I should end it if it's going to be too tempting. He said on saturday that he wanted me and looked really lustfully into my eyes.      Any advice. Thanks in advance

What should I do? Just ignore it? But what if it means something important, something I'm not getting?       Help me out?

He used to spend almost every weekend with me for the entire weekend adn we rarely spent a weekend apart and even when he was at school (i go to another university 2 horus away) he would still call every day and leave me cute text messages. recently he's been so busy with school to where i'm lucky if i get a call once a week and it's very short and he just texts me at night. then this weekend he came over on friday at 9pm, we watched movies and stayed up til midnight then he left at 9 the next morning to go parachute jumping. so he really only stayed for 3 hours while he was concious. he spent the rest of the weekend with his little sister which is great b/c he's trying to fix their relationship. other than that the past few weeks have been awful, i miss talking to him so much but i know he's so busy and he's not doing it on purpose. i don't know if i should just say nothing about it or to ask him if he could make time for us during the day. also, we're going to Disney World together in two weeks for 4 days and as great as that is, i love the inbetween even if it's just a phone call. he graduates the academy in may and will be stationed in Italy for 3 years and i think knowing he'll he gone is affecting me already. what am i supposed to do? am i being irrational?

20090309123245AAPM7Wy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Responsible guy or waste of time?	- Been friends with this guy for four years.   - He comes over to visit me at least once a month.   - My dad called him out on liking me two weeks ago.   - He said he never told me because he thought he never had a chance.   - We had a couple of make-out sessions and spend time talking about the possibility of "us".      - We have kept talking and went out on one date.   - However, he lost his job last week.  And said he wants to fix his job situation before getting into a relationship.   - I completely understand that, but he is keeping distant from me.   - I said "you know you can touch me, right?" he said "You're not ready for me to touch you - if I start I'm not stopping."      Should I just be patient? I waited so long for him to like me...I don't want to give up - but I'm coming from a lot of wasted time.  He seems to like me...

We were just really good friends and neither of us liked each other more then that. Now he doesn't talk to me as much as he use to, we don't really talk much in school now and we rarely talk on the computer anymore either. Nothing happened, just one day we stopped talking as much. He just kind of gets shy or something, he'll just kind of look at me and I will smile at him and he looks away.

20090309110847AAurKDv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys 18 or over, I'm married, he's single - are the rules different for our friendship?	I met a man from UK 6 months ago while on vacation here in the US. I am married and he is single. We developed a friendship and emailed a couple times a month. I gave him my cell number and he started to text me and then called me around christmas. Since then we have started calling one another and speak on the phone every couple weeks. ( he stopped emailing as I think calling is easier for him to call - he initiated the texting and calling, I was happy w/email) We were taking turns contacting each other. Sometimes I will think to text him or email him something related to a conversation, but stop myself for fear of him thinking I like him romantically and contacting too much. But with a girl friend I wouldn't think twice.       Often the women on this site say "yeah no problem having male friends", but the guys always say otherwise...they always want more. I'm also not sure why this guy wants to be my friend since I don't really bring anything to the table in terms of an interesting life, work, etc. But he says I'm "witty and charming" so I guess I have some likeable attribute. He is very successful, handsome, albeit commitment phobic since he is still 40 and single lol...But I think it's cool to have a friend in another country and we talk about interesting things that I don't have the opportunity for normally.         Are the rules different in guy/girl friendships. This is a new friendship and we don't really know eachother very well so any insight you can add is appreciated.      My husband knows we are friends.
20090309063424AAZUw42	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do women constantly ask tips on how to flirt because they refuse to exercise?	Is it that they so desperately want to believe there is another way to find a guy that is not based on looks? Why can't they just focus this effort on going to the gym? It's like when your mom said "For all this effort you've put into avoid doing your homework, you could have had it done by now!".   If not, why do women ask for flirting tips? Men don't notice girls "flirting", it has zero effect on men, so why bother? I heard a girl say one time that her killer flirt move was to talk to him more often and smile. Hahaha. What is that supposed to do? Does that mean I should assume every girl who talks to me and smiles is hitting on me? Think about it ladies, why do you ask about this?

20090309120749AA7mfR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If girls have romance, dating, and relationships a lot easier than guys do, then why do girls deny the fact?	that they have it easier? why do a lot of girls say that they have it harder when it comes to romance, dating, and relationships, or that they have it just as hard as guys? That is so not true. Girls have it so much easier because all they have to do is wait for a guy to approach them and start a conversation, get to know eachother, and for the guy to ask them out. Girls just have to approve of the date and the relationship. Since us guys always have to chase the girls, take the initiative, make the first move, start all the conversations and keep them going, and ask the girl out, overall, us guys always have to initiate the date and relationship, while girls can sit back and call the shots.
20090309125434AARc5kg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should a Male with Asperger Syndrome just accept the fact that he is never going to have a girlfriend?	I am a 21 year old male with Asperger Syndrome, I am not very outgoing, I don't have a lot of friends, I have never had a girlfriend, I am never invited to parties or social events in which a lot of people attend. My social skills are not that good, they are below the average person, I have a hard time being able to start a conversation and keeping one going, I usually seem to do better at initiating conversations and keeping one going if someone else starts the conversation. I have a very hard time being able to tell if a girl is just teasing me, just likes me as a friend, or likes me as more than a friend. Also every girl that I asked out, pursued, and taken the initiative with, either had a boyfriend or they rejected me by leading me on by letting me have their real phone number but they never answered or called me back. So are my social skills and conversation skills never going to get better since I have Asperger Syndrome? should I just stop talking to women? heck, should I just stop talking to women just as friends? should I ignore women completely? should I bother not even to just be friends with them?

Say, you were a shy boy trying to gather enough courage to show a girl how you feel. Much later, you've found out that the reason she never took you seriously was because she'd thought you were gay.   And it's actually your best mate who'd told her that (before he then asked her out, married her, and eventually cheated on her and left).   How would you feel about it?   And why on earth would anyone do that to their own friend?      Your thought on this?

My fiance's cousin, a Christian who love to judge people about their lifestyle has been having an affair with this 21 yea-old girl. The came by us one time and we didn't know the extent of the whole thing yet at that time. He told my fiance that she was a friend and they just dropped by while passing through the area. He asked my fiance to put a movie so they could watch. I was unhappy with the fact that he brought the girl by the house so I left. While I was out, my fiance called me and told me he went downstairs with the girl and he has no clue why. Then the cousin came back up and say he was simply showing her around and use the restroom. But today my fiance just told me that he told him in front of some other people that when he went downstairs (just less than half an hour) he had sex with the girl. I know it had to be on the bed that I share with my fiance since the other rooms had things all over the beds. I am now furious and want to say or do something about that. I find so disrespectful for them to that. How can I handle the situation?

Guys, if you met a girl you liked but you had to leave for interstate to look for work and you weren’t sure if you would be back or find something there and stay, would you see her again before you left or would you not want to get involved until you see what happens with your job-hunting interstate?       We had our first date but he’s leaving in 2 weeks to look for work, said he’d call me when he gets back so we can go out again. He’s a really nice guy, complimented me a few times and said he was looking for commitment. Do I move on now or believe him and wait to see what happens if he comes back?      Would something like this really stop him from getting further involved with me or is he making excuses?

Right i took alot of advice from this site regarding my story involving a girl at work in a very senior position. The response i got was that she was playing  games with me,enjoying it and flirting.The advice i got was to avoid her at all cost which i did today but just keep it work related. Firstly i did not sit next to her which i used to but on another table. She came to me and said hello which i did as well and that's it. She then came straight back and said whats up with you which i said just want to chill out . She said fine and left in a strop.I then heard her talking on her mobile quite loud that her belly hurting thinking she was trying to tell me.I ignored her.Later on i was working elsewhere in the building when i looked up and seen her walking pass me smiling at me.I smiled back but put my head down.I even did not offer to buy any tea or chocolates today which i do usually. What do you think she his up to know that i have ignored her all day.Also should i continue avoiding her.

As he was driving me back..he was like " I need to get you a cell phone so we can talk to each other..like 1000 minute" I thought that was weird. he said call me when you get home , I did...then he said he had a great time and that he wanted me to stay ( I had to go home)..he then told me to call him in the morning..so I woke up.and I called him....left a message. Thought he wouldn't call me back because I slept with him. Lo and behold, he called back!! I told him I thought he wouldn't call back because I slept with him and that is NOT like me. He said ,pretty much "we're adults, I actually feel privelleged..don't feel bad, it hasn't changed anything." So, we went on to talk for a while. He said he would call me later, which he did but I was asleep...He also sent me an email this m orning saying that I have been on his mind since we met.That I'm sexy and smart and to have a good day. He also wants to know when I my next free day is.    QUESTION IS: DOes he really like me or is he playing me with lines?   Should I just chill and see what happens? What are your opinions and advice. AND YES, WE USED PROTECTION!      I will make sure next time we go out for it to be out doors and no drinking and no sex. Thanks...more opinions would be great...this is what he emailed me today "Good morning,       Well just to let you know, you haven't left my mind since I saw you. You are so sexy and sweet. Have a great day"   Somehow I hope it's not a line. Is it a line guys?

My boyfriend was cast as my character's boyfriend. So in one of the scenes he tells me he loves me and I kiss him.   Slight problem, he's only been my boyfriend for two weeks, and we haven't kissed yet...    Today, I kissed him when we were rehearsing, and I felt nothing. It was really weird and awkward. Now I'm worried this will spoil our first kiss, and I like him so much. I'm only 15, and I don't have much experience with guys and I'm really nervous. What if we kiss for real and it's just as bad.   I'm not really sure what I'm asking, this whole situation's a bit weird, so any advice at all would be much appreciated. xx

We are not close at all. We go for months without talking until she comes up with some excuse to call me...grant it this time it was to tell me my uncle was sick...BUT she says the most horrible things and does not make any effort to see her grandchildren and she lives a BLOCK away. We had a huge falling out this weekend and I told her this time I am finally deciding to keep her out of my life for good, that I can't take the drama. I also advised her that she could not see my children, (keeping in mind she never cared to when she COULD)...she then tells me she will be taking me to court to evoke her grandparental rights?    Can she do this?  We live in PA.  By all means if she was any kind of grandmother I would never keep my children from her but she is a manipulative person who comes and goes out of your life as she pleases and I feel my children do not need that or her drama.

Well I recently went through a rough patch where I had a lot going on, just a lot of problems in my life where I ended up lieing to friends so they wouldn't know i was struggling. I blew friends off all the time, cause I just was depressed. I ended up shutting myself in and lieing a lot to my friends. My friend just told me she sees my true side now... This is NOT me.. I was just in a bad way and didn't know how to handle myself and am the kind of person to keep it all in and not admit when i need help. I wasn't having problems with durgs or anything, it was just family and personal issues.

20090309115846AAjxbHI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im goin out of my mind!!! need to find out if this girl is playing hard to get!?	this girl and i started talking about in sept. we talked every day on AIM for about 5hours per day, and occasionally we would talk up to 11 hours.. per day.... (yea i know). we used to talk about everything and i got the assumption we were really close, and i was positive she like me, ( obviously no one would be that committed to talk to someone for about 5 hours per day for 4 months unless they didn't have some feelings for the other person. well her second term of college started and she says she cant talk to me as often anymore,( i understand) but her 2nd term stared 1 month ago and she has talked to me like a combined 3 hours in that time!!!! i told her around the time her 2nd term started, that i liked her( it was the first time that i told her that, even though i have made it clearly obvious to her by complimenting her and such.) ever since then, her convos are dull, she seems uninterested, i don't know whats going on!! she doesn't respond to my facebook emails i send her or texts!!! is she playing hard to get???? im going crazy rite now!!! she is theee perfect girl for me. she is the only girl that i like for HER, not her looks, i am in love with HER!.      tw she is my sisters best friend. she is a college freshman, and i am a hs senior. its not a big deal because she is only 1 month older      i am 99% sure she likes or liked me because our convos used to be veryyyyyyyyyy sexual. and she told me i am the only guy she thinks of when she ______ ( fill in the blank)      this sudden silence cam rite after i told her i liked her... what does that mean, hard to get??

20090309114954AAoGwP1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is she like this? Am I in the wrong?	Well my friend at school is really annoying - basically she used to always put me and my twin sister down (we were the only people that would hang around with her), and bring herself up whilst doing it. She NEVER wanted to do something on the weekend - we'd always have to organise it, she boasts about how long and skinny her legs are, and how tanned she is. I got really offended because once she even said that the nazi's would've sent her to a concentration camp if she lived in Germany because she's so tanned they might think she was coloured! I think that was so inappropriate and disrespectful but she thought it was totally normal!      Now we have started to hang around with our old group of friends a lot, they are such a nice group of people and we have a lot more fun with them - they don't put us down and act like they're superior to us. Now she's getting annoyed about this, saying that we're leaving her out, but before she never wanted to do anything with us... we got invited to a friends party who is also our cousin, she said for us not to have fun there! When she saw photo's of us enjoying ourselves she flipped!      But i felt mean about her feeling left out so on the weekend i gave her a call and asked if she wanted to do anything - she said that she couldn't because her dad was out? Then she said that we could do something the weekend after the one coming because she's busy this weekend, now, 1. If you were that desperate to hang out with us then why would u decline an offer because ur dad's out, and 2. i told her today that i might have some people round on saturday and she automatically assumed she was invited - even though she said she was busy!!! I think she only wants to do something with us when we're doing something with our other friends.      Her mum is also horrible - i said i hope you feel better soon to her and she said yeh so do i. I was like:O! Also she said "here comes trouble" when i walked over to her to talk to the girl.      What should i do? She's also started to copy the clothes i wear, like the clothes that i put together for school - she goes out and buys stuff that i TOLD her i was going to get!      :( It's really frustrating me and i just needed to vent but please hlep with any advice
20090309123007AA1jPZo	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is a nasty person, Advice Needed..?	My dirty mom is constantly picking on me, my dad and my sister and completely favoring my brother, All I do is make her coffee like 100 times a day, do all the house work, I'm cleaning up after my slob of a brother 90% of the day. I even cook my moms dinner, I'm only 17 and I can't even think of the last time she cooked a family meal, I've been cooking for myself since I was 11. and all my dad does is run around for her, she does nothing, shes constantly speaking bad about my dad and treating him like crap when all he does is work for the family! shes got her friends over from AM-to-PM and they just sit around drinking all day and on friday nights she goes out to the bar and leaves me baby sitting my 12 year old brother and then she comes home with her friend who stays the night and her friend screams at me and calls me names and she just watches and laughs when I'm about to cry. I'm a 17 year old who doesn't go out clubbing, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, doesn't have sex like most girls my age....I don't know why she treats me like crap and favors my brother so much! and If I ask her for even $5 she would flip out      I can't STAND HER, all she cares about is herself, her friends and my brother. Whenever my brother wants a $50 PS3 game he gets it with no questions asked!!!      What bothers me the most is she actually CONSIDERS herself to be one of the "BEST MOMS IN THE WORLD"??? LOOOL.

20090309124708AAhualR	Family & Relationships;Family	How can i stop my older brother acting like a father?	I am 15 and my big brother is 25, our mother died when i was born, our father is a business man dedicated to his companies that are situated around the world. When i as little my brother was at boarding school my father was always away on business, so i was pretty much raised by nannies, until i went of to boarding school when i was eight.   I am still at boarding school and termly board, but when it comes to holidays and half term, my father never seems to be around so it falls on my big brothers shoulders, to pick me up and sort everything out.       He lives in London, and works for one of my fathers companies and is constantly on the go. I feel really bad that he has to look after to me, but on the other hand he is so annoying and strict. I was fifteen minutes late home from a friends house over half term, i let myself into the house, and was confronted by my brother, he grabbed my arm and frog marched me to my bedroom, then proceeded to lecture me about time keeping and sent me to bed without supper. Everything i do he seems to have some complaint about, whether it is how i make my bed, or that he wants me to eat more, he even smacked the back of my legs because i called him a loser. I just really want him to lighten up and stop him acting so paternal. What can i do?

20090309114817AAZzh8q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy problems, and need a new input, esp a guys.?	Ok its a long story but I really need some input besides my friends.       I have been talking to this guy since early November. He goes to the same school as my friend, and that is how I met him. We kinda talked ever since, but not on a day-to-day basis. I really started to like him when we hung out in December when I visited my friend and got to talking more. Whenever we talk we talk about hanging out, and how we miss each other, and last week he told me he was excited to see me in a few days. When I went to visit my friend she was really sick, and wanted to go to sleep early but he wanted to get food so i backed out hanging out with him. Then the same thing the next night. I only got to hang out with him one night.        I am just so nervous about hanging out with him because I really like him. I only call him on Friday's after I have been out because I feel like I bother him (because its my personality) if I try to contact him more.       To make matters worse, I over heard his friend talking to him about another girl... saying I don't know what you see in her shes not pretty, not cool and still in high school. So im nervous that not hanging out with him this weekend really ruined my chances with him.      How do i recover? I never told him I liked him.. I don't know if i should. I just need a guys input or anyone's for that matter.         Ps. He is a year younger than me, and when we hung out on Saturday he told me he had to tell me something but didn't know how to put it into words, then when i asked if it was bad he said no -- i confronted him about it the next day, he said he didn't remember saying that to me because he was drinking..       sorry for the lengthy read. and sorry if i sound like an idiot just need some input       Thanks in advance!

I really care about her but I'm getting sick of the non-stop drama and don't know what to do
20090309123314AAjxeqH	Family & Relationships;Family	My uncle looks at my private parts, what can i do to make him stop?	Just to be clear I don't wear tight or sexy clothes around him.  I always wear simple jeans and a long sweatshirt.  I don't talk to him much so there's nothing i'm doing to provoke him.      I'm particularly worried right now.  Ever summer my family goes to Idaho to visit our relatives (my uncle lives in Idaho).  And last summer when i turned 13, i noticed that he was looking at areas in my body that he shouldn't.  Now i'm resenting to go this summer and there is only 4 more months left until the vacation.  What i'm concerned about is that during the summer it is very hot and obviously i cant be wearing a sweatshirt to cover myself up at the risk of heatstroke.      I've tried to talk to my parents and ever other adult in the family. They just say i'm exaggerating and that i take things to seriously.  What could i do at this point?      My uncle looks at me constantly although he has a wife and two sons (my 2 baby cousins).  It's inappropriate and disgusting.  Last summer he practically touched me all over and fortunately i was able to get him to stop.  But what could i do about where he's looking at me?

20090309123031AAQuIzi	Family & Relationships;Family	Were you a teenage runaway?	Details are a 13yr old girl ran away for the first time - to a friend's house (this time).   She shoplifts and lies, but does well at school and I can say that she has a lovely home - not abused, own room, although mum is not well off.  Family of 5, single mum who works hard, but is there in the afternoons and evenings to spend time doing homework. They spend time as a family doing crafts and going places, but kids allowed to go to the park or see friends if they want.   School is no help at all.   My question is - if you were a teenage runaway, what brought you back to earth.  Was there a single action that you wish your parents (whichever adult) had done that would have stopped you - or eventually did?

He says really inappropriate things I don't really want to say them on here. And I told my friend about what he says to me and she is just like "So He is nice to me"  she keeps on saying that and she wont even talk to him about being rude! She is always like "its awkward to say I mean he loves me and I love him" I tried to give him a try about 5 times and still he isn't nice. I really like my friend she is my BFFL but I don't know what to do and I come crying home after school because of her and that stupid boy.

20090309123831AA09d0G	Family & Relationships;Family	Moms, help me out, please......?	Although this isn’t the right category, I’m looking for a broad base of advice, so please answer anyway.  My 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter like to rough-house from time to time.  It's never very rough, but my son will occasionally give his sister a “titty twister.”  I know that he doesn’t do it with the intent to hurt her; he just thinks he's teasing her.  I’ve lectured him and have taken away privileges, and I’ve tried to convey to him that a girl's breasts are very sensitive, like his testicles.      Fed up, my daughter asked me today if she can give him a taste of his own medicine (and a lesson in sensitivity).  She wants to hit him in the testicles the next time he gives her a "titty twister."  Since my “nice mom” approach hasn’t worked, I told her that I would think about it.  I may allow her to hit him (not too hard), and I’m wondering what you think?  And what should I say to my son?      Thanks!

This weekend I kicked this dude in the balls (I think?) cuz he was harassing me at a party, but nothing happened! He just like backed up and was like "woah, baby!" I talked to a couple of my friends and some of them had similar experiences like half the time! I always thought they would just go down right away? So, wondering if any of you girls who have kicked guys in the balls:   1) Have any special way to do it?   2) How much experience do you have with this?   3) What happened each time?   4) How many times did it "work" or not "work".   Thanks for your input! :)

So far I've cut out an eighth of a bright pink A4 sheet of card and written on it: Get well soon bla bla bla...

She's not going to die, but on the next eighth of a card (this time it's green) I wrote: I'll never forget the time when....   and then wrote some old memories of us together.   I've done one card like that so far and I want to have different headings which all relate to the times we've had, just wondering if anyone could give me any headings that I could use....?

I know it sounds dumb but every time I go see this one guy who likes me, I always make sure I look Extra pretty and beautiful for him. I'm worried that one day If i see him and I don't look very pretty, that he won't like me anymore. I know that if he doesn't like me for not being as pretty than he is just a waste of my time. But what should i do? I don't want to be worried about this. I just feel like if i don't take extra time to get all pretty and "dolled' up whenever i see him, I feel like he won't like me anymore!
20090309170717AATM62U	Family & Relationships;Friends	How was your weekend mine was crazy?	this weekend well ill go day by day       Fri. went home and saw 7 cop cars in my apt. complex(across the street from my apt.) their was a shooting. (good thing no one was home at my place)      Sat. i woke up at 11:00 am (that's late for me) after i had a great dream that now i plan on turning into a book. i worked on it till 12:30 that night      Sun. woke up at 9 (much better now i have a little more of my day back)  my boyfriend calls me about 10ish  tells me he's on his way over and as usual he shows up three hours later (i love the man but that is getting a little annoying) so we are driving to Greenwood from Indianapolis (for those that don't know that's about a 45 min. drive) going to his dads house to drop off some tool (that cant get wet) and its poring down rain (lovely) so he starts cussing "i hate this mother f***ing weather".... blah blah blah. (note i get carsick and i had a big lunch) when all of a sudden i get sick (really sick i never throw up i always feel really sick to my stomach but i never throw up) and i say" Matt i don't feel real good" he asks me if I'm gonna get sick and hands me a bag and before i can answer i fill that bag up. if that wasn't the bad part the bag had 2 holes in it. so I'm cradling the bag holding it up so "stuff" wont fall out.holding the holes with my other hand and (needless 2 say) "stuff" still got everywhere. We get to his dads house he gets out and tells me to just throw it out on the ground so i do. his stepmother comes with rubber gloves on a bucket of  water and a trashcan and she cleans it up. (she is such a little home maker ) she had no problems with it either. "oh your fine,your fine. don't worry about it. It happens."  Well I'm soaked with multiple fluids. "stuff" and water(from the bucket) so his stepmother gives me her robe and she washes my clothes. it was weird i was sitting in my boyfriends fathers house wearing nothing but his stepmothers robe sitting beside his stepsister holding her baby. well if i wasn't the most embarrass person in the world than somebody tell me who was       if you can beat my weekend of craziness and tell me about it you get 2 ducky points (LOL)
20090309172454AAeZzhb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex is telling lies about me to everyone at our church. Now everyone is treating me badly. What should I do?	I divorced him because he was using drugs and left me to drink and was with another woman. Some people tell me the truth will prevail, but they don't know this guy like I do. Now, he is making my life miserable and everyone at church is helping him get his life together because he's acting like the perfect christian. I supported him with my savings and paid off all of his old fines (about $30,000 worth) now I have nothing and he's doing well. I could use some prayer.

20090309171626AAEb4WQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Problems with sisters' friend... am I overreacting?	Alright, let me start at the beginning - growing up, my sister and I were EXTREMELY close, mostly because we both were shy and didn't have a lot of friends. Now that we're older (I'm a sophomore in college and she's just about to graduate high school) we've made some friends, but I have a problem with one of her two "best" friends. She does, too. She even tells me. The only reason they hang out is because she has a car and the other best friend has a boyfriend, which leaves her alone. But up until recently I was able to tolerate her, I'm beginning to get annoyed with her right now.      She has this obsession with my cousins (ages 16 and 14, yes they are YOUNGER) and has even gone so far to invite them to her graduation party. And guess what else? She's not inviting ME. Jeez. She even knew me in high school before she was friends with my sister(we were on the newspaper staff together). She also didn't defend me when the editors-in-chief treated me like crap and has said stuff about how my sister and I are "screwed up" because of our home life. That really bothers me... I hate when people talk about me behind my back and have low self-esteem as it is.      So tell me, am I overreacting? Or are my concerns legitimate?      This just  I that undesirable?

20090309171227AAwe6aG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	BOYFRIEND CHEATED...?!?	So my boyfriend and I have been going out for 4 years - we are deeply in love. However, he cheated on me last november with one of my friends (we haven't talked in awhile, but I grew up with her). They didn't get "DOWN" they just kissed at the movies. But he was texting her the whole week before that telling her we weren't seeing eachother anymore and how much he wanted to be with her, how pretty she was, and how he really liked her and just couldn't help himself.      I have left him for another guy before. BUT - he did find another girl as well.      So is this a guy just being a guy ?? Should I forgive him ? Have any of you ever been cheated on and attain a strong relationship still with that same person?
20090309170728AAzTPJp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going on??? I can't figure myself out....?	So there's this guy...let's call him "Turkey".... and we dated for a little over a year, then we broke up. And we've been broken up for about 3 months now.      Whenever I'm dating someone else, I get really depressed because I start to miss Turkey and start to think I still love him.      I rarely get to see Turkey anymore, because we go to different schools, and his parents hate me for some reason. But when I do see him, it's amazing and we have a good time and we kiss and stuff and I remember why I was so in love with him. But then after he leaves, I don't feel anything for him. It's so strange.      We're not officially back together yet, but we plan on getting back together soon. Maybe I'm just afraid of committment, and I get coldfeet sometimes???      I don't even know. Can anyone please try to figure out what the heck is going on with my mind..or heart...or whatever it is????      I don't like any other guys, by the way...   And I'm 16 years old.

20090309171444AAqkP8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on girlfriend flirting online?	Hey everyone this is my very first yahoo question so dont mind if its not to good but here goes... ive been with my girlfriend for almost 2 and a half years and at the start of our relationship she left me to go sleep with another guy who liked her and also had a crush on my friend (she never went with my friend) . A month later after been dumped she decides she wants me back and begged me to get back with her promising me it was all a mistake. I gave her another chance but swore to her there would be no more. A year later she became pregnant and then had my daughter and we now live in a house all together as a family. Just recently she decides to go up town with her sister every few weeks and i didnt mind her doing it as she fones me up town and comes home. Her sister is a slapper and a bad influence on my girlfriend. So just to be careful i decide to sett up a auto save feature on windows live messanger so i can monitor all my girlfriends conversations with her sister just to make sure nothing fishy was going on. To my shock i find a very saucy conversation off my girlfriend to another guy called tommy. my girlfrind on the conversation is asking him to meet her up town and she is telling him she is going to sleep with him when they meet up . The conversation even says she went on webcam for a few minutes. So to my horror (bear in mind she did it to me before ) i flip out and demand answers off her and she claims that she said the things on purpose because i was saving her conversations. its been weeks since she did it and she never went up town after i shouted about it but it is always on my mind and i dont believe her at all as i generaly do think she was going to do it with tommy. Has anyone had this happen to them as i could do with some advice , many thanks - ben

So, because alli is a good friend of mine, she wasn't about ot sit back and let me get pranked! so we came up with the idea that we will double prank jaclyn.  so now we are trying to think of a prank that jaclyn and alli can "play" on me and that we will really flip around and prank jaclyn with.  Any ideas? it has to be a lie, like i hooked up with my friend, not like a practical joke.  It has to be cenetered around a lie or two.      please help!

20090309172547AAT7J0z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone give me advice on girlfriend problems.?	hello, so my girlfriend broke up with me this morning. She said we should just be friends, but i knew that couldn't be the whole reason. so we're at school and the day goes on, its about half way through the day, and i see her holding hands with one of her ex-boyfriends. so i was like WTF and went to class and then i text her and talk to her for a while and decide since we have been friends for a long time i wont let something like this ruin our friendship. then i leave school and we start texting and she says that she made a mistake and she says she wants me back. now i dont know what i should do: give her a second chance or should i give her a week or so and see what happens?      Any advice or any opinion would be helpful. thanks for helping =)

20090309084748AAKjcoU	Family & Relationships;Family	I need advice-anyone want to help?	My dad and I just got into an argument. It was pretty big. You see, my dad left a year and a half ago for another woman, but now he's back. I had walked in on a girl drinking in school, so I had a few beers with her. It was my first time drinking and I felt really bad about it so, I thought I could talk to my dad-my mom would just scream and yell, but I thought my dad would be a little bit more understanding. But when I asked him if I could stay home from school to talk to him, he started cussing at me, telling me I was lazy-in return I called him a f****ing w***e in men's closing. But he said I couldn't use that kind of language because 'I'm the father' He's went to take my sister to school and he'll be back soon, but I'm scared that he'll start cussing at me again-I hate it when people cuss at me. Any advice?
20090309091026AAiOpUD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My potential girlfriend and her checkered past?...?	I started seeing a girl that, quite frankly, has a bit of a reputation amongst a group of friends of mine. About 6 years ago (she's 26 now, I'm 28), she slept dated one of our friends, then had random drunken encounters (read: sex) with 2 more of them at separate other times. On top of that, since then, she's also hooked up (kissing and high school touching) with 3 more of them on separate occasions.      Now truth be told, I kinda ran with this knowledge and made my move recently. Althought it was all that was on my mind at the time, we didn't end up having sex right away, which turns is pretty consistent with how she is now. She's into the whole having a boyfriend thing and not having sex out of relationships. Turns out, I actually like the girl and she's fallen for me pretty hard too, but this whole past of hers and having to hang out with guys who have had sex with her is so troubling to me. We've been seeing each other for almost 3 months and I still haven't been able to commit fully because of it....and in actuality, I was kind of relieved to find out she had slept with 13 guys, which isn't as many as I thought, considering what I heard. I'm no saint myself and am no stranger to the girls in this group, it's just having to see these guys that makes me sick to my stomach. I know a few guys that would look at me like I had two heads for making her my girlfriend. I'm constantly questioning her about it, and passive aggressively chastising her for it, and she tells me she's not proud, and it's in the past and she never felt anything nearly as strong with those guys as she does with me, but I never feel quite satisfied.       So yeah, I'm just looking for words of advice, encouragement or even cricitism, one way or another.
20090309094822AAGgbVA	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I deal with a father in law that drinks every weekend?	I am an indian newly wed, and it has been only 6 months and my husbands parents are planning to move in with us.  Both of them are in their late 60's and are retired, and so because of their financial and cultural (parents should always live with their children) reasons they have decided to move in with us.  Before the wedding I was fine with it, until I actually got a glimpse of how it is like.  My husband says its temporary, but I know it's going to be permanent.  My mother in law is a very sensitive, but has a teacheristic approach with me where she's always advising me.  I feel like I have two mothers now.  My father in law is pretty quiet, until the weekends where he drinks to the point where he's crying, not being able to walk steady, and repeating the same sentence over and over again.  My husband just ignores him and walks away, but I can't do that.  Then the mother in law begins to yell at the father in law for drinking too much, and they begin a battle of their own.  Right now I feel like what have I got myself into.  If I had known from the beginning this is how they are, I would have seriously bought a home that comes with an in law suite.  So I've discussed this with my husband which didnt' start off to well, but it ended in him understanding (a little).  I feel like I need to get another home fasttttt! They haven't entirely moved in with us yet, but they will next week and I know I'm going to go crazy soon! I promised myself I'll just bite my lip until we can buy another home adequate for his parents.  I can't even be normal around him and act as I would when were together, I jerk away from him when he tries to hold me, it just feels too uncomfortable.        I sometimes think, if I had known this is how its going to be once I do get married, I would have pushed marriage for another 2-3 years and just lived with my parents in happiness!

She is intelligent, accomplished, has a wonderful heart, beautiful personality, and fun to be around.  Where there is a road block is intimacy.  I hold back and shy to tell her what I like and prefer because I am shy but I am very sensual and erotic when the other person knows too.  Has anyone maintained a healthy relationship while the intimacy is not all there?  Male or Female, please answer and PS  I do not wish to cheat, so need advice.

20090309115156AA5yjOm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies...would you let your boyfriend re mane friends with these girls?	My boyfriend of two years has these lady friends in college. We had a break and he told me on our break they we are still just the same, except not seeing each other for a bit.    Well I found out that he has two lady friends he hard core flirted with. He smiled, laughed, joked around with them, asked one of them for her phone number, had nick names for each other and considered going to our date spot with one of them.    We our off our break and says he doesn't do that anymore, He still sees them every day and hangs out with them every day at college.   but what he did still bugs me to this day.       Should I have let him still be friends with these two girls? Would you let your boyfriend still be friends with those girls if he did that?      Thanks!
20090309115250AA7qnFa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is the right path for my marriage?	I am 30 years old, married 3 years and have a 2 yr old daughter (planned).  A year ago my husband was struggling emotionally with his job and feeling stuck in his life.  We discussed moving back to his home town to be closer to family and start fresh.  So we took the leap and it felt good to have a change.  We moved 7 hours away from where we were.  Now almost a year later, my husband has a great job now and is content with his current situation.   I feel like I did the right things as his wife to give him the chance to live up to his potential.  However, now I am struggling myself.  My husband and I are very different people and although we have things in common and care for our daughter very much, I am afraid that we might have built our life thus far on what we thought we could be rather than being real about who we both really are.  I am very in tune with my emotions (probably too much) and love people and relationships; he is quiet and simple.  We have had open conversations about all of this and he has been clear that he doesn't want to split and is willing to do anything to repair us.  My feelings have no doubt rattled him and as a man he wants to fix them, but I am not sure that he really knows how.  He is a good man, but he is a man?  Why am I feeling so trapped by parenthood and marriage?   Why all of a sudden can I not stop thinking about traveling, meeting new men and adventures?  Could I be having a mid life crisis at 30?   My plan is to work on myself (see a shrink) and try and meet more friends in the area and make the most of this, but I can't help this sinking feeling that our marriage will end one day for whatever reason and I will have wasted this time I have now.   I am still fairly young and maybe there is someone out there that might be a better match for me.  It is just a lump in my stomach that won’t go away.   My parents are still together after 40 year and my mother thinks that I am a restless soul. Has anyone ever come out of a slump like this in their marriage and literally learned to love again and gotten the passion back?  Is that possible?  Or has anyone ever left their spouse with a young child and still been able to fulfill their restless soul?  I am trapped between not good and not good.  Twenty years ago a women would have stayed and made due.
20090309115811AAemYBd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is dating him too old?	I recently had my first "love" and my first "heartbreak" and it hurt really bad. A few months ago i went to a new years eve party with my cousin and her boyfriend. I was bummed all night because my ex was being a jerk but i got to talking to this boy. He was really nice and we exchanged numbers.      I went through another month or two of abuse with my ex until i finally ended things. I stayed single for a while especially because i am going to college this fall so i figure there was someone better out there for me and it would be better for me to be single at college.      I continue to text this guy and found out he is 26 and i am 18 (senior in high school but graduate in may and go to college in august) He really likes me and i like him and we have hung out for a while. He asked me to be his girlfriend but when i told my family and friends they advised me to not date him or even hang out with him just for the fact that there is an 8 year difference. My dad told me that if I were in college than it would be different but he can't tell me who i can or can't date so its up too me.       At times i don't feel like there is an age difference and that it doesn't matter and i have told him once i go to college i don't know if i will want a relationship with anybody and he is completely cool and understanding of that. I have even met his family.      Should I completely stop talking to him or Is it okay?

20090309124224AAVIgN5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I approach this problem?	There has been much conflict with my boyfriend's brother's girlfriend in the past. She lived with their family immediately after they started dating. Anywhom, she would act very nice infront of everyone but then be manipulative and spread lies to his mother about me. Being the stuborn yet peaceful person that I am, I chose not to involve myself with her any longer, now that meant not going over to my boyfriend's house and deleting her from Instant messaging. She freaked out when I deleted her and made me look like the bad guy. Yet again, I was passive and just added her back to my list to make everyone happy but me because I still put up with her manipulations and i don't need it. I love my boyfriend and plan on marrying him, but I can't handle her, sometimes I think maybe we can move away? that's how bad it is. I don't want to cause anymore conflict than she has already. And by her living with them and trying to be their mom's best friend... I felt too uncomfortable to discuss this with their mother, I want to be the bigger person but it isn't paying off. Now I feel self conscience with his family. I wish we can get along, but everyone but his family knows she is a manipulative woman, it's like it's in her blood and will never get out.   I may have went off track here, but any opinions and suggestions would help at this point.
20090309121746AAtHlgf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP!!! What should I do...He beats her!?	I started tutoring my best friends cousin. She’s 21 and I 26. Were both in university and we often study in the local library. Today I couldn’t make it to the library. So, she came over to my place. It’s been a good 11months and she never really needed my tutoring…she’s genius. However lately she been falling behind. We became really close over the pass months. We're not together, even though I would love that. But we have a bond deeper then a mere friendship. Long story short…when she came over to my place she was in this really bitchy mood. Just snapping at me for the most trivial things. I didn’t understand why she was behaving this way. She’s beautiful on the inside and beautiful (absolutely STUNNING!) on the outside. She’s just a really sweet girl. After awhile of her snapping…I was essentially thinking…wtf? And I got a bit angry. I ended up snapping at her quite a few times. Yelling: why was she getting mad at me when I corrected her mistakes. We were both yelling now. And she got up and chucked all her books and everything else off the table. I was so pissed; she broke some of my things. I walked over, grabbed her by the arms and (regrettably) shook her, to get her attention. She was going crazy... She winced and cried out, pulling away from me; then began to sob, repeatedly. “Oo-uch, it hurts...I did-n’t mean to. I’m sor-ry…braking your stuff.” Her eyes were huge, like she was afraid. She was trembling. And I noticed how she looked a bit pale, and very tired. I was surprised at her reaction since I made sure I didn’t shake/hold her hard. I would NEVER purposely hurt any woman…especially her! She was holding her left arm to herself. And immediately I was apologizing and coaxing her to please let me see her arm. This only made her cry more. I don’t know what came over me, but before I knew it, I was on the sofa with her in my lap, stroking her hair and back as she continued to sob, “sorry”. She looked so fragile. I pulled her sleeve up. And when I saw the old (black&blue) bruises that marred her skin…some that looked like they were done a day or two ago, I flinched. I knew these weren’t my doing…you could tell they were a bit old. And there were more bruises but not on her arms. She wouldn’t look at me when I asked who did it (what happened)…just cried harder, hiding her face in my neck. After an hour of trying to calming her down, she told me it was “her fault” why her father lost his temper. She provoked him…The beatings started form her childhood. I don’t understand why she just doesn’t move out, she’s 21! But I didn’t ask. I couldn’t when she was hurt and crying like that. She’s staying with me for a while. And it’s extremely hard for me not to go and inflect murderous pain on her father right now! I don’t know what to do. But I care for her very much. So, I am asking you all…please, what should I do? What should I say to her?

Okay, my little sister was being a little dick and told her I liked her. So for about a month, she's positive that I like her.      We never really talk at all, but in the four classes we're in, we sit in the opposite corners of the room. We look at each other time to time, but that's it.      But what's throwing me off is that there's this other kid who I'm pretty sure likes her too and she talks to him.   I think she avoids me.   Her reaction when my sister told her I liked her was: She smiled. I don't know, that's what she told me.   I'm really stressing out over this, can someone help me?      And she's shy around people that aren't her friends. Like, she only talks to her friends, etc.      All we're really doing is looking at each other in class.      What makes me really unsure is that, I don't consider myself attractive. I have good hygiene, but I don't look good anywhere else and I could burn off some weight, but I can easily make people laugh.   It's not just her looks that I like, she's smart, and everything about her. I don't know what to do.      (Sorry, bit long. or too short.)
20090309124310AASAh9o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Difficulty accepting his child- a very complicated case?	im back togther with my first love. we were together for 5 years, we split for 1 yr. and then got back together on our 7th yr,   when we split he had a short relationship with a girl from his work. they were togther for 2 mos. i believe that iv always remained in his heart. in that 2 mos, she got that girl pregnant. but then again my first love had a job opportunity to work abroad, they tried to work on the relationship, but it did n0t last. and i still believe its because its me whom he truly loves. ... but then again we decided to got back togther last dec 2008, when he came to the phils to have his vacation, i was optimistic. but then, the lon distance adding up to the challenges for us, im starting to have second thoughts. i dont know if i can bear the reality that yeah, he has a child, and i think eventually he will long for that child. At this point he is still in denial, and is resisting his reality. But i know deep down his heart, he has the urge to be a responsible father to his little girl. I feel awful, that fact is im never gonna be first, its just a matter of time until he truly plunges into the feeling of fatherhood, i dont know what his plans are. i wanna stop him from reaching out to that child, but i know its not fair to the kid. Eventually hi will face his responsibilities. i know him. he is a good person.its just hard for me to accept all these because iv known him eversince before college. we had so many dreams, we dreamed of our future, how many children, a house and all he works, we were each others first. it couldv been a different story if the child came before we knew each other. but then again, i came first, and with just a little interval, came the baby. Its hard to adjust to the changed him. and now i dont even get the chance to interact with him physically because he's abraod, so perhaps so much has changed, and i can't even guage and experience what is him or who is he at present. all im holding onto is my hope and love, and his love for me.      he makes me feel he loves me, i know, but then i feel that its inadequate sometimes, we're too far from each other. he tells me that im free as i want to do, if there's another guy id meet he'd let me go, because he thinks i deserve better,.. but if i choose to stay he'll be happy. is that fair? isnt that giving me away? is he making excuses only?      what do you think, i desperately need your words of wisdom on the different points i raised.

20090309124946AACvpVh	Family & Relationships;Family	Sibling problems? Advice needed.?	Ok, so I'm in my late teens and live with my parents who are in their 60s.  I'm having problems with my sister who is in her late 20s. She recently moved back to our native city and her roommate (who is allowing her to live for free) says no company, no parties, no nothing.  So she solves all her problems by coming to our house everyday from 10 in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening (no she does not have a job).  She pretty much acts like she lives here, using the computer (all day), eating our food (therefore causing more dirt), etc.  And at first I really didn't mind until it became a daily habit.  But then I said ok she's looking for a job and when she gets one it'll be fine so no need to cause any trouble...But it's been three months still no job AND instead of just her its her and her friends!!  These grown women (literally knocking on 30) and they have no where else to go?  And God forbid we have our laundry out in our house when she's coming over.  She threw a hissy fit.  It's like she has no sense of boundaries.  And I understand she's lived away for a year and a half but we visited her every 4 months (and she didn't exactly live in the country).  Also it's not like she's coming over to be with us cause she missed us...it's because she's bored at home cause they don't have cable or internet and also cause she can't invite her friends over.  And she's made that blatantly clear.  HOW RUDE!  I'm getting to my breaking point.  But she doesn't respect anything I say cause I'm younger than she is.  My mom is in the early stages of alzeihmers and besides that I think she has selective memory when it comes to my sister anyway.  My parents are so wrapped up in trying to be supportive it's like they forgot they still have a daughter at home.  I know this is super duper long but one more problem.  My sister has been having some problems with her friends so she's been hanging out with mine since shes been here.  All my friends are older than me kinda closer to her age and idk I guess I'm kinda insecure about her like stealing my friends cause who'll need me around once they have the older version of me (which I hope I'm not but some people seem to think so).  So I got some friends who were my own age.  Actually a sibling of a friend of mine's boyfriend haha.  And we're super cool the thing is she's graduating next month and she lives a couple of hours away.  She invited me to come stay with her and come to her graduation and the party and my sister completely invites herself!  I was really mad.  I mean it's one thing if you start hanging out with my friends your age that you did not know until three months ago even when I'm not around...but an 18 yr old?  goodness.  I kinda feel like she's trying to take my place in life or something!!  But I really hope I'm never like this when I'm 28 goodness.  Please help!  ADVICE NEEDED.

20090309125346AArZaHN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage problems. Should I get divorced?	Today is an especially scary day. My husband started back to work last week and was expecting his last unemployment check today, so we could buy groceries and pay bills, you know how it goes, anyway, he didn't get his check. O.K. so you are saying what the french right? Well I have been with "Vinny" since 2003 and have never been loved so well by a man or scared of his anger. I started taking Xanax after I had a bad anxiety attack in 2005. He is always great until the subject of money comes up. He flips out when he realizes he is broke. He says how it sucks that he works just to be broke and I tell him, "welcome to the world" and then he says I don't understand because I don't work, as if that's the way I want it to be. He is a roofer and works only seasonally, I am unemployed and going to college for my bachelors degree in Business Management. Although I get income from survivor benefits for my children and have ALWAYS paid our rent since we got together, his job is to pay the other bills, more often than not I pay those as well, especially in his off months and yet he resents me for not working. I was laid off from my job ( a mortgage company, lol) in 2007 and have been unable to find another job.      So here I am broke every month and sitting in fear of how I am going to pull the next rabbit out of my hat to keep him from throwing a mantrum. He will get depressed and go to bed, get up go to work, come home and eat and go back to bed. And I cannot stand feeling as though I have done something wrong when it's an issue neither of us can control. I try so hard and have for the last 5 1/2 years to keep him happy, to take care of him, and to try to relieve some of his pressure ( he has no kids of his own). He married me with three kids and I guess supposed it was going to be a piece of cake. I just cannot get him to be the man I need him to be so I can stop feeling so anxious all the time and on the edge of a nervous breakdown. I feel I do more than my fair share and still...here I sit scared of his reactions to the news when he comes home. No, he has never hit me but he has thrown words sharper than swords aimed at my heart. I feel like a divorce is in order but I don't know. I always told myself if it's worth saving save it but this relationship has seen all its best days already I think because he won't grow up or mature until he sees what he has lost because of it. Right? Just in case you needed to know this info he is 35, almost 36 and I just turned 41. This is our first marriage. I have always been in long relationships (from 3 years to 11 years) so I think I have a pretty good idea how to do it, his longest relationship was 6 months. It just seems like if emotions aren't centered around him on a regular basis none of us will ever be happy, whether or not they are good or bad, he has to be the center of attention. This spills over into intimate parts of our lives as well. I am so confused and making myself even more so writing this. Advice anyone?

We're still married, but we've had two kids. We were so poor when we married that I never bought or wore any lingerie. Now, we're in our mid 20's and for the first time in our marriage he's gone away on a trip for a few weeks. I've been thinking about buying some to surprise him when he gets back, but I don't know if I should. He's in his mid 20's and doesn't exactly need anything to get excited, I've never worn it for him before, and I really don't know exactly to get.       Do men (even young guys) like to see their wives in this even if they've never seen them in it before? Does it excite even young guys? What do men like to see?

My cousin asked me for advise on the right thing to do with their money.  She was granted money for her medical disability 2 years ago and some told her that her husband is not entitled to that money.  I thought that whatever assets or money acquired during the marriage is to be split in half to both of them since they were still married at that time when she got the money.  I thought that everything they acquired, money, house and everything inside the house that was acquired during the marriage should be split in half but not an inheritance from their parents or gifts.  Please help me.  Need some legal advise here.

20090309125611AAlwc5V	Family & Relationships;Family	I live with my parent still, help please?	I just graduated from college, im 22 please dont fault me for living with my parents we have a good relationship where they allow me to live there rent free because im trying to build a strong future for myself by going to grad school. i feel like its time to move out now! here is my plan school cost me 6756 dollars/year and i would have to borrow money for my living expenses like rent ect.. 8220 dollars year. Then borrow 3411 for my bills for the year. That would be a total of 18,387 dollars for the year. Im going to work part time for spending money maybe to days a week then i would bring home 1000 a month home after taxes. The money that im getting will be used to save up for next year because the rest of my bills will be 206 dollars and i'll have less than 800 to pay with but im a savvy person so 400 a month will be saved for 12 months is 4,800 dollars and I'll borrow less money next year 13,587 or less. I only have about 12,000 in undergrad loans for the course of 4 years which is good compared to people with 80, 000. does this sound like a stable plan if not please feel free to cover things i may have not thought of. Im going to grad school to become an accountant.
20090309130017AAtmfQq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just wanna know what's really going on?	Ok I have a friend. I have know her about 4 years.She has had to move 10 times in 4 years.  In 2007 her daughter who was 16 had her first baby by her19 year old boyfriend. Ok now I know what was going Through my mind. I felt like she was a minor and  he needed to explain everything  to a judge. The law is pretty plain she's a minor don't sleep with her. Then I figured out why my friend really couldn't do anything. She allowed her 16 year old daughters 19 year old boyfriend to move in with them. Knowing she really did not spend a whole lot of time at home.16 year old gives birth to a baby boy       Fast~forward to 2008 her 16 year old daughter is now 17 and baby boy  is turning 1. The babies father is now 20 and has moved out of  state . 2 months before the baby turns 1 without the knowledge of my friend he moves back into her house. Her now 17 year old is now 7 months Pregnant with baby number 2 and living with her 20 year old boyfriend . This baby is a little different because the young mother was not only sleeping with  father of baby number 1 but another guy who is 20.. May 2007 baby girl is born. Now she has 2 children by 2 different MEN I put that in caps because  legally they are Men and she is still a child. 1 is from out of state the other is considered homeless so he moves in too. homeless  sleeps on the couch with his baby the other in bed with his baby and the young mother. Problems arise homeless one gets kicked out.       Fast~Forward 2009 baby boy (# 1) will be 2 in June . Baby girl  (# 2)  is 8 months Mom is almost 18 and you guessed in pergnant with baby number 3 due in June by homeless guy. None of these men are taking care of these babies or paying any rent.  I consider myself very laid back and I think about this whole senario (which by the way I hope you could follow) It's a mess. It's like creating generations of dysfuction or am I just a tight azz. I just see this whole thing as wrong I can't even hang out with my friend becaus I just wanna tell her go home home and straighten out your household am I wrong for feeling this way or is this family in need of therapy. I know who I feel carries some of the blame for this situation. Who do you feel might be to blame?

20090309130400AATP6zU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about dating sites?	about a year ago, I found where my husband had a profile on a dating website, and when I confronted him he swore he didn't do it, that his friend had set it up to be funny (they were out of town for their job). Later on I found a couple of more sites that had his profile on them, but he swore he didn't put them there. Is it possible if you set one profile up on one website, that other websites can get you information and create a general profile with your info onto their website, or is he just lying? because some of them just have basic info on there and no confirmation was ever verified for the acct.....

20090309125846AAArXzk	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I forgive him and give him another chance?	My guy friend and I have gone through a lot over the past few months. We about dated, but that didn’t work out so were just friends now. He’s been acting really weird, like he want talk to me a lot any more for no reason at all and he just acts like he doesn’t care about it or he doesn’t care about me any more.   He treats me like crap and it hurts.    So I confronted him about it.      He’s the main part of the conversation:   Me: Whats happened between us?   Him: What do you mean   Me: oh don’t play dumb. You know what im talking about we hardly talk anymore, things are different now and I don’t like it at all   Him: well don’t look at me   Me: your part of this situation and its like you don’t give a crap about me but you probably never did to begin with   Him: don’t even say that   Me: well that’s how it seems and how it feels   Him: sorry   Me: whatever you don’t care   Him: yeah I do but its not like you talk to me and when you do you always get mad at me so idk what im suppose to do. Keep talking and keep making you mad   Me: its just like I always have to talk to you first. Its like you don’t care if I talk to you or not. And like you don’t care cause you act like you don’t if you actually acted like you cared for once I wouldn’t get mad but you don’t so I get mad.   Him: Sorry   Me: when are you not sorry? All I hear us sorry sorry sorry. Act sorry for once.   He didn’t text me back.      We both are really busy and we hardly ever see each other at school so we don’t get a chance to truly talk in person, its annoying.       Well I figured if I want him to still be in my life I should apologize to him for going off on him, but I meant everything cause its true but I didn’t want it to come out like that.       So here’s what happened last night when I apologized, again it was through text..   Me: okay this is hard but im sorry. I meant every word that I said last weekend but I didn’t mean for it to come out like it did and it was kinda was like I was pointing fingers at you its just that I don’t want things to be so complicated between us   Him: What are you talking about    Me: ugh I shouldn’t have even tried   Him: Don’t even say its my fault you act like you hate me at school so yeah   Me: I’m not saying its your fault right now. How do I act like I hate you at school? I hardly ever see you.   Him: Yeah but when you do you put your nose up like your better than me   Me: I do not.   Him: Yeah you do   Me: whatever and I was trying to be the bigger person since I always have to talk to you first and try to work things out.   Him: To work what out? What is there to work out?   Me: I mean come on we don’t speak and when we do its always through text and we end up arguing. I don’t want things to be like this but apparently you don’t care   Him: Theres nothing wrong. We only argue because you bring up this same subject and why do you want to talk so much all of the sudden   Me: oh really? We argue more than just about this. Can I not try to fix things at all or do you want to go back to being complete strangers? Cause Id rather not   Him: We can be friends but I’m going to be so bye   Me: I seriously shouldn’t bother idk why I was so stupid to in the first place but whatever bye   Him: its not that I’m really going to bed   And about how he said I put my nose up when I see him, that’s not true cause when I see him I either look straight ahead, look at the ground or ill start talking to my friend, so I can tell you for a fact I do not stick my nose up at him.    He though stares at me whenever I'm near him..   What should I do now?   I want to fix things, cause if I don’t it bothers me, but I don’t know anymore..   I didnt want it to seem like I was pointing fingers at him, but he serisouly doesnt act like he's trying to have a relationship with me at all.   Should I even bother any more?       Sorry its so long, haha.

Well it kinda turned into a relationship but not official well now when we are at work and he looks at me I just can't look at him in his face,  and I just dont feel the same connection we had once before, and when he talks to other girls for long periods of time or laughs and jokes with them for long periods of time I start to feel depressed and sad and left out and put to the side.  someone why do i feel like this?

20090309125643AAqngO4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm thinking of divorcing husband I'm 21 and he is 75. I'm expecting a baby by him but he is to controlling?	I'm 3 months pregnant and been married a little over a month to my baby's father who is 75. He has become very controlling and mean to me. He gets mad when I don't do things the way he wants. I love him but I don't know what to do because we are low on cash and he won't let me work. I'm also thinking it could never work with our age difference, am I right?

20090309125830AAQwpmX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im friends with this guy, and i asked him out finally and... i need help!?	ok so He's a senior and im a sophomore.   last year we liked each other but were a little shy, and didn't talk in person very often, but we talked on AIM all the time..like two or three hours a night.   Then, because i was too shy to talk to him and hes too shy to talk to me, he told me (over AIM) that he didn't like me anymore and that we should stay as friends. (we were never really more than that, it was just like a 'i like you' and 'you like me' kind of thing.)   Anyway, so that was last year, and now this year, during the summer between my fresh. and soph. year, i saw him one day. he posted on my facebook wall AND IMed me that night to tell me he saw me, and that his bike chain broke. we didn't have any conversation other then that.   Then the first day of school he IMed me and said 'hey sophomore!' and i was like hey, whats up? and then he didn't respond at all.   He's done this a few times during the year...about every month or two, and everytime we talk its just him commenting on my away message or something and he never holds a conversation. Then, since i still really like him, and im not sure if he still likes me at all or not because at school he looks at me a lot, and we make a lot of eye contact but we never say anything. I decided to talk to him, so about 3/4 monthes ago i went up to him and talked to him, asked him a few questions. he talked back and then we split at the bottom of the stairs to go to our classes. two nights later i got an AIM from him saying 'i didn't expect you to talk to me blahblah' and then we actually had a 10minute or so conversation for the first time in almost a year.      I feel pretty stupid still liking him, when hes graduating this year and im not, so i decided i have nothing to lose if i make a fool of myself, hes leaving pretty soon for college anyway, and if he likes me then something could happen or i could learn that i dont like him that much. SO, i asked him if he wanted to go get some icecream (over aim) because im a chicken. :( and he never responded, so today, which was the day we would have gotten the icecream, i ended up going with a friend because he left and didn't go.      Now the problem is that i dont know if he got the message or not, because i asked him friday and he didn't respond at all over the weekend. If he did and he ignored it then whatever i know he doesn't like me and i can finally move on, but im not sure if he got it.    I want to talk to him about it, but i dont want to push the subject and make an awkward conversation but i dont want to never know.   I want to know if he got it and was ignoring me, or if he didn't for some reason.   anyone have any suggestions on helping me get to know him better, or how to find out if he got it or not?
20090309130708AAVSLMj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Pregnant with Husband's Best Friend! DEVASTATED!!!?	Please don’t judge me. I’ve been married with my husband for 9 years and we have 3 beautiful children together. But my husband has been suffering from diabetes and it has compromised his sex drive. For the past 3 years I have been driving to the city and having intimate encounters with other men. (Please don’t judge) I have not told my husband this. I believe if you truly love someone then you’d do anything in your power not to hurt them.      6 months ago my husband’s best friend and I have become intimate. We found out recently that I’ve become pregnant. I feel bad about betraying my husband. But I love both men. I don’t know what to do! I will not hurt my husband and tell him the truth! He is a good man. But I cannot say it is his child because he would not believe me. I am absolutely DEVASTATED about this. Help!!      Please don’t judge. I am a kind woman.

20090309130325AADf7Y0	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't want to loose my best friend after a break up!?	Me and the boy were best friends for 3 years. We would sleep over at each others houses, talk about everything, including the people we were dating or interested in. After having a fall out with my old roommate, he took me in. Soon after, we developed feelings for one another and began dating exclusively (to the relief of my other friends).       Now that I've moved out to my own apartment after a full year of living with him, (going on 3 months on my own!), our relationship had dwindled, he confessed not being in love with me, just content with me, and wanted his best friend back. I miss having him as a friend too, but I had fallen in love where as he never did. He has been an important part of my life and has obviously helped me through so much, but it's still painful to know I can't have him anymore.      The question, is it possible to go back to what we were, and how happy I was to have my best friend? Or is it unhealthy to continue talking to him?      I know a lot of people say to never be friends with your ex, but he was my friend first and foremost even while we were dating. It's only been a couple days, and I feel progressively less sore as each one goes on. We've even been talking and I've been fine.      Suggestions?

20090309130646AA7micJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	WHAT SHOULD I DO??!! Need help deciding to transfer or not...?	I am currently attending at and living at a small health school (about 2000 undergrad). I have loved parts of this whole experience so far but I have also hated others. I have 2 random roommates and we have definitely become friends but I think that is because I have wanted to make living together an enjoyable experience. I would very likely not be friends with the group of friends I am currently in if I was not living with or next to them. I am torn because in high school I had so many friends but never a "group" and for the first time I feel like part of a group, but only on the exterior. The problem is, this has been in the back of my mind all year and I have never been fully happy at school so far. I am very close with my family and my sister and I are the best of friends (She is 23, I'm 20). I feel the most confident and happy when I am hanging out with her and her friends because I have ALWAYS gotten along better with people who were older than me. I think this is because I am more mature than most people my age and I am more conservative and stick to my morals and values. My "friends" are all the complete opposite of me and it has often been difficult to put up with their trashy dancing/talking/ and overall behavior (esp when we are in public). I love them for who they are but I think that they have held me back from meeting a nice guy when I show up to a party or walk around campus with a group of girls talking loud and obnoxious about something inappropriate.       Okay, the main issue is that my current school is small so it is basically impossible to meet a new group of friends. ALSO I just met a really nice guy but I am too ashamed to introduce him to my friends which sounds awful, I know. He, however, goes to a big, fun school and has a huge group of nice friends. I wish I could say the same. I am nearly positive that I want to transfer schools but I am scared to be a transfer student. I don't want to be a freshman all over again and I think most people will already have their groups of friends made so I really don't know what to do... make the most of the fun times with the friends I have now or transfer and hope to start fresh?? I am also pretty sure I want to change my major so that would impact the transfer... any advice would be great...

20090309131411AAViIoS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is he back of me?	I caught my boyfriend chatting online.When i questioned him,he said that,he will stop it.later,he said he stopped using that chat id itself.I found him in invisible mode recently,he is using the same id.I am in visible mode but even then he didn't ping me.I tried to break away from relationship many times due to his attitude.But,he says sorry and goes to the extent of crying,pleading,asking me not to leave him.I don't understand,when he is so much interested in other girls,why does he want me back?
