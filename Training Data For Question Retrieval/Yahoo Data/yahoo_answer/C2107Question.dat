20090227075349AAfbHIf	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	It was as though someone had kicked me in the stomach when my husband accidentally left his hotmail open and I?	saw hundreds of emails to other women AND men arranging meetings for 'fun'.   I have been very open minded and thought we had a good sex life and now feel so betrayed.   I had a feeling something was not right when he was spending so much time on the Internet and clearing 'History' afterwards.   I confronted him with it and he denied everything, saying it was only fantasies over the Internet and that he never actually met up with anyone.   We have been married for 29 years and he's always been a great husband and Father but I don't know how to get past this, I feel I will never trust him outside of the house.

20090304152718AAW9cqi	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Other - Yahoo! Mail	Is this e-mail real or a scam?!?!?!!?	Dearest In Christ, May God be praised!!! I am Mrs. Fatima Iyesa Ismiana from Kuwait . I married to Usman Ismiana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2005.We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems when my! late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $15million dollars (FIFTEEN million dollars) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently , my doctor told me that I had aterminating illness (cancer) thatwould last for the next four months.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness,having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization and a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches,orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible.I took this decision because I don't have any child to start from and where I will stop and my husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this m o! ney will be used in an unholy manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer Barr Brown Nelson because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm. May the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. Amen. Yours faithfully,Mrs.Fatima Iyesa Ismiana.         No idea who this person is never knew him\her is this for real? i ain't buyin it.

Okay.   so i woke up five days ago with a little sore throat.  that night, i felt really sick and my temperature was below my average temperature.   Then i went to bed super early and woke up sunday with NO VOICE at all.  it's continued and is now wednesday night and it seems worse than ever.   i can barely whisper and even the slightest physical activity makes me feel out of breath.  sometimes i can get like 2 words out with little difficulty but most of the time nothing comes out.   money's really tight so im trying to avoid going to the doctors if this is something that i can easily get over at home. just wondering if you guys maybe knew what it could be.           my dad thinks it's because i was screaming too much at the jonas brothers 3D concert on friday but im pretty sure that couldn't cause something to last this long. haha.      thanks guys!
