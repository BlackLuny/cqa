9X4MS2uxaa	"A was made of B" can be written as "A wa B de dekiteiru".  In an if-clause, "ga()" is used instead of "wa(ha)".  So your sentence can be expressed like this.

HvnFTNmCaa	I was raised Catholic and I say yes go ahead and do it. If it is your true will to partake, then who are they to not let you ?|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Of course, Jesus wasn't Catholic either and He created it! He was Jewish.|`|PpJEaCpCaa	i'm catholic and no you can't partake communion sorry|`|XsTJPMHqaa	No.     Please. please do not recieve Communion. To do so is to say you believe with Catholic teaching regarding not only Communion but every other teaching as well, and would be a sacralige in Our Faith.     Only Catholics in a state of grace may recieve Communion.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Your choice. According to Catholic church rules it'd be blasphemy. In reality the communion wafer is just a bland bit of squished bread.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Not in a Catholic church. It is possible, though, that you will be able to arrange to attend Protestant services from time to time.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Not in a Catholic church.  They are rather uptight about who gets to play cannibal with them.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	No. The Catholic Church does not allow you to partake unless you have been through Catholic confession, catechism classes, and confimation.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	No, you have to be a catholic (unless you pretend of course)|`|JDxpjT34aa	If you are not member of the Catholic Church you may not partake of the Eucharist (communion). Catholics who have committed mortal sin and have not confessed them are not supposed to partake in communion either. You can go to mass with your host family but when it comes time for communion it's perfectly acceptable to just remain in your seat.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	No, you cannot receive  without prior sacramental confession. You can go up for the priest to bless you, and make an act of spiritual communion. If you are not one of us, why would you want to receive our Sacrament illicitly?|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Yes you should be able to partake of communion and I cannot see why  you can't|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	If they know you're not Catholic, they won't let you and sometimes they deny it to other Catholics.  Christ told us to eat bread and drink wine in His memory.  He did not give other humans the right to cancel that commandment.  I've taken communion and I'm not Catholic.  I didn't tell them, because it's not up to any human to deny me communion.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	No, I'm sorry, but unless you agree with Catholicism on the Eucharist -- that bread and wine have been transubstantiated into the actual Body and Blood of our Lord and can state that publicly before the Church (which would mean you wanted to become Catholic), you cannot partake in Communion.    Oh -- if you are Eastern Orthodox, you can probably get permission to do so without converting.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	no, but can receive a blessing, by crossing your arms at your chest.  ask alot of questions to your family member about the church.  you might learn something..|`|AA12295528	you can't|`|utAWNRzfaa	Each church has its own policy on communion. In some churches you have to be a member to take communion. In others you only have to be a Christian. So I suggest you ask the church leaders/priests/your host family|`|lmAhmZfzaa	Nope.  big no no.      Although, if you are sneaky, they'll never know you aren't Catholic.  Just remember, cup your hands.  right under left.  priest will say, "The Body of Christ" and you just say "amen" then you grab it with right fingers and put it in your mouth, take a step to whichever direction your line is going, do a sign of the cross and walk on and do that same at the wine if you want.    EDIT:  for all the people who say you can and that you don't see why you couldn't, that is because you are Protestant and believe in "Consubstantiation"  Catholics believe in "Transubstantiation" which is a literal rather than metaphoric transformation from bread and wine to body and blood of Christ.|`|fA3fhfPSaa	You can't take communion in a Catholic church unless you are a baptized Catholic, have gone to confession, and have been given the catechism to understand the Eucharist.|`|8IHfytEvaa	I would suggest you ask when you get there.    Explain that you are a Bible believing Christian but not Roman Catholic.    You might even get them to help you find an Evangelical Bible believing church and take them with you.    Wouldn't it be neat if you could introduce your host family to a personal relationship with Jesus?    I think it would!|`|2H6j4j8taa	No you're not meant to.    I used to go to a Catholic school and when we went to mass, if you weren't confirmed into the Catholic Church you were meant to just have a blessing.|`|c73cac86901ee77d1060c607b55ea156aa	No - you don't confess the same beliefs that we have.  Please show respect to the Church.    Technically, you can go up for a blessing, but it would be better to stay in the pew and pray.|`|ExysmulYaa	What I know, one of the differences between Christian & Roman catholic  religion is in the taking of Holy communion on the part of R.catholic. With the present practice you can take / receive the communion with no problems.What is important you know why you want to have or receive  the communion and that you believe in it.  Please go on with your noble desire.    Ofel|`|ek6FQFiZaa	I'm in the process of converting from Protestant to Catholic.  Catholic belief in the Eucharist (loosely Communion) and Protestant understanding of communion are quite different from a theological standpoint.  Taking of the Eucharist in the Roman Catholic Church (as well as Eastern Orthodox) is the actual eating of the physical body and blood of Christ.  It is not viewed as a symbol the way Protestants see it. It's considered the most sacred of the 7 sacraments.  The theology I've given you is just the tip of the iceberg to Catholicism.  Therefore, it's true the Catholic Church will not knowingly allow you to receive the Sacrament.  I suspect that if you truly understand their belief in the Eucharist, you would not want to partake unless you believed the same.
3cc04ca1b70eaaef3ed7bb1c5dc9af35aa	dude, just be a dude!    Your sexuality doesn't have to dominate your entire existence, it's just one aspect of you that comes together like a marble swirl cake: it's so mixed in that you can't separate the flavors, but you can still tell them apart from the plain yellow cakes (all the straight guys).......if my analogy makes sense....    Just be....a guy. It's not that hard I guess. You're just another average joe who happens to like other guys. It shouldn't be a big deal. For anyone!|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	My best friend is a masc guy, so I can only tell you how he is, or at least how I precieve him to be.     That and, you should be who you are. Don't front - dont be a fake.     Ok. He works out a lot, watches what he eats ect, but works on his muscles.. really into his fitness.   - He waxes his chest but refuses to wax/shave anything below the belt!  - He has the gruffist manlyist (hahah so not words are they?!) voice ever.   - He hates "flaming fagg0ts", ie the type that will wave it in your face, that flip their wrists, attend gay pride, pride office, ect.    He just acts like a normal dude. I had NO idea he was gay until he told me.|`|AA10579309	More importantly, I'd say you should try to be accepting of the way you are.  When I or other gay men talk about how being masculine is better, I can't help but think that part of it may be leftover internalized homophobia -- the idea that straight (even if it's just in outward mannerisms) is better than gay.  Or that your queerness should be hidden, because it's shameful.    Now, I know: how can you help what you think is hot?  I think you can kind of nudge it in the right direction by learning and growing more accepting of queer gender constructs.  And you can do that by seeing and spending time with people who don't follow conventional gender norms.  It'll make you happier in general.    Ok, and after all that, if you still want to act more masculine, I'd say two things help:    1) Confidence.  Men don't care about what others think, whereas women and gay men do (especially gay men who want to act more masculine, haha).  Listen to what Beyonce says: "If I were a boy ... I'd roll out of bed in the morning, and throw on what I wanted, and go."  Men also don't hesitate as much when they talk, they don't soften the ends of their sentences, and they don't talk as humbly.  There are also nonverbal assertions of authority: sitting back, keeping the neck and head stationary, not touching/blocking your face, standing up straight but relaxed.    2) Pay attention to who you are modeling yourself after.  When you hear a woman speak, do you internally repeat her speech patterns?  What about when a man speaks?  Be aware of this type of "mental rehearsal" and try to pick who you want to emulate.|`|QJK1Uhdhaa	work out like any other man who wants to get ripped!  good luck babe :)|`|DuSFKygEaa	I'll answer your question as soon as I quit throwing up.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	its hard to tell when we really don't know how you act but its you sometimes you just cant change who you are!!! Be happy and just be you ..don't try and change just because you think that's the normal way to be.. but good luck|`|BfdMSoz9aa	Masculinity is relative. Trying to be something you simply aren't will ultimately make you less attractive. Not only will you be less attractive to others who it will be obvious to that you're attempting to act out of your element and comfort zone, but there's a good chance you wouldn't feel any more attractive independent of outside opinions because a lot of wasted effort goes into being something you aren't. I would suggest instead embracing the type of guy you are and being the best you can be to be yourself.    Femininity isn't strictly a look and is also a relative term. One can change they way the dress and work out but mannerisms that are ingrained into a persons mentality and daily life are difficult to change and shouldn't be changed unless they are destructive to oneself or others. You could change the way you walk, perhaps, and talk (though again its a lot of wasted effort) but changing the way you think is ridiculous, and ultimately if the outward appearance doesn't coincide with the fundamental actions, thoughts, projections and mannerisms of the individual, "masculinity" is still not achieved.|`|AA10552086	Don't act in any way like Chris Crocker and you'll be fine.|`|r4ghFtFGaa	Try working out. like buff up a lil   Don't dress femmie (if you do)  And try to get into sports|`|3qMdrFmkaa	get muscles and go me man u woman|`|YH8ERZg8aa	i feel you...22 and been through it already. it took me a good 2 years and for the most part i am complete....i want to say that the major problem lies in letting the fact that you're gay comsume you....there are other facets of your life and personality than being gay, i'm sure....that's the secret...and also, do not let yourself do things solely because you are gay.....don't watch miss america or wear makeup just because you think that's what gays do...do and act what you feel in your heart, not what the gay media and other gays in general command....you will be amazed at what will happen to you...and eventually, you'll find what you're looking for...a hottie :)|`|4kqvnQtUaa	I perfer the more fem guys,|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well go to ehow.com  I just added you to my contacts I am gay too.

However, don't stoop to their level, by saying negative hateful comments like "cheap mexicans" even if they were saying mean things to make you mad. It just makes you as racist as they are.     Why not try to get to know them better? Maybe, they do this because they're not educated and the only time they have one on one with an asian person is when watching a martial arts video on TV.     Show them that you're a human being that deserves respect and don't hurt your pride by stooping to their level.

This country is so weird and terrified and full of half crazy right wingers, I don't bet it will ever happen.  We are moving toward it though - medical marijuana has come to a lot of places - and we voted here to put marijuana on the lowest rung as a crime.  The cops went nuts and wouldn't do it - but later the court told them to obey the wishes of the voters.      The funny part about marijuana laws and frightened right wingers is that half these people smoke marijuana themselves - THEN - go out and bust stoners.  It's nuts.|`|y1gqPZ30aa	OH MAN, if he did that, that would be so awesome. Can you imagine, stoners driving the street only to find themselves an hour later on the same street? That would be hilarious!    SO YES weed  should be legalized. But, not because I want to see stoners everywhere so I can have a kick out of life everyday but because I want weed to be available for those who need it.  Like those that use it as a medicinal purpose. Weed is not as bad as what some try to convince us, but it does do some damage to the body with heavy uses. So if you want my opinion, it should be legalized but it should go for those who need it and not for those who use it as a tool for recreational fun.|`|vJzCrX88aa	lmfao    u cant be serious|`|qZNdKQPmaa	where did you hear that? really? i dont think that will happen. but honestly, who knows what the world is coming too.|`|AA10552086	Where did you hear that?

8yE2sYGeaa	The problem is that people knew the effects of pot as far back as the 1750s and that it is a terrible way to control people    Now, I will agree that the CIA got involved with both LSD and STP, but it has the same problem: you cannot control people with it|`|NScOteNraa	are you stupid?       pot is a plant, the government didnt make it its been around for hundreds of years wow.       its not even a drug.|`|NZjnMKXAaa	lol nope your wrong babe.  but nice story (:|`|anC0pVOQaa	sorry to say you are completely wrong. marijuana use has been around for years and years and years. it was found in nature and smoked by ancestors of yours many years ago. by the way, are you a pot head yourself? your theory not only doesnt make sense, it also has many grammatical errors.    lay off the pipe|`|KkZE2NDYaa	crackpot|`|uiVEaxjqaa	No it just grows that way its all natural well now  a lot of people put things in their weed. The first weed plant was discovered in Asia. Once the government realized drugs like LSD is one of them was bad after they tested it on like a million people then they realized that what they should use it for. And America doesn't like weed because the stuff people want well the good stuff isn't from here they want to put our kids on things like amphetamines and try to say they have ADHD and their pain killers and their sleeping pills. They don't want us smokeing weed because they can't control it like they want to. They want to control us.|`|ghItgMZxaa	its pretty clear you spend way too much time getting high lay off the stuff and save your last brain cells dude|`|AA10455120	This may be true of the harder drugs like LSD, but marijuana has been around for...centuries at least.     Trivia: George Washington grew it, and smoked it.|`|P1alfkrJaa	No, I'm sorry, but it's not a good theory - mainly because `pot' has been around a lot longer than the Vietnam war. Marijuana was first `classified' in the USA in either 1903 or 1907, can't remember which now, but it was made `controlled' in 1936 through the efforts of the USA Drug Czar of the government Harry J. Anslinger who feared `dope' not because of its properties but, rather, because it was used by black jazz musicians and Mexicans and he didn't want `that type' influencing white youths. In `36 Anslinger purposely mislead the Congressional hearing on marijuana and blocked witnesses who wanted to testify that the drug was relatively harmless.  The so-called `war on drugs' was a creation of the Reagan administration, is a COMPLETE waste of time and money and lives and accomplishes NOTHING because it is based on the lies of Anslinger, and Hearst of course, and draws its power from the ignorance of the USA populace on this matter.  FACT: Look into the early stages of any - ANY - civilization on this planet and you'll notice that, as soon as they have the basics of a society down, the first thing they devote their energy to is concocting an intoxicant. Even in this country - what's the first thing the Pilgrims do once they're settled here in 1621? They brew up beer.

May your Kingdom come and Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. May Your truth prevail and false doctrine fail. Open spiritual eyes, ears, and hearts to Your truth.    I guess that I equally pray for us all. I want God to fill us all with His Holy Spirit, that His love might so fill us that it flows out to all who come near. My praying is more of a us and we kind of praying, I include you all my brothers and sisters in Christ. I am confident that you also pray for me. Since that is what we have been told to do...    One of my devotions this morning was on this very thing, so I'll share it with you...    For All Saints  Waiting on God/ Andrew Murray  "Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed." (Psalm 25:3)  Let us now, in our meditation of today, each one forget himself, to think of the great company of God, saints throughout the world, who are all with us waiting on Him. And let us all join in the fervent prayer for each other, "Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed."  Just think for a moment of the multitude of waiting ones who need that prayer; how many there are, sick and weary and solitary, to whom it is as if their prayers are not answered, and who sometimes begin to fear that their hope will be put to shame. And then, how many servants of God, ministers or missionaries, teachers or workers, of various name, whose hopes in their work have been disappointed, and whose longing for power and blessing remains unsatisfied. And then, too, how many, who have heard of a life of rest and perfect peace, of abiding light and fellowship, of strength and victory, and who cannot find the path. With all these, it is nothing but that they have not yet learned the secret of full waiting upon God. They just need, what we all need, the living assurance that Waiting on God can never be in vain. Let us remember all who are in danger of fainting or being weary, and all unite in the cry, "Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed!"  If this intercession for all who wait on God becomes part of our waiting on Him for ourselves, we shall help to bear each other's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. There will be introduced into our Waiting on God that element of unselfishness and love, which is the path to the highest blessing, and the fullest communion with God. Love to the brethren and love to God are inseparably linked. In God, the love to His Son and to us are one: "That the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me, may be in them." In Christ, the love of the Father to Him, and His love to us, are one: "As the Father loved me, so have I loved you." In us, He asks that His love to us shall be ours to the brethren: "As I have loved you, that ye love one another." All the love of God, and of Christ, are inseparably linked with love to the brethren. And how can we, day by day, prove and cultivate this love otherwise than by daily praying for each other? Christ did not seek to enjoy the Father's love for Himself; He passed it all on to us. All true seeking of God and His love for ourselves, will be inseparably linked with the thought and the love of our brethren in prayer for them.  'Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed.' Twice in the psalm David speaks of his Waiting on God for himself; here he thinks of all who wait on Him. Let this page take the message to all God's tried and weary ones, that there are more praying for them than they know. Let it stir them and us in our waiting to make a point of at times forgetting ourselves, and to enlarge our hearts, and say to the Father, "These all wait upon Thee, and Thou givest them their meat in due season." Let it inspire us all with new couragefor who is there who is not at times ready to faint and be weary? "Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed" is a promise in a prayer, "They that wait on Thee shall not be ashamed!" From many and many a witness the cry comes to every one who needs the help, brother, sister, tried one, "Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord. Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that wait on the Lord."  Blessed Father! We humbly beseech Thee, Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed; no, not one. Some are weary, and the time of waiting appears long. And some are feeble, and scarcely know how to wait. And some are so entangled in the effort of their prayers and their work, they think that they can find no time to wait continually. Father, teach us all how to wait. Teach us to think of each other, and pray for each other. Teach us to think of Thee, the God of all waiting ones. Father! Let none that wait on Thee be ashamed. For Jesus' sake. Amen.  "My soul, wait thou only upon God!"|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	I pray much more for others. I seldom pray for myself although I do on occasion pray for myself. I pray for those who have harmed me because this is what our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ instructed us to do.|`|jcrPpPvqaa	Sometimes I do. But, I often find myself spending the most time asking God to change my heart, so I can live a life which reflects more gratitude for His mercy.

This word order is correct, too, but it's not the "natural" way of saying it, as if you wouldn't say it spontaneousely, but in a context. You put the accent on "verliebt" (in love). I've already talked too much: the difference between the two sentences is not that big, so other speakers of German may not see it in that way. ;-)    "In einen Dichter bin ich verliebt." = It's a poet who I'm in love with.

b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	We should try.  We should not instigate conflict.   We should love others like Jesus loved!      However, God has no problem with us stepping up to the plate when we are attacked.  Justified war is fin, unjustified war is sin.      The sad fact of life is that there are bad guys.  And God is a God of justice.      But we should not look for conflict, or look for war.  If it comes, we fight.  If war does not come, praise God for peace!|`|DHCwLBuwaa	I'm sure that Jesus (and I'd think that everyone can agree here), whoever he really may have been, wanted mankind to live peacefully.  He didn't wish for huge churches or cults or religious wars.  Unless I'm mistaken, he wanted his followers to be meek, respectful, understanding, and loving.  Not oppressive or arrogant like so many on this Earth, claiming to be of his faith when most of what they do and say contradicts his teachings.|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	As they say, you don't find too many atheists in fox holes. You will find that many of our top military leaders are Christians. And I am glad for that. Jesus didn't tell the Roman soldiers to quit the military when they asked Him what they should do as far as reasonable service. He told them to be content with their wages. And that's all. Soldiers are needed and are accepted by God as a profession and a necessity in the world. Actually the more Christians, the better. There aren't as many atrocities.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Holy crap what a scarry, scarry thread...    Christians in here... ALL OF THEM... saying that Jesus supported wars, retribution, and revenge!

It would not have been Christian to sit back and refuse to fight in WWII. Those people needed help.

The world would like nothing better than for Christians to give up the rest of our rights like we have the prayer in school issue and the ten commandments not being displayed publicly issue, however if we don't fight for the things of God who will?

Revelation 19:15, speaking of Jesus, declares, "Out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron scepter. He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty." Ecclesiastes 3:1, 3, & 8 say, There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavena time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to builda time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. Daniel 9:26 says that war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. Matthew 24:6-8 says, You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.    Jesus Himself said, Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law---a mans enemies will be the members of his own household (Matthew 10:34-36). From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it (Matthew 11:12).  We are commanded to hate what is evil and cling to what is good (Romans 12:9). In doing so we must take a stand against what is evil in this world and pursue righteousness (2 Timothy 2:22). Jesus did this and, in so doing, spoke openly against the religious and political rulers of His time because they were not seeking a righteousness from God, but rather of their own making (Luke 20:1-2, Romans 9:31-33). Zeal for Gods righteousness consumed Jesus, and He was not afraid to stand up against those who opposed and dishonored His Father (John 2:15-17, see also Numbers 25:11). Those who hate Him He will repay to their face by destruction; He will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate Him (Deuteronomy 7:10). While people are saying, Peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape (1 Thessalonians 5:3).  The Old Testament is full of examples of how God used his people in war to bring judgment upon nations whose sin had reached its full measure (only a few examples: Genesis 15:16, Numbers 21:3, 31:1-7, 32:20-21, Deuteronomy 7:1-2, Joshua 6:20-21, 8:1-8, 10:29-32, 11:7-20). In raising the moral consciousness of the world, God must take the people as He finds them and introduce principles of righteousness within the moral framework with which the people can identify. We can be assured though, that it is always with justice that God judges and makes war (Revelation 19:11). For we know Him who said, It is mine to avenge; I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge his people. It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Hebrews 10:30-31). What we can learn from these and other Biblical examples is that we are only to wage war when it is the will of God and not at our own discretion (John 18:11, Numbers 14:41-45). It is Gods choice as to how and when He brings judgment of sin upon this world and its inhabitants, to display His holiness. We are simply called to follow Him (Matthew 16:24-25).  All of this may sound contradictory to the teachings of Jesus, God Himself, in which He instructs us to love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 19:19), turn the other cheek (Matthew 5:39), as well as the command, you shall not murder (Exodus 20:13). After all, we are told that God is love (1 John 4:16) and Blessed are the peacemakers (Matthew 5:9). The Bible also says in 2 Corinthians 10:4, For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine powers to demolish strongholds. While all this is indeed true, it helps in examining these seemingly contradictory concepts from an eternal perspective, that we may gain a more complete understanding for Jesus purpose in coming to this earth.  At the beginning of human history, God commanded mankind to rule over the earth (Genesis 1:26-31; Hebrews 2:6-8). When man disobeyed God, sin entered the world (Genesis 2:17, 3:6-7). By this one action, man sold his right to rule this world to Satan and at the same time became captive to sin himself (John 8:34, 12:31; Romans 6:6; Ephesians 2:2, 6:12). As a result, sinful men live in a world full of corruption, each person doing what is right in his own eyes, the whole time being led astray by their own evil desires (Psalm 8:6, 51:5; Proverbs 14:12; Genesis 3:17; Romans 8:20, James 1:14-15). It isnt hard to see that the whole world lies in Satans power (1 John 5:19). Even Jesus did not dispute with him over the fact that he ruled the kingdoms of the world (Matthew 4:8-10). Therefore, there can be no lasting peace or restoration of the land until Jesus returns to redeem the land and man (Galatians 4:4-5).  Jesus came in the likeness of mankind, while still retaining his full authority as God, in order that He might redeem men from their sentence of death, and re-establish, for the believer, mans authority to rule (Philippians 2:6-8, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 54-57, Revelation 20:6). When Jesus died on the cross, He purchased back the land and mens souls from the dominion of Satan through the shedding of His own blood, the purchase price for redemption of mans sin (Hebrews 9:22, Acts 20:28, 1 Peter 1:18-19, 1 Corinthians 6:20). A day is coming, after severe judgment upon the earth, when Jesus will break the seal of the deed and end Satans rule (Revelation 5:1-10, 6-18, 19:11-21).

It's been a quick read and would recommend it if you are interested.     I do believe that philosophy is for the more wise then the righteous.|`|kppEhBBgaa	It's a great way to attempt to answer some of life's toughest questions.|`|81sucrAEaa	it's absolutely magnifiscent (typo)|`|84fm2GXOaa	i think its one of the most unique things that makes us human....|`|feaac89a2e462bb3b9302cfa8b53ca0caa	Well i am a christian and i took philosophy class in college last year.  i think it is a fun class and makes you think a lot! :)|`|jPxkg7vKaa	Load of useless jargon to me.

But I wonder if the science mind is not ignited by philosophical thought. We need the sciences for medicines, etc. But we need the philosophical (rational) mind to make use of it correctly. Back to   1. We need science, first.

AYs6iFlLaa	Ahh no, they did not change their sex, merely stopped their sexual desire.    The reason for stopping such desires was to be able to care for or be a slave to women. Also men who were impotent and celibit were considered eunuch.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	I don't know that eunuchs always had a real choice in the matter.  It was a form of slavery.  Eunuchs weren't born with gender-identity issues.  They were just forced to undergo that operation.    A transgendered person today suffers gender-identity issues.  For example, a boy may feel more at ease being "one of the girls".  That is just a very basic example for the scope of this forum and is not meant to be taken at face value.  If you want to know more you will just google it.|`|yAvTxh47aa	http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/ SERIOUSLY.    That being said, no, transgendered and eunuch aren't synonyms.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	Most likely.  A eunuch was a slave and slavery is acceptable according to the Bible.

They dressed and acted like men.    Although he might have sounded like a woman.|`|utAWNRzfaa	1. I don't recall eunuchs in the Bible  2. Transgender is not equal to eunuch. They are quite different.  3.

Nor did eunuchs live their lives as a different gender then the one they were born to. Nor do trans-gender necessarily undergo sex reassignment (which is not the same as being made a eunuch)

For instance, in UK there are regional signs. I suppose they are much like our dialects. Mostly they are similar but it can prove a challenge to a hearing person who goes from one region to the next when they're trying to learn sign language.  One of my BSL teachers came from a region that was different than where I lived so some of the signs I use are slightly different than people in my area.  I am unaware whether this is so in other countries.  I would imagine that deaf people would find it easier to communicate with a person from another language than a hearing person would because some signs must be similar ('eating' or 'walking' for example)|`|u6K5TtRlaa	No, definitely not.    There's ASL, American Sign Language; JSL, Japanese Sign Language; ISL, QSL, FSL, BFSL, prettymuch a different Sign Language for every different verbal language.|`|GPznIhzMaa	No, there's American Sign Language (ASL) used in the U.S., British Sign Language used in the U.K., etc.

Edit= Oglum you are so ignorant. so it is ludicrous that a black person has a name with the La prefix. so is it ludicrous for Latinas and Latinos with significant black blood to have the same prefix?. everything doesn't cater to you or your race. a name doesn't belong to a race its all cultural so stop hatin.|`|3kNncEXpaa	mines does       Lauren...does that mean im ghetto?|`|55AOkGa5aa	culture|`|nWdtTIDyaa	what can i say, i have no idea!!!|`|DmjSkZSTaa	Culture??? i think those names are ghetto...not the person..the name.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	No black females in my family have "La" at the beginning of their names. Neither do any of my friends either. So much for your stereotype.|`|uR3WHF9jaa	The word LA means THE in french (and spanish,italian,portuguese), and it is put before a common name or certain places names ( La France, La Chine, La Turquie,etc )...And it is used only for feminine gender names ( in french, common names have genders, unlike in english)   It's really weird, because it suggests that people with such names feel the need to be important, as if they were unique...That reflects a certain inferority complex...  Just imagine , if a French girl had a name like "TheMichelle" or "TheMarie"...You would certainly mock them...

01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	Antichrist can mean not only against and opposite of, but also in place of."  The basic belief of the above denominations may be valid, but what has been added to the basic simplicity of the Gospel of Christ?  Whatever is added, complicates and takes away. If the Lord had thought we needed something in addition, He would have provided it.   But He gave us exactly what we need.  We have God's Word.  We have the Holy Spirit and we have the fellowship of fellow believers.    Romans 1:16  For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto  salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.|`|k03dYskYaa	What the Bible teaches:  2?John 7: Many deceivers have gone forth into the world, persons not confessing Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. (Notice that the many antichrists of 1?John 2:18 are here referred to collectively as the antichrist.)    Some of those identified as antichrist    Persons who deny that Jesus is truly the Messiah  1?John 2:22: Who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ [or, Messiah, anointed one]? This is the antichrist.    All who deny that Jesus is the unique Son of God  1?John 2:22: This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son. Compare John 10:36; Luke 9:35.    Apostates  1?John 2:18,?19: There have come to be many antichrists .?.?. They went out from us, but they were not of our sort.    Those who oppose Christs true followers  John 15:20,?21: If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also .?.?. But they will do all these things against you on account of my name.    Individuals and nations that oppose Christ as King or that themselves falsely claim the Messianic role  Ps. 2:2: The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [Christ, or Messiah].  See also Revelation 17:3,?12-14; 19:11-21.  Matt. 24:24: False Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.  This is what Jehovah's Witnesses believe, and honest Bible students.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	The BIBLE says that there are many antichrists and that they are already in the world.    Roaming around in this forum confirms it.|`|r8a0mIYEaa	the what?......who cares?|`|7fgATXX2aa	I don't get into the religion arguments, but I have done some surface research on the anti-Christ and i have been led towards the catholic church in its entirety as having fulfilled every prophecy about the anti Christ, they are obviously not him but its worth looking into.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	I don't think Hindus and Jews have an anti-Christ figure.    Catholics really don't think about it too much.  We are of the mentality that we shouldn't bother thinking about it much - rather, it is better to just be prepared when the time comes.    7th Day Adventists used to think the anti-Christ was the pope.  This was based on some disinformation (like the Church being based in Rome instead of Vatican city and "Vicarius Filii Dei" being a title of the pope).  The idea has been officially abandoned by the SDA church, but some members still hold to it.    Baptists, Methodists, and Lutherans all vary greatly in their thoughts on it.  Some think it is Obama.  Some thing it's the pope.  Some think it's the NEXT pope.  But mostly, they really haven't thought about it much.|`|LyPVlMl0aa	Im the antichrist...    Come get me    lulz

Sit down and read Revelations and see if you can find any of the statements you claim..

The Bible says that he will make the peace agreement with Israel or be an instigator in making peace work and the signing of the agreement for 7 years. The spirit of the Anti-Christ is in the world today and things that we hear about the computer chip being implanted in humans, I believe is a pre-cursor to when the Anti-Christ has everyone take the mark of the beast, to be able to buy and sell. When 3 1/2 years of the 7 has passed the Anti-Christ turns on Israel and breaks the agreement. The Bible says he will gets killed but is resurrected (in mimicing Jesus' resurrection). I believe this is when Satan takes control of the Anti-Christ and starts attacking anyone that opposes him.|`|bl0RZJrDaa	Obama = 666?|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Hes called the beast of Revalation and will get power from the European Union which is a revived Roman Empire.

Caesar's evil great grandson.|`|9hHHU6QGaa	there is no satan|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	I have not yet found where Satan will create a one world government in the bible.  Are you sure its there?  Why would Christ say "give to Caesar what is Caesar's" if Satan will create a one world government?  Everyone is busy looking for a one world government while Satan is busy working on a one world religion.  We're all looking behind us for Satan while he is parked and setting up camp right in front of our face.     There is an anti-Christ religious movement who's stated intentions are to convert the world to their religion.  Islam.   And they do and will subdue those who dont.   The Mosque on the Temple Mound has written in its interior "God forbid He have a son".  If that isn't 'anti-christ' i don't know what is.   A peace treaty that WILL work and .... that means what?  I think the wording is that there will be no peace.  And uh ... there is no peace.    Satan rose in 688 when the Mosque was built on Gods holy ground in Jerusalem on the temple grounds.  Jews and Christians haven't been able to worship freely ever since.  His prophet, Mohamed (the man your looking for) - came on the scene, molesting, murdering and steeling ... and has had a growing group of faithful followers, who will die for him ever since.

pw4Cb45Kaa	Yes!  Three times!  I thought my world had come to and end; I was a lost soul with no direction and no will to live.  For some reason God rejected me and decided to keep me here in this harsh world to finish something only He knows what.  So, I wait to hear for His direction to lead me to do my deed in this world.  I can only hear His demands because only a person who is truly secure in his/her identity can afford to take the role of a servant.  I am truly secure with my identity with God and Jesus Christ as Our Savior and Lord and I will take the role as a servant.  I have been chosen to know wisdom and knowledge of the spirit.    GOD BLESS!   AMEN!   SHALOM!|`|HdmlZdyHaa	If you want the truth yes and only once.     I did because my life was sucking and I felt like no one cared. I moved to a new school, I had no friends. My parents were in custody court over me, my mom had a new live-in boyfriend my dad got remarried. I felt no love at home. I just wanted it all to end. But luckily it didn't and I find my joy at school.      If my mom wants to throw her life away, fine by me as long as she doesn't drag me down. Neither of my parent's homes are too great, but I'll work with what I got and enjoy it while I can.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	Years ago my doctor prescribed Zoloft to me.  I was having some issues and needed counseling, but she thought I needed medication instead.  It made me suicidal.  Come to find out, that is a side effect in some people.      I never once acted on it and stopped taking the pills after 2 months.  However it was very scary to think what I may have done if I was actually suffering from depression.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Even though I've been a Christian a long time, last year I became very depressed - thinking my life was going nowhere and that nothing I did mattered - and almost did it. God interfered, though. I can't really explain it, but I could almost hear Him screaming "Don't do it!" and I just broke down, fell on my knees, and cried.     Now and again I get tempted, but nothing like last year. God and my parents have helped me not to lose hope.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Yes, I have, on more than one occasion. Periodic suicidal depression is a feature of my mental illness. It is only by the grace of God and a high tolerance to medication that I survived the attempts. Now, I am more in tune with my illness and I know when to get a medication adjustment or check myself in to the hospital before things come to a crisis.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	The simple answer is no.  I have never attempted or planned suicide.  I also think that in most cases attempted suicide (as opposed to properly executed successful suicide) is ultimately a pretty selfish gesture.  I understand some people have mental illness, and others have terminal illnesses and in those cases some people may consider a properly executed successful suicide a relief from their misery filled state of existence.      However, people who deliberately perform a half hearted attempt to kill themselves, or who continually dwell on whether they should kill themselves or not, are primarily just selfishly seeking attention or intentionally moping about in self pity.  The answer in almost all of these kinds of cases is that the individual just needs to redirect themselves into more positive modes of thinking and action.  I'm not saying this is easy to accomplish, but talking to someone on a suicide hot line is a good place to start.      I understand that people, and teenagers in particular are subject to periods of depression in their life.  Sometimes a person's circumstances my feel particularly dire such as losing a job, doing poorly in school, breaking up a relationship, or having a dysfunctional home life.  These are all periods in a person's life that can be survived with some positive thinking.  The trick is learning that emotional response does not have to trigger inappropriate action on your part.      I hope this helps.|`|DArAz67Caa	NO-----as a soldier of God----I DO NOT SIN|`|2CBxqNcaaa	No, but I am paid very well to cheat death.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	Years ago, almost took pills but didn't.  My brother walked into the room and I hid them. I guess he saved my life in a way and I count it as a suicide attempt because I had made the final decision to take the pills, even though my plan was spoiled.     Why? because I was in a profound state of depression and had no idea what was wrong with me (pre-diagnosis)|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Yes, a couple times long ago.  I fell for the demonic belief that homophobia is moral and allowed others to dictate morality to me.  Once the Holy Spirit led me to the conclusion that God loves me and all His gay children, I never had the desire again.      One of the fruits of homophobia is suicide.  Bad fruit cannot come from a good tree.|`|N3BXYCYUaa	Thought about it... but never tried it directly... more in a roundabout way.  Such as deciding to party like everyday was my last, consuming every bit of alcohol and drug I could find and not really caring if I did die.  So not your usual definition of suicide...more of a morbid, non-caring lifestyle that I still stumble back into once in a while.|`|nN3mHJVhaa	No, but when I was very young, selfish, and self centered I thought about it constantly. In junior high especially. I would always think about it, everyday. I was so depressed and I had no real reason to be like that. I was socially awkward and afraid, and I was just flat out whiney, selfish, and I was responsible for my depression, not God or other people. And I came to realize this, and I'm glad I did. Now I am a much happier person and I would not give up this wonderful life for anything. I look forward to each passing day and the universe continues to amaze me with all it has to offer. I feel so amazingly enlightened to have been placed on this Earth some how and its great that I am able to live and breath and think how I want, and I can live how I want and I can really be happy.     Some people just need to get over their petty insecurities and live. I understand some people have real pain, but others are just selfish and ungrateful. I am glad I am no longer like that and I would not commit suicide or recommend it to anyone.|`|C37kzsTXaa	too much crap in my diet|`|AA11736322	suicide is sin|`|r8a0mIYEaa	"NO-----as a soldier of God----I DO NOT SIN"      not a liar either,....lol|`|BZEN8QXbaa	Yes,it was after i was raped...|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Suicide is a form of mental illness.

I was being molested/ abused in various other ways.|`|p4hWHIN9aa	No never tried, but did want to die once, around age 15. I actually prayed that God would kill me.... (good thing God says no sometimes!)  Because I was being abused and manipulated as a teen, felt like I was going to have a total emotional and mental breakdown, to say the least. Didn't see any way out at the time.   Fortunately God blessed me and I did get out - left for school with a scholarship, finished, lived on my own. Very happy now as an adult.|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	Yes.  I am alive though, by the grace of God.  God saved me, and not just physically, but spiritually.  It was soon after that I turned to Jesus.  And I am a new man in Christ.  Jesus's love is more than I have ever known, and more than you and I can comprehend because it is so great.|`|LqyOHY37aa	Yes, many years ago when I was 16. Depression and many circumstances I would rather not get into were my reasons.|`|AVAwtoVTaa	I have never tried myself, but i can tell you why it happens.    Those people who are unable to see the positive side of life or the positive side of their issues or struggle in life, are the ones who tend to commit suicide. It can either be instant decision or can be a thought process developed over time. What I can tell you is that there is a brighter side to everything. It all matters how we take life. There is always a solution for everything. Sometimes its just our patience that's being tested and we have to stand firm in such times.     Specially if you believe in Jesus, its more simple , because the Bible teaches us that God will deliver his people out of all their trouble. And God will make a way when there seems to be now way, He works in was we cannot see.. he will make a way.    If you are going through some issue or have thought about suicide, never give into it.

You can make it through this situation|`|hQDapmICaa	I contemplated it once because of love failure.|`|MeEAPsSLaa	never tried.    but after watching japanese movie, 'suicide club', very messy video, make me miserable and very discomfort very angry, very depressed.................................. like want to take a knife and cut something|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	No Way.. never.

ixFbNr4taa	I am assuming that you are refering to an story from Arthurian legend?  Depending on which tale you are reading -- the Lady of the Lake can be several different women and do several different things.    Usually, The Lady of the Lake is the one who gives King Arthur his sword Excalibur.  She is also among the queens who escort the dying king to Avalon after the Battle of Camlann.  She is also often cited as being the lover of Merlin the magician and later imprisons him by magic.|`|AA11403222	The only legend regarding a Lady of the Lake I know of is in the Arthurian Legend.  She 'chooses' Arthur in that she provides to Merlin the Sword Excalibur, which she requires Merlin to return to her once Arthur is dead.  Since Merlin is no longer around when that happens, Arthur instructs Bedeviere to return it instead.  If the legend you are looking for is different that this, I am sorry, I cannot help you.
ixFbNr4taa	From the web.............    The Romans would apply an oil to their body (or if you were rich, a slave would apply it for you) and begin their daily exercise. The exercise would take place in the large courtyard in the center of the bath house called the palaestra. Exercises would include weight lifting, running, swimming and ball playing.    Once exercise was finished, the oil that had been put on the body would be scraped off with a metal instrument called a strigil. At this time, bathing would begin. Throughout this process, they would walk through a series of rooms which varied drastically in temperature. These rooms included a tempidarium which was the warm room with heated floors and walls but without any water, the caldarium which was the room for the hot bath and the frigidarium which was the cold bath room.    You may think that, after the baths, the Romans would head home. Actually, once they finished bathing, they would read in the library, buy food from a vendor, walk through the gardens or watch a performance by an acrobat or a juggler.

Like in all matters of life, when we need  the Truth, the real answers, we have to go to our final authority in all  matters, the Bible. One of the greatest weapons of satan is division. The  enemy has figured out every way imaginable to divide men. Since virtually  the beginning of the human experience, man has fallen into satans trap of  division based on the color of a persons skin or their ethnic origin.  While racism has always been an issue in this country, the fact is it is an  issue in every country. This divisive mindset is not unique to the United  States. Sadly, in some form it is practiced everywhere on the planet.    Since the racially incendiary remarks by B. Hussein Obamas pastor of 20  years, Dr. Jeremiah Wright, became such a big part of the Presidential  campaign a few weeks ago, it has sparked a national dialogue on race. A few  weeks ago Senator Obama gave a speech on race that was lauded by many.  Those who made such a big deal over his speech were most likely swayed by  the fact he was dealing so openly with a taboo subject few will talk about.  However, his speech was hollow, self serving, and nothing more than a  political move to do damage control because of his close association with  Dr. Wright.    B. Hussein Obamas race speech did NOTHING to help people or this nation  deal with this scourge, since the victory over racism isnt going to come  from the flowery words of a politician whose only motive and goal is to get  elected President. No my friend, if people and this nation are going to  truly get victory over racism, it has got to come from an understanding of  what God says about this issue and by people who are willing to follow what  God says in the Bible.    If Senator Obama had intended to really take a leadership role on the race  issue, educate the nation and provide real answers for how to get victory  over this inhumane way people treat others who are different than they are,  then he would have told people what God says about racism. God says MUCH  about this issue, but Senator Obama didnt find it worth including even one  verse of Scripture.    *THIS IS WHY I TELL YOU SO OFTEN THAT IT WILL NOT BE A POLITICIAN, BUT A MAN GOD HAS CALLED TO LEAD PEOPLE IN THE WAYS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS!!!    The fact is, there is only one race, the human race! People may have white  skin, black skin, brown skin, yellow skin, red skin, or any other color  skin, they may have different ethnic backgrounds, but they are all part of  the same race, the human race! The Bible says that ALL MEN are created in  the image of God. God created all men equal. I tell you frequently that  satan is the great perverter. It is satan, not God, who seeks to divide men  by their skin color, ethnicity, financial means, and any other way you can  dream up to divide people. God created men equal to live in harmony with  one another. It is satan who introduced division into the human experience.    In Gods plan of redemption, there is no division. John 3:16 says that God  so loved the world, ALL men. It says that WHOSOEVER BELIEVES. That is a  universal call to ALL MEN regardless the color of their skin or where they  live. In 1 John 2:2, it talks about how Jesus laid down his life for  EVERYONE. Everyone means ALL MEN, the entire human race. This satanically  inspired way we have of dividing ourselves through racism, prejudice, and  discrimination all make a mockery of what Christ did on the cross. He  faithfully and obediently went to that cross to die for the sins of ALL  MANKIND.    That is why all of the black pastors I know repudiate the false black  liberation theology Dr. Jeremiah Wright has been teaching for over 3  decades. Wright is actually a student of James Cone who made this perverse  theology popular in the 60s that teaches the Bible is the basis for blacks  to be liberated from social, political, economic, and religious bondage. B.  Hussein Obama is a liar when he states he never heard the types of comments  made by Dr. Wright the media has been playing, since that is the  foundational teaching of the black liberation theology Wright has been  preaching in Chicago for over 30 years.    The fact is the Bible DOES teach liberation theology, LIBERATION FROM SIN!!!  It was not written to people with dark skin, but to all people regardless of  their skin color. We are all part of the human race, which means we are all  born with the sin of Adam, we all sin during our life, and that is why Jesus  went to the cross. He gave His very life on that cross as the payment for  the sins of all mankind, that through faith in Him men might be find freedom  from their sins. There is nothing in the Bible to support this false black  liberation theology Dr. Wright preaches, since the liberation theology of  the Bible is about the freedom from sin for ALL MEN!

There was a commandment given to the Jewish nation to not intermingle with other nations once they crossed into Canaan. This commandment was given in order to protect the Jewish nation from other religious influences, a commandment that was soon broken. This had nothing to do with race, as the people in Canaan were Semitic also, just like the Hebrews.    Glocktwentyseven nailed this answer on the head.

This law was most strictly enforced during the Hebrew Conquest of Canaan, when Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised Land and subjugated the region through military dominance.    The reason for the law, was to preserve the Covenant that God made with Abraham, to ensure that the Israelites remained God's "Chosen People".    Intermarriage with people from "other nations" or "other races" would have allowed pagan cultural and religious practices into the Israelite nation, thereby undermining their dedication to God and their status as his Chosen People.    The problem with this commandment, is that modern day people have twisted it out of context to support a misguided concept of racial purity.    Even as a religious commandment, this law had it's exceptions.  If a person from the "nations" cleansed themselves and adopted the Abrahamic covenant, they could be considered by law to be one of God's Chosen, and be allowed to marry within the Israelite nation.|`|YSr8dm5faa	I commend you for  taking the initiative to question this claim and not being an example of someone being led by the blind.

Deism is a religious and philosophical belief that a supreme natural God exists and created the physical universe, and that religious truths can be arrived at by the application of reason and observation of the natural world. Deists generally reject the notion of supernatural revelation as a basis of truth or religious dogma. These views contrast with the dependence on divine revelation found in many Christian,[1] Islamic and Judaic teachings.    Deists typically reject most supernatural events (prophecy, miracles) and tend to assert that God (or "The Supreme Architect") has a plan for the universe which he does not alter either by intervening in the affairs of human life or suspending the natural laws of the universe. What organized religions see as divine revelation and holy books, most deists see as interpretations made by other humans, rather than as authoritative sources.    Deism became prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Age of Enlightenment, especially in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, mostly among those raised as Christians who found they could not believe in either a triune God, the divinity of Jesus, miracles, or the inerrancy of scriptures, but who did believe in one god. Initially it did not form any congregations, but in time deism strongly influenced other religious groups, such as Unitarianism, and Unitarian Universalism, which developed from it. It continues to this day in the form of classical deism and modern deism.    _()_    (edit) Try this test, it will match your personal beliefs to different major religions.  http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Q...|`|f90ca27c686e1316601b6836a8f2e32caa	sorry but if you don't care to worship or live for Him now what makes you think you can make it to or in heaven, this is kind of like a test for heaven    Heaven is all about worshipping Jesus  We cannot make it to heaven by simply beleiving, even Satan beleives in Jesus and knows He exists, that alone isn't enough and I pray for you that you will change    John 3:16    God doesn't just want you worship though, He wants a relationship with you, we should be willing to give Him our lives because He gave us His    also, God doesn't just live in the sky, He lives in the hearts of those who invite Him in, and a relationship with Him can be intimate and lovely|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	Deist or just a Theist.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	That sounds like Deism.. but do you think this god inflicts himself upon the daily lives of humans?

Agnostic are unsure of whether there is a God or their isn't.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	From the information you provide I venture to say that you are a 'deist' with a small 'd'.    An agnostic is one who does not know whether there is a God or not, whilst holding him or herself open to either and of the belief-unbelief spectrum.      It actually makes a lot of sense in a faith such as Christianity, because often the first step to belief is what we might term 'a whispering' of something inside us that helps us to be open to the possibility that God lives.      To worship God requires greater understanding of him than believing he is; that is that he exists.  Worship, another word for 'serving' God takes place spontaneously when a person come to know that God is interested in him or her personally and desires the best things for them.    When we learn that God has done wonderful things so that his children, that is us, can be led to salvation, and actually feel gratitude and love for God for his blessings, then we spontaneously worship him.    Faith is like a little seed.  Jesus likened it to a mustard seed, because although the mustard seed if small, a little larger than a sesame or poppy seed, when planted and nurtured it grows into a large plant that will provide shade from harsh sunshine in the same way that faith when it grows and is established provides us with shelter from life's storms, shocks, disappointments, and gives us purpose and direction, all of which provide for a level of happiness that must be experienced to be appreciated.

God is defined as something we worship.  If you do not worship him he is not your god.  There are many of these gods.  Worshiping is what makes them gods.  That's all that makes them gods.  To believe in god (Worshiping something) and then to not worship it is to argue against your own belief.  Psychology considers this unstable.      There is another God though.  He's different,  perfect, immutable, wisdom, supreme or ultimate in reality, the creator of all that is.  This God we do not define.  He defines us.  He is love.  Without Him we have no meaning.  Without worshiping Him we have no understanding of Him.  we cannot fully understand love until we worship it.  It's an abstract concept.

6kue5meiaa	The Bear-Walker tale is from Ojibway (Anishinaubaek) Native American Oral Mythology. It is a morality tale.     The Bear Walker comes from the shamanic "Bear medicine" that  is found almost universally throughout the indigenous ancient peoples not only of North America, but of the world. Bear is the one who can walk between the upper, middle and lower worlds. He is a friend and teacher, and also a guide to help people in their travels between the worlds. Bear is often seen as female, as well. She is the maternal one, the nurturer, the one who's focus is on home. Interestingly enough, Bear ... male or female ... shares this "home and protection" trait. Often seen as one who came from the sky/heavens to teach man to live in harmony with the mother Earth (home).    But these traditions can be confusing, as well. To some branches of the Ojibwa(y), the Bear is a positive symbol, but the Bear WALKER is negative, an evil sorcerer who uses the Bear Medicine for selfish purposes. As in so much of life, what Is simply is. It can be turned to good or evil purpose by the direction of one's heart and intent.     Bear medicine is extremely ancient, and for that reason very deeply ingrained in our cultural heritage as humans (of every origin) ... for this reason it is also considered a particularly powerful "medicine."    Some of the below sites may give you a beginners' overview to the Bear in the Shamanic tradition.|`|90MwwrSeaa	It is similar to a skin walker in that it is an evil practitioner of magic. They either shape-shift into a bear or inhabit a bear's body and use their powers (medicine) to bring illness or death to their victims. Some say that a bear walker must claim a body part from a victim they have killed. I think the purpose of this is either to increase the bear walker's power or prevent the spirit of the victim from getting revenge. This belief exists among the Anishinaabe Native Americans (Ojibwa, Chippewa, Ottawa).|`|jcO0oErWaa	no it doesnt|`|Z1Ivthddaa	Wish it did, how cool would that be?

Lately, I've been thinking about why we humans have to prove so much to this world when the only thing we're sure of is our own death. Why have we created such a dilemma out of money and love?  Are we just trying to feed our own desires? Or are we trying to make time pass?   I'm single, too. I don't need to be around people to be happy; in fact, I'm happiest on my own. I don't believe everyone has to be in love or a relationship. But I do agree they bring fun times and dramatically pathetic ones, too.

g4AAZRuxaa	It means God wants to help.|`|pO8OzblHaa	It's an expression used when you hope that something will happen even though it is highly unlikely.        Example:    You have a child that skips school a lot, but has a serious test one day the next week. The teacher is informing the parents and states, "I think your child could do really well on this test, God be willing they actually show up for once."|`|tl2pMkOcaa	It means that God has a perfect plan, but because of your incessant whining, God will do something else.    God allows a lot of horrible things to happen.|`|N8wutNoLaa	It means God will be willing.    Whether he will actually be willing or not is up to him, ahaha.|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	It is the surrendering of an event to God's will.   Example: You want something to happen, when you say: "I want this, God willling", it means that you want it to happen, but only if it's God's will and that you wont be disappointed if God doesn't have it in your fate and it ends up not happening.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	It is an expression of hopefulness that an imaginary entity will assist a person, group, event etc...|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	The expression is "God be willing." It means "IF God is willing."|`|d48b0cce8366a9573fefff374501246aaa	It means nothing because there is absolutely no proof that any deity ever existed.|`|wGQvgeXDaa	It means to have complete trust in God. It is accepting things/people/event whether you have a favorable inclination to it or not. It is to have a conviction that good and bad things come from God and He has the our best interest in mind. Because you know fully well that God is All Wise, All Just and All Powerful.    This is hard to grasp if one does not know the purpose of life.

No, I can't see Jesus; if I claimed to, people might question my sanity. However, I don't think it's that simplistic. As I see it, Christ (the "imaginary friend") set up an ethical system. Through examining Christ's teachings, I have embarked upon the path of pacifism, social justice, fighting against bigotry, promoting equal rights for all people, and practicing charity. That's a tall order for an imaginary friend. The average imaginary friend does not generally lead people into philosophical research, social activism, promoting peace, and attempting to better the world. There are many people I can't physically see or speak to, and I don't label them as "imaginary friends". I can't see Thomas Paine, either, but he's worth reading.|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	People need to keep religion in perspective and try to  follow what President Obama asks each of us to do.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	I'm pouring my second drink|`|tl2pMkOcaa	They say:    "But God is real and powerful and popular - and Bobby is not!..."    IT'S THE SAME EXACT THING.    They claim to have an imaginary friend that they really believe is real.    But they cannot introduce us to him, can they?    They make grandiose claims like, "If you believe, you'll understand..."    or    "You must have faith and believe first, then he will be revealed to you..."    or     "My imaginary friend changed World history..."    or     "I know he's real, more real than anyone else I know..."    Every one of those claims is begging scrutiny.

Jesus is a reality; get over it yourself.    Apparently you are so caught up in the physical and mental world that you do not know that you have a soul. Well?     Then maybe you should turn off your lights some night and get acquainted with your soul; providing you have not already traded to the devil for something. Satan's real, too. Get used to it...    You probably haven't heard about ghosts have you... Well, get used to it, they do exist: scientists are proving it.    As for Lucy's friend Bobby, he could be a spirit with an unfinished purpose upon Earth... Lucy did pass that test... Or maybe Bobby is Lucy's guardian Angel... Get over it...

Assuming you are right and God does not exist his character still would not have been created by the individual but instead mythology (and I am using the word mythology in the academic sense as stories of origin, not as the inaccurate definition of falsehood) therefore it is not an accurate comparison because the individual is not the author of the nature, complexity or personality of the god figure.    And so you are aware it is a common thought in sociology that those children that have imaginary friends actually develop better language skill, memory retention and critical thinking skills. Making it intellectually beneficial to have an imaginary friend.    But I am sure neither of these tidbits of knowledge go with the point you are failing to make.|`|7fgATXX2aa	Amusing, Too bad Bobby didn't have 4 thousand years of prophesy relating to a single Real person, and then Multiple witnesses around the world During his resurrection...

Imaginary friends are something we have as children. I had them, I don't really remember what the purpose was...haha but I mean I would "eat" with them and set their places at the table. It's just fun :)    However, just because we don't see or hear God doesn't mean he's imaginary. It's nice to just have faith and believe in something even if other people think that it's not real. For me, I can feel His presence when I pray or when I need Him..He is there for me. It lifts me up and makes me feel wonderful! If you're not willing to accept Him into your life you will never know that joy...just pray and ask for Him and you will feel Him inside and around you. Don't make fun of Christians just because you yourself haven't been there yet. At least I live a wonderful, happy life and I don't let people like the rude kind of atheists get to me...I just try to pray for them. It's such a wonderful feeling! :)|`|ea81cc87feb482bf3fb14cd395e3bd4aaa	Bobby doesn't answer prayers but God certainly does.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Well I suppose when you have memories of certain events that you play over in your mind.  And you review a conversation or detail.  I don't call you crazy for doing that.  Even though that is all in your mind and no one else can hear or see you think about it.    And when I see a person obeying the invisible but powerful law of the land rather than breaking the law I don't consider that crazy.  I call it rational.    And when you hear a voice inside your head that you know is your own I don't think that is crazy either.     And when I see someone behave himself a certain way in front of an authority figure I don't call him crazy for behaving that way either.    When I see a person talking to himself out loud when he is thinking about something I don't think he's crazy.    When I see a man pray in faith when for so long he left it thinking himself to be wise in the world.  And in the end says he believes in God.  I don't call him crazy either.    Faith has nothing to do with imagination.  God has nothing to do with fantasy.  If he did then he would never have left heaven and become a human being and lived as one of us.  And died as one of us.  And arose again as we all will one day.|`|AA12048147	Mom: Lucy, come have your dinner.  Lucy: Wait, I have not finished playing with Bobby.

I guess it will be alright, you seem to enjoy his company. Ask him to come in.  Lucy: Thank you Mom. He is such a good friend just like the friend you have.  Mom: What friend are you talking about Lucy ?  Lucy: The friend you talk to every night. I hear you sometimes .  Mom: Oh, I see. You mean Jesus ? Well yes I do. And I can tell you this, He is a very good friend to me. Just like Bobby is to you.  Lucy: I'm glad you have a special friend mom. Do you see Him, or hear Him like I see and hear Bobby ?

egBy7RqOaa	first off im going to explain to you that its impossible to change into a vampire by getting bitten. i AM a vampire so i know that the only ways of being one is having sex with one, exchanging blood with one or being born a vampire. but keep in mind that some humans are incapable of changing and that some vampire (though it may not affec them) do indeed cary sexually transmitted diseases from their human days, just like any other human can have. and by having sex of exchanging blood, if you are uncapable of being changed and that vampire has a previous std, you will indeed get that.    now also remember we do exist (those non believeers) and we dont go on drinking sprees or anything like that, weonly drink blood that is donated and only human blood when we really really need it. we drink normal beverages and eat normal food and sleep as well.      any other questions you can email or im me.     hope i helped=]  vote best answer, ?    thankyou.|`|30ZHowVBaa	Tell people you are one.|`|GBFhC35aaa	Um... you are human so it is not actually possible that you would suddenly change into a vampire.|`|YIH3lkHhaa	ummm i'm not sure if ur really being serious, but legends and mythologies around the world say all these things become vampires-    A baby born with teeth or a caul, or a stillborn     A bat flying over a corpse (Romania)     Being a wizard or witch     Being excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church (Greece)     Being the seventh son of the seventh son     A cat jumping over a corpse (England)     A dead body that has been reflected in a mirror     It was generally assumed that if a cat was allowed near a corpse it would steal the soul and the dead person  would become a vampire. (Vampire cats were common in Japan but were easily recognizable as they had two tails)     People with red hair (Greece)     People who commit suicide     People who die sudden and violent deaths     People who have eaten the meat of a sheep that has been killed by a wolf     People who do not receive a proper burial     Renouncing the Eastern Orthodox religion........  .........................................

LQQAQDkIaa	Wealthy American corporations had bought up much of the land in Cuba. The Cubans became serfs in their own country working on farms that produced food that was sold abroad. They were hungry in their own rich land because foreigners owned all the food produced. The revolt in Cuba messed up the status quo. The rebels won, they kicked out the landlords and nationalized the land and the crops. The wealthy corporations were furious because the revolution destroyed all their lovely wickedness. Pax Christi|`|IVy35SE2aa	We are a very colonial country.  We brag about our high morals  and how we would not invade another country.

But Columbus soon realised that he had found undiscovered land.

Thats just one example     Nope, if I ever thot I was becoming my mother or saying things she said I would kill myself now,      Grandma though, yes,  sometimes, like "never do anything you wouldnt want to see published on the front page of the newspaper" and "being drunk is no excuse, I've never seen a drunk sit on a hot stove and burn himself" and "when the wolf comes in the door, love goes out the window"    Grandma had a lot of cool sayings for things.|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	Yep, all the time I repeat my mother's adages:    When I'd play card with my kids I'd tell them:  "I win-you wash the dishes.  You win-you wash the dishes."    "Clean up your own mess. The maid has died and gone to heaven."    "I'm made of dirt--not money."    What's for dinner?  "Only God knows now.  You'll know when it lands on your plate."|`|9HzjEbd4aa	i never really had a childhood|`|AA10620879	Yeah but what is real funny when my daughter calls up to tell me she is repeating things I said to her when she was little to her own daughter now.

It is the old saying "what goes around comes around" again and again!|`|nwnILcEAaa	Yes, a favorite aunt would reply when someone didn't care for what was for dinner, ' Eat it or wear it".

My grand kids say Oh my God to often and  I have always said ,my stars, so now my daughter tells her boys to say what grammy says.I remember Good gravy! and ,well forever more!

Now that I'm older and find myself saying them all the time to my son and grandkids, I often wonder how long people in my family have been saying them?  Wouldn't you just love to know who first said:    "Meaner than cat dirt" or "That wind's so sharp it could cut the horns off a billy goat".
9mLjDa5kaa	The rapture is in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. It is the taking away from the world of all believers by Jesus, it happens in the future, and it is before the beginning of the Great Tribulation in the future, which is a time of God's judgment on the earth before the return of Jesus Christ.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	A very bad early 1980's pseudo-rap song by the abysmal BLONDIE.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	It is a modern heresy.

We are living in the time of the end. The fast-fulfilling signs of the times declare that the coming of Christ is near at hand. The days in which we live are solemn and important. The Spirit of God is gradually but surely being withdrawn from the earth. Plagues and judgments are already falling upon the despisers of the grace of God. The calamities by land and sea, the unsettled state of society, the alarms of war, are portentous. They forecast approaching events of the greatest magnitude.  ______________________________________...      Earthquakes and Floods     The time is now come when one moment we may be on solid earth, the next the earth may be heaving beneath our feet. Earthquakes will take place when least expected In fires, in floods, in earthquakes, in the fury of the great deep, in calamities by sea and by land, the warning is given that God's Spirit will not always strive with men.     Before the Son of man appears in the clouds of heaven everything in nature will be convulsed. Lightning from heaven uniting with the fire in the earth will cause the mountains to burn like a furnace and pour out their floods of lava over villages and cities. Molten masses of rock thrown into the water by the upheaval of things hidden in the earth will cause the water to boil and send forth rocks and earth. There will be mighty earthquakes and great destruction of human life.  ______________________________________...

Not only is vegetable life affected but man suffers from pestilence. . . . These things are the result of drops from the vials of God's wrath [GOD TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT WHICH HE ALLOWS OR DOES NOT PREVENT. SEE EXODUS 7:3; 8:32; 1 CHRONICLES 10:4, 13, 14.] being sprinkled on the earth, and are but faint representations of what will be in the near future.     Famines will increase.

The rapture is described primarily in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 and 1 Corinthians 15:50-54. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 describes the rapture as God resurrecting all believers who have died, giving them glorified bodies, and then departing the earth with those believers who were still alive, who have also been given glorified bodies.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	1Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:   1Th 4:17 Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.   1Th 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

Mat 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,   Mat 24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   Mat 24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.   Mat 24:41 Two [women shall be] grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

Every eye will see Him. (Revelation 1:7) Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.

Some people say this will happen just before the last seven year period(the seventieth week of Daniel)which is called the tribulation.  Others say it will happen in the middle of the tribulation, and still others say it will happen at the end of the tribulation.  No one really knows when the rapture will happen.  Jesus said "no one knows the hour or the day, but My Father which is in heaven.  Therein lies another mystery!  I'll not elaborate on that right now.|`|AA11183936	Rap music festival in heaven.|`|JCnSm91uaa	The Rapture is the latest fad among some fundamentalist evangelicals!  They hope to disappear from the Earth sooner or later!|`|AA11822969	The Rapture is when Christ comes to take His faithful to be with Him in the heavens...so we do not have to suffer through the Great Tribulation which will follow. This will be a time when the Anti-Christ takes over the world. He will seem like a good guy at first. He will even rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. He will put an end to hunger and be just like a miracle worker! Then He will demand to be worshipped. He will put out a mandate that everyone takes his mark, called the mark of the beast. Those who take it will be condemned to hell. Some will have turned to Jesus as Savior in this time and they will not take the mark of the beast. Many will end up being murdered for this. Those who do not have the mark of the beast will not be able to buy or sell, but the Lord will provide. This is a time when it will be worse than anything beyond our imagination. According to Scripture, the Rapture may come very soon. It is time to be saved and right with the Lord.

6jkusbCgaa	Anti-fashion is a way of asserting other attitudes, beliefs, theories and ideas about fashion that are outside of the mainstream. Often the influences are utilitarian and emphasize making clothing that isn't created around the ideas of fashion for a fashionable purpose. But it is not an outright resistance to fashion or an emphasis of mediocrity over fashion, which is what people often tend to think. Without the right anti-fashion isn't just against fashion, it is outright ugly.

gHGtoqFIaa	firstly its not a black thing    my parents are black and my mom does not even believe in spanking let alone punching     i know a lot of black men are rough with their sons but not necessarily for discipline but to toughen them up some (however i do not think that they abuse them, they coach their sons to defend themselves and fight back)    are u sure your son didnt say chastise which means discipline?  I dont think that was a cute made up word lady!    and if there are black parents who do this and see this as a form of discipline that they are ignorant and yes they are abusing their children, however im sure there are many people in other cultures who may discipline in a similar or the same way    Question: How many stories have you heard of a black family doing this to their child for you to try to generalize?    Thats like hearing that a white women drown her five kids and me asking....Do white women feel that drowning her kids is a form of releasing the devil out of them?    So to answer your question, NO abusing a child is NOT OK in MY CULTURE!    secondly, do some hard core research before making such broad generalizations, im black, have MANY blacks friends, all of whom were never beaten in any way    if u didnt mean to come off rude, u did!!!
WjRqYf6naa	It is called "soul sleep" and is a false doctrine.

This is not a part of our scriptures that are even confusing.    I suppose the description of that event allows for the possibility that it was something that occurred only that one time.  Maybe people who have died since then are still waiting.  Matthew does not explicitly seem to make that clear.       I'm pretty sure "The Holy City" refers to Jerusalem, not heaven.  Maybe people think those who rose returned to their graves after they rose  and were seen by other people.  That seems ridiculous to me, but I suppose it's possible.    I believe in purgatory,  and that some people who have died are in purgatory.  I also believe there are saints in the eternal presence of God The father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.  Saints are experiencing eternally the full joy of being fully in the presence of the Triune God in Heaven.    I hope and pray to meet you there some day.

One verse for example where paul says he would rather be with Christ than continue suffering in the body. God instructs us to be care takers of our bodies for they are a Temple.A temple is a hugh house and were only living in it temporarily and like any tenant were expected to treat it with respect and not cause destruction. Any way i believe all understand what i'm pointing out.There used to be when i was a child a old country song called this old house and for those who never heard it was worded as thus>>> This old house is getting weary this old house is a getting old this old house kept out the heat it kept out the cold, and the song goes on telling how they were a getting ready to leave this house and getting ready to be with the lord.I always thought it was a very excellent way to describe death.|`|cN3Fh5Q8aa	It probably has something to do with the return of Jesus to judge the living and the dead.|`|93733684831cb258957f05ced7910d86aa	Again tradition melded together with facts.

Are they going to be sent from heaven back to hell (the grave) just to be ressrected again & then judged ?  Any way what is the point of heaven or hell for that matter seeing the dead know nothing according to the bible ?   No wonder atheists rule religion makes no sense .|`|v6nISGeUaa	I am a Catholic, but my family is Lutheran and they would tell you to look at this scripture, among others:    1 Corinthians 15:6  After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen  asleep.    They believe that when you die you are not judged immediately, but are Asleep in Christ, waiting for the final Judgment Day.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Early Church father Origen said that the saints in heaven (those who are asleep) are interceding for us.    "But not the high priest [Christ] alone prays for those who pray sincerely, but also the angels . . . as also the souls of the saints who have already fallen asleep" (Origen, Prayer 11 [A.D. 233]).     The the souls of the saints "who have already fallen asleep" are not snoring in their graves and unconscious.  They are in heaven praising God and praying for us.  Falling asleep simply means physical death but the soul remains alive.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Hey Sister Sha! Let me try to explain. Our physical bodies are buried and our souls are not for they have entered the realm of heaven to be judged by Jesus. The (self) person is no longer present. Now I know you know this I'm just long winded. For those who do not believe in the soul, they think that's it we go back to nature and rot. However  when Jesus returns we will all be reunited with our bodies. and Jesus will raise us up on the last day so we will have physical bodies again.    However many many people do not know that where you lay your loved ones is sacred grounds and by going to visit the grave of that loved one many graces are given to you. It is called remembering the dead.    If you go to Nevers in France the physical body of St. Bernadette is  incorrupt, her soul is not there but she is, it's as she just went to sleep. And she died in the 1860's. Every so often the nun's will change her habit, and the really strange part is she moves positions sometimes. One day she will have her head turned to the right and other days her head will be turned to the left. This is truly and act of God. There must be a reason for this, she is dead. It is amazing to read about the incorruptibles, And throughout history there have been many of these miracles. Just thought you'd like to know. God bless you.|`|RwpHV4nOaa	The false protestant sects don't really believe that Jesus came to bring life for us.  They think everyone dies, that he Saints are "just dead people". When in reality through Christ we can inherit the Kingdom of God and gain eternal life. That's why Mary , the Saints and the hallowed souls in Purgatory can intercede for us.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Okay. I know you're supposed to go to your after life but you're missing the day of Resurection. That day is the last day of the world when the dead will wake up and God will pick if they are worthy enouph to go to Heaven. So they'll sleep and the next thing they know they wake up at the worlds end basicly. That's even what it says in many Holie books.
TtVgXhWyaa	It is like toootally weird how everyone, mostly the kids, can't exist without their phone, blackberry, or ipod in their ear.  It's a new generation that can't deal with not having technology.  And as times get worse, and energy demands increase, there will be more times that are like the past, where books keep you interested, rather than cable tv, dvds, and the internet.    I work at a call center, and many times, we are not busy.  The kids go bananas becuase they can't use their cell phone or text on the main work area.  But the older people, who have lived their lives without such electronic chaos, can easily deal with being with their own thots.    this is why schools are so hyper to get each kid a laptop, because the kids are screwed into technology at such an early age.  The kids don't want to read books, they want to read it on the internet.  It's just how they're wired now.  But times will come soon when they won't be wired properly and can't use their fancy cell phones, etc, to occupy their minds.    Plus, it's not good for people to be full of so much noise.  The brain needs time to calm down, to process all the info it gets daily.  So if there's constant stimulation, the brain has no time to process correctly.  Try just turning off the tv or the cell phone, and sit in the wonderful solitude of the house, a forest, or even your car.  It's delightful sometimes to just "be".|`|wC51rE1gaa	nope|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Yes I do I also need that me time  I don't even want to think  it's great|`|kGeetn8saa	heck no i would die|`|AA11788494	I sometimes don't answer the phone.|`|1WaTRF3Caa	Totally..

Go ahead, turn of your phone for a day.

In France, in a region where they speak a dialect called Occitan - sounds very different from "normal" French. Anyway, he was a young man, working out there, I believe, an sleeping in the living room of this old house. In the company of a rather attractive young woman, his roommate.    One night, he wakes up, and instantly knows something's not right. Its pitch black, and he can hear heavy, plodding footsteps in the room. Its not his roommate, because she was lithe and cat like. And then he felt a weight on the side of his bed, as if there was someone sitting there. But a wave of his hand confirmed that there was no one there. I forget how that part of the story ends, but eventually the whatever it was went away, and dad went back to sleep.    However, a couple of nights later, he woke up again, this time to a voice - that of his roommate, who by the way cannot speak even the most basic French, let alone a different and nuanced dialect thereof, speaking fluent Occitan. He did the whole "Are you awake" thing, but got no response, just this girl, who is apparently still asleep, mumbling away in a language she can't understand.She kept it up for an hour or two before dad was able to sleep again.    He asked her about it the next day and she was totally surprised. Didn't remember anything of a sort. Dad says he never felt any kind of fear through these events, he says it felt like whatever was going on was completely indifferent to anyone in the house. More like, the very stones were replaying what had gone on before, like a tape recorder of some kind.    I don't know what to make of it, to be honest. I don't think he'd lie to me, and I can't think of a nice, neat, canned explanation.|`|jBYxEX8taa	There's Ghost Hunters that comes on Reality TV channel. It's really freaky.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	I did not look at the picture, but I am conversant with the genre.    Art is any medium through which anyone expresses their ideas, thoughts, faith, philosophy, political leanings, etc.    God the Father was often depicted as an elderly person because he is the Father of God.  Jesus is shown as younger because he is the Son of God.    Therefore, to make a picture intelligible to non-theologians, the pair were often shown as Father and a Son, the obvious difference in their ages showing whether of the two was God, and which one the Son.    According to Hebrews 1.3, the most accurate depiction of the pair would have them identical in form, figure, image, and glory.      Such pictures make us ask serious searching questions about the Trinity.        QUILL|`|0DW8nj5caa	Please answer this question.

There are some serious glitches in the story of the last days of Jesus before going to the Holy Cross! Jesus was teaching his last long lesson on different subjects. He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him    John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"    John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"     Jesus didnt answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!    John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, Where are you going?* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).    Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldnt remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka Another Comforter was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?) The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!     Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.    Jesus started to shed blood even before he went to the Holy Cross!    Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it because it pleased God!) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED    I can almost still hear him crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didnt have to spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time from the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit in preparation for hanging on a Holy Cross as the spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!      No wonder Jesus was sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven to pass the cup. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a Guardian Angel to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the Slaughter House Religion! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Saint Paul came along later on and finished whatever PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the elect for salvation!    Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of his body, which is the church.    For his work God rewarded Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!    Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (I lie not! Saint Paul)    You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS dont read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybodys book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read it carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible!|`|QrC3blK8aa	i believe in this picture, because it exists... i cannot say the same thing about your god..|`|wFlObEjcaa	that dude has a small peepee

That he would draw unlimited gratification seeing it on your face? What planet are your from???    Also, you knew he wanted a truck, and you took him to the garage, made him cover his eyes, and then 'surprised' him with make-up for you? You have to be kidding......No one is this clueless.

I read somewhere that as a child Nicholas II(Alexei's father) was presented with a piece of the cross as his baptismal gift. This "locket" may also have held a piece of the cross or even a picture of the imperial family for him to remember after they passed away. If it was not a locket it may, as you have speculated have been a pendant or necklace emblazoned with the Romanov Imperial insignias. I could not find any pictures that were close enough to see it, so we might never know for sure. By the way this is just a THEORY based on what I know about Russian History.

yakmXr5Jaa	The Bible says God created all the creatures first, and then created man afterward, which is just what the fossil records show us.  As a matter of fact, the first creatures God creates in Genesis are ocean creatures.  Sure enough, the fossil records show us that is where the oldest creatures were.    For thousands of years, people read the story in Genesis where God created the world in six days, and they assumed that literally meant six 24-hour days.    Now we know better.  We can see that it was a longer process.  And when we look back at Genesis, that actually fits.  God doesn't even create the sun until day four, so what were we using to measure a day in days one through four?    Obviously a "day" is a much longer time period.  It is not measured by the same system we use today.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	It wont fit- Imagine your self God explaining to Mosses all the process of creation..long..boring..not to mention impossible to understand.

Potential Answer 3: (liberal answer) God works through the natural forces of the world. He was the 'spark' that started life, and then created mankind through evolution, and controlled it until we became the way we are and were ready to fulfill the purpose He prepared for us.    Take your pick. They all lead to the same God. And after all, the foolishness of God is greater than the wisdom of men, so don't worry yourself over it too much.

The present age in which we are living is the fourth age in the cycle. It is said that the dinosaurs and other creatures actually appear  towards the end of the fourth age. The reason we are finding the remains of such creature on earth is because we are digging up what is there from the last fourth age.There is still many thousands of years left to run in this present age before the cycle returns to the first age again.  The four age are known as follows. First age is Satya yuga, second is Treta yuga, the third is Dwapara yuga and the fourth or present age is Kali yuga.

I suggest that you build your vocabulary. Use the words that you learn in, at least, 2 sentences each. I really appreciate that you're strong enough to tell everyone to NOT tell you that God doesn't exist! Your habit of text messaging is hurting your written expression. God should always be written with a capital "G". It DOES make a difference to Him.  The answer to your question is very involved. Scientists are correct when they say that the earth is about four and a half billion years old. Before the spirit rebellion, Lucifer and his angels lived here. The dinosaurs were made in their image. When they rebelled, they destroyed the earth's surface, left it, and tried to take over God's throne in heaven. (Jude 1:6, Isaiah 14:12-14) You may need a Stong's Exhaustive Concordance to verify this part. There is a gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. The word "was" in verse 2 should have been translated as "became". It is word 1961 in Strong's. The English words "without form" were rendered from the Hebrew word to'hu.  Isaiah 45:18 says that God created it NOT to'hu. In this verse the word was translated into the English word "vain", but it's the same Hebrew word and this verse says that God did not create it that way. Thanks for your question.

Dinosaurs is a word that was coined in the 1800s.  But God talked about them in the book Job and Psalms.  There were dragons around in jolly old England that were a problem throughout the land.  They even had a newspaper that would come out and warn people of sightings and dangers.  These were published until the end of the 1700s and called the Dragon Chronicles.    There are footprints of man  and tree-toed dinosaurs in the same Paluxy riverbed in Glenrose, Texas.  There are rock drawings of pterodactyls which people drew in Utah.  And thirty-five thousand little figurines of dinosaurs in action in South America in one nation alone.    Ask yourself how a fossil is made?  Could a fish or animal lay around long enough to become petrified?  No, it would decay and animals would eat it, at lest bugs and bacteria.  How then?  The only reason is the flood which covered them in layers of mud.  There are trees that they have found that go through several layers of rock.  How does that happen if each is put down in millions of years?  Just like stirring a glass of ice tea with sugar at the bottom, the dirt was stirred off the earth while the earth was turning while under water for almost a year.    Remember, God is truth and not a liar.  He would have said that the earth is truly old and was started as evolution says.  Besides, evolution can not pass the test of the first and second law of thermodynamics.  They make evolution impossible, but if these scientists can not have evolution, the only solution is to realize that there is a God and if they do, they know there are things they must do to please that God.|`|mMPjXbvcaa	You haven't been paying much attention in class, I take it.    edit: Simply, they don't fit in.

The Genesis account indicates that mankind was the final act of creation.    A difficulty encountered in this connection is the insistence of some Christians that each 'day' during the creative period was a standard day consisting of 24 hours.    The Hebrew does not lend itself to this, and it must be considered that a  'yom' or day, was not as understood today when marking the passage of hours and weeks, etc, but a 'period' of time that is undefined and of sufficient length for God to complete his work.    The word 'yom' is often used in the Bible to mean a period of time whose length is unspecified.  Perhaps you grandfather has related a story with, "In my day ... " and you will understand that he is using 'day' in an alternate way, just as the Hebrews were wont to do.

He noticed that on each island the birds had different shaped beaks according to the type of food available on their particular island. For this reason, he assumed, the birds had progressed over millions of years and only the hardiest of the species had survived the climate and vegetation changes. However, this is totally inaccurate and was dismissed as a mere humor in a TV series on the educational channel in October of 1998. According to the scientists discoveries in that very same year, the effects of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino, the climate on these same exact islands had drastically changed in a single year within a number of months. And to their surprise, the eggs of the finches on each island hatched open producing birds with beaks already altered to accommodate the changes of their environment.    The commentator even said this shoots Darwin's theory completely down and he laughed.    There is no DNA research pointing to a connection between apes and humans as was supposed by the scientists and those who had financed them over the years. In fact, the barnyard pig is closer to humans in many aspects, than a monkey or a gorilla. Consider the fact, doctors use the skin from pigs to replace needed tissue on burn victims and the famous movie actor, John Wayne had a pig's heart valve installed in his own heart in a 1977 operation to save his life.

This is an assumption or theory.|`|jBYxEX8taa	Why would God have left out a description of the dinosaurs from the creation account found in the Bible? Skeptics claim that this omission proves that the Bible wasn't written by God's inspiration, but is just a compilation of the words of fallible men. First, we should understand the origin of the Genesis creation account and its purpose in the Bible. The first five books of the Bible, including Genesis, were written by Moses. Since nobody except God was present at the creation, the Genesis creation account was given to Moses by God. If one is attempting to second guess the Author of Genesis, one must take these facts into account.    God was not interested in giving Moses a scientific treatise on the creation of the world. The Bible indicates that God's communication to Moses was centered on the relationship between God and man and the rules by which God wanted man to live. Therefore, the creation account mirrors the content of the rest of the Bible, which centers on mankind and his relationship to God. The question, "Why would God leave out a description of the dinosaurs?" is a bad one to begin with. A more appropriate question should be "What would God want to relate to man about His description of the creation?"    Many who have studied the Bible believe that it does mention dinosaurs in the text. Specifically, Genesis 1:21 says that God created "great sea monsters" on the fifth day.1 The Hebrew word tanni?yn, can have several meanings, including "dragon," "serpent," "sea monster," or "venomous snake." An analysis of other Old Testament verses indicates that this word usually refers to contemporary aquatic animals or snakes:    Genesis 1:21  Ancient (?) Aquatic Animal   Exodus 7:9  Contemporary Snake   Exodus 7:10  Contemporary Snake   Exodus 7:12  Contemporary Snake   Deuteronomy 32:33  Contemporary Snake   Job 7:12  Contemporary Aquatic Animal   Psalms 74:13  Contemporary Aquatic Animal   Psalms 91:13  Contemporary Snake   Psalms 148:7  Contemporary Aquatic Animal   Isaiah 27:1  Contemporary Aquatic Animal   Isaiah 51:9  Ancient Land Animal   Jeremiah 51:34  Contemporary Land Animal   Ezekiel 29:3  Contemporary Aquatic Animal   Ezekiel 32:2  Contemporary Aquatic Animal     So, although tanni?yn could refer to a dinosaur in Genesis 1, in most other usage throughout the Old Testament, the word refers to species that existed at the time the Old Testament books were written.    The second instance where the Bible might refer to dinosaurs occurs first in the book of Job. The Leviathan is described as being an armored aquatic creature in the book of Job, the Psalms, and Isaiah. The descriptions claim that the creature was contemporary with the writers of the Bible, and are not inconsistent with large alligators or crocadiles. Although dinosaurs are not specifically mentioned in the Bible, the fossil deposits they produced are described as being used by early humans in the opening chapters of Genesis.    There are some technical problems that God would have faced in including dinosaurs in the creation account. There is no word for "dinosaur" in the Hebrew language. Now, God could have invented a Hebrew word for dinosaur and explained what those animals were like and how they had died out. However, this is a one page description of the creation of the world and life in it. Trying to explain about an extinct group of creatures would have taken a lot of space and distracted from the rest of the creation account.    Obviously, there were a lot more creatures than just dinosaurs that were left out of the creation account. If God were to have included every creature in the creation account (well over one billion), such inclusion would have completely lost the spiritual significance of the passage (and would be much longer than the Bible itself). The purpose of the Genesis creation account is to give an account of how God created mankind and provided for him. The account, like the entire Bible, centers on God and His miraculous workings for mankind. Therefore, in the creation account, we find the supernatural creation of the universe by God, indicating that the universe wasn't always here, but created by God for man. Next, it talks about the creation of plants, which are important to humans, since we eat them, and also important to the animals that we rely upon, which also eat them. Then, it talks about the sea creatures and birds, which we also eat. It next talks about the beasts of the field, which we eat and use for labor. Then it talks about the creation of mankind and how he is to have dominion and manage the earth and its creatures.    The second chapter of Genesis gives a spiritual account of the creation of mankind and man's relationship to God. The entire account is centered on God and man. Therefore, one would expect the creation account to describe events that are important to mankind.    Those who claim that the lack of dinosaurs in the creation account is a mistake are looking at the topic on the basi|`|XJhiXoDVaa	dinosaur was animals so he created dinosaur first and they live for a period of time until a little bit after people came and the dinosaur did not listen to god so when the noah ark came  they did not listen so they all died and yes i am a christian|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	The writers of the Bible worked in their own historical context, and understood science and the world around them only in terms of that historical context....there were no "stenographers" for God writing the Bible- just men trying to understand their role in the world around themselves in terms of a belief in God...|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	As you stated they would have existed before God reformed the world.

And just speculation pure on my part, I believe that Satan caused the world to be in the condition it was in at that time and is also why the dinosaurs became extinct.|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	That's an honest question and I don't think religiously there is an answer. We know dinosaurs existed for thousands of years. We also know they evolved into many different species of animals. We also know, or so it is said in the bible that God created man, Earth, the heaven and stars in 7 days. None of it fits together, but I believe it's all true. I don't know how, or why, but there is so much we can't explain and understand as mortals, that only God knows.     The dinosaurs do fit in, we just don't know where, how or why. That's something we'll have to ask God (who does exist) when we are with him. If you need to write a paper, I think that's an excellent explanation.    I strongly believe in the Lord, but when I wa in college, I took a philosophy class and our final was to make a statement and prove it to be true or false using the philosophical things we learned in class and the different Philosophers.

Sometimes this is a bad thing, as you have stated, but it can be a constructive thing. Before I elaborate on your question though, allow me to answer it. Self-Esteem is determined by the self, and though it is stimulated by outside sources, ultimately it takes the person to give in to pressure. All societies but heavy emphasis on beauty that make it difficult for women. What is beautiful for one culture  may be different for another. However, one thing that is universal, is that somehow morphing or shaping the body is involved and it's the emotional strain of fitting those standards that many of our society's young girls are experiencing today.    There are, however, good examples of unrealistically high standards. Twenty years ago, it was expected that a child would graduate High School, now we've raised the standards so that students are expected to go to college. This forces students to become ambitious in ways we have never anticipated. Another good example is when JFK announced that America would be on the moon by the end of the century. Ridiculous right? Well, look what happened. High standards have two sides, ambition and let-downs.|`|AtY7izyHaa	Of course, and guess where they get there Inspiration from? . . .

And it seems kind of selfish to have to kill others for immortality ... take what they have to add to your own. Just ... wrong, somehow.|`|kLHaJ8XKaa	(I would like to be the kind of vampire you get in books such as Anne Rice's and Twilight etc, they're just amazing but obviously not real - however, I don't think I'd want to be a vampire in 'reality' as Sanguinarianism isn't something I could reconcile doing myself, despite having a best friend who's quite comfortable with it.|`|73903c4a4ca4db868d8178012c3e4273aa	No. I like the daytime.  If i had a chance to be a vampire hunter however...yes. that would be sooo badass.|`|BUaK8xswaa	yes it would be awsome lol|`|Z1Ivthddaa	Hell no!  What kind of life would that be?  Skulking through the centuries and resorting to, what is essentially, Cannibalism to survive?  Watching friends and family loved ones and enemies wither into dust?  I'd rather do all my living in one short burst and die.|`|NLYPIXcUaa	Hell yes. No questions asked.|`|AA10455120	NO, because I love sunlight(even if I'm fairly nocturnal by habit). And from what you read in stories, they seem to be waaay too...political/clique-y. They also tend to revert to sadism, in the majority. Just not my kind of people. plus I'm fairly empathic and shy, so finding food would be fairly difficult. I'd much rather meditate my way into immortality, even though it's more work. Enlightened Yogis just seem so much more sane and reasonable, and ethical, plus they can deal with sunlight.|`|1rLPBPvvaa	Sure! Be cool to live forever, only reason being I would get to party all the time and I'm hungover all the time anyways so daytime don't appeal to me too much, its the nightlife for me! Hey maybe I already am? Haha|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Not at all. I like th sun.

I will choose to remain as one of the higher beings that preys on them.    EDIT  Hey, if you're a vampire and are emailing the people who ask you, email me, too.  I'm hungry and could use an easy meal.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	there are such things as vampires.  your little fantasy edward cullen is not accurate.  do research.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	No, I like not having to suck blood from peoples' jugulars.  That's nasty.|`|jbYqydH7aa	Yes,I would.I think the whole concept of the cold skin,and velvet tone is all amazing.I would like to be a vampire for as long as possible,it seems...just so unreal...I would though.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	No. I would like to come out when the sun is out. I like the sun and I like being at a church even though I barely go.|`|NFnOV8yFaa	Lol depends on the circumstances. Like if I wasn't able to come out in the daylight then no, or if i dunno bad things could happen then no. Otherwise....most definitely ! =]|`|7f1w30PXaa	Absolutely in fact ive been asking people if they were a vampire to come over my house and bite me or whatever it takes to turn me into one     ps: please email me if u are one

If your having a problem thinking of stuff, just think of something you would be shocked to see and, if your a typical American, it is probably a taboo.|`|cXXJVz64aa	I don't know about "taboo" but some things we dislike are:  1) Not looking someone in the eyes when talking.  2) Passing gas loudly.  You should:  3) When someone wants to say a prayer, jump up and yell "NO WAY! I'M AN ATHEIST!"|`|KhJwOurLaa	Picnic hangings of random slaves, by fine white Christian folks.|`|u4SJHSgUaa	In TN it is still law that you can be hung for stealing a horse.  Today we don't hang people but the law was never changed and is still on the books.  You can look others up like this by state and maybe find something weird in your own state that would work.      Good luck!|`|cByRtCC9aa	Talking about suicide  Sex that isn't "traditional"  Anti-patriotism|`|Ldxf1tW1aa	Drive by shootings|`|HIdsFdr3aa	Tradition and taboo are exclusive by definition.  In other words, there can be no such thing as a tradition that is taboo, in the same society.|`|UR4mWefGaa	fraternity hazing rituals. I had to lick jello off the nude bodies of my fellow pledges. We had to sleep tied together nude, on the floor, in a group of 8 young men. Then I was forced to drink 1 liter of vodka straight up. I woke up 12 hours later in my own vomit.|`|YvjTJPEfaa	Well wearing a white robe with conical hat anywhere north of Georgia might get you in trouble.     But in all seriousness don't even think about saying ****** if your white.    Do not imply/infer or otherwise cause people to think America is anything less than the number one nation on Earth.

Yeah... hunting runaway slaves was a old taboo tradition. Well... having slaves was a old taboo tradition. God Bless. Love. Amen.
tQsxsuNPaa	To bite the dust means to die...as in one is shot, and falls down, face first, in the dust.  As in an old Western movie.   So, another one bites the dust means that another one has died, lost a big game, or just quit, whatever it is, or is finished of...I can't remember the whole thing, but Thanks!  The refrain will be running through my head for days now!  :S    and Goody Two Shoes is an expression for someone who never does anything against the rules.  The root goes back to a character from something in the thirties, but I'm not clear on it.    You could get more by checking in an etymological dictionary.  I'm not sure if the one online that I use (I just search the words) will do whole phrases, but you could check.    Aww, now I might have to do that, too!  :O|`|xh1Ega5Daa	another one bites the dust-means somone dies  Goody two shoes- means someone who does no wrong.|`|675240e4767a78efb825e156326f38d1aa	Another ones bites the dust means Another person died and the second one refers to a person who follows all the rules and only does things deemed good by society.

For example, there is the British East Indian Company to rule over India and Malaysia.|`|1Gm1m30qaa	Positive - English language, democracy, united India into one country, stopped sati (burning of widows), introduced team sports such as cricket.     Negative - completely wiped out indian market, presided over cultural destruction of India, spread lies about Hinduism, created environmental problems that last to this day, stole all the gold and jewels.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Helped to bring down the caste system    Tried to eliminate the custom of women climbing (while drugged) up onto the funeral pyre of their dead husbands.    Offer at least a taste of civilization, although most have rejected it.    Taught Indians that it was better not to crap in the streets and then walk through it.    Introduced modern medicine, instead of witchcraft methods.    Lessening bribery and corruption at least during their stay in India.    The WORST thing Britain did was grant independence to a place that was not equipped to rule themselves as a modern nation.  BUT, that is also the best thing Britain did, by relieving itself of the medieval minded piece of real estate.|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	Gave India it's infrastucture including the railways, democracy, justice system, western medicine and made lots of Indian wealthy through trading.  And by the way, there were no "Australians" in the 1700s.   hve met many Indians in India, generally well educated, who acknowledge that there were many benefits to India of the relationship.

JH8Afnf4aa	I'm sixteen and I don't really know where I belong. (in a religious category) My parents (I have two separate families) want me to study - and learn about other religions and then choose which one I want to "believe it."     One of my families is Christian  The other Catholic.     But I think that some of the stories in the bible (christian) were written to tell a lesson and they might not have even happened.     Like I get questions in my head all the time. The story says that Adam and Eve were the first beings to walk the Earth (I think that's what it said) Well what about the Dinosaurs?     And how some religions say that being Gay is wrong... I mean for all we know Jesus could have been gay. Think about it... he surrounded himself with  twelve male disciples.|`|BznyCtM9aa	I am actually not sure at all what my religion is. I mean my parents were both spanish (south america) and they had their religion (which I'm guessing is Catholic.) But when I was born here in North America they just didn't go to church or anything. I don't understand why; My mom went to church every sunday with her family when she was younger. I do not know the reasons why my parents stopped going to church and never made me or my brother go to church or learn about religion, but I am currently trying to learn more about religion.    So, currently I have NO IDEA what religion I am. I was never raised into any religion.|`|bDoJuBEkaa	I was raised one, studied and tried several and then I chose.|`|421cVKcpaa	I chose mine.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Irish Catholic mother, Agnostic father. I am an atheist.|`|zbAKxm0daa	Chose my religion.    Raised around Catholic/Lutheran/Presbyterian family, but never made to go to church much.    Later in life Christians showed themselves for what they really are and decided that there was another path that I belonged on.    Finally found Wicca and Home.    Not all paths are valid for all people.  We each belong on the path that we feel most comfortable on, not the path that someone else chooses for us.|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	I was bought up to be a baptist ,Married a Catholic , We are both Jehovah's Witnesses now ...You should read The Illustration of the wheat and Tares (weeds)..There... Jesus points out that he would have  His True Christian  teachers, and that Satan would have his False Christian Teachers, They would grow together until the Harvest ( The last days )..then they would be separated . The true Christians would  be doing The work at Matthew 24:14. Also read Revelation 3:20.|`|9BeUbORtaa	I was raised an evangelical. Thankfully, I saw the light. And became an Anglican of the most obnoxiously High-Church kind. Mostly to annoy my mother.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	I ran away from religion for 33 years cause my dad was a preacher, i sought out other religions that made intellectual sense to me, and allowed myself to become very deceived. Most of the people i know that are preachers kids did the same- hence the old joke about preachers daughters.  But when i ended up in trouble who do you think i prayed to? I'm not a Christian because i have been brain-washed by my parents, but because Jesus loved me enough to die for me. That's a pretty amazing thing when you consider that He loves us in spite of ourselves!|`|wR1XyyrUaa	I was raised a Lutheran, but When I read the Bible, I lost my faith.    When I studied world religions in High School, I drifted towards an Atheist Following Secular Buddhist practices.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	my family has had the same religious faith for 5 generations. so idk i was taught what i believe and now that im grown up i have chosen to stay in this religion that i am in.|`|kX3Kn7Cjaa	I am christian by culture and morale because I was brought up by a christian family in a christian country. By faith I am atheist and I chose that myself. Although it can be debated to what extent you chose your own beliefs.     As a little girl I really really wanted unicorns and fairies to exist. You could say I chose to believe in them because I liked the idea of them being real. I also believed in God because my dad read me stories about Jesus before bedtime and I wanted that to be true as well.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	I was not raised in any religion I searched until I found one that made sense. and here I am in The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it makes sense|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Thankfully I got to choose it.

You know, like a claustrophobic is afraid of being in enclosed places. Simply because someone doesn't agree with a lifestyle or attitude, doesn't make them phobic, or afraid of it.     People make the mistake of thinking Christians, Republicans, Conservatives, etc. are all homophobic...and well, yeah, there are some who probably are. Just like there are some Liberals, Democrates, etc. who are afraid of the right-wing agenda.  But, it's not ALL.  Just because some are afraid, doesn't mean all are.|`|oxeAYFGzaa	VAMPSGOTSOUL  just b/c GW Bush is a Christian DOESN'T"T mean he is homophobic. that is the stupidest thing you could ever say.

There is no punishment or reward. If you look at it this way God makes perfect sense. Good and bad is a matter of opinion.     So the question "do you believe in God?" is irrelevant. It's like asking do you believe in gravity? One could say "no" because one doesn't see gravity just the effect of gravity. I think lots of religions are on the right path but their missing the point completely. I think God is inside each and everyone of us, working through us, every action and reaction. To me God is more of a collective consciousness, a source of awareness. that's why most religions ask that you pray or meditate. Not to ask for things but to look inward for God because that's where God is, not in church or temple, those were constructed to create a community where you can worship, but its really yourself that you need to look for, find yourself, your true self, there you will find god. At least that's my opinion.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	I believe in God and yes I love him.|`|8fp5dSW4aa	I personally find it hard to believe in someone or something such as God.

I see the signature of the Creator in the way in which electrons flow, in the control, discipline and movement of electric and magnetic fields, in the natural world, how photosynthesis of radiant electromagnetic energy and photons from the nuclear reaction of the sun, filtered by the earth's atmosphere, is converted to food by the creation of water and Chlorophyll....how the balance of plant and animal exhalations balance each other, the give and take of Oxygen for carbon dioxide and vice versa.    There is immense engineering and planning for such a biosphere as spaceship Earth. I'm not convinced it came about by accident or by itself.    And ponder the creation and good use of such things in the face of so much ingrained ignorance and hate by such an abusive selfish, savage and tribal-minded race of human beings.    Religion is a man-made culture, an excuse for people to use force, fear, ignorance, tribalism and hate to "educate" people - and spread their venom in the name of their religion.    God if you wish to use that name - or I prefer the universal mind and the Creator - is above all religion. Think about it. Use your senses, your brain and intelligence to cultivate a curious mind and seek knowledge.    NEVER cultivate blind faith. You'll be taken advantage of.    The more you think you know, the more you realize you don't know, that is the depth of Creation.

We were DESIGNED. specificly. and complexly. everything works. man began ruling himself and it went to ****. you can seewhat the earth is supposed to be. there are still parts of paradise left.. its us who ruin it. How can you not love God? he created us. if you get to know him by studying his word and living by his guidlines and learning his name you cannot help but love him. its in us. he doesnt ask too much of us. he can ask whatever he wants he created us! but he gave us choice. to show we love him. and i must admit... i am amongst those that have strayed from those guidlines and my life went downhill.

And he does NOT cause suffering. why the hell would he? you're an IDIOT if you beleive that bull. he merely allows things to happen and doesnt intervine. to prove that man cannot rule himself.|`|AA10302491	yes I do I love God and Jesus.

I bet if I told you I still believed in Santa at the age of 32 you would say I was crazy. I say to you, prove he doesn't exist.

How can you love a God that kills people at the snap of a finger with tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes? How can you love someone that allows people like George Bush and Bin Laden to have some type of influence over the world? I say we should dump you're a "all-loving" God.|`|OxuLUCX9aa	Their was no ancient Hebrew word for God. When you put the word God in ancient Hebrew it comes out to El which was the idol the of the Canaanites. This means that the word God was not a name for the ancient Hebrews Creator. The Hebrews called their Creator by the name of Yahweh. That name appeared 7,000 times in the original Bible and in the Dead Sea Scrolls. So to be correct I love Yahweh. I don't love El the idol of the Canaanites who's name is God in English.|`|MfBT0F1Caa	Yes and yes!|`|a9etFur6aa	No and no. Can't love what I've never met or don't know anything about. Too reckless to believe in something unverifiable.|`|pUOkWQ1yaa	I don't think the world points to an Almighty one. And if there was one, loving him would depend on who he was and how he effects the world.     An honest Atheist's response. However, I think it's wonderful that others can come to different conclusions.
ogiZn2rxaa	Look, I'm gay as well, and for me, after a long thinking session alone in my room i arrived upon this point:    You need to do what you feel, if you feel homosexuality is the right thing for you to do then you need to go for it. Even if you dont think its completely the right thing, you might want to try it anyways, but keep it under reps.    Also    Don't worry abput friendships, your true friends WILL like you for who you are in the end. And dont think for a second you wont have any friends after you come out (if you chose to do so) you will. I promise.|`|NeOVXJcXaa	Well you could either be:    1. bisexual  2. sexually frustrated  3. a teenager with raging hormones    or all of the above.      If guys turn you on, you're gay. If girls turn you on, you're straight. If both turn you on, you're bisexual. Don't be afraid to explore to see what you like.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	ummm yea...your gay.|`|ltYtxmjEaa	heh heh! "shut your hole wang chung!" ahh.. anyway.. well i don't know if it makes you gay to have a guy do that.. it just means you want pleasure.. but maybe you are if your eyeing him..you are i can tell! so yes.. you are most likely bi.. sorry. well.. okay not sorry cuz there is nothing to be sorry about.|`|VnrdIXnGaa	yeah i think so. are u attracted to other guys or just to your friend? If your not attracted to other guys, u might just be desperate bcuz girls reject u|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	You sound like a disrespectful pup. Dont you dare use him cause "your desperate". He has feelings.|`|k3TKEOJBaa	Hello Lovie, You should never just jump right into bed with someone just because you are horny especially with a friend. If you dont feel like you are gay and you do something with him you will send him bad signals and also be playing with his emotions. Friendship is something to cherish and if you enjoy being around him then that is great don't mess up what you have as friends for just a cheap thrill. If in fact you are feeling emotionally and physically attracted to him then you could make something beautiful together. Follow your heart and for someone that will keep you happy sexually a Mr or Misses Right not a right now.    -Love Danni|`|pVpQuWXzaa	ew please dont be gay just keep trying for a girl|`|bIGmaQ6baa	i would say You are probably gay but don't freak out. If you think your friend wants you, then he probably does. Sometimes you just know.|`|YpqXb5GIaa	Dont go gay, you will be a social outcast from the straight guys and you will see girls naked but you can't ever touch them our your cover is blown. Dude, trust me, play a sport, work out, and then go for the chicks. It'll be hella easier and if it isn't, get a hore to suck your wang, just watch the std's. Don't be willing to let another guy suck your wan, it's a disqusting thought, and dude don't jack off to butt sex or anything. If it doesn't seem apparent to you, ill put it in a simpler manner.. Girls have 3 holes guys have 2.. Its simple, you will have a more variety of sexual intercourse with women. And if you really feel you need a dick in there, just ask a slut to strap one on for ya. Girls are willing to do crazy things in sex, it just takes a crazy guy to initiate the awkwardness. But still, gay is bad and im tryin to save you from a sex-thriving life with men. It isn't natural, you aren't born gay, it is a fetish. Just deal with the fetish by doin extreme stuff with the opposite sex.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Sexual desperation does not a homosexual make. Nor does engaging in homosexual acts a homosexual make.    I know this is confusing, but stick with me here.    What makes you gay, or bi, is having an emotional as well as a physical attraction to other guys.    Now, when you are going through puberty, it is quite normal for guys to have homosexual experiences of one type or another, it doesn't necessarily make you gay, it just makes you normal.    So you think your friend might be interested in fooling around? Invited him over for a sleepover, and initiate some talk, or play. Truth or dare is good, or strip poker can lead to some fun.    Good luck.

It's much easier on the sidelines, to tell people to "Just stop smoking"  It's an addiction that sucks and most people are aware when they get older especially of how bad it is for them, and try to quit many times.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	Who are you to judge people like that?

ZkBLNj6Vaa	I got a Witches' Almanac in my library.  It contains a calendar marking witches' sabbats, esbats, and other pagan holidays.  There are articles on famous people, folklore, symbolism, and other witchy things.  This particular almanac has a theme every astrological year; this year's theme is Divination and Prophecy articles.    There is another almanac by Llewellyn, which is similar, but gives more room to the calendar, and has suggestions on daily correspondences.     I use my almanac to figure out moon phases and sun transits mostly, and save them over the years for my library collection.  It's not a requirement, but a novelty to me.|`|dFBccLExaa	I have bought a few witch's almanacs, but I've never found a huge use for them. They mainly tell you where the moons/zodiacs are, the daily incense, and any correspondences for the day. They also have some articles for the different seasons... but really, it's not worth the money. You're better off buying the witch's calendar that they make. Has almost all of the same stuff in it.   My 2 cents.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	A witches almanac is not much different than a Farmers Almanac, other than that it contains more "Witchy" information than agricultural. There are stories, recipes, hints, information, etc... alongside information on each day, the phases of the moon, what astrological sign it's in, etc...I own two different types of Almanac (one a thinner almanac, other the size of an average book). I found them rather interesting, though I didn't really utilize the phase information nor astrological information contained within.|`|AA10455120	It's especially useful if you're into "high" magick which requires rituals be done at specific times, dates, etc. It's also good if you're just into astrology. You might also like the witch articles, which cover anything from candle magick, to ideas for Lammas-related rituals and crafts, to an essay on the earth element.    If you're not into astrology, ceremonial times, or random witchy essays, don't bother.    But if you are, you'll enjoy it.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I've bought the Witches Almanacs in the past, but like the answer above, never really found a huge use for them.  Yes, there is good info and usually some good articles, but because it is a book and the way it's bound, it ends up on the book shelf and not getting used for reference much.   Every year for Yule I end up getting the Witches Calendar and the We'Moon Datebook for the upcoming year from friends.    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0...  http://www.amazon.com/WeMoon-2009-Calend...    http://www.wemoon.ws/    I find that these are much more useful to me.  Wall calendar has important dates and other info of interest to witches, suggested correspondences, and an article for each month - all at a glance to the wall in my kitchen.  And the We'Moon date book, also having moon phases and astrological phases is simply beautiful.  The spiral binding allows me to keep it on my desk next to my home computer, open on  to the current week, so I look at it more.  The poetry and the artwork are always wonderful - I love it!  It inspires me daily.

If it's Maria that wants to give the gift to him, you have to use quiere with an E. If it's o, that means you're talking about yourself and that doesn't make sense.    and the more commonly used one is "Maria quiere comprarlo [un regalo]" or whatever. Because when you say maria wants, it's more natural not to stick the lo in between there, and to just stick it on at the end.|`|22PP8yakaa	both of them are right   maria quiero comprarlo or maria lo quiero comprar|`|00029bbed746bd51719336b3a771cef7aa	"Maria quiero comprarlo" is a better option|`|GmTMVmASaa	they both sound right to me, pero quien es maria?|`|5dacc9eb4e68943f64922eec708c24f7aa	Both are wrong.

And what happened here?    I'm not sure if this sentance even makes sense in Spanish..  but remember, vaya means go, but only in the usted form. like when you're talking to an elder or someone who's in charge of you.

ddae81176a45fb68a40708536cdf1038aa	Once upon a time there was a very creative and weird man named Howard Phillips Lovecraft. In creating horror stories in the 1920-s he researched some ancient Sumerian religious/ magickal beliefs, made up some names, and 're-wrote' most of the particulars. In brief, in most of the fictions he wrote, there are a number of 'old ones' (titanic ancient gods) that were exiled from Earth and from the Solar System (to the 'outer darkness'), but their pantheon leader, Cthulu, instead of being exiled, was put into an almost eternal slumber on an island that then sunk into the sea,, and all of that happened tens of thousands of years ago. Then in modern times (18502-1920-s), stupid strange people learned ways to do magick and summon lesser beings related to the 'old ones', for horrific benefits, and that's what the stories are all about. But Lovecraft had a lot of friends and they started publishing short stories that were in that same world - - - and it became the 'Cthulu Mythos'. Beyond the obvious members (like August Derleth), Cthulu Mythos parts show up in such weird places as the Illuminatus Trilogy by Shea and Wilson. That should give you enough search items to do some really thorough research.  I hope that helped!!!|`|WX1b747Iaa	http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Call_o...|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	This is the lyrics of a song from the 70s and it may give you a bit of what was thought of  Cthuhlu.

God superintended the human authors of the Bible so that while using their own writing styles and personalities, they still recorded exactly what God wanted to be said. The Bible was not dictated from God, but it was perfectly guided and entirely inspired by Him.    Humanly speaking, the Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 1500 years. Isaiah was a prophet, Ezra was a priest, Matthew was a tax-collector, John was a fisherman, Paul was a tentmaker, Moses was a shepherd. Despite being penned by different authors over 15 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvationJesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Few of the books of the Bible specifically name their author. Here are the books of the Bible along with the name of who is most assumed by Biblical scholars to be the author, along with the approximate date of authorship:    Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy = Moses - 1400 B.C.  Joshua = Joshua - 1350 B.C.  Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel = Samuel / Nathan / Gad - 1000 - 900 B.C.  1 Kings, 2 Kings = Jeremiah - 600 B.C.  1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah = Ezra - 450 B.C.  Esther = Mordecai - 400 B.C.  Job = Moses - 1400 B.C.  Psalms = several different authors, mostly David - 1000 - 400 B.C.  Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon = Solomon - 900 B.C.  Isaiah = Isaiah - 700 B.C.  Jeremiah, Lamentations = Jeremiah - 600 B.C.  Ezekiel = Ezekiel - 550 B.C.  Daniel = Daniel - 550 B.C.  Hosea = Hosea - 750 B.C.  Joel = Joel - 850 B.C.  Amos = Amos - 750 B.C.  Obadiah = Obadiah - 600 B.C.  Jonah = Jonah - 700 B.C.  Micah = Micah - 700 B.C.  Nahum = Nahum - 650 B.C.  Habakkuk = Habakkuk - 600 B.C.  Zephaniah = Zephaniah - 650 B.C.

It was written to underscore the beliefs of the society at the time it was written, to set down certain codes of laws and ethics and to make sure that women had no say in the running or ruling of men in any way.  It was also, in a small part, a history of the ancient Hebrew nation.  The New Testament was written by male disciples at least 1 generation removed from Jesus, and the people who put the names on the gospels were not the same as the apostles or disciples described therein.  Only Luke is probably genuine, as there is no apostle Luke, he was not one of the original 12, but a Greek from about 30-50 years after Jesus, who was, probably, a disciple of Peter the apostle.  St. Paul was a contemporary of Peter and the other apostles, but was originally a person who was out to destroy the followers of Jesus.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_counc...|`|C37kzsTXaa	it is written by men inspired by God himself. the purpose is knowledge of the truth and on how to fit in Gods kingdom someday, word for word|`|AA10552086	The same type of people who wrote the mythologies and religious texts of other cultures.|`|EdNK9UpWaa	Interesting question. Many people wrote the books of the Bible, but why? Surely the people who wrote it truly believed the things that it says, but the people who translated it, and assembled it into the version you can read needed the common people to have something to blame their crappy lives on. You know, "Sure, you're suffering now, but if you continue to behave you'll be rewarded when you finally work yourself to death for my benefit", that sort of thing.|`|8da82103fe0f8016ae2e59b5de8eb5ecaa	People wrote the Bible.  However, People are part of something far greater than just people.  In some way or another, close or remote, they relate to everything else in the entire universe.They relate also to anything that brought about existance as it is.  The Bible is a vast amount of information to examine.  I wouldn't expect anyone without enough exposure to its evidence to believe it, but as for myself, I believe it was written by God, even as it was written by people.|`|AA11856921	There is a huge difference between a "writer" and an "author". Very few people ever look up all the verses where God commanded the "writers" to put it in a book. People seem to think that the takers of the dictation just got some kind of "idea" and just "knew" it was from God. It was dictated over thousands of years. Of course there had to be different "writers"!    Exo 17:14  And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book,...  Deu 17:18  And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:   Deu 31:19  Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.   Isa 30:8  Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever:   Jer 30:2  Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.   Dan 12:4  But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.

GtazNrplaa	The human brain is always active by keeping the host body alive and functioning in repairing and replacing constantly. While you sleep you mind continues to tell the lungs to breath in and out. The heart will keep beating pumping fresh oxygen into the blood and circulating it around the host body. The digestive track keeps on digesting food and more nutriments enter the blood stream. Then usually at the end of that sleeping period the brain starts to complete the scanning and de-fragmentating all the clutter and images stored in the brain subconscious. Clearing the way for more new information intended to be lodge into the long term memory of the human brain.    Intelligence gathering during the human mind activity while being awake, the subconscious relaxes while information is gathered. During this process the mind can by trained to question that information, to see if it is relative to the known knowledge already stored and sometime the human brain will say hang on, that is not true, as I have been taught different to that. This is where we can see the brain questioning the relativity of the information being gained and by thinking and rejecting this information, unless the information can convince the brain otherwise to the nature of this new information that "No there is no such thing as any God" and is only in the imagination of the person, who may believe in this type of 6th dimensional abstraction in spiritual life.    So where did all this crap come from of course my brain if it is right albeit if it is wrong so beit.|`|grwtwPbAaa	The mind above all else wants to be connected with the essence of satisfaction....immeasurably ...beyond the expression of words...the mind is hungry for this satisfaction...this state of  inner contentment!   I personally believe we were geared to search for this state of inner peace and contentment...nothing will quench this desire...until we have attained this  immense waterfall....I define this in the word Love.  The mind is looking for it's stamped 'Identity!" It longs for this!    The mind searches everything it sees in pursuit of its goal!  It will climb over mountain ranges, through valleys...through generalizations   through belief systems and even in fact through people.... in search of its own need for fulfillment!  Doesn't matter how powerful, precise or explicit any one point may be..our minds will investigate any point which entices us with the promise of fruit!  You ask why we get hung up on "The Points!"  The answer I believe is we get hung up because somehow we are looking  too much..  much of our happiness is found inside of ourselves, once we quit fighting our minds illusional needs and wants we have less points to ponder.  Amazingl how we lust after the philosphies of men!  Those great advertising agencies which distort  truth of reality.  ...and the mind continues to search outwardly until it  discovers  "inner" contenment.  When the clamour of our minds begins to rest...something beautiful happens...we discover peace...    The mind may stop at many points to gather in a view, ponder it and move on if not satisfied...the mind doesn't allow points to simply point for it is  hungrily looking and longing for connection....for fulfillment ...it doesn't want to be empty and void...it longs for peace and compassion...it will travel any road, go through any wilderness, swim the depths of the oceans, and fly into the skies ...to discover the content it seeks....     Once the brain finds that peaceful haven...it thrives in harmony and true inner contentment is lived out in harmonious joy...peace and tranquility are achieved...the messages the mind  of man....most wants written on it are stored and treasured  in the chambers of man's  heart....    For some this would be called peace or composure...for me it is a place of inner contentment...coming to the final realization that I am content  with my portion....no more need to become "hung up"  on all the various points of life....those points seem to evaporate, not having power or persuasion  over me...    Mr. MP...you and I see some things well though we vary in our description  ~ I sense this  ...you call this "mind:...yet I call this soul and spirit....we both thirst  for this eternal bliss....:)  I have touched the presence within..and for me this prescene is with me always...

VMU1DLJTaa	Thats pretty weird but in my religion dreams are opposite of what they seem. In our dreams, if it is something bad happening to someone we know, like a funeral or a death, then that person is going go be well. and likewise: if its good or happy like a wedding or something, it usually means you should warn that person. for your situation, i have to admit i didnt read everything because it scared me but i think your thinking about this too much so you keep dreaming about it. if youre a boy, try thinking about a special girl. if youre a girl, think of a boy you have had a crush on to ease your mind and maybe you well sleep flawless.|`|6ZtpTBZEaa	A priest would be my weapon of choice.|`|Ka1pGYzCaa	It could be an entity trying to get in contact with you.

Dreams like this happen often, they're normal, usually caused by stress over something bugging you or by an event that once happened. The best thing to do is to force yourself to face it. In doing so, you will regain your power to move again. Imagine yourself getting angry at it for wanting and trying to attack you and then attack it back, or teach yourself to pity it. Give it a storyline as to why it's angry and then seek to fix the issue. Take back the power to of control. Practice while your awake as often as necessary and then again the next time you have the dream.     Confrontation is your best weapon of choice. Allowing it to control you and your fears, you turn you're power over to the dream. Take it back. Eventually the dreams while stop. As for the cold feet, use socks and don't forget to stretch your feet and toes once in a while. Circulation issues due to lack of movement can cause this issue. Forget about monsters, ghosts, etc. Put something happier in your mind and thoughts.|`|mT5srUKHaa	all i can think of is that ur house is haunted and the ghost  is trying to contact you

Sx6vlEUbaa	When someone dies their bodies return to the elements of the Earth. The soul (greek word nephesh) of man and animal is the same and simply means the "complete life of a being".  The Spirit of man is what separates him from the animal kingdom. Upon death the Spirit, which contains all the thoughts, memories, and uniqueness of that individual returns to God and remains with God until a resurrection. The Spirit of man has no life in itself outside of a body.  Now, God created Adam from dust. He is surly able to resurrect mankind in the same manner. At a resurrection, the Body(soul) and Spirit are then again joined together.   So, at death, no one floats of to heaven or goes down to be tortured. All consciousness ceases to exist until a Resurrection.    Great question.|`|r8a0mIYEaa	no one can bargain for god..his word is law.  heres some of his word now.    1.

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?    3. I know from Leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play  football if I wear gloves?    4.

Should I smite them?    5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states that he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?    6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there degrees of abomination?    7. Leviticus 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to  be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?    8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this  is expressly forbidden by Leviticus 19:27. How should  they die?    9. My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds  of thread (cotton-polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to  all the trouble of getting the whole town together to  stone them (Leviticus 24:10-16). Couldn't we just burn  them to death at a private family affair, as we do with  people who sleep with their in-laws (Leviticus 20:14)?|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Yes, that is what it says and how I believe it. Man was also made a living soul. The soul is the determining entity that determines where the individual will spend his or her life after death of the body.|`|Cs6aBBrJaa	The spirit is the life force that keeps all of us alive. See Revelation 11:11 - how the spirit of life from God makes them alive. So the power to live is no longer ours. When we die, our soul dies. See Ezekiel 18:4. Eccl. 9:4,5,10. Also see Eccl. 3:19,20 -Men and animals go to the same place. Our hope should be in a resurrection on a post Armageddon (God's destruction of the wicked) planet earth, as Jesus foreshadowed by his bringing Lazarus and others back to life.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Pretty clear scripture.|`|KDrztUEpaa	Well, I looked up that scripture in my Bible (I'm not sure which Bible you are using, I have many different versions) and it reads:  "Then the dust returns to the earth just as it happened to be and the spirit itself returns to the (true) God who gave it"    When a person dies, they return to the dust. Meaning they gone, dead, finished. They don't feel any pain or sorrow or anything any more.     At Zechariah 12:1 it talks more about that last part, where it mentions "the spirit".   It reads:  A pronouncement  The word of Jehovah concerning Israel," is the utterance of Jehovah, the One who is stretching out [the] heavens and laying the foundation of [the] earth and forming the spirit of man inside him-     that spirit, just symbolizes life. It shows that you are dying.|`|e4ef6e28e838dad7d38eeeff4eb720e4aa	Sis, remember that you have 3 parts of you :    1.  Your spirit    2.  Your Soul    3.  Your Flesh    So, when someone dies, the flesh indeed goes back to the dust !  The spirit goes back to God whom gave it.  The Soul will either be eternally separated from God, or ,  accompany the spirit to God.    Blessings and Peace...|`|QL0FOQMmaa	The spirit and the soul are not the same thing. The spirit is what gives life to our earthly bodies, that is why it returns to God when we die. The soul (who we are which is made up of our mind, will and emotions) is what is either given eternal life through Christ, or faces the "Second Death" as described in Revelation.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	Birdy,  I agree with you that the Scripture should be taken literally.    Here is some more to back it up.    II Cor. 5:5-8  Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.  6  Therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord.  7  For we walk by faith, not by sight.  8  We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.    Christian's souls and spirits both go back to be with the Lord in heaven and when He returns in the clouds at the rapture we will have our souls and spirits reunited with our new glorified bodies.  Won't that be neat?  No more pain, etc.    What verses 1-8 point out is that man should remember his Creator from his youth so his old age will blessed with longevity and service for the Lord.|`|XCquWTVEaa	Sure, why not? Scripture is meant to be taken whatever way you want it to be. There's no one who actually decides which is the right interpretation.    It doesn't matter anyway. It's just a book.|`|lil8ZaSiaa	Yes, because the wisdom of the Fathers of our faith say that this is the correct interpretation|`|TzDvl1CUaa	the spirit will not die, and Paul (or maybe Peter) said that to be absent from the body is to be present with Christ|`|93733684831cb258957f05ced7910d86aa	Agree, now when you meet God do you stay are go down under?

He is demonstrating the ultimate futility of leaving God out of your calculations.  His pursuit of worldly wisdom led him to despair.  It is at the very end of the book that the message comes through:    The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person.  Because God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.  Ecc 12:13-14    peace    Interpreting your verse, then I would note that "spirit" is not the soul, but rather the life force-- ruach--  that God breathed into Adam when he became a living soul.  The preacher is not talking about the destination of the soul, but rather the physical process of death.  The life that came from God goes back to him.  Using Ecclesiastes to develop an understanding of what happens to us after death is a mistake.  It is simply not addressed in the book, except at the end where we are told that we will stand for judgment.  That, of course, requires the survival of the soul.   People get judged.  That means that people cannot cease to exist when they die.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Ecclesiastes 3:19 and 20 helps answer your question.    What the verses are saying is that the bodies of both humans and animals return to the dust. Just as Adam was told - From dust you are and to dust you will return.    The spirit that returns is not like an immortal soul or such, because it is referring to animals in the same sense.    What it is saying is that what we call life leaves the person - they are now dead. That spark of life is gone. The only One who can return it is Jehovah God, who can restore humans to life by means of a resurrection. He has given his Son, Jesus the authority to carry out this in his behalf.    That is why John 5:28 and 29 speak of those in memorial tombs - that is, in God's memory. He can reconstruct everything there is to that person, their thoughts, personality, looks, memories, everything that makes them who they are.    We will see this resurrection begin right here on earth during the thousand year reign of Christ, under his rulership as king of God's kingdom.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	The spirit was and is always Gods. It doesn't belong to us. The soul is ours. The soul is what goes to heaven. The spirit just animates all physical life.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Hi Birdy, there are opposing beliefs on what this really means. In my opinion, the word "spirit" would be better translated as "breath" and is translated that way in some versions of the bible. When you use that meaning combined with the record in Genesis where God breathed the breath of life into Adam and Adam became a living soul, it begins to become clear that there is no soul apart from a living, breathing person.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Yes...you can take it literally.  We have a fleshly body and a spirit body.      The spirit body is the exact duplicate of our fleshly body, but it is just of spirit form.  When a person dies the fleshly body goes into the ground and decays.      The spirit body, however, departs and either goes to heaven or hell at that moment depending on whether they lived for Jesus or not.    That explains why in near death experiences the person sees themselves over their fleshly body, because they are in spirit body now and departed from the fleshy body.    http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

qzPZf2XPaa	Because sex is one of the mos spiritual things you can experience, people who say other wise are deluding themselves.|`|wNA3EqKcaa	People, especially young people, experience sexual thoughts throughout the day--especially when it's least appropriate! The key is 1) not purposefully entertaining these thoughts, and 2) training the mind to help keep away from sinful, lustful thoughts.    Fear of experiencing sexual or otherwise impure thoughts at Church should NOT keep one from attending Church. If someone has a sexual thought, he should pray within his heart and ask for purity.|`|AYyoasvtaa	Maybe becasue you are distracted. It may not be that your church is boring you may just be missing the sexual experiences b/t u and ur girlfriend or wife.|`|kzg1RHWraa	well theres actually an answer in the Bible 4 this    so u see of course we asscioate "all" sexual desire as bad of course thats wrong-Feelings are immoral its how you act and even more then that why you act on them    anyways the Bible says the law encourages sin to produce rapidly.  if you believe that God is angry w/ u at church cause u get sexually excited then u then enter under condemnation-which is an aftereffect of following the law... so since u r under the law and guilt of breaking the law-sin produces faster.    Its basically put this way- 'I "WILL NOT" give into lust'     thats why u need grace and u probly still will get excited in church but when u know God isn't upset you don't lust so much.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	people's humanity is not magically discarded when they enter into a place of worship.     yes, the focus should be on all things spiritual while in church, but as long as we're walking around in these bodies, we will have to contend with the flesh--even in church.|`|f90ca27c686e1316601b6836a8f2e32caa	because it is forbidden and highly inappropriate, kind of like having sex in a public place is exciting|`|84fm2GXOaa	beacuse they are human, and think about human things....|`|EiSUj2khaa	extreme boredom.. and if you're a real christian and young.. you're usually a Virgin too... so no more said|`|LUGCxeuNaa	i don't know.

nCjkx8qPaa	There are a lot of things practiced by today's modern society of false religions and false teachers / false preachers.  These mind numbing LIES are the very reason that the people of our generation consider christianity as a joke.    It is written, that most of the world will be deceived by these teachings. And When Judgment occurs at the end of the Millenium (the LORD's Day), The false teachers will be dealt with first.    Most of us made up our minds in the first Earth / Heaven Age as to where we stand. The Elect stood up against Satan during this time. (and) We will do so again in this Earth  / Heaven Age.

Neo-Darwinism make predictions, and those predictions are confirmed with every archaeological discovery. All life on Earth is derived from common ancestors, and finding organisms without DNA would disprove that. Yet all lifeforms on Earth have DNA. All life on Earth is hierarchical, and both the morphological and molecular hierarchies converge. Our discovery of transitional forms follow this hierarchy : we have plenty of transitions between reptiles and birds and reptiles and mammals.We can even explain why vestigial organs exist in a given species, by looking at the past of its genome. If whales were fishes instead of mammals, it would be rather bad for Darwinism. Or to take a previous example, we should not find mammals with vestigial feathers. There are millions of ways by which Neo-Darwinism could be falsified, and yet all the data we find confirm its obvious truth.rd to explain why they have vestigial legs. Indeed, those vestigial legs could be called the "smoking gun" of Neo-Darwinism     all of the other scientific disciplines agree as well, biology agrees with paleontology which agrees with zoology which agrees with chemistry which agrees with archeology.......on and on and on.....and none  of that is in dispute anywhere.    just no need for any more gods...from zues to athena to alah to ganesh to jesus to santa    your bible is disputed within its pages, within it pews, within its churches and within its leaders.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Because it's important to look at the wisdom of more than one spiritual teacher.  On what points they all agree, there will you find the truth.  Don't forget that Jesus' teaching "career" was very short so he didn't have time to say everything he wanted to no doubt, so other teachers such The Buddha and Lao Tzu (in ancient times, and there are teachers of these times worth listening to) fill in the gaps and add to the teachings.  Or vice versa of course.|`|026e583a4f8bdf68c9199aa674249f5baa	Oh I dunno, how about his promises of torture eternal? Matt 11:21-24    Or Matt 15:4 "For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."    Or how about how he basically says that he makes his parables deliberately obscure so people will go to hell: Mark 4:11-12.    Or best so far here Jesus describes God's realtionship to his followers as that of a slave owner who whips his slaves with many stripes: Luke 12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.  12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.     I don't think I like the guy much right now... or his Father (of course they're one and the same anyway, right? but even if this is just the 'historical jesus' saying these things, which the Jesus Seminary doubts anyway their really awful!!)    So no, I wouldn't follow Jesus because he isn't a preacher of sunshine and roses like everyone thinks he is. I think people just make up the Jesus they want and assume the bible backs them up then have the nerve to act surprised when it's contradicted by biblical references.|`|FJOdKzLXaa	Following Jesus is like being in love. You have to get to know someone before you fall in love with them. Jesus does not seem real to many people. He has to become real to us before we can even start to get to know Him and love him as the immortal God-man who took the greatest chance in human history, the greatest leap of faith, he died knowing that it was possible he may not come back, giving up immortality on the chance that He might save the people he loved so much that it was worth it to Him. Not everyone understands, it's hard for them to grasp that they were the ones He loved enough to take the leap for.|`|ZIlUpooRaa	Amos 3:3 says 2 people cannot walk together unless they are in agreement.  The reason a lot of people don't follow Jesus is because they don't like what Jesus taught.  They would rather do things their own way.    John 6:59-61, 66 says:    These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.|`|JL8KpDYnaa	because the antiChrist doesn't follow Him either and will need a cult of personality...|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	Everyone has the freedom of will.

We do not work for them.      Unfortunately over the decades we have allowed them to usurp so much power from us, that many of us no longer understand what our forefathers fought and died for.      The US Constitution is barely touched on in the schools anymore, and the majority of politicians have never even studied or read our Constitution.    We lose more and more of our God given rights every year, and it's going to get worse.  And yes,  we have God given rights but we have allowed government to take them away slowly and subtly.

And it's up to all men to prevent rape.|`|utJYCCvaaa	i think they are around the same but as everyone is saying Abortion is Murder then i choose Rape because Raping Someone leaves a Emotional Scar and the person has to live with it for the rest of their life and "Murder" to me isn't as bad.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	Both are violent crimes.      I would have to say that abortion is worse. Its premeditated murder. You can't ask the forgiveness of that child afterward for taking its life.    While rape is a terrible this it can be forgiven.

However if I were to say which is worse, I would ultimately go with rape as the more horrible of the two.     Abortion is a gruesome thing and it kills an innocent thing with a right to be born.    However, rape is a very terrifying experience and it always leaves emotional scars for the rest of the victims life. For that reason, the emotional pain that remains after the incident, rape would be considered worse. (To me of course)    Cheers|`|cV22kVBUaa	Abortion is the people opinion to do so  but rape ruins your dignity.

u6K5TtRlaa	Not at all. In fact, I think it makes most guys more comfortable saying so. I'm not afraid to say a guy is looking particularly handsome one day, either. As long as it doesn't sound like you're coming onto them, everybody appreciates a compliment. Does it matter who tells you that you're looking good? As long as they mean it, it helps. And, just because I'm not attracted to women doesn't mean that I can't say they're looking attractive in general. I can still tell who's attractive and who's fugly without being attracted to them.    And for the next question, are you talking about what makes anyone initially attracted to a boy, or what gets them tenting? I look for intelligence and sincerity in a boy when I first meet him. When it comes to what makes me horny, I like it when a guy is really confident about his body and his sexuality. If he knows he has me hooked and knows how to enjoy that, I can't resist 'im.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I'm a bisexual tranny boy, but I don't really find it uncomfortable to compliment anyone. My classmates see me as a lesbian (I'm not out as trans) an I compliment them all the time LOL. Compliments make people feel great.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	I have no problem saying anything about a woman. Here's what I think about the issue, you can think someone is attractive without being attracted to someone.  Second I really like (personally not physically) a guy that has a high self confidence but it is not boastful (and of course he has to deserve the confidence he has to he can't be a deush and be all proud, and he always needs the universally great attributes like inttelegant funny and interesting). Insecure guys are a turn off. I always appreciate some kind of physical contact that can either be a nudge or pat or hug but something is always great so I know that he is kinda involved and not just spacing out the whole time we are together or is like counting his minutes away.  When it comes to what he would say I can't really tell you reason being there is nothing specific I really like to hear but as long as he talks at all cuz those really shy not very talkative guys kinda get on my nerves here and there  But yeah that's me for ya|`|AfVSH3ghaa	well yes it makes me want to yell out that i am gay and something a guy can say to turn me on is like hey sexy and how u doin|`|ltYtxmjEaa	no i don't.  and what turns me on about a guy.. well first and formost.. his personality.. got to have a good one. sweet guys are such a turnon!!!! my best friend, who is straight, talks about how he will treat his girlfriend and just goes on about all this romantic stuff, and it makes me wanna jump on top of him! he is SOOOOOO sweet.. if i can find a man like that.. i could die happily.|`|ae3f9bbdeb1e63825db24ba47b307cd9aa	PERSONALITY-thats what turns me on! i mean ive dated some pretty ugly guys but they were so sweet and they were just awesome!(but didnt work out)|`|3aEQqoM8aa	no, i have no problem telling a girl shes pretty or beautiful.    ummm... LoL, i know this sounds weird but i like how he smells and i love him kissing me.|`|dLlbo591aa	No.    And it's very difficult to quantify or qualify the second parts.|`|RALliiZTaa	1. no, I like to complement a woman on how she looks ( and most guys do, it dose not matter if you are gay or not) but I won't be dating her for obvious reason    2. I guess a lot of things, both physically and personally. if he has a personality of a great person I'd totally date him (and I'm not saying who, but there is this person I'm eying and hope he won't be taken by any other guy but me that I'm talking to). personality can also make up for physical attraction. I sometimes find something cute about him even if others are not that attracted to him|`|30Ojw4n8aa	no i say girls are pretty and i am comfortable about it  any boy that would be willing to protect their love and can be sweet understanding and there for me every step of the way   that turns me on

Allah created what He created.   Allah knows the best.    I suggest you search ulema sites first|`|0BHiaVZ9aa	In the Qur'an and Hadith (sayings of the Prophet), it is emphasized that animals be treated as humanely as any other of Allah's vast creation. The Qur'an goes as far to say that cruelty to animals is equivalent to cruel treatment of a human being. Kind treatment of animals is considered a good deed in the same sense that good conduct and treatment between human beings is deemed a good deed. The following Hadith illustrates this point:    The Prophet said, "While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.' So, he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him.'' The people asked ``O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?'' He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).'' (Narrated by Abu Huraira -- Volume 3, Book 40, Number 551)    In Islam, the Qur'an and Hadith give clear guidance on several matters concerning animals, aside from their treatment and roles. Another issue which is carefully described in the Qur'an and Hadith is the slaughter of animals for food. In Islam, one must follow strict guidelines from the Qur'an and Hadith on the process and proper way of slaughter.    We should definitely take better care of animals i agree.|`|bWtp8Zyjaa	Erm, no.      -God Bless.|`|TKgfCYfOaa	no Allah created animals because they are useful to human beings... samething science says every single living organism affects us.

If racism (or cultural hatred) did not exist, then we would have irish literature.   It's nice to see that you are seeing things culturally and not racially. The world needs more people like you.   MY WHOLE RESPONSE IS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU ARE NOT RACIST.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	too similar to your own culture, no "diversity"|`|JDRj44xMaa	I had a similar experience.. Perhaps is it bc most of what we learn stems from European philosophy, culture, arts, math, sci? Basic G.E.?? So when they mean diversity, they mean from other cultures??
bdSm8Mi6aa	I think if Christian's believe that there is some guy in the clouds that created this entire world in seven days; then its not so hard to believe in the flood.|`|VzIWDuRzaa	Well since the world is over 6000yrs old its not hard to explain. God Bless|`|uMKWNhLkaa	Water to flood the entire earth from the clouds needs to be a miracle through Gods power.  The supply of water isnt here on earth.  Where does the water receed when the rain ends.  God does another miracle to have it drained away.   Here a proof video of the ark.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9q17cGJ...|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	The oldest tree is claimed to be 5,000 years old. And the flood wasn't local. It was world wide like the bible says. The flood is documented in the bible and as fossilized remains on mountain tops. Your 5,000 year old tree is just hersey as usual. Just a guess. And then you boldly proclaim it as truth. Kind of like what you say about us. Hypocrite.|`|482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	There is a lot of other evidence in the biblical text to support the idea that the flood was indeed global. "The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered"  is just one example (Gen. 8:19). But of course, none of that would matter to someone who doesn't believe in the historical veracity of the Bible.    To the person who mentioned the 9,500 year old tree: they used radiocarbon dating to establish that date, which, to my understanding, does not always yield reliable results. Also, not all creationists have set a definite date for the age of the earth. Some believe it could be 10,000 or so years old. Your argument is not very well-grounded.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	You can't prove to me that the oldest tree is any age. I know scientists think they can, but they seriously can't. They weren't there. They have no idea how old things are. Neither do I, but I don't claim to.    Wow, "retards"? You don't even know me, you must be a very angry person. Do you really think there are 5,000 rings to count? Did you count them? Didn't think so.|`|AA11297267	Try better research.  The oldest tree in the world is 9,500 years old -- older than the creationist's earth :)  And rules out the "flood" (as if we needed to...)    http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...    Peace.|`|casg30Ataa	Maybe satan put that tree there.|`|AA11992885	first off, a flood TO DESTROY ALL FLESH..............a local flood was more then enough at that time to destroy all "humans" of a certain level of evolution.......God never promised that HE wouldn't do local floods, HE promised to not destroy all "flesh" with a flood again, local or world wide    and since the flood was only local, trees certainly existed outside the local flooding area, and the world is far older then 6000 years old anyways    the count currently on the Jewish calendar only counts from Adam, NOT from the creation of the world, which is 5768 i beleive....and again, this is only since Adam, not the creation of the world    the world was created some 15 billion years ago, something like that|`|zMcHYQeBaa	I agree with davan_ben_noach's answer|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Two explanations to  the two dilemmas: The oldest tree that you claim is 5000 years old who date tested it, was it you? i thought not..     Has anyone ever tried to drown this old tree to see whether it would survive after being subdued under water for a long period of time, in fact how many other trees of a similar age are surrounding this old tree or is it just the one..     The next thing, all these local floods that happen all the time, were there ever any survivors or did every single one of the locals drown? no they didn't all drown did they?..     In the great flood every single person drowned, except for Noah his wife and their three sons and their three wives, when the waters subsided plant life continued..    One more thing, how do you count the rings on a living tree?..    It does not make sense to you because it goes against what you've said..    So the tree was cut down in 64 and you were a witness to the counting of the rings were you not, unless you've just heard the story and you faithfully believe those who were there..     In your favour lets hope that they counted the rings correctly..|`|gf5ysBCnaa	The food wouldn't have been that great if it was local. That is why it is called the great flood, it left a scar of fear in the heart of mankind that god patched over with a rainbow.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	Uh... what's your point???

We may lose another generation to obesity, but I doubt we'll lose more than that.|`|ENIQAxDhaa	ANOREXICS|`|MaDN2SYEaa	there might a lower population of "naturally" thin people but i dont think theyll be rare or extinct. i dont know how many people are naturally thin right now though.

But only if people actually use it. otherwise we will dwindle but not become extinct or rare.|`|P5ZNPyW4aa	Actually, live in Minnesota and you'll see your assumption is pretty incorrect. =P  The people here (at least in the Twin Cities and Red Wing) are all pretty much healthy and thin.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	well, as far as aesthetics go, i think the pendulum will start to swing the other way.  for the last 40-50 years, thin has been in. prior to that, a larger frame was de rigeur.      i think that over the next 10 years, we will see people starting to question more and more what it was in the culture that made grown women feel that they should be the size of 10 year olds.|`|FhQ3Yt6saa	nah naturally thin people aren't becoming rare since our definition on naturally thinner people has changed, and people notice the larger obese people more often then the thin.|`|lnXFAmSaaa	I doubt it.

H7evKKdIaa	How about Nursery Time, ot Nursery Rymes...Nursery meaning Nurseing home and Nursery like, for babies. I really think this is a great idea! My grandmother was in a nursing home a few years ago, and everytime I went to visit her, I noticed thease things too...its sad, and I'm glad to hear you want to do something to help put a smile aon thease peoples faces. Oh, and maybe for your "program" you could get not only mothers and babies to visit, but children and even teens form local schools too!|`|tAQvUE4kaa	You have a great idea!    "Chinese culture places the elderly in a revered position. They are a treasured part of society, and people value the life experiences and the wisdom the aged are felt to have accumulated over the years. When someone reaches sixty years of age, they have achieved that special status. A celebration is held and every family member tries his or her best to attend. With every year that passes, the individuals prestige, dignity and status only increase."     excerpted from Culture Briefing: China    Here's an idea for a name...Shared Treasures  it's a start or it's the one..  you may want to add additional entertainment and still be able to use the name...imagine 8 crying babies in a nursing home tv room evey week.    I think that these residents would also enjoy a choir from a local school to come perform, maybe once in the spring and once in the fall.    or even a theatre class to perform a play the are rehearsing      loveyalaterseeyabye/bdi

0QFKm3WLaa	I had my first date on 15. From the information you give - this is not enough for her to be lesbo, you know|`|fJt5zRTXaa	Just because she doesn't have a boyfriend, it doesn't mean she's a lesbian. You should try asking her, maybe she just hasn't found a boyfriend? And she's only 13, I have loads of friends who didn't have boyfriends at that age. So in most likely hood, I don't think your cousin is a lesbian.|`|PpJEaCpCaa	no i'm 16 and never had a boyfriend and i'm 100% straight she's probably waiting for the right guy|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	omg, grow up, how old are you?? seriously why should a 13 year old have a boyfriend?!|`|Dq1r2ixlaa	Um...no. I haven't had a boyfriend yet and I'm 16. I'm in no hurry to get pregnant before that age.|`|nRjY9J5Yaa	umm that means nuffin  im 18 and never had a bf either   just cuz u were a whore since u was lil doesn't mean everyone else is  she just dont wana experiment with anyone  she just probably wants to wait for someone to steal her heart|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Just because she hasn't started dating yet doesn't mean anything about her sexual orientation.   She's only 13, fer cryin' out loud!!      And if YOU had 10 boyfriends by the time you were 13, that doesn't speak very well for you, quite frankly. Its not something I would brag about if I were you.|`|zSdeMhvAaa	umm no! im 13 and i havent have a bf and i am deff not a lesbo!!! i mean maybe she doesnt want to date! ik i dont 4 a while...|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Gee she is only 13, maybe you are just a hoe.|`|3ME7sBxjaa	You're nuts.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	Quite the contrary.

Every one matures at different ages.  Why not just let her alone and find her own sexual orientation|`|lz4nK3ibaa	If you're assumptions are only going on her lack of boyfriends then i'd say wait another 5 years or so before you come to any conclusions.     Some people are late bloomers...  A friend of mine didn't have one till she was 22... And shes been in the relationship for a year or so now.    Have you thought that she may actually have other priorities like school, music or friends?? Boys aren't everything to everyone at that age, and thats a good thing!    13 is still very young, I wouldn't go jumping to any conclusions just yet... but if she is so what, good on her!|`|Avbh2QEeaa	no!! she's just 13. it's not like if it's considered "normal" to have 10 boyfriends by the time ur 13.

And if she is gay who gives a ****? She's not gonna bother you! Leave her alone and I hope she doesn't have to see you very often.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Wow. No.    It means that she probably has better priorities than to date a million guys. Or maybe she hasn't been asked out yet. Or maybe she doesn't even like anyone. I don't know.

Cause i just think the guy should say that.  Because Girls fall in love with guys all the time, guys can be players alot so when they say I love you, it just means that they REALLY REALLY care about you.  I think the letter could make him realize how much you REALLY like him.. and then he'd realize how much he REALLY likes you.. and then he would say I love you soon! hhaha    But i'm 16 and my boyfriend of 3 months is 16 too and we havent said i love you yet either.|`|AA10941169	aw. shy guys are the cutest.  anyway you can probably write about a time you guys had together that whenever you think about makes you laugh or smile and say how you look forward to more memories to make like that one. and that when he is done reading this you have two gifts waiting for him. one a kiss and two whatever gift you decide to give him.   ok that might be somewhat cheesy but its just an idea.  and if you sincerely feel that you love him and its the right time to confess you can add that at the end of the letter. don't feel pressured to say it, you're young and can keep things in relationships simple.|`|QFf9phAmaa	write him just LOVELILO|`|3f3ad3990a7e27462986bdcaf4e4a684aa	only say i love you if you mean it!  and dont be afraid if he wont say it back. tell him how u feel anyway.

I know that there are certain causes of bleeding that are not considered menses and during those times it is permissible to follow a regular prayer and study.

You may be very "religious", but you sure aren't very "spiritual".      If you were more spiritual, you would understand that your body is a holy temple which is deserving of the very best possible treatment and respect.  Instead, you have ignored your temple's cries for help, and now you are talking foolishly and ignoring the warning signs of what could be a serious problem.     If you are going to be so stupid about your own health, then get off the internet and quit trying to make people feel sorry for you.

Sister, you need to see a doctor. i envy you for your determination, I have just learned to read the Quran yet i dont ever find the time to read a juz per night.     Sister, Allah is Merciful, and our deen is one of ease. If your bleeding has gone more than 8 days, it is considered as an illness and therefore if you are able, take gusl, then pray wearing sanitary pads. Im not sure if you can read the Quran in that state so better check with your local Imam.     Also, salat and reading Quran are not the only ways to worship Allah. If you do things for teh sake of Allah and follow the sunnah of the Prophet sws, it becomes an act of worship. May Allah guide us always.|`|7UV3OVANaa	salam,     I know, i was shocked by the answers too, lol. Mashallah, i like your faith. Lol, i never have time to read a JUZU a day, mashallah. But alhamdulilah, i pray five times a day. Well, you can still read Quran, i mean you can use the websites on the internet adn stuff.Yes, you have to make wudu before every prayer, and keep your clothes clean, Allah is merciful, He wont diqualify your prayers if you are going through an illness. Well, i hope inshallah you get better, and be able to practice your things more. SALAM AND ALLAH YIBARIK FIKI! (may Allah bless you!)     JAK    OH AND I FORGOT YOU HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR, I DONT THINK IT IS NORMAL WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. TELL YOU MOM AND GO TO A DOCTOR NOW!!! salam :)  get better!    p.s. maybe you can contact me, it would be nice to have a Muslim penpal, lol. salam

I9CD3ORQaa	Wow, now that's a great question.  It really depends on what the person has been eating lately.  I'll attest to having let go of one of the worst farts I've ever smelled, and since we all somehow take a bit of pleasure in our own flatulence, that's impressive.  Still, I've smelled some horrendous burps as well.    I guess you'd have to test this out on your own (and I think it would be the greatest scientific test EVER).  You're gonna need about a week to carry this out entirely, but here goes.  Spend two days eating nothing but hard-boiled eggs, hot wings, onions, and broccoli.  Drink lots of beer.  After about day 3, I'm pretty sure your stomach will be ready to produce one of the world's worst belches.  Spend a few days recovering.  Eat lots of dairy, brush your teeth a lot, bananas should help out too.  Go out one night to a Brazilian steakhouse and wait for the guy with the garlic beef.  When he comes by and asks if you'd like some, tell him to keep it coming.  The next morning you should be able to finish the test.  Seriously, I've cleared entire houses with garlic beef.  If you're into masochism, run these experiments concurrently.  I can't see how, in any way at all, there would be anyone who wouldn't rather be at the bottom of a dumpster than sitting within twenty feet of you.|`|Rh8m6cxnaa	Oh good grief!!!!|`|qHEpR92Gaa	dookie S           T            A I         N       S.|`|yxtj5LUaaa	Bad fart for sure.

AA10329469	One can always try and make up for the wrongs done by him knowingly or otherwise.I think,more than Prayers,it's our deeds  which are more  important .All religions,including Islam recognizes this and have preached variously to the followers.There is no need to be afraid but go ahead and try to set the record right by your good deeds and actions.|`|SsRw7ujraa	It is not a problem to do sins because all of us can do wrong things, except prophets, but the problem is the intention to do the sin.However you should regularly ask for forgiveness with the intention of not doing it again, thence it is not a probleb even if you did it again.    Chapter 2: THE OBLITERATION OF SINS WITH THE HELP OF SEEKING FORGIVENESS PROM ALLAH   Book 037, Number 6620:     Abu Sirma reported that when the time of the death of Abu Ayyub Ansari drew near, he said: I used to conceal from you a thing which I heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as sayirig: Had you not committed sins, Allah would have brought into existence a creation that would have committed sin (and Allah) would have forgiven them.  Book 037, Number 6621:     Abu Ayyub Ansari reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you were not to commit sins, Allah would have swept you out of existence and would have replaced you by another people who have committed sin, and then asked forgiveness from Allah, and He would have granted them pardon.  Book 037, Number 6622:     Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.      http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...|`|dAcNaajsaa	CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING AND YOUR ANSWER IS IN THERE INSHA'ALLAAH.    From chapter 25 - Surah Al-Furqan (The Criterion)      69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;    70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    71. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    As you can, what is mentioned is :    1- believing in the truth sent from God (ie, islam)    2- repentence    3-righteous deeds        If accepted, what wil happen if you do these 3 things ???      'for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds'    Isn't that what you want ???      Another point important to mention is, how will you know what are the good deeds to do and what are the sins to repent from and what is it that you have to believe in ???    The answer to that is the point 4 that you are required to do, insha'allaah. and that is:    4- seek knowledge    The other condition that is not a point separately but is intrinsic to the above 4 points is that you be sincere while doing the best you can in the above 4 points.... that is the best way to go. and then you will find that 'Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'      may Allaah enable you and us all to follow the best of these words and accept us into his mercy and paradise !!!!|`|AYs6iFlLaa	You are given a "clean slate" and all your sins are forgiven you upon the taking of Shahada. God is often forgiving and most merciful. Seek forgiveness from God, only he can give you heaven or the hellfire, and turn away from sinful behaviors. Live your life for his pleasure and don't be hard on yourself. May God grant you peace, patience, and the patience to persevere through all your hardships and discomfort.|`|igkbUflbaa	You're a muslim. Good. I'm glad you worship a god that makes logical sense. Only god knows who will go to hell. It is not up to people to judge you, only god is the final judge, and god its the most merciful of judges. I would recommend posting this is the Holidays-Rhamadan section for muslim answers.

You'll start again with a clean slate.|`|E870WbAsaa	Brother,    Repent for your sins.  Ask Allah for forgiveness.  And never repeat the sins again.    And the most important is to remember that Allah is "The Most Merciful", and if you act upon as stated above, Insha Allah you will be for given by The Allah   :)    Jizak Allah    :)|`|CQz8dMzFaa	Yes, there is a way. First of all, ask God for forgiveness. Secondly, don't repeat them. Third, try to do a good deed now and then.This can be done in a small or large scale. Fourth, pray regularly, and ask for forgiveness everyday. All this is written in the Quran.   As humans, we sin every single minute, even unknowingly. As long as you dont intend to, God will forgive you, because He is 'Oft-forgiving, Oft-Merciful'. The fact also that you have realised your sins is the path to repentance. Dont be scared or confused. Pray regularly(and yes, it will always help), read the Quran, you'll feel liberated.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	In Islam, you are never sure, there are the scales that must be weighed, have you done enough good to counter balance the evil you have done?  The Good News is that Christ paid for your sins on a cross for you. He took all of your sins, past present and future.  Turn to Him, He will forgive you, and you can know that you have eternal life, according to the bible.|`|vBMjcDaYaa	You need to pray a lot. You are not getting through. God's dead! Jesus can't reusurrect nobody cause the elders said the next person to be resurrected would not be God. That's a rule or something. Sheesh! You know you are forgiven when it is apparant God has forgotten. His memory can't hold no more, Poor thing. That's Ma in there in the place where they pile the bodies off the carts country.|`|ubffk5L4aa	well brother just start praying for one thing. dont be late either at the end of every prayer say astagfurillah 33 times. then say allauakbar 33 times say alhamdillah 33times and then say subhanallah 33 times. then pray your sunnah. be sincere for forgiveness. it will remind you of allah so that you wont make bad choices|`|BhYn0zmfaa	Ask for forgiveness from God, the Just and the Wise.    He is surely oft-Forgiving and Most Mericful     So don't fear, just do your 5 pillars and insha'allah Allah swt will give you a clean slate.  Know the one story of the one that killed 100 men, its long so this is the short verse, he killed 100 men and asked for forgiveness, was told by a wise sage to go a place there he will find Allah's Mercy. But on his way he died, the angels came down to take his soul but they started to quarrel one says Jannah-(Heaven) the other saying Jahannam-(fire).    So they asked Allah. So Our Lord said, measure from were he came from to were he was going if its more than half-way enter into Heaven it its less than half-way enter him into Hell. So to two angel do so and they found he was only one step more than half way. So he entered Heaven .    Question did he do the act of forgiveness? No.  He only had the intention for seeking forgiveness.    Remember you'll be judged on your Intention not your Actions and you're a Muslim until your last breath and even then Shaytan can come and put whispers into your heart and you could die in Kufr in your Last Breath in though you lived as a good Muslim.     Remember what the Quran says  Don't give up/despair from the Mercy of Allah.

I think they made that show as popular as it was for so long.     I did read recently that Paul was an alcoholic, and that his behavior  when drunk caused problems for the show. He eventually had to be  removed from the show, since he couldn't refrain from ugly outbursts.  I hated to read that, since he was so funny to me. He died from his  alcoholism soon after a major outburst, where they had to find  someone to fill in for him. He totally lost control, so he went down-  hill about then.|`|AA10405438	Hollywood Squares|`|62aa8bddc1cd975a68423b931027c1a2aa	google one of the charactesr thats should help|`|vrquFHfraa	Hollywood Squares|`|y7HD8unTaa	I was gonna say the Phil Silvers Show or the Paul Lynde Show....but I can see the answer is most likely the Hollywood Squares.

C7o9XMaZaa	Well probably because stupid presidents keeping sticking our noses where they don't belong.|`|0audneJ4aa	First I am going to assume you are talking about the United States of America, not America, which would encompass North and South America. Canadians, Mexicans, Bolivians etc.. etc.. are all Americans. This is the same as Germans, French, British etc.. etc.. all being Europeans.    An overwhelming majority of countries are peaceful and more concerned with their own well-being than with invading another country. Lacking any real enemies, United States foreign policy has intentionally created enemies and conflict to support the defense industry and further the goals of the ruling elite for the last 50 years.    I was raised to believe that the United States is the "Land of the Free and Home of the Brave". I was seriously misinformed. The United States truly is "the great satan". The United States mass media continues to project an image of the United States as the "bastion of democracy" and "leader of the free world" - yet, few people other than people living in the United States believe it any more.    Just as past United States of America atrocities have created wars and conflicts, the current atrocities will result in more conflict, loss of life and environmental destruction. The preparations for the so called war against 'terrorism' have been going on for at least 20 years. In partnership with the Saudi ruling family, the global ruling elite has radicalized Islam through mind control facilities disguised as religious schools. In these schools they create the 'terrorists' needed for an enemy. Without the CIA, Saudi 'schools' and Israeli abuse of Palestinians there simply wouldn't be a threat from muslim 'terrorists'. If the US had not stolen democracy from so many countries in the first place, muslim fundamentalism wouldn't have grown to the level it is now.    The continued war will be one against freedom, democracy and life as the United States military empire and its minions expand control gradually over more of the globe in the name of 'fighting terrorism' and the creation of a global corporate police state.|`|c73cac86901ee77d1060c607b55ea156aa	I'm 42 years old.

The general arrogance of the people!|`|LY0cZJO4aa	I don't think you can generalize but sure there have been people who hate america. I don't. I think America is awesome. Here are some reasons why other people may hate america.    1. America is the worlds most powerful country militarily and economically. All such states (rome, britain) have been criticized by others. As a lot goes on in your country difersnt people will think things are good and bad.    2. American foreign policy. This has been pro-Israel. That will annoy Arabs Nd people who sympathize with Palestine. Israel is really opressing a people who were dispossessed of land by Jews in the war.  It is a complicated subject and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.    3. America consumes a huge percentage of the works resources and is generally hostile to the enviornment. In Europe we are more in the centre so we disagree.    4. The us seems to want oil from other countries used up before it touches it's reserves. Let's face it, the second Iraq war was not about a d or terrorism, the us wanted a foothold in the middle east and a friendly regime in Baghdad. Again, your own opinion on this is fine, but that did make things worse after Israel.    5.  Bush 2. Very negative and undeserved  overage of bush. The press in Europe is just as liberal as the one in the states but a lot netted at hiding it. The message was: bush and republicans = very bad, ant democrat = good. That is a heavy bias and is not good for democracy.    6. General liberal bias. Europeans are more liberal. Liberals are very intolerant, think they are "right" and anyone else is stupid. USA is mostly republican and Christian, liberals don't like that. Obama was wildly popular over here because be is a democrat. Your image will improve greatly, for right or wrong as a result.    Anyway, there some reasons. There could be others.    For my part, I like american culture, tv, sports, music, movies and the people the only thing I or my friends dislike about the states is when we see racism or something else negative because we admire and respect your country and want it to be the best it can be.

AuPI2apEaa	Look up the Nicene creed|`|AA11923447	Actually, the best way to learn about Catholicism is to take RCIA courses. Most Catholic churches have them. If you don't like the church nearest you, there are many others, since most towns of any size have one or more Catholic churches. Call your local church and ask when they're having RCIA courses. These classes are specifically designed to teach people the basics of Catholicism. Many people take the courses while preparing for the rite of Confirmation, but there's no obligation whatsoever to convert. I know people who've taken RCIA courses and ended up not joining the Church. I know non-Christians who have taken them. The classes will have far more detailed information than you're going to be able to get from a single post in  R&S.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	Catholic.com    Here's a good start: From there you can explore the rest of the site and learn more:    http://www.catholic.com/library/Pillar.a...|`|feBJEgcgaa	The more someone actually reads the Bible, the more they find it frivolous.     However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)    Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)    A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.

As a Catholic, you should be attending Mass every Sunday.  Look up Roman Catholic Churches in your local yellow pages and see where the nearest one is.  If you are older, have you been confirmed yet?  If not, talk to the local priest about attending RCIA classes and becoming confirmed.  There are websites out there and I am sure your local parish has religious education classes, etc.  I was Catholic for over 40 years, and it is too hard a religion, and too complicated to give you a 'sum up' of what it means to be Catholic.  Perhaps, if you are over 18, it is time to start looking around and seeing and learning about other religions, and not just other Christian sects.  Start reading books that pose the idea that Jesus is Not divine, such as 'The Shroud of Turin' and 'The Gnostic Gospels'.|`|31M2IDw2aa	Buy a copy of the Catechism of The Catholic Church for a few dollars at most book stores.

It is very heartbreaking to see this and I apologize for this.|`|AA10311549	First of all I should state that I am NOT a pro-lifer.  But neither am I a Pro-choicer either.    BUT I AM PRO-LIFE!  BOTH the mother's and the POTENTIAL new born.    However having said that, I also believe that a HUMAN LIFE by definition is NOT a developing embyro until it can reason and be capable of self-awareness.    But still the embryo is a POTENTIAL human beling.    And although about 25 to 30 % of all embyros are spontaneously aborted, that does not necessarikly mean that this potential life should be given NO regard.    What is the definition of a human being?  Note that even now people "pull the plug" in hospitals all the time when there is no longer any brain activity. It is assumed that they are NOT killing a human being.    This is because where there is no ratiocination, no self awareness, there can NOT be a human life.    All human life and all potential human life should be held in serious consideration, and reverence.    However, why should a NON-human life, even a POTENTIAL human life, have either equal or higher right to continued existence than the mother?    There is NO simple answer to the question of abortion. People who want simplistic answers get instead the answers of simpletons.    I happen to be pro-reason. A POTENTIAL life is to be reveared and protected BUT it is NOT a human being.  And is not to be considered one. A mother IS a REAL life, IS a human being and as such she TOO has the right to life.    BUT because the embryo and fetus IS a potential human life, I believe that only a serious consideration should allow one to opt for an abortion.  And ONLY to save another life when the fetus is capable of ratiocination and self-awareness.    As for early term abortions, one such consideration is the obvious necessity to save the life of the mother as in an ectopic or tubal pregnancy.    Other people believe that in the case of rape, the seriousness is sufficient to warrant an abortion.    I agree that these points are debatable, but let us do with logic, reason, and FACTS.    The assumption that at the moment of conception we have a human being is NOT a fact. And so long as people refuse to argue true facts no concensus nor even understanding can take place.    To opt for indiscriminate abortion on demand is just showing a severe lack of regard and respect for life and the "rights" of the developing fetus, and should have a comensurate reason for its abortion.      On the other hand, to indiscriminately state that all embryos and fetuses which can not yet be considered a human being -- meaning it must have ratiocination and be self aware -- , have a "right" to life above that of the mother who is a human being, is also showing a severe lack of regard and respect for the mother.    BE RESPONSIBLE!  Please stop using abortion as an alternate method of birth control.\\And by the way, how is it that no one seems to even mention the right's of the father for his child?    ======================================...  And ANGIE PANTS:  You stated:  "killing something."  Why is it so hard for you to understand that in early term, this "something" is definitely NOT a human life?  Do you not believe that killing a human being is DIFFERENT from killing say a blastula stage embryo?  Should ALL embryos NEVER be aborted?  What if the embryo endangers the life of the mother?  Why can't you seem to be able to nuance this moral distinction?|`|lmAhmZfzaa	whoa.  whoa.  you need to go cardio kickboxing or something.  you're going to get an ulcer.|`|buly56vFaa	Twisted and sick, isn't it?|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	You sound really, really angry.

KBBonf97aa	I don't think your standards should change just because you came to a realization.  I'm assuming the reason you were waiting until you were married was that you wanted that intimacy reserved for the one person with whom you planned to spend the rest of your life.  If you decided to have sex with a person of each sex for the "experience" of it, you're really lowering the bar, since you obviously wouldn't be committed to either of them.  I still think it's admirable to wait for marriage (or the equivalent), if that was your intent before realizing you're bisexual.  Sex for the sake of sex isn't going to be a great experience the way it will be with your soulmate.|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	Wait until you are deeply in love.

I fell in love with my husband and that is the main reason I married him, but I am still attracted to girls.|`|AkJNt2FMaa	hey!    i faced the same dilemma when i first realised i was bi, when you first accept that you are bi it is a exciting and tantalising thing, wondering what the difference between having sex with a man and a women would be.    but eventually you become used to your sexuality, and the curiosity lessens.    i decided that i would still wait, i was never going to sleep with different women before i found 'the one' to see what it was like with different girls, so why should it be any different now? just because there is another gender involved doesn't mean i should treat whomever i choose to marry (yes marry, male or female, we will get equal rights, of that i have no doubts) with any less respect.

But as far as the pursuit of triumph, victory, and if your talking about which one breaths the fire of combat, men all the way.

Women Get to Wait in Line at Public Restrooms  This might seem like an argument for the opposite camp, but think of the times you've been at a baseball game or monster truck pull having a perfectly miserable time with a male companion. By excusing yourself to stand on line at the biffy, you were reunited with many of your own gender, and as you inched forward, flush after flush, you began to talk  really talk  with these women (shared discomfort creates deep trust and mutual understanding). By the time you made it to the stall you were hugging your companions goodbye and exchanging phone numbers  friends for life! Men, on the other hand, are in and out of the head in no time. Do you think it's a coincidence that men have difficulty creating close and lasting friendships with other men?    2. Women Get a Door  This is related to reason one. There's something unseemly about having to pull out your goods for public display, and ... horrors, I can't even go on!    3. Women Get to Sit Down  There's been some controversy on this topic, thanks to Camille Paglia, who writes in her book Sexual Personae: "Male urination is a kind of accomplishment, an arch of transcendence. A woman merely waters the ground she stands on." I can't speak for Camille, but only in extreme cases of toilet deprivation have I ever "watered the ground I stood on." I prefer to sit.    4. Men Make More Money  Men, propelled by their willies and some prehistoric hunt-and-gather mindset, spend their nasty lives clawing, sniping and scratching their way to the top of the pay scale, all the while eating fatty foods, losing their hair and clogging their arteries, until one day  kablooey!  they keel over. When they're gone, it's the women (who live longer) who spend what's left. All those old ladies you see at the travel agency collecting stacks of cruise brochures are having fun, fun, fun!    5. Women Never Worry About Whose is Bigger  No matter what we tell men about how much size doesn't matter, it does. (Well, it doesn't really, but we talk about it with our girlfriends, anyway.) Knowing this, women can feel fortunate that we don't attach much of our identity to something we can only see in a hand-held mirror.    6. Women Are Better Looking  Because women don't have penises, and therefore, loads of violence-inducing testosterone coursing through our veins, we're prettier, softer, have less stubbly black hair, smell better, and are basically more lovely to behold. When men can't understand why we spend so much time in the bathroom, it's because they don't know the joy of appreciating one's lovely mug in the mirror.    7. Women Have Breasts  Given the preoccupation that straight men have with these, it puzzles me that Freud never came up with a Breast Envy theory. Breasts are fun, no matter what shape, size or agenda, be it nutritional or recreational. They are soft, reassuring, and in their passive splendor, a far more potent sexual asset than any dangling penis.    8. Women Have Periods  As a woman, I am allowed to eat copious amounts of food, yell at my loved ones, cry uncontrollably for no reason, and when it's all over, say "I can't help it. I'm having my period." When men behave this irrationally, which they are known to do, they have no excuse.    9. Women Bear Children  Men and their equipment make an important contribution to the reproductive cycle, but their role is much like that of the center on a football team: He hikes the ball, she carries it for a touchdown. Being pregnant might be more of a burden if it weren't for the fact that men suffer so much more seeing what their seed has done to the women they love. Labor pains are brief compared to the torment you can inflict on a man just by smiling weakly and saying, "That's OK, honey. I'm sure you would have been glad to carry Junior, if only you could."    10. Women Have a Hidden Agenda  You can't play hard to get when your intentions are standing at attention. You know what I'm talking about  the pleading eyes, the heaving chest, the sudden alertness in his nether regions  it's so obvious, for God's sake. For women, it is a blessing to be able to withhold some cards from the sexual table, thus creating a sense of mystery and promise. Think of it as hiding one's light under a bushel.|`|rRO3x9hZaa	Neither...they're equal...|`|ocxRp5Auaa	we are equal with equal rights .|`|aL2LPYfaaa	Better? Better at what? And besides, in certain cultures there are more genders than ours. In some cultures there can be at least 5 different genders (can't remember which ones). Gender is how someone is viewed, and I'm sure in many ways an organizational system.     I really don't think any particular one is best.     Another thing, Gender is different than Sex. If you mean sex, then you may want to change the question to "Which sex is better male or female?"  In which case, I still say neither is better than the other.     Of course, I could be wrong, but this is just what I think.|`|wafsXQSnaa	woman lol. men are fuking lazy....and dumb
P1SdGAj3aa	La novela consta de dos partes: la primera, El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, fue publicada en 1605; la segunda, El ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, en 1615.1  La primera parte se imprimi en Madrid, en casa de Juan de la Cuesta, a fines de 1604. Sali a la venta en enero de 1605 con numerosas erratas, por culpa de la celeridad que impona el contrato de edicin. Esta edicin se reimprimi en el mismo a?o y en el mismo taller, de forma que hay en realidad dos ediciones de 1605 ligeramente distintas. Se sospecha, sin embargo, que existi una novela ms corta, que sera una de sus futuras Novelas ejemplares. Fue divulgada o impresa con el ttulo El ingenioso hidalgo de la Mancha. Esa publicacin se ha perdido, pues autores como Francisco Lpez de beda o Lope de Vega, entre otros testimonios, aluden a la fama de esta pieza. Tal vez circulaba manuscrita e, incluso, podra ser una primera parte de 1604. Tambin el toledano Ibrahim Taybil, de nombre cristiano Juan Prez y el escritor morisco ms conocido entre los establecidos en Tnez tras la expulsin general de 1609-1612, narr una visita en 1604 a una librera en Alcal en donde adquiri las Epstolas familiares y el Relox de Prncipes de Fray Antonio de Guevara y la Historia imperial y cesrea de Pedro Mexa. En ese mismo pasaje se burla de los libros de caballeras de moda y cita como obra conocida el Don Quijote. Eso le permiti a Jaime Oliver Asn a?adir un dato a favor de la posible existencia de una discutida edicin anterior a la de 1605.  La inspiracin de Cervantes para componer esta obra vino, al parecer, del llamado Entrems de los romances, que era de fecha anterior (aunque esto es discutido). Su argumento ridiculiza a un labrador que enloquece creyndose hroe de romances. El labrador abandon a su mujer, y se ech a los caminos, como hizo Don Quijote. Este entrems posee una doble lectura: tambin es una crtica a Lope de Vega; quien, despus de haber compuesto numerosos romances autobiogrficos en los que contaba sus amores, abandon a su mujer y march a la Armada Invencible. Es conocido el inters de Cervantes por el Romancero y su resentimiento por haber sido echado de los teatros por el mayor xito de Lope de Vega, as como su carcter de gran entremesista. Un argumento a favor de esta hiptesis sera el hecho de que, a pesar de que el narrador nos dice que Don Quijote ha enloquecido a causa de la lectura de novelas de caballeras, durante su primera salida recita romances constantemente, sobre todo en los momentos de mayor desvaro. Por todo ello, podra ser una hiptesis verosmil.  La primera parte, en que se alargaba la previa ?novela ejemplar?, se reparti en cuatro volmenes. Conoci un xito formidable y fue traducida a todas las lenguas cultas de Europa. Sin embargo, no supuso un gran beneficio econmico para el autor a causa de las ediciones piratas. Cervantes slo reserv privilegio de impresin para el reino de Castilla, con lo que los reinos aleda?os imprimieron Don Quijotes ms baratos que luego venderan en Castilla. Por otra parte, las crticas de carcter neoaristotlico hacia la nueva frmula teatral ensayada por Lope de Vega y el hecho de inspirarse en un entrems en que se le atacaba, supuso atraer la inquina de los lopistas y del propio Lope; quien, hasta entonces, haba sido amigo de Cervantes. Eso motiv que, en 1614, saliera una segunda parte de la obra bajo el nombre de Alonso Fernndez de Avellaneda. En el prlogo se ofende gravemente a Cervantes tachndole de envidioso, en respuesta al agravio infligido a Lope. No se tienen noticias de quin era este Alonso Fernndez de Avellaneda. Un importante cervantista, Martn de Riquer, sospecha que fue otro personaje real, Jernimo de Pasamonte, un militar compa?ero de Cervantes y autor de un libro autobiogrfico, agraviado por la publicacin de la primera parte, donde aparece como el galeote Gins de Pasamonte. La novela no es mala y es posible, incluso, que se inspirara en la continuacin que estaba elaborando Cervantes. Aun as, no es comparable a la que se imprimi poco despus. Cervantes jugara con el hecho de que el protagonista en su obra se entera de que exista un suplantador.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	....and you an unearned grade.    You have been assigned homework.

For instance, many evengelical groups demand that in order to be a 'true christian' one has to be 'born again'. This is an intsnsely emotional process through which one is saved. Many extreme, or just uneducated, forms of this faith sect believe that once one is saved then one is entitled a place in heaven. So, a hypocrtie christian would be a born again christian who commits murder, but then dosen't ask for forgiveness b/c that person believes that they are saved and therefore sin no longer counts against them.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	some people especially catholics are having a hard time keeping their faith with the trouble the church is going through. the catholic faith was handed down to us from Jesus who bestowed on Peter the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.

They think that "being saved" somehow gives them a leg up on the rest of the people. They parlay that into judgmentalism, legalism, and often downright un-Christian behavior.    The truth is that "being saved" is the ultimate humbling experience. It's admitting that you are a sinner, that you can't make it on your own, that you have no choice but to be lifted out of the mud of your life by Jesus Christ himself. That ought to drive humility into your very soul. Could someone who understands this act as a hypocrite? I think not.    The key for you as a new Christian is to focus on Jesus. Read the Bible to find out what he said, what he did, and what his followers had to say about him. Look at the way people's lives changed. Find a good Bible-believing, Jesus Christ worshiping church. Find a few good Christian friends who can walk this with you.

n6nSjHXBaa	There is a distinction to be make between an absolute monarchy and a constitutional monarchy.    In an absolute monarchy (like Saudi Arabia) the monarch holds supreme executive power.  The monarch directly decides who governs the country without having to consult the people.  In short, an absolute monarch has absolute control over the country.    A constitutional monarchy is, however, much different.  While still retaining the office of monarch as the highest office in the land, the monarch's powers are considerably reduced.  The power of the monarch is limited by parliament (the exact nature of this limitation varies over different constitutional monarchies), and in some cases the monarch is barely anything more than a national figurehead.    Now what is the purpose of having an absolute monarchy?  While it does extremely limit the freedom of the subjects under it, an absolute monarchy can offer increased stability and continuity of governance.  The divisions that are necessarily present in a democracy are absent in an absolute monarchy.  It might be viewed as the best option for government in countries where instability is a big issue (i.e. many Middle East countries - the most stable of these being absolute monarchies or semi-constitutional monarchies).    What is the purpose of having a constitutional monarchy?  While having their power severely limited by parliament, in most cases of constitutional monarchy the monarch still has some residual powers available for use.  These powers (including the right to dissolve/start parliament, the right to refuse to sign legislation into law, the right to choose/dismiss a prime minister, the power to call elections, etc.) are there in order to protect the country from excesses of political power.  If a prime minister started acting like he could do anything he wanted, without listening to parliament, he could be dismissed.  If an unconstitutional law were submitted to the monarch it could be rejected.  If there was no clear majority to form a a working government in parliament a monarch could play a big part in trying to form a coalition (eg. Belgium), or could decide to call elections.  There have been cases in the past where all of these residual powers have been used to protect democracy.  Even the few cases where the monarch has been stripped of all remaining residual powers, he still acts as a focus for national unity (eg. Japan).  An elected head of state, in reality, represents only those people who voted him in, while a constitutional monarch is an apolitical head of state who represents everyone.    What are some of the effect on people that are under this power?  Well, in an absolute monarchy there is reduced freedom, but there can also be more stability.  In a constitutional monarchy democracy can have the extra protection afforded by a constitutional monarch, and these countries also have the luxury of having an apolitical head of state to look up to.    Why don't the people choose a better way of life if they could?  The simple answer for an absolute monarchy is they can't, or at least it is very hard.  The monarch would either have to voluntarily give up power, or else there would have to be a revolution (which has happened many times in the past).  In a constitutional monarchy, however, the people do have a choice.  The powers of the crown are already limited by parliament, and if the monarch abused these powers then he could have his powers reduced, or he could be stripped of the title of monarch by an act of parliament.  But the political will would have to be there in order for the monarchy to be thrown away.  And in most constitutional monarchies the political will is not there because most of the citizens believe that their system is the better system.|`|u6PhC7vhaa	Having a monarchy doesn't mean you're not democratic. Here in Britain we've always been a monarchy - It's a purely ceremonial position they have no real power.|`|RT05lfKqaa	Monarchy:    There is a few purposes:  First - most people do not want to be a leader.  To much responsibility.  (Even today in the USA, if you save someone from a burning car, a co worker, that you think might explode you can get sued.  The court said it is ok. Now who are you going to save?)    2nd- People don't play nice together.    3rd- Most people are not trained, or look good enough .... uhg the pressure of standing for hours.    4th- during war and hard times it is a moral bust to have them working along side you.    5th- and ultimately the common folk, you and me, rule a country.  What country is there is there are no people.  Look at Thailand .... the people are speaking and things are changing.    6th- Monarchy's exist because people don't remove them.    that is all I can think of at this moment|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Monarchists would have you believe the monarchy has popular support. But of course they never offer to put it to the ballot for fear of losing. Even a narrow win would feel like a crushing defeat for them, so the question is never asked.
216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	If you flub someones name a single time, its fine to apologize and make light of the situation. Say something about lack of sleep or that youve had a really crazy day, and move on. Dont bring it up again, even to joke about it  this will just extend the awkwardness,  However if you have been calling your cubicle mate the wrong name since day one, the apology should be in earnest, . Validate her mortification by reacting in a big way, and do it in person: I cant believe Ive been calling you Nancy for three weeks. I am so, so sorry. What can I do to make it up to you?    Tip: If youre introduced to someone you might have met before and forgotten, say Its nice to see you (rather than Nice to meet you), since that works in either case.     nfd?|`|vnYYH4fMaa	Just be honest and apologize. It's not a big deal really in the sense that most people who meet someone the first couple of times would not remember the name clearly, let alone pronouncing or spelling the name either.    Don't worry about it. Just be apologetic sincerely and you're fine.    Also, what I do is generally tell them to spell out their name and even pronounce it at times so I can remember it the next time very clearly.

The period before Christmas - the four weeks before - is called Advent and, in the Christian church, is a time of preparation, not celebration.    The Christmas season then continues through Epiphany (January 6th) celebrating the coming of the Magi (aka three kings) up to Candlemas, 40 days after Christmas - Feb 2nd, commemorating the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (Jewish custom).    Obviously the current focus on presents and buying them has shifted the focus to the time before Christmas so the "commercial" Christmas begins months before and finishes abruptly the day after.

aO4iCwtoaa	hmm... I did a quick search and there are two Chabad congregations in your area, as well as what I'm guessing is a Sefardic shul (which will be closer to Modern O than Chabad is, but it's still a different prayer book and may not be what you're looking for).  In my experience Chabad go out of their way to be welcoming, so I don't think your showing up alone would be an issue.

qEdhPD8Laa	What Raxivar said about trying to psi-feed on someone who's been sick or recovering from surgery is a very BAD idea.

If they aren't feeling drained/headachy, etc, then It's probably not vampirism, you might just have some energy problems, and need to ground often, and get lots of live food and sunlight.

If/ when you feel a bit more 'sated' s/he should feel 'actively healing' again, or a surge of 'healing energy'. If so, you are definintely a Psychic Vampire.

Its OUR OWN lust that tempts us...NOT God .    Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness..but was not tempted WITH the evil......    He by Abraham's OWN was he tempted....He told him to go take his son and sacrifice him there, to see what Abraham would do....he never tempted Abraham WITH evil .(big difference)  And in 2 Samuel 24:1 because Israel was already foretold not to do that , yet they insisted and God was angered and David was angered and yet told the people to go ahead and number Israel and Judah , it again was not GOD who did it , God allowed the People to have what they wanted,,,thus Drawn away by their OWN desires !!    WE are to pray not to be tempted with evil...and in another place it tells us to lay aside EVERY weight and Sin that easily besets us....  GOD never brings us into EVIL nor brings the temptations of OUR own lusts...that is always Ourselves and or the adversary that brings the EVIL or Lust or desire or anything contrary to God.

No. We are praying to God who has power over satan. He can use him for His purpose anytime He wants and He does. If you will read your bible through, you will see this.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Dear One,      I've not gone into the scriptures as I normally do in these cases, as I can see some of your confusion up front.  But I am inclined to believe James 1:13 when it says , "Neither God can be tempted nor does God tempt any man."  The temptation would have to come from satan.    Gen. 22:1  Says " Now it came to pass after these things that God TESTED Abraham, and said to him, Abraham!"  Abraham said, "here I am."  Then God said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah , and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains.)    Dear heart, this is not a temptation, but a test!  The difference is quite the opposite.  A test is what God does with us to see if we love him enough to suffer and toil for him.  A temptation is God using an object or item to see if we will  stray from him or his love or his laws!    I don't see these two as contradicting each other.       Now the "Lord's Prayer" is something I am familiar with , in particular the verse of "And lead us not into temptation."  What we are doing when we make this plea is "asking God to lead us AWAY from any and all temptation or to take away the temptation(s).  This too, does not infer that God is "tempting" us.  Only that we are being tempted, possibly by satan or our own selfish motives and we are asking God's support and grace to lead us away from the temptation. I personally believe that in the Lord's Prayer, we are asking God to lead us away from temptation.         Hopes this makes sense Dear.  It makes perfect sense to me.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	From www.BlueletterBible.org  Genesis 22:1  tempt  from the Hebrew "nacah"    1) to test, try, prove, tempt, assay, put to the proof or test    a) (Piel)    1) to test, try    2) to attempt, assay, try    3) to test, try, prove, tempt|`|Qn9V5rajaa	They're wacky!

And most of them... cannot be resolved.|`|DBg0yFSYaa	Here's the part you quoted (NIV), plus the next verse which puts it into context (yes, this does need to be done!):    1 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!"         "Here I am," he replied.    2 Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."     Here are the same verses from the KJV:    1And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.      2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.     You can see that tempt and test are interchangeable but obviously don't always mean the same thing, depending on how they are used. It's useless to cherry pick, for people who believe in the bible and people who don't. You can see how grabbing part of a verse and comparing it to part of another really doesn't hold up for either side of the argument.|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	Actually, the original text in Genesis 22:1 says test and not tempt.

Matthew 4:1 "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."    OK. So Christ was led into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted. But God did not tempt Him; Satan tempted Him. I guess it is OK to ask God not to lead us into temptation.

Anything else?    agapefromnc|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	God put Abraham to the test by commanding him to sacrifice his son Isaac as a burnt offering. It wasn't a temptation. James 2:21-23 says.   "Nevertheless, a certain one will say: You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith apart from the works, and I shall show you my faith by my works. 19?You believe there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder. 20?But do you care to know, O empty man, that faith apart from works is inactive? 21?Was not Abraham our father declared righteous by works after he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? 22?You behold that [his] faith worked along with his works and by [his] works [his] faith was perfected, 23?and the scripture was fulfilled which says: Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness, and he came to be called Jehovahs friend. It was just as he did Adam and Eve. Satan turned the test into a temptation.    2?Samuel 24:1 reads: And again the anger of Jehovah came to be hot against Israel, when one incited David against them, saying: Go, take a count of Israel and Judah.   The one who did the inciting is not there identified.  First Chronicles 21:1 helps to answer the question, saying  Satan proceeded to stand up against Israel and to incite David to number Israel. Try a different translation.  .

I actually didn't know you were a boy until I reached the part that involved flirting with girls due to the amount of complaining you've done over such a little issue.

gxl6oBpJaa	I think she obviously loves children for one thing, and I believe she's probably a very good mother or else she wouldn't have wanted any more kids. I don't think she was trying to have 8 more kids. The drs. didn't even know there were 8, so she certainly didn't know there were 8 either. Speaking of Angelina Jolie, I think she even kind of resembles her. So, to answer your question I agree that she just wanted a big family. I have 5. It's stressful at times, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I would never suggest that this woman put her children up for adoption. It's a miracle that they were born all at once. I don't think they should be seperated. I wish her all the luck in the world. As for tax dollars, there are plenty of people who are living of off tax dollars who shouldn't be. Life's too short to worry about this one mom and her kids. There are thousands of homeless kids and moms. Worry about them.|`|a0c95fc1a67ea521b01c5ac057a51aa2aa	Yeah, but did she think about her own parents when she took those fertility drugs? I doubt she thought she would have 8 kids, she was probably hoping for 2 or 3...I am not sure if she is sad or happy with so many kids but either way its a burden on her own parents, they are the ones who have to deal with the kids, while she gets the sweet book and movie deals...|`|ftvPJfEXaa	Lets go egg her house!!!!!|`|onkUcy19aa	I agree with you God bless you.|`|xb7ey8c0aa	She has no husband, she lives with her parents and she has 14 children under the age of 7.

Maybe she wasn't aware of the Dionne quintuplets from the last century, or didn't watch "Eight Is Enough" from the 80's ( now there's "Jon & Kate Plus Eight"). Our tax dollars are subsidizing this frivolous campaign for a posting in the Guinness Book of World Records.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are not living with Angelina's parents and relying on them to support them and their children.      If you have 14 kids, you DO need plenty of money and a big house.  For the life of me, I can't figure out what this woman was thinking, or why her parents would go along with it and continue to support her.      I know people who have been trying to adopt for years, only to be turned down over and over.  It seems that adoptive couples need to prove they are worthy and capable of raising a child, so why aren't similar measures enforced when someone seeks fertility treatment, knowing the risk of multiples?      I hope for the sake of the children that CPS keeps a close watch on that family and ensures that the children are all being taken care of.    PS... Remember what Andrea Yates did to her five children when things got too stressful for her??    PPS... I agree that she didn't plan on having octuplets.  BUT... she chose to have fertility treatment when she already had SIX young children.  She did this while living with her parents, already relying on them to support her large family.  I truly wonder what her parents' feelings are about that decision.  She has said that she wanted a large family...that's great, but planning to bring a bunch of children into the world when you don't have the means to care for them is just plain irresponsible.  Why should everyone else bear the financial burden for her self-centered choice?      You know, I wonder if she saw a few too many tv specials about the Duggar family and decided to see if she could give them some competition...|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	She shows extreme... EXTREME... immaturity and lack of judgment, to say the very LEAST.    What all I've learned of this situation, I am astounded that the fertility clinic even allowed her to do what she wanted.  They also have exhibited a lack of judgment in this.    The true innocents here are the children, ALL of her children.  Frankly, I think ALL of her children should be REMOVED from her custody and placed for adoption and she should be forced to be sterilized.  But that's my "heart" talking.    I DO think that Child Protective Services should be involved... they have every RIGHT to since this woman is taking government money to pay for this.  Children should be removed from her custody, as many as CPS deems necessary.  (CPS is really working for us, the taxpayer who's paying for her lack of responsibility.)    She should also be REQUIRED to pay for ALL of her hospital bills, ALL of her other related bills, etc etc. etc.  Regardless of how she will obtain her income, it should also be "monitored" by CPS to see that ALL the appropriate bills will be paid... by HER income.    Personally, I don't think she will get a lucrative book/movie/tv show deal.  She has not made many friends who would be interested in seeing her "story" or situation.      Who says you have to have lots of money to raise a big family?  No one SAYS it, it is an economic FACT.  Look at the Duggar family on the tv show... they have worked hard, they volunteer time, they have rental properties for income, they built much their OWN home, they DO accept CHARITY, they are WISE and prudent with their money and resources.... just about EVERYTHING that this woman is NOT ... including MARRIED!!!!!!!!!    Sorry, but this woman does NOT get MY vote for "Mother of the Year!"  I have NO sympathy for her whatsoever.  It's the children I care and worry about most.  These children are innocent, they did not ask to be born to an irresponsible, daft person.  THEY NEED to be cared for.  SHE needs to be institutionalized.      Have a polite day.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	She didn't plan the babies the natural way. She knew all along how many it's gonna be, and she was expecting the government to supply her.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand.   1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible.     2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a bolus called chyme. It then passes into the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.    3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.    4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo.     5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.    6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than ten years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.    7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.    8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive|`|anfhcnWeaa	sorry kid Vampires are born not made you are either born like us or your not there is nothing that any of us vampire can do to help you.|`|hceSZoAkaa	u do need help lol  tons of it|`|znaCeJhtaa	lol are you a little bit twilight obsessed?|`|djVmUu5caa	wow?

I think people are just disagreeing on why exactly it's happening and how to solve the problem.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well it is a problem when my mom took me to the doctor she said my sugar was too high,cholesterol was too high and I was on my way to developing diabetes and now she says my sugar is fine and I am fine and I have lost weight.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Anyone can be in denial about what or what isn't good for them to be  healthy. But statistics are out there for anyone to read, that being  over weight is an important thing these days. We now know more about proper nutrition, and how we are supposed to eat to not get  sick, and live long and productive lives. Obesity is a killer in the long  run. For it can cause anyone to have high blood pressure. It can bring  on Diabetes, especially if it has run in the family. And because of  extra weight putting more pressure on your heart, you can also die  young of a heart attack. We've all heard of teenaged sports players  who have dropped dead on the court from an aneurism or a heart  attack. So these things can happen at any age, if you don't eat the  things right for you and minimize or ignore what isn't. It helps if you  are a lover of fresh and frozen vegitables, and fruits as these do   benefit our bodies. Eating small amounts of meat and milk and  dairy products aae also a key. Avoid fried foods that can clog your  arteries and bake and broil instead. And avoid salt as much as you  can, because it thins our blood and aids to obesity. Salt causes  water to build up in our bodies, which can lead to health problems.  When your body starts to break down and organs become affected  it's too late to stop eating and living life the way we have. That's why  it's important to start young and get into the healthy habits that you  can maintain the rest of your life. So that you will live long and stay  healthy.|`|MkYQNkgHaa	i think fat people are an eyesore|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	yea, that's gross...

Though I *did* have a problem that they didn't seem to understand that having kids was bad after that. (The court system was like "Okay, it's fine, just don't have anymore." and the two of them took an "lol no" approach to the court order.)|`|DKHmJuxiaa	Why do i care|`|oVeGMNsLaa	It's rather funny . . . I'm watching "Brothers and Sisters In Love" on BBC America right now, and it is literally breaking my heart to hear about these couples harangued, hassled, jailed, having their children taken away and put in foster care.  All for love.    I cannot for the life of me understand the hatred that pours out at the mention of incest between consenting adult individuals.  People use all sorts of arguments, all of which are bunk:    * "It creates deformed/mentally retarded children."- First off, let's remember that not all incestuous couples have or want children.  Most know the risk involved and don't want children.  Secondly, people have a big misunderstanding about incest and genetics.  Is there a higher risk for deformities and recessive diseases when the parents are related?  Yes, most certainly.  However, the concept of "The Hills Have Eyes"-style offspring is largely modeled off of small, closed communities that have PERSISTENT generational incest- many nations' royalty, for example, or isolated "redneck" communities where it is viewed as appropriate.  All the incestuous offspring concentrates the genetic deficiencies.  In modern society, however, the children of incestuous relations usually go on to be with non-relations, and there isn't a problem.  And, I hope it goes without saying, we do not take legal action against non-related people who are nearly guaranteed to have children with genetic deformities and disease.  So why do we against incestuous couples?    * "It's disgusting!"- How long ago was the same said of homosexuality? Or, for that matter, interracial relations?  What turns your stomach is not a justification for hate.    * "It's abuse."- We're not talking about children here- that's child abuse.  We're talking about consenting adults.    I find it utterly appalling how the LGBT community reacts to incest.  I suppose everybody needs something to put down.|`|AA10057011	I think it's disgusting.

Creationist ignore this, as they do with any evidence that they don't agree with.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	Every thing that exist, exist because of what came before it.

So that brings us back to the Bible again which clearly states that God did not do it that way.|`|XN0cYCATaa	That depends on how "macroevolution" is defined. Scientists have seen bacteria exchange genetic material. They have seen bacteria become antibiotic resistant. They have seen bacteria become bigger from mutations. But have they ever seen bacteria become anything other than bacteria? No. Have they ever seen one type of bacteria, such as E.coli, become some other type of bacteria that is not (in this case) E.coli? No, they haven't. In fact, with over a hundred years of work with E.coli behind us, (at 20 minutes per generation time, that's over 2 1/5 MILLION generations of E.coli minimum that have been witnessed), and despite forcing or encouraging mutations, they still cannot get anything but E.coli. So it's your call. Is that macroevolution? By some evolutionists' standards it qualifies.|`|yYYXVCGZaa	actually kevin, speciation HAS been observed in nature by science.  and there are many examples being compiled as we speak.  from ring species to those cut off from each other in lakes or rivers and other environmental pressure situations.  these things are recorded...and they're easy to find if you want to.|`|3EudCWEuaa	Good Question!     First of all, some creationists adhere to an "old" earth model, and may accept some forms of evolution. So not all creationists reject the idea of macroevolution.    What most assert is simply God created everything. If he used evolution, it was engineered evolution from the beginning.    Let me stop right there and ask you a question concerning Intelligent Design:    Is it possible for a new species to be created without evolving?    I suppose your answer would probably be, no, everything must have evolved due to natural selection and other processes.    But is that really true? Can a scientist (Intelligent Designer) not manipulate genetics today, and create complete species by alter codes without evolution?    The answer to that question, is YES. They are beginning to do this more and more.    So if an intelligent designer (scientist) can create life using genetics, and species in a particular form with the ability to adapt with their environment... Without Evolving from a lower life form...    Is it not also logical to assume an intelligent designer could have created the genetics for each species, in its final form, without having them evolve, and also writing into the completed "code" the ability to adapt to their environment with subtle changes (micro)??|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	You won't get a decent answer to this Q. from a creationist.  Speciation does happen.  If you do it with organisms small enough to have very rapid reproduction rates then you can create entirely new species in the lab. However the people you are asking cannot or will not understand that this applies all the way up the spectrum of biological creatures. You could do the experiment with dogs or humans but to do it with humans at 5 generations a century, the experiment would take something like 2000 centuries or 2,000,000 years.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	There would be fossil evidence (if it was true)  There is none    There's a great deal of evidence that dinosaurs were here all over the earth... but none to prove one thing evolved into another... not one    Adaptation is not evolution|`|eUEgi111aa	If they don't get it by now - now that we have seen this 'macro-evolution' happen in the wild AND in the lab, observed it fully - they never will.

Many of us believe G-d instilled the creatures of this world with many defenses and ways to adapt to changing climate conditions.  I don't believe G-d created this world as a static environment.  I draw the line at the Darwinist claim that all this was set in motion by chemicals or some other scientific gewgaw, period.  Whether our story of Creation or Native American's tale of the Raven is "true" is immaterial.  Our understanding of the world is advanced by certain science; our understanding of our place in the world is enhanced by Faith.|`|UkKEvilYaa	There is no absolute evidence that macro-evoltution happens. A good example is the Precambrian explosion. There in the fossil record was millions of primitive life forms then suddenly with no explanation millions of complex forms. In between there should be millions of transitional forms, there is none.   Second that is a big if, How do those who believe in evolution know it takes millions of years? There was know one there to observe that change. It is all assumptions based on what we see today to prove the past.    Third, the main argument we have is that we all look at the same evidence. We all just look at it coming from a different bias. I was an atheist for 47 years and then was asked to think about it. Take a good honest hard look at what I was believing. I realized i was wrong. There is no such thing as a non-bias person we all have them and that is what controls what we think.     Lastly my God can do all things. That is what he can create a world in 6 days. That is why He can create man in His image. That is why he came to earth an humbled Himself as a mere man to die for all of our sins. With a love greater that any could imagine.

When I was a child, I was beginning my own form of evolution, but God had already begun creating the person  he wanted me to be.  I believe each of us have the capability and ingredients to be Christians or to "believe" in God but many "choose" not to.  Simply because if I have the one ability, I have to have the other option....it's called choice.  So I begin my trek or path in life and I immediately begin to hit stumbling blocks.  By the time I'm 16 years of age, I was "evolving" into something that the average man would not appreciate.  I began spending most of my time in the streets of New Orleans, and soon enough would find myself as most of the street people did there.  I knew if I stayed there very long I simply would not survive, as it can be devastating.  After a few long years of scoping the gutters, I came to know an elderly couple who were Christians and they took me into their confidence and taught me about the God of the Bible.  I began to evolve and change my thought process and suddenly I demanded more education about life, man and God....As the years progressed, I came to acquire degrees in two fields and by the time I was 20 I acquired my own business and became very successful.  I can only attribute God and those two fine people to much of my success and peace in life, because each time I left God's side for a time my life began failing and I only saw those gutters in New Orleans as a place of refuge.   Had I not heeded to God's evolution in me, I'm sure I wouldn't be here to talk about his NEW Creation....         Kevin, this may not satisfy your determination to dispel the God of the Bible and dismiss him, but it satisfied my successful life and the lives of the hundreds of Christians whom I'm responsible for leading to God..and that's all that's important to me right now.          The thing you have to keep reminding yourself Kevin is "What if you're wrong?"  What if all you are doing here only takes you to a lowly grave of death and dust ?  What if there is a life after death and you have done all you could to avoid it?           Right now Kevin, you hold the life of many people in your hands, and you may be taking them down with you in your efforts to convince someone that you are simply .....right!   That's not the same as what I'm trying to do here.....It does not affect me if you or others decide to continue your path....it only affects you all.

Anyway ... I will attempt to answer your question.  Just know that it comes from that point of view.    I mock "the science" of carbon dating.  You may be aghast by this, but I do.  I tell people all the time, look at that rock over there.  It may be a billion years old, or 10 million years old, or maybe only 10,000 years old.  How do we know?  NO ONE KNOWS!  Then along comes some brainiac who explains how he "knows."  He gives us a bit of scientific mumbo jumbo about carbon half life, etc. and voila!  We believe him.  But ... if no one was there before that rock came to be, if no one knows how, let alone when, that rock came to be, then how do we know Mr. Carbon Dating is right?  You already know that we don't know!      I'll go further ... the "science" of carbon dating is what ... 50 years old?  They are basically taking things that they KNOW the age of and measuring the carbon in them.  Okay....  I ask a simple question: What if carbon does not break down at a consistent rate over time?  What if it doesn't breakdown at a consistent rate at varying temperature, altitudes, climates, etc.?  You want scientific FACT?  I'll give you logical facts:    No one knows the age of the earth.  Christians and Jews have their opinions, based on God's word.  Scientiists have their OPINIONS based on their best scientific GUESSES, using the best scientific methods of the day.  But carbon dating is not factual.  Wait!  It MAY BE factual, but it cannot be proved to be!  And it's folly to say that we KNOW that this bolder or this fossil or this plant is such and such an age.  Pure folly!  The science rests as much on knowing that NO ONE knows the right answer as it does on calculating the answers.    So, given what I just said about carbon dating, we can apply such shadows of doubt to almost all of life.  How do you know that your parents are indeed your parents?  How do you know that you are who you say you are?  WHAT IF you were born in Berlin 1 year before you were told that you were to two people who gave you away to "those people" who raised you as their own?   What if, indeed!  How can you PROVE that you were born to these parents?!    You said, ASSUMING that macro-evolution is true, etc.  The fact is that there are MANY things thought to be false that are in fact true.  I suspect that you don't believe in God.  Does that make Him a lie?  Of course not!  Whatever percentage of non-believers doesn't change the facts.  Either God is real or He is not.  It has nothing to do with how many people believe.  Yet, evolution has this "following" that slams this theory down our throats.  You can't prove it any more than I can prove God is real.  I'm good with that!  If God Almighty wants me to believe in macro-evolution then He'll reveal it to me.  Otherwise, I believe what I believe by some combination of faith, reason, logic, and empirical evidence.  That does NOT make the things I believe in factual, at least not always.  But trust me, my friend, when I say, lots of "science" isn't factual either.  At least, they can't prove that it is.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	All things are possible with God.

Darwins use of the word species, however, is contradictory. To say that species are fixed, Gilson writes, is tautology; to say that they change is to say that they do not exist, Why does Darwin obstinately say that they transform themselves, rather than saying simply that they do not exist?

My apology for assuming it was being used once again for the same purpose.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	The procedure has been cynically misrepresented as common to manipulate public opinion and has become a political football because of its shock value. It is very rare and is performed only when there is no alternative, typically on women who, although they wanted to carry their pregnancies to term, were unable to do so because of dangerous complications.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Barbaric.|`|h3gMzNS3aa	Spiritually-speaking, they go to heaven automatically.

That's a denial of the fundamental rights of the baby's soul, which outweighs human rights.|`|mSFjbetxaa	They are EXTREMELY rare.  Late term abortions are only done if the fetus is malformed, already dead, or to save the life of the mother.      I am pro-choice and I believe that abortions should only be performed in the first trimester.  Just my opinion, however, and I have no right to force anyone else to abide by my beliefs.            I disagree. 0.17% is way too high a precentage.        Interesting fact:    "partial-birth" abortion is a nonmedical term coined by opponents of reproductive rights"        It is lies and propaganda that has kept the pro-life nonsense going, littleladymoo is proof of that.

I can understand how a person might be mistaken about human life at the point of conception.  Human life begins at conception,  but it does require some reflection and careful thought to understand that.    The procedure realistically referred to as "partial birth abortion" is a profoundly barbaric act.  I can not see how any sane and civilized human being could approve of abortion when the evidence of the victim's humanity is so obvious.|`|AA11824333	It is a horror.

All I can say is after seeing  these girls having them -They don't deserve to be mothers. Sadly some use this service as a contrecptive.   Yes I know the babies are living and the mother is injected in the abnoman to kill the baby before it is removed.  But those poor little souls are better off without those girls as mothers.  Hopefully they go back to heaven & get a better chance next time.  PS contrary to   popular beleif, Terminations after 16 weeks are very common & done twice weekly up to 6 a day.  They are call "Lamimaria"    Miss Im so righteous - are you going to be their when they get neglect, abused & used ???!!!    Boy are some people living under mushrooms.

If a pregnant woman is abused or assaulted resulting in the loss of her unborn child, the abuser is charged with murder.      Why is it any different with abortion simply because the mother decided she didn't want the baby?    another prime example of why life sucks!|`|dirIBdToaa	utterly disgusting and I can't believe people can actually do that    there is judgment for that|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Barbaric.|`|AA10307806	Abortion is murder.|`|vQ6AfJxlaa	I have met many people who should have been "full-birth aborted" like even in the 81st trimester.|`|C7o9XMaZaa	Let me tell you--- that at 16 years old, for reasons beyond my control, I allowed my child to be murdered in this way. This happened when I was a minor, 24 years ago. I can honestly say that I will never get over it, it has affected my entire life, and I would not wish that kind of soul-killing pain on my worst enemy. Murder is murder. It doesn't matter if it's partial, 2 weeks old, or three months. I hope that everyone will try to respect my honesty and please learn from my mistakes. (smile)|`|2RygPGRaaa	Thank God it's outlawed...at the moment. Obama wants to re-institute it though. It's murder, no way around it. Because a baby is too large to be cut up in uterus, it has to be born, stabbed in the neck and have it's brain sucked out? Who could think that is acceptable, malformation, disfigurement, disease or whatever other reason!!! How do these abortion "doctors" go home with a clear conscience at the end of the day? Sick and it makes me down right angry!!!! Spiritually I don't know what happens to these babies souls. I believe that all people are inflicted with the original sin of Adam and need baptism to receive salvation if they are at an age where they can't confess their faith. But since we have a loving and forgiving and fair Lord, I think he'd take these precious little ones into heaven, since they never got a fighting chance.|`|LA5VwAvIaa	I am pro-choice    late term abortions are abhorrent.  they literally kill the living child within the womb or partially out of it.  If you are going to get an abotion -- be an adult about it and make the decision in a proper time frame or get ready for the adoption process.
46fouwFfaa	Yes. My parents aren't strict but they are moderate Muslims. They disapprove of dating (for religious and cultural reasons) but are fine with good old-fashioned courtship. Muslim parents often want their children to marry someone educated, kind, family-oriented, and who will treat them well and is Muslim.     But many young Muslims date freely which their parents don't know about yet they usually end up marrying Muslims.|`|iJiDFZUxaa	hello,  if i were you i would contact scholar people who can correctly  answer  your question .there are many islamic sites you can visit to know more about islam.  regards|`|jTkX9HJyaa	Well, what parents wouldn't want their children to only date nice people?|`|fia9gMHpaa	Yes, they are looking for virgins.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	I think every parent wants their child to marry nice people lol. Most importantly though, we Muslims are not allowed to date. It is disrespectful for a lady to be alone with a non-related male in Islam. Only marriage is accepted. In saying this though, it is not like we just marry any one without first getting to know them. During the engagement period, we are allowed time to spend together in order to get to know each other first|`|3566188061f294a16807056333d8ef6caa	I would assume that muslim parents would encourage their children to date other muslims.  That's expected.  Then, there are muslims that are more liberal with whom their kids date.  You should ask the guys that are flirting with you|`|wTqid2ONaa	I wasn't allowed to date at all.    I don't live with my parents anymore, date who i want now lol.  I think everybody would rather be with a nice person :P|`|bltgAc9Maa	Well, strict Muslim parents usually only allow their children to date/marry fellow Muslims too because they tend to view non-Muslims as infidels.    Again, we are talking about the STRICT or RADICAL ones here.
g4nlUfmeaa	Legends, myths and religious stories sometimes have some basis in fact, but even where that is the case, you can be sure that they've been exaggerated and embellished quite a bit.

There may be some historical basis to some of the stories (such as the tales of Troy and the wanderings of Odysseus).

I dont know if they predicted future stuff though.|`|AA11717874	first, lets get the definition of what a myth is so you understand what they are:  myth? ?  noun 1. a traditional or legendary story, usually concerning some being or hero or event, with or without a determinable basis of fact or a natural explanation, esp. one that is concerned with deities or demigods and explains some practice, rite, or phenomenon of nature.   2. stories or matter of this kind: realm of myth.    3. any invented story, idea, or concept: His account of the event is pure myth.    4. an imaginary or fictitious thing or person.   5. an unproved or false collective belief that is used to justify a social institution.   Now with that in mind,you have to realize that myths were the only way the ancients had to explain the world around them. Myths to the ancients is like science to us today. You also need to understand that  the ancients believed their myths to be fact and true as much as people believe that science is fact and true today. Historian Bettney Hughes said that these stories, myths, don't spring out of nothing. Somewhere in the dim past there are actual things that did exist and did happen that were the seeds for these stories, we just need to dig them up.|`|T2ztOxa9aa	weel its is MYTHOLOGY so it means its not true!!  im greek!|`|LdFgAPFxaa	OMG thr not real u mentard =] ?

Quotations:   "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural & spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity" A widely cited, but apparently spurious quotation attributed to Albert Einstein 1    "The greatest achievement is selflessness.   The greatest worth is self-mastery.   The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.   The greatest precept is continual awareness.   The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.   The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways.   The greatest magic is transmuting the passions.   The greatest generosity is non-attachment.   The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.   The greatest patience is humility.   The greatest effort is not concerned with results.   The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.   The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances." Atisha.    "If you live the sacred and despise the ordinary, you are still bobbing in the ocean of delusion." Lin-Chi.    "Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I vow to cultivate compassion and learn ways to protect lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life. Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh.    "When the mind begins to become still, we then begin to truly see it. When you first try to stabilize and pacify the mind, initially it will become very busy because its not accustomed to being still. In fact, it doesnt even necessarily want to become still, but it is essential to get a hold of the mind to recognize its nature. This practice is extremely important. ... Eventually you will find yourself in a state where your mind is clear and open all the time. It is just like when the clouds are removed from the sky and the sun can clearly be seen, shining all the time. This is coming close to the state of liberation, liberation from all traces of suffering. ... The truth of this practice is universal. It isnt necessary to call it a religion to practice it. Whether one is a Hindu or a Moslem or a Christian or a Buddhist simply doesnt matter. Anyone can practice this because this is the nature of the mind, the nature of everyones mind. If you can get a handle on your mind, and pacify it in this way, you will definitely experience these results, and you will see them in your daily life situation. There is no need to put this into any kind of category, any kind of "ism." Venerable Gyatrul Rinpoche|`|ifnyElN9aa	lol, don't worry. For Buddhists, different level of commitment have different rules. For casual visit, get joss sticks, three is enough, some temple has them for free (sometime you need to buy those) you can just grab them and lid them on one end and hold the other, hold them in front of you and bow, then there normally will be place where you can place the joss sticks once you are done bowing, if you are not sure, just ask. That's the basics.|`|Z9hcP2b5aa	Buddhism is meant for both two kinds of people :  One who are casual , who enjoy life & live normally   and  other who take it seriously , try to control their behavior , follow celibacy & meditate.    For casual people there are casual practices such as chanting , praying & putting incense sticks, donating money or gold leaf etc.    But for serious people , they are required to be celibate & are required to control their minds in long mediation by first watching the mind, thoughts, emotions & breathing and then their control by stopping the mind to function , not allowing any thoughts & emotions and non-reacting if they arise.     By stopping their function it is believed that mind transcends the material world and gains super natural abilities which may appear as hallucinations first but later they are controlled. The further processes are to learnt from monks. Celibacy is important for making the mind transcend because sex is the most violent emotion which shakes up & quakes up entire nervous system hence avoided altogether.    The practice of Buddhists monks & nuns is very similar to Christian monks & nuns except that Christians dont know how to meditate.    (I believe that Buddhism is father of Christianity, see my profile)    If you want to learn meditation (free) here is a good one :    http://www.dhamma.org

While I have no doubt Jesus did do those things, I also know that the long life expectancy we have today is because of exactly what your question is about: modern health standards and modern medicines.   One interesting point is that many of our modern health standards aren't that difficult to implement. Is it hard to wash your hands before eating? Is it hard to have proper sanitation? Is it hard to expect people to dispose of sewage so it doesn't contaminate drinking water? Much of the disease (or lack of) is caused by the way we manage these things. Pride is an abomination to God, and it is also the reason people won't humble themselves and wash their hands or do other simple things that will prevent disease.

If you love someone, you should tell them that EVERYDAY.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, not all men.  Some do.|`|fFe75M3Baa	not all of them.|`|iDTrTvg4aa	no i dont think any one will not like that good & nice day|`|RicENLBsaa	not all men do but the one who don't have a harder way of showing there love for the female.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	Yes, we do.  Any man who says different is a liar or gay.|`|OYwZNRaeaa	I love valentine's day.  My wife gives me special treatment (stuff I usually don't get)  With a few flowers and a box of candy, she is a very happy woman.    Thanks.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	My ex boyfriend sure did.  He acted like I was the most needy woman on earth for wanting a single rose on Valentines Day.  He was pretty cheap though..|`|IlndnVyBaa	I do!!!! I'm a proud valentines day hater. I'm not a man yet but in a few years I will be|`|kkxn0Q4Aaa	my friend did say he thinks its stupid   but another one of my mate says he likes it|`|cjMMciVvaa	I think it really depends on the guy. If he's romantic or not!|`|B7YaCM2zaa	Depends on the guy, and usually depends on if he has someone to spend it with. But some guys just hate it.

It's another day when you get to screw up by forgetting to get her a card and a present.  I hate it with a passion.|`|cLdGiQFXaa	If he does, something went wrong in his past.  It should be just another day for a single guy,  but if he has a girl then No. I mean if something  didnt go wrong in his past.|`|FEYDoBhqaa	no we do not actually we find it very exciting and hormonally riveting  but what we dont like is having to remember to buy our partners presents but the best usally take you out to eat and then end the day with a present|`|A93KIkWTaa	depends if the have a girl or not. And also the type of girl|`|AA10552262	It is not that we hate that day, but it is just that it requires us guys to second guess you gals again. It seems that our team is supposed to know what your team is thinking and what it wants from us at all times. In all honesty, we haven't a clue. So Valentine's Day gives us another opportunity to prove we are knitwits. It's not that we don't want to do the right thing. It's just that we don't even know what we don't even know about you (collectively, of course).    And of course the worse part for our team is MOTIVE. When we do something for you, we don't necessarily have an ulterior motive. And your squad seems to want to know WHY we did one thing over another.     All the guys seem to get so frustrated with the rules, that many drop out of the game after a few innings. Hence the tried and true purchase of flowers every year.|`|qaD1jAQYaa	My boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do on Valentine's Day before I even thought about asking him what to do. So no, not all men hate it.
dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	The state of the church is disgusting. They're even more bound than those that dont even know God at all.    I have friends that dont believe. We have little in common except for our determination to care for eachother. Some times they go into things that I cant follow them into because I cant deal with it, but they know that, and it doesnt bother us.    Its not my job to judge someone else for believing or not. Its between them and God. Considering the examples they have to follow in the christian world today, i cant say that I blame them for turning away.     I think its unfair to God more than anything, but certainly unfair for those that are soured by all these liars that pretend to know God.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	Religion does not make or break a friendship!  the person does!   i could care less what faith anyone has if your a good friend you'll stay in my life!   however your last lines complain and negative that would make me not want to be friends with you!  not if your atheism or christian or whatever!       tho i don't go around announcing my faith!   maybe you shouldn't either!   and see what happends!|`|AA11521494	Sounds like they weren't that Christian.

I'd be friends with Christians too, though. And believers of other religions.

I avoid negative Christians also.  My son is a former Christian that is now an atheist and I still love to be around him. He is smart, funny and an all around great guy who does the next right thing because it's the right thing, not out of fear of being sentenced to 'hell'. Try not to complain so much and be the guy everyone wants to hang with!  Good Luck!  ~Peace~  Update: Your mother can't 'give you' schizophrenia...it is a mental disorder that develops in the brain. It CAN run in families, though.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Sure I would.    But,then, I am an atheist who once was a Christian.

Give us a try again sometime, we are all not like that  Being friends with an Atheist to me is no  different than my friends from any other faith. We are friends, we have the same interest, goals, and church is not usually brought up. I don't have friends just to spend my time aruging with them.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Maybe your lack of belief had nothing to do with it, but those chose not to be around someone who was negative and did nothing but complain.

I won't be there. :)      But seriously.  Contrary to popular stupidity, the world does not end in 2012, nor anywhere near it.    What does, however happen at the end of 2012, is a change in the age.  We are currently in the age of Pisces and when Dec 31, 2012 comes around it will begin the age of Aquarius.  The world, as we know it, will be changed dramatically.    Not with fire and destruction of the Earth, but a social change that will bring about things that will begin a cycle of healing of the planet and maybe even the people will learn to grow on a more spiritual level that has not been seen in an age.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Absolutely nothing. :)    The date is actually the winter Solstice on the 21st, though I guess 12/12/12 might seem a bit cooler to some. LOL The world is not ending, the Mayans just saw it as the end of one cycle and the beginning of another; Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce and the bible don't say one word about it, and the Age of Aquarius most emphatically does not start at New Years like clockwork!    One thing, no one can agree on when exactly the Age of Aquarius does start and how it's determined. Some say it started hundreds of years ago, some say it won't be for hundreds of years to come. But at any rate, it won't be based on our current calendar: whichever yardstick you want to measure it by, it's an astronomical event, which hardly ever coincides neatly with our modern calendars.    It's hard to explain in detail to those unfamiliar with the subject, but it's more than something transiting into Aquarius; that happens pretty regularly. It has to do with the Precession of the Equinoxes and whether or not the Spring Equinox occurs either in the constellation of Aquarius or the zodiac sign of Aquarius, by the starting point of the sidereal zodiac. The issue is that the zodiac signs are *not* the same thing as the constellations they share a name with, they are 12 equal zones of space, 30 degrees in length, in *both* sidereal and tropical astrology. But the actual constellations are unequal in length. So in the end you come up with the 2 most sensible times for the changeover: either when the Equinox occurs in Sidereal Aquarius, or when it's in the stars of the constellation of Aquarius. All other dates are wildly speculative based on "really cool" alignments featuring a lot of planets in Aquarius or featuring aspect patterns heavily weighted in Aquarius. LOL|`|lTx8Hoheaa	If Sarah palin got elected President, the world would be ending shortly...|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Nothing but the usual.|`|W0qNkROpaa	9 days til the end of the world.|`|A01w1dHqaa	I've enough to concern me now.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	Is that a saturday?

This doesn't mean that suddenly everyone is going to start believing in the same things, just that more people will start seeing the big picture, in a more whole way. Seeing how their individual piece fits but that there are many other pieces to the puzzle too.    The Aquarian Age also talks a lot about this too.     In my opinion, the transition has already started and it might take quite a while before the actual change is fully in place. I believe that 2012 is just the marker for when the transition is at it's peak.    The Mayans believed that this will mark a great cosmic event. Coincidentally (?) the date they gave is the Winter Solstice. There are also galactic alignments that are going to take place at the same time, for the first time in the history of our civilization.    From what I have read, it seems that maybe something is going to happen but we can survive it if we are all at a certain energetic level. That is the message I get from a lot of this but I don't know if I fully agree with it or not. I don't think the world is going to end though.     *2012 in brief    The Mayan civilization of Central America was and is the most advanced in relation to time-science knowledge. Their main calendar is the most accurate on the planet. It has never erred. The Mayan fifth world finished in 1987. The sixth world starts in 2012. So we are currently "between worlds"    1. Humanity and Planet Earth are currently going through a huge change or shift in consciousness and reality perception.    2. The Mayan civilization of Central America was and is the most advanced in relation to time-science knowledge. Their main calendar is the most accurate on the planet. It has never erred. They actually have 22 calendars in total, covering the many timing cycles in the Universe and Solar System. Some of these calendars are yet to be revealed.    3. The Mayan fifth world finished in 1987. The sixth world starts in 2012. So we are currently "between worlds". This time is called the "Apocalypse" or revealing. This means the real truth will be revealed. It is also the time for us to work through "our stuff" individually and collectively.    4. The Mayan sixth world is actually blank. This means it is up to us, as co-creators, to start creating the new world and civilization we want now.    5. The Mayans also say that by 2012    we will have gone beyond technology as we know it.  we will have gone beyond time and money.  we will have entered the fifth dimension after passing through the fourth dimension  Planet Earth and the Solar System will come into galactic synchronization with the rest of the Universe.  Our DNA will be "upgraded" (or reprogrammed) from the centre of our galaxy. (Hunab Ku)  Everybody on this planet is mutating. Some are more conscious of it than others. But everyone is doing it.    6. In 2012 the plane of our Solar System will line up exactly with the plane of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. This cycle has taken 26,000 years to complete. Virgil Armstrong also says that two other galaxies will line up with ours at the same time. A cosmic event!    7. Time is speeding up (or collapsing). For thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second, The military have used this as a very reliable reference. However, since 1980 this resonance has been slowly rising. It is now over 12 cycles per second! This means there is the equivalent of less than 16 hours per day instead of the old 24 hours.    8. During the Apocalypse or the time "between worlds" many people will be going through many personal changes. The changes will be many and varied. It is all part of what we came here to learn or experience. Examples of change could be- relationships coming to an end, change of residence or location, change of job or work, shift in attitude or thinking etc."*    *EDIT*    My bad! :)     *The date December 21st, 2012 A.D. (13.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count), represents an extremely close conjunction of the Winter Solstice Sun with the crossing point of the Galactic Equator (Equator of the Milky Way) and the Ecliptic (path of the Sun), what that ancient Maya recognized as the Sacred Tree. This is an event that has been coming to  resonance very slowly over thousands and thousands of years. It will come to resolution at exactly 11:11 am GMT.*    http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm    *edit*    Okay...so obviously I am having some dyslexic issues.

Jesus is mysteriously connected to all human beings by virtue of the Incarnation, so Luke 6 is not talking only about Christians.     Being hungry and being thirsty can have a dual meaning. We are to feed spiritually hungry and thirsty people with food that will last for ever. That means supporting and belonging to a faith community that eats spiritual and physical food.

LuN1unJ3aa	Yes. They exist and are called mudskippers. Several species of such creatures exist and are often available for purchase from pet shops that deal with tropical fish.    From the wikipedia article (a good place to start): Mudskippers are members of the subfamily Oxudercinae (tribe: Periophthalmini), within the family Gobiidae (Gobies). They are completely amphibious fish, uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats, unlike most fish in such habitats, which survive the retreat of the tide by hiding under wet seaweed or in tidal pools. Mudskippers are quite active when out of water, feeding and interacting with one another, for example to defend their territories.    They are found only in tropical and subtropical regions, including all the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.

A) You say "Christians" when what I think you mean is  "Creationists".  The idea that all Christians are Creationists  is common on TV and in popular culture, but it is a straw man argument, and totally untrue.  Something close to 1/3 of the humans on Earth are Christians of one sort or another. http://www.religioustolerance.org/worldr...  of that there are hundreds, if not thousands of different forms of Christianity, breaking down into "Four to eight meta-groups: Most of the Christian denominations and sects in the world can be sorted into about eight segments or branches:  Roman Catholicism,     Eastern Orthodoxy,     Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches,    Protestantism    Restorationists    Anglican Communion    Pentecostals    Others "  http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ...    Of that only SOME of the Protestants and Pentecostals (and Others of course) teach anything close to Creationism.  (I'm one of the group that considers Restorationists to be non-Christian).     In any case, the vast majority of Christians have no doctrinal problem with the Theory of Evolution, that being :  Roman Catholicism, Anglican Communion, Eastern Orthodoxy,  Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches, and the vast majority of  Protestants.  Telling us about lung fish won't challenge our faith.    B) You assume that Creationists are ignorant, and that they are unaware of public knowledge that is commonly seen on the Discovery Channel. This is not true either. The most ferverant and out spoken Creationist I ever met was named Tim. Tim is  a computer wizard who works for the U.S.Army and who is  the subject matter expert on a particularly complex, and vital, piece of comptuer software. I believe he had a masters degree in Computer Engineering.      While you and I, and most of the scientific community see lungfish as proof of evolution, Tim would see them as an interesting species that was created by God, and was designed by God to fill a particular ecological niche.  Tim was a Creationist, but he  knew about lungfish and didn't dispute their existance (I talked with him about evolution quite a bit at one time).  He was rather close minded and ill informed on the subject of Darwin, but that didn't mean he was stupid or ignorant.    The point is Christian and "idiot" are not the same thing, even if the TV tells you so.  Many of the brightest minds in scholarship and history have been Christians. Christian theology can be very complex and intelectually demanding stuff. Try reading anything by St. Augustine, or St. Thomas Aquinas, or even Karl Barth, and you will soon find you are in over your head intelectually (though that's not quite fair of me, all of  of them wrote as schollars for other schollars...and most of their works weren't targeted for a wider audience).    C) You assume that science and Christianity are at odds. This too is a straw man argument often seen on TV, but again it is false.   This is my favorite example http://vaticanobservatory.org/ to disprove it, but this works pretty well too http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/gregormendel.h...    So please don't go thinking that just because people have  accepted Jesus Christ as their  Lord and Savior, they must be some sort of  ignorant rube and you can rock their  world with something you just discovered in your Upper Third Form Science Text.  It's kind of insulting.    That may be what TV tells you is true... that's normally the way Christians are depicted on TV, but that's not the way the world really is at all.     Good luck and take care.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Well, aside from the walking part, a lungfish could indeed do that.|`|q6H2ru3waa	LOL!!!!!!!|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Regular fish do not breathe air or have legs.

The Greek of the New Testament is much better:  ? Eros: Romantic love  ? Philia: Brotherly (or sisterly) love  ? Storge: Parental love  ? Agape: Godly love    Eros and philia are based on emotions and storge is almost an instinct.    But Agape is a decision to wish for the best for someone.    Christians are commanded to love (agape) their neighbors and enemies. This does not mean we have to like them or approve of their actions.     This love (agape) is almost impossible to do without God's help.    Do you love (agape) the terrorists who flew airplanes into the World Trade Center?    With love in Christ.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	For me one huge part of "love" is when I spend hours here no Y/A responding in an effort to help whomever I can, in an effort to appease and bring resolve to people's minds and lives . God's plan and Laws for us should be very basic and simple and man tries to complicate them too much.  Love transcends all these boundaries and fronts man puts before him in an effort to conceal himself.  God allows me and us to see through those boundaries and fronts, and bypass them.  Another words, "If someone is pretending to hate me or dislike me or my opinions or thoughts,  I will only show compassion , love and understanding to break through his barriers to win him/her over to God.  We must be willing to humble ourselves for God's missions and taskings and we must be able to see all the way to the end result instead of being beat down by the excess baggage of hatred and confusion that many here put in front of them.|`|93359f8cb488652b055bb246c8283544aa	God|`|VhmBMJKxaa	Love is accepting someone for exactly who they are.

Another way evolution might be demonstrated more convincingly is to work with a species that reproduces very rapidly - like bacteria, and with for a whole new species to evolve.  Some bacteria reproduce many times in only 24 hours.    Hard scientific research is being done using life forms, like bacteria, that reproduce very rapidly. Adaptation within species happens a lot, and it is obvious,  but so far, no species has been observed to have evolved into a new species.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Not just by looking at the physiology. A key point about fossils is dating them. For example, fossil layers are uniformly stacked on top of each other by age, so the most recent are to the top-most levels. The earliest levels with fossils show simple life forms, increasing in complexity and diversity.    Certain layers show mass extinction, followed by proliferation with lots of new species.    While the rate of change varies, the consistency with which we see slight variations in species over earlier species confirms the idea that populations change over time.    It would be wonderful to be able to genetic analysis on fossils, but right now we can only see the physical expression of genes.    If creation was true we'd expect to see all organisms appearing all at once, which is not what we see.|`|31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't arrive at by reason.

5RmhSDPTaa	if you look at the first 5 books of Moses (Torah) you'll see that some things are said about preparing meat, but not other things like fruits and vegetables.  the book of Leviticus speaks of what is clean and what God says is not clean in the way of food, but not a lot on how to prepare what is clean (edible).    and for those who think the dietary laws in Torah only applies to Jews, ask yourself, "does God ever change?"  the answer is "no, never."  what God gave to His people THEN, is for ALL of us now, because all of Yeshua's (Jesus) followers have been "grafted in" according to Romans 11.    delme|`|n7bok7NRaa	In Leviticus and Deuteronomy you can read a LOT about how the Israelites were to prepare their food.    For instance, there are rules about bleeding the meat dry, about how cooked portions of certain animals (like lamb) should be eaten in certain ceremonies, which parts are clean and unclean to eat, and how fluids should not be mixed (blood/meat and milk, for example).    Most modern Christians do not take these rules at face value any longer due to the fact that we know a great deal more about how hot certain meats must get before they can be eaten, and how to pasteurize milk. But it is still a fascinating read.|`|aHaZ1IcHaa	yes, plenty.  there is a lot about food in the old and new testaments.  regulations on how to properly prepare sacrificial foods are mostly in the books of exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy, as well as good manners and regulations on how to show proper hospitality.      the new testament mostly says eat whatever and however you want, just give the proper thanks to God.  but 2 prohibitions remain in the new testament; consuming blood is forbidden, and it is forbidden to boil a baby goat in its own mothers milk (it's just too heartless a thing to do).|`|j1vjNjDiaa	There are a lot of things mentioned about food, mainly what to eat,  what not to eat, unclean animals, removal of fat.

2ZO7vFC1aa	Not any disabled person.      But consider what Mormon said in his letter to Moroni (in Moroni chapter 8), "repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin".  Children are not capable of committing sin and thus do not need repentance or baptism.  That same principle also applies to some mental handicaps.  Some mental handicaps are such that the person does not understand right from wrong and is not capable of committing sin.  That person does not need baptism.      In fact, I believe there is a verse that specifically refers to such people:    "For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, AND ALSO ALL THEY THAT ARE WITHOUT THE LAW. For the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing" (Moroni 8:22).    This principle doesn't just apply to children, but also to many that suffer from mental ailments that prevent them from understanding and thus following the law.  God does not condemn them for not following something they are mentally incapable of following.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Yup. They are as innocent as little children (some of them).|`|AA10637643	Well, most mentally handicapped people either 1) can't discern right from wrong and/or 2) never really do anything "wrong".    I have a younger brother with partial autism, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder, and social disabilities.  He is almost 20, but more acts like a 10 year old most of the time.  BUT, he is one of the most genuine and loving people I have ever known.  He is very concrete - if you say something once, that's the way it is, no changing.  So, he believes the gospel is true, that's what he has been taught, and knows sinning is bad.  He is not completely helpless - he does his laundry, went to regular school & regular classes, passed them all, has his driver's license, went to prom...  I have absoluetly no doubt he will be in the Celestial Kingdom.  His disabilities are part of his earthly trial.  He will pass the "test" with flying colors.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Define disabled.    Oh. I don't know why they would say that?   I agree with Ms. Stevie's response to this one.|`|JWjlyztBaa	It all depends on their ability to discern right from wrong.    "Obviously if children or adults do not develop mentally to the point where they know right from wrong and have the normal intellect of an accountable person, they never arrive at the years of accountability no matter how many actual years they may live. Such persons though they may be adults, are without the law, cannot repent, are under no condemnation, 'and unto such baptism availeth nothing.' (Moro. 8:22.) Because they have no 'understanding' it remains for the Lord 'to do according as it is written' concerning them (D. & C. 29:48-50) that is, save them through the power of his redemptive sacrifice." (Moro. 8:22.)"  (McConkie, B., Mormon Doctrine, Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1966, p. 853.)    Some have committed heinous acts due to their incompetence, so I don't necessarily subscribe to the notion they were per se valiant in the pre-existence.  There is no authority to make that claim.  Some or most may very well have been valiant.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Those incapable of making adult choices in their life would fall under the same conditions as little children and thus be alive in Chirst as Mormon teaches us in Moroni 8.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Ms. Stevie's answer is correct. This is what has been told to my family as my brother is seriously  developmentally disabled. He is considered profoundly retardard and is innocent and has no concept of right or wrong. He has not been baptized into the church as our bishop  stated he has no concept of the ordiance and is listed in the records as Not Accountable. So I guess that's about as good as any Free Pass as one can get.

z74a7wvlaa	Thank you for bringing this up. Last Jan 21, 2009, an update of the scientific findings of the shroud of turin authenticated the image in the burial cloth is that of THE BODY OF CHRIST. Prior to Jan 21/09 findings, the error in the carbon dating is from that patch cloth, and turn there was a process to do that in France. So, here's the report at Jan 21/09:     The Authentication of the Turin Shroud:  An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology  by William Meacham - Archaeologist  "But in an epistemological framework no stricter than that normally operative for judgements of history and science, the image on the Shroud of Turin can, I submit, be confidently ascribed to the body of Christ." [last sentence of last paragraph].|`|K91tfiLCaa	The Catholic church does not recognize stigmata as being any sort of act of God.    One little-mentioned fact is: "...Jewish burial practice utilizedand the Gospel of John specifically describes for Jesusmultiple burial wrappings with a separate cloth over the face."    The bible says that small napkins were used to cover Jesus, not a giant piece of cloth.  If you believe in the bible, the shroud must be a fake because it conflicts with the Word of God.    Giz|`|HrQDQvUUaa	The Shroud of Turin has been proven to be a real burial shroud showing the image of a savagely beaten, crucified man. The image is best seen on a photographic negative.    Scientists who have examined it have found hemoglobin in the marks of bloodstains in the shroud, and have found it to be type "O" blood. They have also found sweat and urea from the laceration marks on the shroud, indicative of oozing from the wounds after death.    The man in the image was savagely whipped by two whips, one with three thongs, the other with two, from someone on each side of him. The whip ends were tipped with lead dumb-bells to increase the effect of the beating. Jewish law stated that a man could not receive more than 40 lashes, whereas the Romans had no such laws. The figure in the Shroud was whipped over 120 times, from neck to ankles.    The image indicates that the figure was right-handed and lacerations on the back indicate that he carried the crossbeam of a cross higher on the right shoulder than the left, which would be normal for a right-handed person. The nose of the figure was also broken, and there is an abrasion on the right cheek as if he fell and was unable to catch himself with his arms. (In Roman times, the crossbeam of a cross was placed across the victim's shoulders and tied to the beam at the wrists. The victim was then were forced to carry the crossbeam to the execution site)    There is a wound in the right side of the figure's ribs the exact size and shape of a Roman spearhead, and stains show that blood and plasma poured out when the spear was withdrawn indicating that the man was already dead when the spear was inserted.    The scalp of the figure is deeply lacerated and torn by sharp objects, very likely caused by a helmet of thorns.    The hands and feet show clear wounds made by square-shafted Roman nails. The backs of the hands show the nails coming out through the wrists, and bifurcated (divided) bloodstains indicate that the victim had to pull himself up by his nailed hands to breathe while on the cross.    Read the New Testament accounts of Jesus' trial, scourging and crucifixion and you will see that they are eerily identical to the marks on the image on ther Shroud.    Finally the image is 3-dimensional and has been lightly burned into the topmost fibers of the shroud by a instantaneous intense flash of energy. Scientists who examined the Shroud have reluctantly admitted it appears that the image was created at the moment of resurrection.    What is fascinating is that the image of a Greek lepton (small Greek coin) was burned into the Shroud. The lepton was placed over one of the eyes, usually used to keep the eyes closed after death. Chances are very good a lepton was over the other eye also, but didn't appear on the Shroud image.    It is impossible to paint a 3 dimensional image onto cloth, ruling out the possibility that the Shroud is a painting or a clever forgery.    The reason why scientists don't want to cotrect their error is that if they "prove" the Shroud to be a fake or forgery, they can retain their atheistic beliefs. However if it IS proven to be Jesus' burial shroud, this indicates that the New Testament is true and woukld shake the scientirfic world to it's foundations. Apparently their reputations are more important to them than the truth.    As for "stigmata" these are psychosomatic wounds that are caused by the person being in an extreme mental state.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Stigmata are indeed real.

Wanna buy some shares in the brooklyn bridge? I'll make you a HOT deal!    REALLY!  ?|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	I have known about the dating discrepancy for some years now. The reason the shroud is no longer thrown in our faces is that the other side knows as well. It is one more piece of historical evidence many would prefer did not exist.  Sharing the shroud as valid would only bring more scorn by those with closed eyes. I don't care what others believe. Years of concern have given way to resignation that masses of people will go to the grave cursing God. All too often the cries for evidence are accompanied by fear that the evidence offered will be undeniable. There is enough evidence to serve as proof in any court of law. That is why so many have withdrawn to the world of scientific discovery. The rules of evidence are slightly different and it is easier to hide behind the great unknowns that exist. Let them hide in peace.|`|LyPVlMl0aa	well it just proved one thing is this peice of dishcloth is real...

The idea that someone can appeal to you is the point of your sexuality.     I'm not bi or gay, personally, but I think I can sympathize with your confusion.

Human beings aren't made of stone.  Many people have had far-out fantasies that were interesting to contemplate, but they knew that in reality they would cause a lot of upheaval and distress.    My advice is, before you set your foot on a path that much of society considers deviant, make a sincere effort to develop normal heterosexual feelings and relationships.  The obstacles high-school-age girls face can be tough, but almost all of us have met and conquered them.      You must know that if you made even the slightest advance to another girl from school, the news would spread like wildfire and your name would be mud.    Nerdy boys, shy boys, arrogant boys, boys only interested in science, sports, music, whatever -- sometimes it's hard to even talk to them, much less develop romantic feelings for them.  If you can wait until these problems smooth out, you'll have a better sense of your own self as well as how to relate to other people.|`|FkY5P2Xqaa	if you got to ask the same question 6 time and you are still wondering... i think you already know the answer. yes you could be curious|`|2X0xGTkLaa	uhmmm pretty much...|`|niuy2QwDaa	u have to find that out for urself|`|AA11730096	your not bisexual your just not sure of your sexuality|`|o1B8obliaa	bisexual or not, all beautiful girls should have sex with other girls. it's a turn on, men love it, just go with the flow baby;)|`|0QFKm3WLaa	This depends not if you can see yourself having sex with a boy and/or a girl, but how you really feel around boys and girls and if you fall for th both sexes - you're bi.|`|yNMc5g7paa	I think it makes you a girl that is too young to be thinking about these things.    There is no such thing as "I think im bisexual"... Its either your straight, or your stupid... You decide.|`|KBBonf97aa	It's perfectly normal for girls your age to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  When kids assert their independence from their parents, they form intense bonds with friends.  Mix in a huge dose of hormones and you'll get all sorts of attractions that don't necessarily mean a thing.    Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual, which is why so many kids are doing that.  But if you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that the vast majority of them grew up to be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).  The hipness of "playing gay" actually makes life hard for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't an accessory they can wear for a while and then discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used and tossed aside by peers who only want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries.  When the novelty wears off, the "dabblers" can revert to their heterosexual selves without the fear of being labeled gay.    A lot of people will tell you to experiment with guys and girls and then make a decision, but that's stupid.  A gay man can have great sex with a woman, but that doesn't make him bisexual or straight any more than a lesbian becomes straight or bisexual because she has sex with a man.  The acts are just acts - anyone can do them and enjoy the stimulation.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  You don't get to choose it, no matter how fashionable a certain orientation may be.  It's something that reveals itself when your hormone levels normalize near the end of adolescense.    Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  It's a lot easier coming out of a closet than crawling back inside when you realize you've made a mistake.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she had a crush on another girl.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was completely straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was basically a confused kid.  And she's the first to admit she wouldn't have thought she was bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.    Everything you're experiencing is normal and common and it doesn't make you bisexual.  If you've always liked guys and the curiosity about girls is recent, odds are you're 100% straight.  You're just going through something that has tormented teens since the beginning of time.  Your sexual orientation will sort itself out over the next few years with no action required on your part.  Try not to think about it too much, since you won't find any answers.  You don't get to choose your orientation, anyway, so you may as well be patient and wait for it to make itself known.  Just don't put too much stock in the hormone-fueled feelings you're having at the moment, since in the vast majority of cases the same-sex attractions end as quickly as they started.  And it's not worth mislabeling yourself bisexual because of normal teenage confusion or because it's considered "hip" to do so.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you're supposed to be.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	you are just bicurious    you won't really know until you have experienced it all|`|B3jpU4Jraa	well i dosent matter what you are if you are curious about a girl  then let your curiosity get the best of you and you could  find out if you are or not and i gave kissed a girl i didnt really think anything of it though just a kiss|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Whoa easy girl, well it could be one of two things: 1.

Or maybe you could be bisexual..but so what? Nothing wrong with that, society these days is starting to accept homosexuals/bisexuals a lot more than in the past. So don't worry and if you feel like you have to tell your parents then so be it..they're going to have to accept it whether they like it or not- it's not like they can make you be straight again.

If you get really picky it works like this :  100 for the mantra etc  10 as an amendment for any mistakes made in the 100   1 for any mistake in the 10  not everyone will give you the same answer, like I said it depends upon the school of thought !

The truth is - as I see it of course - God does exist and he doesn't exist.    this option is never thought of because it's just not logical. but who said that the truth is logical or should be logical?    through history, human beings were wasting their energy on making life accepted by their little - logical - minds. and every time, life proves to them that it is not logical at all. but for some reason, they don't get it !!!    logic is a mental trap. life - God - doesn't care about logic or reason.    why we are born ?  what a simple question .. with millions of answers !    why we die ?  for God to live. maybe ?    anyways .. sorry if my answer doesn't make sense.  however,if you think that it does make sense to you .. then it's just another wrong answer!|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	The burden of proof is on the believer (in other words, the one making the positive claim).

The Bible even says that we must accept by faith the fact that God exists, And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him (Hebrews 11:6). If God so desired, He could simply appear and prove to the whole world that He exists. But if He did that, there would be no need for faith. "Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed' (John 20:29).    That does not mean, however, that there is no evidence of Gods existence. The Bible states, The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world (Psalm 19:1-4). Looking at the stars, understanding the vastness of the universe, observing the wonders of nature, seeing the beauty of a sunsetall of these things point to a Creator God. If these were not enough, there is also evidence of God in our own hearts. Ecclesiastes 3:11 tells us, He has also set eternity in the hearts of men There is something deep within us that recognizes there is something beyond this life and someone beyond this world. We can deny this knowledge intellectually, but Gods presence in us and through us is still there. Despite all of this, the Bible warns us that some will still deny Gods existence, The fool says in his heart, There is no God (Psalm 14:1). Since over 98% of people throughout history, in all cultures, in all civilizations, on all continents believe in the existence of some kind of God, there must be something (or someone) causing this belief.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	i don't offended when someone believes differently than i do.  its how they act as a result of those beliefs.  restricting the rights of others just because you (not you per say) don't agree with it is not right.|`|uFAoq4idaa	Look at yourself  at the mirror if you look like an ape so that's the proof that God does not exist.

A food preference is provable...and can be demonstrated by an experiment where people are given a choice, and prefer one thing over another.  However, it makes absolutely no difference in terms of life and death.    The existence of God does not depend on a poll or the preferences of people.  Either he exists or he doesn't.  You can't do an experiment to see if it is true or not...and the preferences of people don't make it true or make it false.  But it does matter.  Because if God does exist, then there might be a purpose for out lives, and there might be more to life than just what we can see.

And since science has only shown that life resists happening by itself I think you need to keep your options open. God is still a very logical alternative. Edit to Michael K you say wrong then say scientists most likely say abiogenesis then say what I just said that they haven't proven it. I think that's what I just said. The Urey?Miller experiment once thought to be an aha moment is now all but fallen into disrepute. Some still quote it but any scientist in the know, knows they haven't progressed any further in five years of intensive research since that famous experiment was first conducted. I am not interest in proving God exists. I think the only proof of somethings existence is the thing itself. However i do believe there is reasonable evidence and the fat that science has shown complex life doesn't self organise is sufficient reason to open your mind to other possibilities. Amazing how many atheists swallow the abigenesis argument though. I thought they demanded evidence and chose to believe in science instead of God. o what science has shown life can self organise? Nothing. Wishful speculation. I guess you guys have faith after all.

I am not OFFENDED if someone does not believe in God, I simply disagree with them, and the will, eventually, learn the Truth.... sadly so for them.    A book most certainly CAN be proof of something.  How many people use Darwin's book as proof of evolution?  How about all those mathematical books out there with PROOFS in them?    What you say about writing anything down and calling it truth, is true.  However, in the case of the Scriptures, they are not merely written down by someone.  They are the Inspired, Infallible Word of God... and since God CANNOT LIE, then what is written therein IS THE TRUTH.  This is how believers understand this.  Whether or not YOU (or others) AGREE with this belief is your/their choice.  But that does not change what the believer believes and "knows" in his/her heart to be TRUE.

What about the nother lights?    http://www.art.com/products/p10240144-sa...      There are two kinds of solar storms, often related to each other: coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. A flare occurs when magnetic energy builds to a peak near the Sun's surface and explodes. This intense, fast-paced event results in an intense burst of light, including X-rays, in the Sun's lower atmosphere. A much larger storm, a CME erupts when magnetic field lines snap, sending billions of tons of material into space at millions of miles per hour. The cloud expands to over 30 million miles by the time it reaches Earth. Both flares and CMEs can result in additional high speed particles being shot out into the solar system at close to the speed of light.

I CAN prove god does NOT exist. The ONLY evidence for there being a god is the bible. It was written by the average everyday joe. It was probably their idea of a joke to play on the world for the enxt couple hundred years. If you beleive that god is "allpowerful" consider this: all of the great pegan nations that at one point or other ruled the know world fell soon after adopting Christianity. If god really did exist I would think that he would take better care of his "subjects". I can name twenty good reasons not to beleive in god but I have not heard one good reason to beleive in god.

Mathmatics is based upon standards called "postulates", these are litterally defined as "That which we accept, without proof, due to overwelming evidence".  Human beings are finitely minded creatures, it is simply impossible for us to know everything.  The truth is, what most people want to see and accept as definate, "proof", does not exist, not in anything at all.  It is a consept of sheer illusion.  The only "proof" we can really have of anything is what the vastness of evidence surrounding us points to.  So what do we do? Say nothing is true, nothing is reliable, nothing is trustworthy?    "Believeing", by its nature is not a religious matter alone.  We have "expectation"(believeing) in every thought resulting in action that we take.  Even something as simple as lifting your arm requires an expectaion, a belief, a trust in your reasoning to accomplish it.  If you were physically capable of lifting your arm, and you thought you couldn't, you might not.  Wouldn't that be limiting yourself, even to the point it might even be called ignorant of you?    If I argued with you that you can't even prove 2+2=4 , which you really can't utterly conclusively, would 2+2=4 really be made so irrelivant or untrustworthy of a peice of information?   People can say there is absolutely no proof of the existance of God.  People can say that absolutely everything is proof of the existance of God.  Not to spin your head around, but its even possible for them both to be right in some sense.  I don't think a lot of people who argue the existance of God, or anything else are really so interested in proof of anything, except to point a finger at what is wrong in the world all the time and who else should be blamed for it.  If they gave a %$^% about what was true, good, or right to do, for the matter, they would all find agreement some where and how.  If God is so fictional, than why is he to blame?  How can it be the fault of something that does not exist? And than, if he does, how is a being that is all good carry the blame.  Humanity, itself, is obsessed with the negativity in which it surrounds itself.  The consept of anything at all being all good, God or not, even in consept, would quite chosenly be beyond its reasoning as a whole.  There are many people who even say they believe in God that are so riddled with negatives they would make such a consept very far from their true thinking and action to relate to it.  If God is true, He proves Himself fine enough.  If he is not, than what matter does he have?  What remains is that humanity does not even know the worth of itself and its own kind, and it is the proof of this it should be seeking.  There had better be something incredibly good to look at to provide vision enough in order to see a way to outdistace its own short comings, or it never will, and its all our own fault.|`|0ZPABvh8aa	You are absolutely right, you can neither prove it one way or the other, not by the standards required of non believers  or the standards of men anyway. I am a Christian but I firmly believe in keeping religion out of law , not all Christians do but I believe in freedom and I also believe that we are responsible for our own sins. By the same token, it is OK for non Christians to express their non belief but they too are expressing just a belief system based on their faith that God doesn't exist. It has no more perceived credibility that what a Christian believes. People far smarter and more educated than anyone on here have  debated the whys and wherefores of the bible for years and years and still no one has managed to provide CONCLUSIVE evidence that its rubbish. For every book that discredits the bible , one can be produced to refute it and on it goes. Faith is at the bottom of all this, faith in belief or faith in non belief.

Are there hot girls there?|`|fZCfJWpOaa	It depends on the group.  When I was younger they would have different activities.  Sometimes it would be mainly socializing, and sometimes we'd watch a movie or perform a play and discuss it afterwards.  You can ask what they're planning to do tonight and see if it's something you'd be comfortable with.    You could also talk to the group leaders about your reservations beforehand so that they can avoid putting you in a position where you could feel uncomfortable.    As Christians, they *should* be welcoming of you and accepting of your different viewpoint.  Unfortunately some people forget about that.  If you're uncomfortable, then leave.|`|gEOVHZcVaa	f that in the a, go and tell them what you believe and why|`|fRCoMzXkaa	I think you should brew up some tea, and play some Grand Theft Auto, that would be more fun. And I say that as a Christian who can think of nothing more dull than a Christian youth group.|`|r8a0mIYEaa	church youth groups pretty lame anyway and I shouldn't waste my time with them?      EXCATLY|`|1407010ef5334b45cfd47e41b94b4eddaa	Depends. As a Jew turned Agnostic, I still often went on youth group outings when I was younger, simply because they were fun.

It is a thrill when you get away with it. You might be confronted with questions about your beliefs and so you have to BS your way through it all! If you get asked which church you attend come up with a name and put "uniting church" at the end of it!    Don't get sucked into debate and clarification if it arises, just go along with it and keep your logical atheistic mouth SHUT!!!    You will find that these people are just like you and me (except for the deluded part)... then you will realize even more how crazy they are!    If there are nice ladies there too, then even better! Some of those girls are just there for the social life and are also pretenders too!!!

Depends on who's running them and whether it's an "outreach"-type group with mainly activities and social things going on, or a group geared mostly to Christian kids that has more of a faith-based focus.  So without knowing any more than what you've told us, it wouldn't hurt to go once and see what the deal is with this particular group.  Almost every youth group does have at least a brief prayer to start and end with, even if what goes on in between isn't religious stuff, so if you're okay with that then it should be fine.  Things are usually pretty low-key when it comes to guests; if you're not comfortable discussing certain things, you shouldn't be put on the spot.  Anyway, up to you.  If you do go, relax and be yourself.|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	Give it a shot. You know that if there is a God, this could be a way that opens your heart to truth that I feel that you are seeking. I really appreciate your attitude on this. Go with an open mind and try not to stereotype them. I'm sure that they won't try to gang save you in the parking lot. Now lets talk about being overtly religious. You have already stereotyped the whole group as being overtly religious when you don't understand what they do as believers do. First of all, has it been said that there will be a discussion on your views and why you don't believe? You may have been just invited there to check things out and see what goes on in a meeting. Don't go there expecting an argument or a debate. The focus will probably be on both socializing, (welcoming  you and others) and spiritual discussion with the bible as the guide.    You owe it to yourself to go and and explore. I admire that. Maybe you will see that there is reason and order and not the kayos and nonsense that is always rumored by people who don't go as far as you will. Remember, go as a friendly observer who likes to see for himself instead of just listening to what you have heard from others who won't even go.    Psalms 34;:8  O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.    Taste and see. Remember, don't go as though you have already tasted. God bless you and good luck. I can tell you one thing right now. Nothing bad will ever happen. And something good always does.|`|rsxXzJDhaa	as long as you have a friend or two that is going you might as well check it out.  you never know maybe it will be fun and worse case scenario you just chill with your friend the whole time

I honestly wonder how any one with even a tiny brain can buy into that nonsense.  Just exactly what have you ever done that would require someone to die to "save" you?  It is ludicrous.

3ViTBLovaa	According to the people who believe in this god, people aren't created gay. They choose to be gay. Which is incorrect of course. But then there's also the people who say even if you are attracted to the same sex, it doesn't mean you have to give into it, and you should either make yourself straight or just be celibate your whole life. This seems hypocritical to me because they give into their urges, and even though they're heterosexual it's still a sin. And I fail to see how a ceremony can make a sin, something pure. Having sex with your wife, isn't any better then having sex with a whore. What makes it different is intimacy and spiritual bonding which most married people don't have anyway. It's still just sex to them.  So they're sinning just as much as gay people do. But ya anyway not everyone believes in a god like that. If you want to you can believe that god will accept you as long your relationships are pure and not driven by carnal desire.|`|Rh8m6cxnaa	I think since Satan has invaded earth, it isn't a perfect world anymore. I don't hold my God responsible. Everything will be made right one day. The only thing imperfect humans can do with our limited understanding is to do what he has told us to do. We can't possibly understand his thinking, so why eludes us. Just do it, or give up on letting this bother you. You have to come to terms with your God.|`|6zha8REvaa	Yeah nuts I can understand why it might be tempting to think of God as cruel... but well to answer your question I guess, while it isn't my place to judge whether something is or isn't a sin for someone else, if being gay is in fact a sin, and is a weakness for someone, the biblical explaination isn't that God created them to be gay, but rather that their different nature is the result of the fall of man... in other words, people have a variety of fallen natures as a result of all the choices to betray God, a history that goes back all the way to Adam... the whole world has gone haywire because of a single act of disobedience, and all the resulting successive bad choices... so the Christian belief is that weaknesses and suffering, in a terribly tragic sense, is a monument to God's respect for the choices of man. As many theologians (from what I understand) have pointed out, it isn't possible for God to say He is Love, and at the same time not allow people to make real, free choices, with real consequences that truly affect other people and things, even those yet to be born...    But while evil and cruelty have the power to bring destruction and sorrow, good and love have the power to bring healing and life. Christians believe that Christ is the only one who ever got obedience perfectly correct... and the interesting thing about Him is that it seemed to matter less what our (or His) weaknesses and questionable inclinations might be, and more about whether we were willing to let go of the things that would prevent Love from coming alive. Granted, our weaknesses might make it harder to let go of thigns standing in the way of Love... but I suppose it doesn't make it any less good to do. Indeed, if there is one lesson that Christ seemed to make quite clear, it is that it is only when we are willing to die to ourselves, just as He did His whole life, it is only then that Love can truly come alive... it is only then that we can really be free. The CEO who dies a bit to his ambitions and decides to pass up additional work, because he knows his wife would appreciate the time they can share, the son who dies to his pride and responds gracefully to the angry and undeserved accusations of his father, because apart from his pride he is able to see beyond the fierce hostility to the broken spirit within... that is what Love is; dying to ourselves, so that we can bring life to others. That's the whole point of the Law, to teach us to let go, for the very purpose of being free to Love.    In one sense, I think it is a terrible shame that the modern idea of morality has been sort of reduced to whether people have technically complied with the written code... while I do believe that sin is real, I think it is Love itself that will make it self evident... there is no need for statistics or social sciences. So will anyone be condemned for being gay? In one sense that might be the wrong question... the business of the religious is to make Love the priority; and from what I've come to know, and many of the great figures of whom I hold in high regard have similarily noted it seems, it seems that it is that Love itself will warn us early on that we may very well have to let go of everything, just like Christ did... it itself will explain what is, and what isn't necessary to let go off along the way, because clearly some things truly do compromise Love... this is what we call sin. So I think that is what they mean by God is Love... no feel good experiences, no prosperity gospel, no gaurantee of even the next breath of life, but rather a God who was willing to give it all up so that He could offer Heaven as a gift to us... and hoping that we would be inspired to Love in precisely the same way. And I think that is the God that I, and many others, am heartbrokenly in love with...|`|lDEGaK7Laa	That's exactly why I'm not a Christian anymore.

c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	I found a poem by Lisa Lewis.  It's quite wordy, but one part of it seems to really hit home.  It's exactly what you asked for... it's loving yet very subtle.  "I don't expect anybody to feel sorry for me,  Which should tell you how long I've been here.  Even the way I sing to birds has changed. The sky wheels  With striped hawks and redtailed hawks and scissortails  And mockingbirds and red finches and flocks of robins  Too wild to hop in front yards listening for worms.  I sing to them and they sing back. They recognize me.  They see like I watch a movie on the Internet,  From afar, knowing it's as real as it's going to get,  And it could be closer than it seems, they'd better live it up,  And if that means singing back to the woman driving  To the tallgrass prairie preserve and parking her little car  Far from all the pickup trucks and nearly falling to her knees  Before all that melancholy, that flatiron sky   That presses down and lets you see things you ought never see,  Secrets you ought not be in on, without ever getting close  So you always feel lonely too, well, they'll do that.   It's about all that's left besides flying and building nests  In the grass. I can't do those things. So I'm singing  A lot these days, and you're overhearing me,  And if it sounds joyous to you, it's because I've been driven crazy  By the wind, and if it's sad, it's because every word is true"         Good Luck and Happy Valentine's to you, too|`|6VyvTYPUaa	you fool.  money , gift cards, check or money orders, all are the most terrible things you can give as a gift.  money, you put zero thought into it at all, and writing a little love poem or something sweet on it that your asking people from YAHOO dosn't make it any better.

Ka1pGYzCaa	I'm not very good at this because I haven't done it very much but this can give me some practice!  I have a book that tells me about palmistry!    I'm assuming you're right handed since that's your right hand.  You prefer practical, logical reasoning, and tend to be analytical and pragmatic.  you always think things through carefully and examin your personal motives before acting.  You prefer to play life by the rules and avoid using tactics that would be embarrassing if made public.  Be careful:  you may be tempted to relax your ethics when pursuing important personal goals.      Your palm looks more rectangular than square so you enjoy brainstorming and talking.  You have an agile mind.  You're bright, quick, and curious and your moods change readily.  Full of mental and emotional energy, you want to know everything about everybody.  You value rationality above all else.  When confronted with an emotional crisis, you try to reason things out and make the most logical choice.  You tend to push aside instinctive gut reactions in favor of logical constructs, through your instincts are often right on target.    Your fingers look thick and fleshy, which reveals a sensual, erotic and mostly passive nature.  You yearn to touch, see, smell, hear and taste all that life has to offer.  You enjoy good food and luxury, and you may be a bit of a couch potato.  But you do want to be productive and transfer your interests into physical form - you may not always be satisfied with admiring the creations of others.      Based on your thumb, I'm assuming you have rounded fingertips.  that indicates that you enjoy people, are receptive and react readily to outside stimuli.  Rounded fingertip types rarely like living alone.  The constant presence of someone who cares for you makes your world safe and desirable.  When  you commit yourself in love, you do so totally and permanently.  You are never pushy or forceful, but once you decide you want something you'll exert gentle but continuous effort to obtain it.  You should consider careers that require helping others solve their problems: medicine, law, social work, management or teaching.    Now the part you were probably waiting for!    Your life line (line below your index finger running to your wrist) is deeply etched and free of a lot of breaks assures that you will have a robust and fruitful life.  You are a high energy person who embraces challenge and opportunity.  Affectionate and physically demonstrative, you enjoy life and people.  You are known for your courage, energy and desire to win.    Your head line (line in the middle of your palm, above your life line that has the "fork" at the end) has a tasselled ending in a fork.  This is called a "writer's fork".  It shows that you are versatile, curious and inventive.  The wider the fork, the more adaptable and resourceful you are with an ability to bring a breath of fresh air into stale, stagnant situations.    Your heart line (line below your pinky going towards your middle/index fingers) is deeply etched but broken.  So you see yourself as a peacemaker.  Even if you have no particular talent for the arts, you enjoy most arts.  You place great emphasis on homne and family.  Because you take everything personally and want everyone to get along, you are likely to interpret differing opinions as attacks or criticisms of you.  Still, you're basically optimistic.  People often turn to you for guidance because you show that you're sensitive to their needs.  Many of your relationships are more like romantic or casual friendships than deep emotional unions.  While it is admirable to help those who deserve it, be on guard against people who would abuse the privilege and use you as a doormat.    Hope it was right for ya, lol.|`|EVbExjIjaa	growing old, dry skin, getting softer, and more stress in your life.

AA10096992	Heh. Like many believers, you seem to think history began with YOUR religion.     Primitive religions were around for thousands of years before Jesus, and they were generally "nature" religions that attempted to explain the unknown. Christianity and Islam have a LOOONG way to go before they demonstrate the same staying power.     These nature religions evolved (to use a dirty word) into the more "modern" polytheistic religions of the Egyptians, Sumerians, etc., and eventually these became the Greek and Roman mythos.     Monotheism was a further refinement (not to say an improvement) that came long later.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	The fact that the philosophy of Socrates is much more profound and inspiring than that of the New Testament demonstrates people are more concerned with the packaging than the functionality of the thing.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Prove there is no God.|`|47sALOGfaa	Remember, "god" is nothing more than a nonsense word created by man to explain away all of the things we can't yet understand.

DapNp1Kxaa	Yes. You would think so. You'd also think that the question of who brought Jesus back from the dead, if he were his own father, and the question of to whom was Jesus praying to, or when he told his disciples that he was ascending to his father, and their father, or when he plainly told those who asked that he was the son of God, and never claimed to be God, Or how holy spirit could fill 120 people at a time, and be everywhere if it were a person, or how no where in the bible does it make any mention of holy spirit as anything other than Gods' active force?  Especially when the bible tells us that God subjected all things to Jesus EXCEPT God Himself.  You'd think that all these biblical statements would be enough to make folks think; but usually not. You'd have thought that all the miracles Jesus performed would have been enough for people of his day to accept him, but generally, they didn't. Go figure...|`|HGPxEhMSaa	I agree with you , it does not make sense any other way.|`|47sALOGfaa	Jesus is nothing more than a character in a fairy tale.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	What makes you think the statement is true, is there a way of verifying this statement as true.

Others are that they must be the same age and power as well as know the same amount of things.  The Bible does not support such a doctrine.    Jesus own words both here and at John 14:28 where Jesus says, "My Father is greater than I am." certainly puts a hole in the doctrine.  So does Colossians 1:15-18 where it is recorded that Jesus was the firstborn of all creation by God.  In other words, God was around before Jesus.  He created Jesus personally.  So they are not the same age or power.    So it is not only Matthew 24:36 that shows Jesus is not Almighty God.|`|O6YbZkekaa	Jesus is not God, Jesus is the son of God.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"When Jesus CHRIST ascended into   Heaven, he found out 'the day and the    hour' instantly, upon being seated at   the right hand of 'the Father'."|`|k4WlqPK7aa	i will agree, only because god does not exist and therefore no 2000 year old used car salesman could be related to a fictional character.|`|ZasNwdXaaa	Exodus 3:15   And Elohim said moreover unto Moses,   Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,   YHWH Elohim of your fathers,   the Elohim of Abraham,  the Elohim of Isaac,   and the Elohim of Jacob,   hath sent me unto you:   this is my name for ever,  and this is my memorial unto all generations.    We are told long before Jesus showed up, that God's name is YHWH and is that forever, for all generations. So to claim Jesus is God, is saying God lied here in Exodus 3. But God never lies nor changes.    Malachi 3:6   For I am YHWH,   I change not;    So then, who is Jesus (Yahushua)? But the right hand of God. For Yahushua means, YHWH saves. And we are told in Isaiah that the only saviour is YHWH. He saves us by His right hand. The holy ghost, is His right arm.    Psalm 98:1   O sing unto YHWH a new song;   for he hath done marvellous things:   his right hand,   and his holy arm,   hath gotten him the victory.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	God the Father is the greatest of the Trinity. But he and the Father are one, meaning alike or equal. This doesnt mean that Christ is greater than God the Father. God the Father has made him equal. If you have a son and teach him everything he knows and then make him equal with you, does he say he is greater than you? Didnt you learn that no student is greater than his master? Yes so the time of the end is for the Master and him only. He is the greatest of all but him and Christ are One. Christ has admitted the God the Father who is also my Father is greater than he. He wouldnt lie. But he has also said that he has the authority to forgive sins, heal, and judge just as the Father has. So he is nothing less than God himself. Everything that God is, Christ is also. But God the Father is greater because he brought forth Christ from himself.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Jesus is God, just like you are your father.

The need for constant attention is really a way to get approval from others since they don't believe in themselves or have the confidence to experience life without forever relying on others opinions of what they feel.    There is a sharp rise in this type of behaviour amongst young people.. 'the mobile generation' because they are always in contact with each other. It's very rare that these people have a moment to themselves. Even when they are lying in their bedrooms (a time where previous generations would really be alone) they have access to thousands of contacts simultaneously via msn and facebook etc.    In fact, those social networking sites encourage users to update their status - with lots of immature and as you call it 'twisted form of thinking out loud'.     I do believe that this will eventually be recorded medically as a personality disorder, in fact we will probably have a mass identity crisis on our hands in the next 5 - 10 years - leading to a lot of hospital admissions and a revamp of the way we are conducting our society (hopefully).|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Its not just some people, its just 99% of the female population lol

Not to mention to have it picked apart by your fellow classmates who put all sorts of comments about how the Dialogue and commentary didn't match up with the characters.    I am also currently in the process of a third draft of a story. You know how frustrating it is to write anything with all those comments and ideas in mind. It stumps me how a farm boy with limited education could write a work like the Book of Mormon.    Edit: In addition, it took so little time to put the Book of Mormon together. Less than a year. Most authors of any fictional work. If they push themselves it takes a year. Some it can take ten years to come up with a work. I am sorry to those who doubt, but to formulate the Book of Mormon and not to consider it a translation is just well near impossible. Who ever is bragging that they could do it, I am extremely skeptical of that claim. Nor do I expect that they will follow through on the challenge.     A short story, it takes at least ten drafts of the work to even be considered done. No idea about a novelistic peice which can be over 600 pages. At any rate it takes a good deal of time to write any form of fiction and I doubt any writer could do it in the time constraints that were mentioned.     Most of this knowledge comes from my personal experience in a Creative Writing class and having discussions on writing in class with a professor who answered our question on how long exactly it does take to write a peice of fiction (And have it published) With this context in mind, I don't buy the claims of people who state that they could write a text similar to the Book of Mormon in so short a time frame.    Edit 2: Okay just to say to those who still think they can do it. Yea maybe you could in about 65 to 80 days but it would most definatly be a really bad rough draft and if it even got sent for publication. I would expect a lot of rejection notices.     Although Joesph Smith never went through any formal publishing that modern day writers go through, the fact still remains that a lot of the writing is very clear, focused and well written. This is unusual if it was a rough draft.     I've done a lot of drafts before and generally the first is always full of problems. grammar errors, sentences that are fragmented or just break off into sort of a stream of consciousness. Which is generally why you have a story-workshoped to help you focus on these problems.     I don't see this with the Book of Mormon, it's very clear, conscice and knows where it's going from beginning to end.     Maybe he had help from someone. Even if the book was co-Authored, there still will be the problem of it being a rough draft. So nope, I still don't buy the claims that it is fiction and that anyone can do it.

But seriously......    Several variants of the so-called Book of Mormon challenge have been circulated through the years but all seem to contain the same major points. One version was distributed in 1976 at the St. George, Utah, LDS Temple Visitor's Center that bears the name of Hugh Nibley. Reportedly Nibley would give out copies of this paper in some of his classes at Brigham Young University.    However, the premise of the Book of Mormon challenge flawed and can be discredited on every point. For instance:    "Other than a few grammatical corrections, you must have no changes in the text. The first edition as you dictate it to your secretary must stand forever."    Besides the approximately 4,000 grammatical and spelling changes that have been made in the Book of Mormon, there have been both historical changes and doctrinal changes.     In two places the name of a king has been changed from Benjamin to Mosiah. In the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon we read as follows:    . . . king Benjamin had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings . . . (Book of Mormon, 1830 edition, page 200)    In modern editions of the Book of Mormon this verse has been changed to read:    . . . king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings. . . (Book of Mormon, 1981 ed., Mosiah 21:28)    The same change was made in Ether:    . . . for this cause did king Benjamin keep them . . . (Book of Mormon, 1830 edition, page 546)    In the 1981 edition, Ether 4:1, we read:    . . . for this cause did king Mosiah keep them . . .    According to chronology found in the Book of Mormon, king Benjamin should have been dead at this time; therefore, the name was changed to his successor, Mosiah.       "You must describe their religious, economic, political, and social cultures and institutions. Cover every phase of their society, including the names of their coins."    The Book of Mormon does not match any culture here in the Americas. It fails totally in the areas of religion, economics, politics and social culture, including their "coins."     While the Book of Mormon does not use the term "coins" it is used in the heading of Alma, chapter 11, which describes the Nephite monetary system: "Nephite coinage set forth. . ."     However, when Europeans landed on the New England coast they did not find the American Indians using gold or silver as money. The first medium of exchange seems to have been shell beads, called Wampum (www.mohicanpress.com/mo08017.html). Later Indians exchanged such items as animal furs for the foreigner's knives, axes, and other utensils (http://countrystudies.us/united-states/h...     "Change your style of writing many times. Many ancient authors contributed to the Book of Mormon, each with his own style."    A recent study done at Stanford University points to Sidney Rigdon as the primary author of the Book of Mormon. http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/conten...

But that it is good -- that is a whole different can of sardines.|`|RzbRRUOdaa	It's fiction. Yes you can!     Dan Brown created lots of fictions such as Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code.  When you read them, they sound like some sort of history books but they are full of errors because again, they're fiction.    When you believe in what you create, it becomes real to you.  But the thing is, inconsistency will always be there.  Simply because you believe it doesn't make it true.    The only undisputed book is the Bible (which doesn't say that Jesus visited America). It's consistent from cover to cover. From Genesis to Revelation. Even unbelieving scholars agree to its consistency.  Check this out:  http://www.y-jesus.com/index.php    No wonder we have the catch phrase "it's Bible-truth".|`|47sALOGfaa	Joseph Smith was a criminal, liar, and conman.  I am neither and thus lack his abilities to deceive.|`|AA11297267	Gee, isn't it a nice coincidence that this "challenge" was given by a well-known mormon apologist professor to students at a mormon owned and operated university?    There are several problems here.  First, the "cultural and technical details" in the Book of Mormon are quite often flat-out wrong.  The BOM lists animals that didn't exist in ancient america, has them doing metallurgy that noone in ancient america did, has them growing crops that didn't exist in the new world.    The imperative that you "do not ever contradict yourself" seems rather silly when you count up the number of self-contradictions in the BOM -- in the hundreds.  Inviting scholars to read and criticize your work seems like a bad idea, since every non-mormon scholar who has spent the time to do so has declared it to be a work of fiction.  Then there's the little problem that there is NO archeological evidence of any kind that supports any of the BOM "history."  Then there's the DNA evidence that shows there are NO native americans who have any descent from hebrews, jews, or any other middle-eastern region.  I'd also keep quiet about that Urim and Thummim thing -- telling people you used magic rocks to see the unseen doesn't usually go over well with rational people, and besides Joseph *didn't* always use the Urim and Thummim (read your church history -- they were taken back, and he freely admits to using his brown "peep stone" to dictate large portions of it, when the supposed gold plates were not even in the same room as he was).    Finally, how could students "finish(ed) the translation in about 80 days after they started..." -- what did they "translate?"  Did they have gold plates?    I could quite easily write a book that was a much more plausible story than the BOM is, though it would still be fiction.  I wouldn't preface every other sentence with "And it came to pass..."  I wouldn't put animals and metals and crops in my story that didn't exist in the time it's supposed to be in.  I wouldn't directly copy large sections of the bible, word for word from a fairly recent translation (King James version) and claim they were there on the plates.  In short, I could do a *much* better job of fiction than Joseph did -- not because I have google, but because I'm smarter.    Hugh Nibley really blew it with this fiction trying to support another fiction.    And your argument from incredulity, "I can't believe he could do this on his own, so it MUST be true" doesn't carry any weight.  Especially when a very similar book, "A View of the Hebrews," that came out in 1823, was in his local library...written by one man in less than 6 months without any plates or magic rocks or anything else.  You should read it some time, it's actually more plausible than the BOM (though it's still fiction).    Peace.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	It would have been impossible for him to make it up.    As his wife Emma once said as far as she's concerned with the notion of Joseph writing the book, impossible, he's not Intelligent enough to be able to even attempt that.    I've noticed a few people picking up the Spalding manuscript in here with View of the Hebrews.  That was a good excuse for years when the book was lost and many claimed that it was virtually identical to the Book of Mormon.  Then, as luck would have it, a copy of it was found which is online for all to see courtesy of the LDS church knowing that if anyone takes the time to read the two there are few similarities.  That was only a good excuse years ago when the Spalding manuscript was lost.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	You could add that word print studies would have to positively identify multiple authors and that none of them would be you.  Your book would be compared to other things that you had written.      It would also have to blatantly contradict many scientific claims.  Over time, your claims would have to be found correct while the scientific claims were discovered to be incorrect.    For the record, Dan Brown, author of the Da Vinci code, states that it is in fact fiction at the beginning of the book.    As far as Xfactor's comments go, the Bible is far from "undisputed".  It mentions dragons, giants, and unicorns.  There are times when it contradicts itself, and only about 18% of the places have been identified.  Far from "undisputed".

wnSvjwWuaa	And you met her just this January?!?    I'm sorry to sound facetious, but you are using words like "I want to grow old together" to someone you have not physically met, just online, and for 2 weeks at the most (you said you met her last part of January)...while I do not discount your intensity, surely you can understand that to total strangers this is an awfully short time for you to feel this way so deeply and intensely.    Also (having been around quite awhile), this seems to me like a simple case of greed on Alexa's part. She want to keep you around "in case things don't pan out betwwen Nikki and me", yet refuses to tell you straight out that you are the one she wants to be with, in fact, she says she can't leave Nikki.    I know you're feeling all sorts of emotions now, precisely why you need to get your HEAD in all of this. Your heart can play tricks on you (painful ones) and sometimes, that cold hard logic from the brain is what's needed to sort this through.    I don't know you well enough to say what you should do - that is something you decide for yourself. But I will say that I see the words "hoarder" written all over Alexa's forehead, because in either case (she leaves Nikki for you or vice versa) she will somehow be a "winner" in that she will definitely end up with someone, and leaving one behind.    I have to be blunt about this, but I have no desire to be hurtful. I call it the way I see it.    Good luck.|`|8Pbevy7laa	Hm, it sounds like you're both emotianally distraught people. You've both been hurt a lot in the past and naturally want someone who will understand and treat you better. The trouble with this is that neither of you seems to have taken the steps of learning how to be happy within yourself regardless of another person. Relationships that are based on this kind of situation often fail as the people in them are relying on the other person to make them happy. e.g. "I'm happy if she's happy" this puts a lot of pressure on the other person. Also it sounds like Nikki has done some good things to care for the other girl, and due to past situations she doesn't have the confidence to make a firm decision on her own future. I think the best thing for both of you would be to spend about 6 months completely single and learn to be more confident within youeselves, then try and hook up again. Your happiness and yourself should be your motivation, Cliche I know but learn to love yourself first, then you can begin loving other people with emotional maturity.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	she not ready to leave nikki b/c shes afraid and since nikki helped her alott shell probably feel bad if she left her for someone else{u}...plus she doesnt want to hurt nikki or whatever :)|`|mE6a0crwaa	never make someone you priority when they only make you an option...

We had no other theory for the development of the human race except that "God" created us.  It was a mystical and religious concept that explained our existence at that time.    Since the dawn of evolution another set of facts has presented themselves to us and we have the ability to back the theory up with a plethora of evidence to support the theory.  Since Christianity was seriously threatened by science and logic, I surmise that they adapted to the scientific theory with a religious spin to keep control of the populace.     It was all, God's wonderous works.  Which, if you believe, is true.  The creation has to show up somehow and this is just as good as any other answer and better than the one that states the world is only 6000 years old, ala Sarah Palin.     Theory of evolution is significant because it does marry science and religion for the first time.  There are connections between the physicality of the universe and the spiritual and how it operates on a molecular level.  Everything is made of the same stuff, but different vibrations create different substances.  Involution creates evolution. Kind of like nothing changes except change.  At any given point in time we are "evolving" so the word evolution now comes to embrace not only the physical in the world but the spiritual as well.    Many New Thought churches are now teaching spiritual evolution which is basically going back to "christian principles" and actually applying them in the sense that they were given: without judgement fear, hate.  This has created a problem for many Christian churches because they can no longer be judgemental, and exclusive that they are the chosen. So they are going to have to evolve or perish, adapt to the climate and atmosphere of the times.  So they are evolving as well as the species that are affected by climate, habitat or the lack thereof.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	it is if your goal is to see mindless religions expunged from this planet.|`|AA12193600	many individuals are afraid of truth whatever that truth may be.

Most people resist change and when Darwin first proposed his theories, there was resistance until evidence from testing validated various aspects of it. The same has always been true for the physical sciences.    The whole tendency to resist new theories is because charlatans of the past loved to "fool" people into thinking something was true when it wasn't. It was typical, for instance, for someone to come up with a method to turn common metals into gold.    In a way, you see some of this foolery going on in religion, especially those that love to make a big splash and profit from it. Elmer Gantry (the film) deals with this kind of nonsense and we have a lot of skeptics as a result.     Thus, the initial resistance to evolution was because: 1 - the idea was relatively new and 2 - people were accustomed to thinking a certain way about things.    About the same time (1700s and 1800s) religious revivals fed on the population to become today's "creationists" while the mainline church congregations continued to mature and recognize the role science plays in our lives.
LuN1unJ3aa	School teachers (in basic education - K to 12) are always under pressure to teach what is acceptable to the local population, mostly because their employment is controlled by an elected school board.    My response to your question is that it largely depends upon the local population. Larger cities generally do not have a problem, since the population is diverse enough to include people with strong scientific backgrounds and knowledge.    In rural areas, superstitions can be very influential and result in certain aspects of life _not_ being taught for the reason I've cited above (elected school board).    Note: If it weren't for the actions of a school board, the FSM would never have come into existence.|`|AA10024451	Yes, and it should rightfully continue to be under assault.

It cannot stand on the facts, so it must stand by intimidation. A university professor can give students poor grades if they don't give the "right" answers.     You're right: this is a battle. We creationists are winning because we are armed with facts and logic. All evolutionists have is out-dated philosophy, ridicule, and intimidation.    Evolution has little to do with biology. In fact, biology clearly debunks the false idea of evolution. In Darwin's day they had no equipment to look inside a cell. They thought the cell was just a bit of carbon. When they finally cracked one open, they found out how complex the cell is.    Furthermore, mutations and natural selection are very poor mechanisms for change. Do you expect everyone to believe that those two can make the complex world we see?|`|c5X6IOclaa	I hate creationists|`|83Cvwbu1aa	a few mindless illiterate snake handlers hardly constitutes an "assault"|`|5a2eKYynaa	Yeah, creation theory is mostly promoted politically, since it can't stand up as a scientific theory since it's impossible to test.  One of the most common ways of promoting it is 'Let the students decide'. And of course, the kids will usually choose creationism because it's easier to understand and they can learn it quicker. The problem is, school is for learning facts, not choosing what you want to believe. A kid could decide to believe that 2 + 2 = 56, but it doesn't mean that should get them a good math grade. In the same way, creationism should be limited to religious studies, and science should be taught in science class.|`|Z049kuHfaa	Yes  it  is  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  truths  of  the  BIBLE.Yes  the  1611  KJV  teaches  evolution.satan  is  smart  and  has  duped  many  with  not  only  lies  but  also  the  truth.

You know why they need your birthday? so they can look up your horoscope and twist that with their opinion and feed it to you for $2/minute.     Funny thing is, I make my living doing Tarot readings. I never claim to be a psychic because they disgust me. I'm actually what is called claircognizant. It's the type of clairvoyance related to "knowing" things for no reason. Like, people around me say "oh, what's the movie that just popped in my head?" and I actually answer them. Or a boyfriend asked once "guess how many tacos I just ate?" and I told him "7" and went back to sleep. It's weird, especially because I have no control over it.     Look for someone like this to do a real reading for you. They just interpret your own energies, it's like a translator for a language. Someone like me doesn't need your birthday or your full name. It kind of freaks people out sometimes lol, but I do it to just make the few dollars here and there while my husband's out of town, because I do it all the time for myself and my family, and I like helping people.    In case you do want a reading, I do offer a 3-card reading for 99c. I have other stuff as well, depending on what you need. In a situation like this, I'd advise getting a full reading so you can find out about each of these guys, but if you want a simple answer of "which one and when?" that's possible too (and cheaper). If you want me to do your reading, I'm on eBay with this username, or you can email me 'cause i do things cheaper for people I actually talk to.

They know I don't approve of it but they are grown and don't live at home. Not much i can do. My oldest son got emotionally sick from it and had a break down. For me when I was young tried it a few times and it made me feel paranoid and just too high, not a good feeling. I have to say I am so proud of you on this site. And for the one that says he works at a 7-11, thats ok, we gotta work somewhere, jobs are hard to find now. I credit you a big plus for working, a lot of ppl won't work these days.

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	I follow it causally but not to the point of addiction. Some of the secrets are really heart breaking and others makes me nod and think "me too".    My secret? I live with chronic pain. (OK that's not the secret.) And I'm addicted to morphine. (That's the secret.) There are days when I could do with less or no morphine at all but I don't even try since I "need" the feeling it gives me. I've been to N.A meetings but the thought of living in pain without anything to stop it made me stop going. Life is not that bad when I have the morphine and it's legal since I have doctors that prescribe it for me.

You must have also heard of the following: 7 sins, 7 seas, 7 ancient planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), 7 wonders of the world, 7 musical notes, 7 directions, 7 Christian classical virtues (Faith, Hope, Charity, Fortitude, Justice, Prudence, and Temperance) and also 7 deadly sins(Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Anger, Greed, Sloth), 7 Colours of Rainbow, 7 Wonders of the World and and 7 "phere" - the basis of a Hindu marriage.    So, overall one can find number 7 everywhere. It symbolizes the "chosen number of God" and is taken to be Sacred. 7 is also equated with the idea of Perfection and Refinement. So, definitely you can say 7 is one of the luckiest numbers, other lucky numbers being 1, 3 and 9.    Sometimes depending on the birth date, birth year and natal chat lucky numbers are decided for an individual.|`|n3yRcpMRaa	Well I know that in the muslim culture it's lucky and so is 1 but in America they think it's lucky?

Christmas was a simple little Christian holiday that combines the birth of Jesus with the feast of St. Nicholas. Now thanks to Hallmark and Coke a Cola it is all this. Every year low income fathers go out and steal from retail stores so that their kids will get all the items on the letter to Santa. That is not what Christmas is about.  Valentine's is for lovers. Leave it alone. Save your money. Go visit an elderly relative and spend some time with them. A girl giving another girl a Valentine's Day card and a gift? The wrong impression? I don't know, you tell me. If a guy gave me a Valentines card AND a gift, I would wonder. Thanks for the dozen roses, buddy. Yeah, right. Hahahah! LOL!|`|2oN7WrVKaa	It does!  Friends and family are a part of Valentines day always.  :)  Its just a day where you send out appreciation and love in the forms of gifts.  And I wouldn't worry about giving the wrong impression.

They have milky skin, more youthful, and cute. Chinese women seem to look older and more stressed out. I think it has a lot to do with living in a communist country and they struggle with life. So many Chinese women run around the world for better lives. Japanese women really have no reason to leave Japan. In America, Japanese population is decreasing because it's just simply better for them to live in Japan.|`|adL8Qm7yaa	LOL  cuz their skin r whiter and cleaner  their eyes r bigger n cuter.  they're shorter and cuter.  they jst look sooo much more freakin cuter.|`|rHZivjUGaa	That's your opinion.    Who's to say this?|`|FUpGRYHQaa	They look the same, dude...|`|AA11700517	MMM, that's your biased opinion. All women are beautiful, regardless of race! But of course anyone would be beautiful if they have as much plastic surgery as the Japanese women, wear fashionable clothes, dye their hair, wear circle lenses or eye-glue tap or excessive makeup. Most Chinese women don't wear makeup at all. But, I'm sure you do know that a lot of Japanese women has had plastic surgery done on their face. So don't be an idiot and pretend like every Japanese women look better than Chinese because I'm sure you've never been to China and see the 1.3 billion people. It's either that, or you are blind and stupid.

That's your opinion. I personally think that Chinese women GENERALLY look better than Japanese women. Although I do think there are plenty beautiful/hot Japanese women too out there. But hey, it's just a matter of opinion and preference. To each his own.    There are also plenty beautiful Asian women from other ethnicity as well, such as Indian, Filipino, Thai, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Sri Lankan, Middle Easterners/Arabic etc.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	Your statement doesnt make ANY sense at all, and it just shows your IGNORANCE.

To show my respect to my jap friends, I wont post our pictures, otherwise, you would know what I am talking about.      @firestar...  Do you know that after japanese corporations abolished the life time employment policy and the increased of unemployment, many japanese started leaving japan ?

qEdhPD8Laa	These are some of the best websites for advice on psi-feeding.     http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm   http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/   http://www.sanguinarius.org/   http://www.kheperu.org/articles.html   http://vcmb.org/family/    Masticina has a few videos about it on YouTube:     http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...     The Psychic Vampire Codex is good, but you probably won't find it in your local library. There's a free online version, but the newer version in bookstores is better.      http://www.sacred-texts.com/goth/vc/inde...     I think breathing in the energy around you is one of the easier and less obvious methods. This works well for taking in ambient energy, but it can also draw the aura energy of people near you.    Touching someone's major or minor chakra points can transfer energy to you, so can shaking hands or hugging.    Visualization helps to focus and direct psi-feeding. Meditate first, visualize your chakras spinning in turn, feel your own energy within you, make a psi ball between your hands or try to see your aura energy between them as warm-up exercises. Then visualize extending your aura out toward someone you want to feed from, touching their aura with this tendril, and drawing their energy to you.     There are other methods too. Most methods involve either touch, breathing or visualization.    - P.|`|AA12384132	Well since there is no such thing as a psychic vampire, I can assure you that they eat food like everyone else does............

He taught me the basics, and taught me how to start to develop in this area.  I am still getting the hang of it myself, but this is what I can tell you:    It is all about energy exchange, and a person's aura.  You know the people who have boundless amounts of energy, the ones that you think "how on *earth* are they still positive after all that!!??!!".      You can tap into that energy yourself, by learning to read, and absorb the aura.      This is the "feeding" you are talking about.  It is quite easy once you practice, and get used to it.    The first time my friend fed from me, I slept for 12 hours straight! He exhausted me!  It was a beautiful, positive experience, one done out of friendship and mutual affection.  It was an amazing thing.    I hope this is what you are looking for....|`|ddae81176a45fb68a40708536cdf1038aa	I'm not a real Psychic Vampire, but I know several. I am best friends with one whom I have watched go from the 'I don't know what's happening, I seem to be a real ******' stage to reading the Psychic Vampire Codex (can't recommend it enough!) and choosing potential donors and setting up his lifestyle to fit.    So, there's several things you can 'feed' on, 'Ambient Energy' is the stuff that normal humans put into the area when working or feeling intensely, so a good source is concert crowds or intense arguments between people. When you are in the vicinity of Ambient Energy, focus first on your feelings of Psychic Energy Hunger, and then on the area around you. If you are a Psychic Vampire, it's like drinking from a stream, you should be inspired as to what to do. I mean, I could go to a stream, focus on my thirst, and look at the stream, but until I bend down, scoop up some water, suck it into my mouth, and swallow it, my thirst is not going to be assuaged. However, when I'm thirsty and I look at a source of water, I am usually inspired about what I need to do to satisfy my thirst. It is the same with any living being.    I'm told that Ambient Energy isn't usually very satisfying. So another way involves touching people - - - but if you touch people who are low energy or who aren't producing energy you can make them faint as if they were diabetic and were in sugar-shock. Often people who are healing from something are stuck in having 'curdled healing energy' in them that they don't know how to get rid of, in order to get new healing energy and keep on healing. So when a psi-vamp feeds on that, s/he is actually helping them heal.    I hope that helps, but I think you need to read the Codex.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand.   1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible.     2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a bolus called chyme. It then passes into the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.    3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.    4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo.     5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.    6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than ten years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.    7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.    8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive

Jesus had boundaries. He knew what was wrong and right. And he knew all mankind was not going to choose to follow the right path.    There would be consequences to choosing to ignore the Bible's standards. Not only in our present life, but in an ultimate judgment brought on by Jehovah, Jesus' Father. And Jesus will back up this judgment by warfare as is expressed in Revelation chapter 19.    The Bible is correct in saying that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God.    We should never think we are above being mislead. If we do, Satan has the ability to catch us off guard.    No one messed up his teachings. They are as pertinent today as they were then.

I'll go in order:    Mat 10:21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.   (here He is speaking about the Great Tribulation time period when even a cup of cold water given to a christian can mean death.  That is because you have to be marked in order to buy or sell anything, and christians aren't going to be marked)    Mat 10:34-36 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.   Mat 10:35  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.   Mat 10:36  And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.  (This is right, Jesus came and brought division.  You have sometimes one person in a family that believes in Christ, but the other members of their family will either not like it, violently go against it, or something along those lines.  Jesus makes so many claims, you either believe Him or you don't, you can't have a middle ground, He makes you decide.)    Mark 4:11-12  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:   Mar 4:12  That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.   (Here, He was speaking to his disciples saying that he would explain his parables to them, but to everyone else they would have to figure it out.  Later, in the epistles, Paul states how Satan has blinded peoples eyes and hearts to the truth of the Gospel, and Jesus even said how the Holy Spirit will teach you the things of Christ, so that you would need no other teacher.  Unless you are saved by faith through Grace, there are going to be things in the Bible that you won't understand.)    Luke 12:46-47 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.   Luk 12:47  And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.   (This is the end of a parable that Jesus was teaching to show what would happen to a bad steward.  I don't know how to explain these passages except to say that the Lord Jesus will come at a time no one knows, and if you haven't trusted in Him by then you have a portion with the unbelievers, meaning you have to go through the great tribulation period.  And to know the will of the Lord and not heed is a great sin, worthy of many stripes as punishment.)    Hope this helps, try not to pick out a verse here and there, but keep them in the context they are used.  It helps trying to understand a verse if you look at the previous 5 verses and the next 5 verses.  Sometimes that will give you a clue as to its meaning, or who it is addressed to.  You can pick a verse out of the Bible to support almost any ideology, but if you take it out of context, you lose its meaning entirely.

Gods Son also spoke of an evil slave that would not be alert and anxiously watching for his masters arrival. Such an evil slave would say: My master is delaying. Not only would he eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards but he would go further by beating his fellow slaves and opposing their work of providing the spiritual food at the proper time for Gods faithful slaves. This one, in turn, would be punished with the greatest severity and assigned a part with the hypocrites. (Mt 24:45-51; Lu 12:42-46) Jesus went on then to show that one who has greater responsibility and fails to take care of it is more reprehensible than one who does not know or understand his duties so well. Such a ones punishment, the number of strokes, would be proportionate to his responsibility.Lu 12:47,?48.    Some of what Jesus said on that occasion has import for us as Jehovahs Witnesses today. The emphasis of our preaching is on the Kingdom. We perform our ministry free of charge and look for people who are interested in the message or who are worthy of it. Caution is appropriate. Opposers abound. Sometimes relatives, neighbors, or workmates cause severe problems, especially for sincere ones who are beginning to pursue the course of true Christianity. Jesus repeated a warning about such opposition when describing the sign of his presence. (Matthew 24:3, 9,?10; Luke 21:16,?17) He also restated our need to endure to the end in order to be saved. Yes, we need to endure until the end of our present life or until this system of things ends and we can enter the new world.Matthew 24:13.    During one of his preaching tours of Galilee, Jesus indicated that the sacred secret was closely related to his Messianic Kingdom government. He told his disciples: To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens [kingdom of God, Mark 4:11]. (Matthew 13:11) One aspect of that secret involved Jehovahs selecting a little flock of 144,000 humans to be associated with his Son as part of the seed, to reign with him in heaven.Luke 12:32; Revelation 14:1,?4.    http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060715/art...|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	Romans and corinthians are a huge way to learn the teachings of the messiah.

It's the New American Bible that I use. It's complete.    A lot of people say "it's been translated and re translated so many times, how can we know what the original said?"     First, keep in mind that that those who wrote the New Testament were either there, being taught by Jesus, because they were His chosen apostles, or Paul, who was converted shortly after the crucifixion.     Second, ever heard of the Rosetta Stone? And I'm not talking about that language learning program they advertise on TV, either.    The Rosetta Stone had the same thing transcribed in three different languages- two variants of Egyptian hieroglyphs and once in Greek. It allowed archaeologists to translate the hieroglyphs better.     This aid in translation also led us to be able to correctly translate the ancient scripts of the Bible, so we know that it has been translated correctly into English, though it has lost some of the inflections naturally present in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Latin.    In order to find Christ's message, it is important not to look at a few passages but at ALL passages within the four Gospels (the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.) However, since you have asked for a look at these specific passages in how they fit in with the rest of the usual view of Christ, I shall oblige.     Luke 12:46-47 is Christ warning us that we do not know when He will return, and so we must be ready for His return in full glory, and that while we await His return, we must do as He has charged us, including feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, and other good works that help support the dignity of the human person.    Matthew 10:21 is Christ warning us that there will be divisions as false prophets rise up and break factions away from His church, which He established in Matthew 16:17-19    Matthew 10:34-36 is much the same in meaning as 10:21. He is telling us that we must forsake all worldly bonds in favor of following Him. It does not necessarily mean that we must fail to love parents, children, siblings, and spouses. It simply means that we must not love any of them more than we love Him, and if there are any that we love more than Christ, we are not worthy of Him.    Mark 4:11-12 is simply Christ telling us that if we do not understand what He is telling us in one instance, then we will not understand what He is telling us in any other instance, for one mistranslation begets another. This is why He left us an authority in His name, the Pope, a line that began with St. Peter, and established His Church, the Catholic Church, to examine scripture carefully and interpret it truly, fully inspired by the Holy Spirit.     The fact is that God sent His Son to knock some sense into us in order that we might be saved, not necessarily to bring peace.    Remember, one of the marks of the Savior is that He be a military leader, a fighter, and Christ showed this not only in his sermons but in his actions, such as when he berated the Pharisees and when he cleared the temple.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	They line up with Torah.|`|xqOoD4eZaa	I would suggest you go to a bible study, you can ask ANYTHING and your question will be answered

BPykW5OAaa	The bangs will look so cute on her!!?  here is another idea hope you like it      http://kaorublade.files.wordpress.com/20...
VLdc4mrpaa	You may want to considered having the hair cut with a razor. This will give it some texture and make it more angular. Right now, the overall look of your hair is pretty soft/blunt.     I would avoid going too short as you need some length to balance the size of your head. The length now is actually pretty flattering, but you can go a little shorter or longer depending on how you get the hair cut.     Try having some fun with your hair. Go a bit longer in the back, and change the bangs to a more angular side-swept style. You can even spike it up a little like in this photograph of Joe Jonas:    http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l90/me...    Feel free to not focus on being neat with your hair. A bit of a "messy" look is definitely in style, and it gives you more freedom.    http://www.hairfinder.com/haircollection...    http://hairdohairstyles.com/HairStylePic...    http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s189/...    You may want to invest in some styling gel to help hold your hairstyle in place on those days when you decide to go for a more messed-up look. Just blow dry your hair and apply the styling gel and use your fingers to style. On most days, especially if you change the bangs to a more angled side-bang, you should at least consider straightening the bangs or blow drying them straight. For the most part, a razored shag cut is pretty low maintenance.     It will take a little time to "train" the hair to be in the direction you want it to be, especially if it's been in the same style for a while. Blow dryers and straighteners help a lot in the beginning.     You may also want to consider the hair color. The black is a little dark and does not work with your skin tone. Try going a tad lighter, such as a medium to dark brown. You may also want to consider some subtle lighter brown (or even auburn) highlights. I wouldn't go too overboard with the highlights, but some added to the hair will add some dimension and interest.     Also, once a week or every other week, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo. It will help get rid of build up and keep your hair from looking too "greasy".  Don't use the clarifying shampoo too much if you are going to color your hair, and I don't recommend you use anything except color treated shampoo for a month or so after you first color. A little clarifying shampoo will help make your hair look cleaner and healthier.    I'm not sure if you will like any of the pictures, but hopefully, at the very least, they will give you some ideas for your hair and you can use them to find the best hairstyle for you.     Good luck and post pictures of the new hairstyle!

oY4vwdjVaa	What dignifies a real question? I haven't seen a real question in this section in a while.    Whenever people ask "Am I gay/bi/or straight?" I respond with saying : You'll know when the time comes - Concentrate on your school work.  I get maybe about 10 thumbs down. It's not worth it.    Most people who ask 'real' questions are just looking for their opinion from someone else.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	I look at those mainly because even though I know I can't change especially on this sight I think that if they should know that they are being stupid by thinking we are just weak and take sh*t here or in the real world.   ANd I think that we don't answer the real questions often ,or at least I don't, is because many of have the same problems. I mean look at every teen who is on this section I promise has asked "how can I get over my best friend". the questions beome so repetitive that it is hard to answer them sometimes because you end up answering the same thing 100s of times.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	because people want to defend themselves faster than actually answer a serious question.

PZqYN4xsaa	Its just plain ignorance, I am of Dominican descent, and I am proud of my Blackness. The Black features in us Dominicans are too obvious to deny.|`|AA10855383	There was a question like this before, and someone who answered posted an article about how dominicans deny it (read the other ones, too). I always wondered where all theese other terms such as Morena, Color Indio, Indio Claro, Lavao...etc etc came from... And yes i do notice how brazilians are very proud of their african culture and they are very confident about it.       http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/ne...|`|jTkX9HJyaa	Yeah I never heard of this happening either.|`|lJHPiAa5aa	i think its because in alot of south american countries the lighter you are the better..they have a color code in sout america and in the u.s. black men prefer women with long straight hair with light skin with thin noses ppl who are similar in looks to europeans...i know alot of dominicans my grandfather is dominican..and although i've never met him i know the dominicans im cool with don't admit that dominican republic is a mixed race of french and african american only that they're latino...its like they'll graciously accept the body figure they get from the african side but screw everything else..and this is only what i've seen..im not trying to be racist..i have way to many races in my family and i just found out i myself that my great grandman who passed when i was 7 was full blooded native american and i have a absentee grandfather who is domincan and i have french in me so im far from racist just stating what i've seen.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	alot of them are self hating. brazilians are more open about their blackness. well thats nice be proud.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Well the Carribean is basically all black countries.  The only exceptions really are Cuba where the majority are mixed and there are far more whites than blacks.    The difference is this, see jamaicans are black, trindads are black, basically all the major islands in the carribean are black because the spanish brought slaves there by the boat loads.      Dominicans and Haitians are pretty much the same people, I'd say dominicans are a bit more mixed but they are pretty much black people.  The problem some people have with dominicans is that it seems like they go out their way to try to call themselves anything but black.  This is real silly to anyone who knows carribean history.  Basicall the spanish killed off all the indians in the carribean, through war and disease.  So anyone from the carribean is either white or black, or indian(from india brought as slaves as well but make up a small percent).    So when lots of dominicans are syaing they are not black, they might as well just say they are white because there is no other race for them to be really.    @ other poster, yes brazil does have lots of whites, it also has lots of blacks, more so than any country but nigeria.|`|x2yUC47Zaa	No offense to any African Americans, but unfortunately, most dominican people do not like to be classified as black s a way to not bring any more bashing on them. What I mean is for many reasons, by some people dominicans are considered lower-class people, with no etiquette are looked down upon by arrogant people who believe they are just trouble. And just as Dominicans are conidered like that, some black people are too. The thing is, unfortunately, due to the majority of dominicans and blacks who commit crimes, robb, kill, and have bad attitudes, those who are not like that and are dominican and black are treated as being the same way. If minority races were not as such then they could get more self recognition as an individual instead of just another stereotype victim. Why do you think even Jamaicans THEMSELVES, who are black do not want to be associatd with black americans. For some reason from those jamaicans I know, they state that they are a different type of people and they don't want to be associated with them to not have to face the same type of bashing they get. This is the exact same case with Dominicans. Although some Dominicans themselves do have flaws which I notice and I'm dominican. But not all. But history is history and although they are african, they are also spanish from spain because they are mixed.|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	uh i never heard nebody say nethig bad about dominicans|`|Um52yp60aa	yeah i know dominicans and brazilians that are proud of the african roots they have. but hey expecial in brasil, in republica dominicana too.. people are mixed some are darker some are lighter but most part is mixed.|`|tusCN8zpaa	You tell it sister!|`|0UjFOsHkaa	I've never heard of that.

This is why most of them self-hate because they see the connection between themselves and people from Haiti.      I have heard Dominicans call Haitians the "N' word. It's that messed up, really.  Whatever past dealings they have had with Haitians, they have allowed that to carry into their every day lives|`|FUpGRYHQaa	There are more White Brazilians than you think.

Below is a picture of a right trapezoid.          In some dialects of English (e.g. British English), this figure is referred to as a right trapezium. Because of the modifier right, no confusion should arise with this usage.    All rectangles are right trapezoids (unless the restricted definition of trapezoid is used, see the entry on trapezoid for more details). Note also that, in Euclidean geometry, a trapezoid cannot have an odd number of right angles.    A right isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid that is simultaneously a right trapezoid and an isosceles trapezoid. In Euclidean geometry, such trapezoids are automatically rectangles. In hyperbolic geometry, such trapezoids are automatically Saccheri quadrilaterals. Thus, the phrase right isosceles trapezoid occurs rarely.    Right trapezoids are used in the trapezoidal rule and composite trapezoidal rule for estimating Riemann integrals.|`|K91tfiLCaa	This is the wrong section to ask questions about geometry, but feel free to ask as many questions as you like about evolution.

WzY2WhGhaa	Wow finally a high schooler who wants to DO something productive with their life instead of just wanting to join the college binge party-- refreshing!!    I think it's great you want to get involved. If you're interested in community service, I would look into some outreach programs locally that you can see being a part of for a good year or so. This builds valuable experience on your resume, and it helps you gain insight before heading to college. If there's a program that needs people helping with making a documentary for example, that would be a great way to utilize your production interests.     Narrow it down to 3-5 things and look into your area for what programs they have that fits your interests. Remember, it's okay to use trial and error with this-- you're exploring what you want to do.|`|eDykHvX1aa	Speaking of video production, maybe you can get an internship at some sort of television/producing company, or volunteer in a foreign country.

I've learned that some of these women just want attention, and think that they can get away with whatever they want to wear.

If I decide to wear low cut, then it is for the guys to look, but only look!  And if a guy is really to obvious about it, I have been known to ask if he likes what he sees ..... 80 to 90% of the guys will tone it down at that point.  lol  and if he doesn't I can get a little rudder and offer him a picture .... and then the laughter turns me into a fun women with boobs rather than just boobs.    lol  Just laugh at it!
AA10064810	You can go to him and say that you are sensitive to cologne and ask if he could wear less or ask your supervisor to bring it up.  Of course, this will embarrass him.  Try doing it as you are leaving work so he doesn't have to sit there all day thinking about it and can do something about it before work the next day.      Both of us are sensitive to perfumes - very - and have had to tell workmen about it; luckily they were there just for one short job like checking the furnace and we could stand away from them; but we brought it up (were embarrassed to do it) because it really was hard on our sinuses.

What are your company rules on this?  Do you have a supervisor you can ask and inform of this situation? How about personnel?  I know the pizza chain I work for has such a policy.    If there is no such policy, maybe one should be developed.    But the "grounds" on which you can argue a case against the excessive "stink" is that it is very distracting to you, and whomever he is around (within a 100 yards, for crying out loud... no, not quite that far, but far enough).  Due to the distracting nature of his smell, you cannot get your work done properly.  As LONG as you approach the argument from this angle... that it INTERFERES with the performance of your (and others) work, THAT is what will pique the attention of your superiors and get them to DO something about it. GOOD LUCK!      Have a polite day.

I do agree that gays are suffering more than blacks and other minorities at this point in time though. The law protects black rights but in most states it does not protect gay rights. A black person has the right to get married. A black person can not be kicked out of their apartment because of their color but a gay person can be kicked out because of their sexuality. (I am being serious!) If a Black person's wife/husband is in the hospital and it is family only... their spouse can see them. If it is a gay person, they have no legal right to be able to see their loved one because gay marriage is not legal. A gay partner can not make funeral arrangements for their loved one as they do not consider them "next of kin".  Gay people are very discriminated against. Black jokes are typically thought to be very inappropriate at this point in time but gay and lesbian jokes abound.     As for the Nazi thing... uhh... there were a lot of gays who were executed then as well. I am not sure why anyone should just lay down and accept their own death. It's human nature to fight for life.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well your friend is wrong,be careful who you meet over the Internet you never know what they might be like misery loves company,I read of some stories of people getting killed by people that they have met over the Internet, just read this for your own safety    Meeting people from the online world can be a positive experience for those who have trouble meeting people in everyday life. When the big day comes to meet the person face to face, however, a lot of stress can build up and for good reason. Though you may talk to a person online everyday, that person is still a stranger. Fear can take over with this thought, but there are ways to meet people from the online world in a safe manner. Here are some tips.    Talk to the person for at least a few weeks before deciding to meet them. Get to know who they are as a person and become comfortable with them. If a person becomes pushy with wanting to meet you, take this as a warning side. A new friend will be understanding and patient if they really want to get to know you.   Step2Always decide to meet at a public location filled with lots of people. A mall or restaurant would be good examples. Having other people around will allow you to feel more at ease in the public eye.   Step3Always tell other people close to you that you will be meeting someone from online. Tell them all the details of your location and the person you will be meeting.   Step4If possible bring a friend along with you. You will feel more at ease with someone you know nearby and if the person you're meeting is by chance a predator, they will be less likely to attack.   Step5Never go anywhere secluded with a person you just met!!!! If they're trying to make you go somewhere alone, this is a bad sign. Leave.   Step6If in the future you feel threatened by this person, get help and notify the proper authorities! Sometimes a person isn't always who they say they are and if by chance you feel harassed you should always tell the police. You could not only save yourself, but others from future abuse.   Tips & Warnings  The online world is the great unknown, but there are quite a few good benefits to meeting people online. Know that they are not all scary and that good people can enter your lives from this angle.     Also know that with the good there are also bad people.     Put your safety above everything else, even if you feel it is unnecessary.      CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Authorities said Tuesday they are considering hate crime charges in the case of a woman who was tortured while being held captive for at least a week, and they are investigating the possibility that she was lured by a man she met on the Internet.    The victim was repeatedly called a racial slur while her captors sexually abused, beat and stabbed her, her mother said.    Six people, all white, including a mother and son and a mother and daughter, were arrested in connection with the alleged abduction of the 20-year-old black woman.|`|B2vFQLU0aa	yes that is def. not true everone has flaws everyone messes up believe me s called being human !!!    ask him if he evered lied or stole or cussed ! everyone has so thats a flaw!!!!!!!!!|`|a3OCK2iraa	Everyone has flaws.

But looking at some of the answers above me, I wanna ask back: is THICK the same as CURVY? Because if I read some of the response saying that "thick" is having defined hips and perfect buttocks and boobs, such as Beyonce.... well to me, that's the definition of "curvy".    Is THICK the same as CURVY? Because I always though that both terms have different meaning. I always thought that THICK is the same as FAT. Correct me if I'm wrong!|`|YSr8dm5faa	I consider a woman who appears a little bit chubby due to more muscle mass, to be thick.    and    I consider a woman who appears overweight and has a great excess of flabby skin and too many camel toes, to be fat.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	To my own defination, thick is big, such as big bones, high muscles density, and the overall body is big but may not have a lot of fat, and they maybe born with it and may not be easily to reduce the size.    Whereas, fat may not be born with it and maybe caused of unhealthy diet or over-eating, less exercises and doesnt walk or work freely. They have more fat than muscles and may not necessarily have big bones, and can reduce their size or to lose weight if they correct their eating habits.|`|Um52yp60aa	thick is nice! fat is nasty|`|eAuKwHBmaa	About 5 pounds|`|BffKmRoYaa	As a white guy, I'd say not much.

sYuTNoEJaa	Reading God's Word to us could never be a waste of time....I pray he gives you discernment.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Actually, debating most people about their religious beliefs is a waste of time, since you're basically asking them to accept the fact that they're going to die.    And they typically jump from subject to subject, never admitting they're wrong about anything.    There's so much real stuff to learn...    You could read the bible - but you won't understand how anybody believes any of that stuff anyway.    There's a bit where god send bears to maul 42 children.    I am not kidding.|`|5e66f381627bd428c703e558425a21ceaa	well spiritual is different then religious in the judeo-christian sense.     because i am very spiritual, and all the passages in the bible wouldnt help you to debate me.     i totally recommend you read the bible even as a book of stories. there are some evil people in the world. the bible can arm you with the wisdom to identify them and disarm them.    i am a femenist. and i dont agree with everything in the bible. but i love it! jesus is an ascended master, he knows.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Very good idea. That's how debate works; you need to know both sides and anticipate the opposing arguments.|`|tLea54g0aa	Yes.|`|Gp160xHOaa	I think that if you are going to debate about something spiritual then yes you should know something of the bible.Even when it isn't about something pertaining to the bible you should know what it is you are going against.|`|TwfyliKiaa	most people don't even read the Bible. So you don't need to even read much to know more then most Christians. It's so sad to me cause   I know the truth ,Jesus is real, hate that I gave you bullets against em! But you may change your mind?|`|R4RsQxJEaa	Be careful if you start reading the Bible you just may end up a changed person.|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	Yeah because you can actually understand where they're coming out and how to explain to them why their wrong better. If you have no idea what you're going against.... You can understand their point of view and yours will will help in speach and debate.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	IMHO, it sounds clever but it misses the  point.    If you want the best ammunition to use against idiots who read  the Bible, check out Jesus' many encounters with religious leaders of his age called "Pharisees."    Many of today's "religious right" are no better than those same Pharisees -- obsessing on the letter of the law when -- by replacing love with catty vindictiveness -- they have lost the HEART of the law.    The trouble with idiots reading the Bible is that they give the rest of  us a bad name -- and scare away a lot of people who need God's love the most.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Yes, which is why I try not to debate the bible per se.    But since they want to legislate the way I live, I don't permit them to debate my secular stance unless they speak on my level.    IOW, the burden of proof is on them, not me.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	Not necessarily 'more' but 'a comparable amount', certainly.  And it's worth studying the Bible to learn about cultures too.  Do the Quran next.|`|AA10556726	In most situations, I'd agree.  In the case of religion, it's not a bad idea but it does not really help.  Most believers believe what their group is taught, they rarely, if ever, read the Bible from an objective viewpoint.  For example, there is no scripture that commands people to pray in public or advocates prayer as anything other than a personal communion with God, and yet many try to use prayer as a sermon or as a way of forcing religion in schools or as a witnessing mechanism.    Even if you do understand what the Bible says from a Christian standpoint, believers will claim that you are taking it out of context or that you are not "lead by the spirit" therefore you do not understand it.|`|JLNoIXkuaa	You need to read the bible (especially everything our Lord said and the book of proverbs) if you want to be able to debate with a spiritual person.    To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory for ever and ever. Jesus Christ is Lord.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	The more you know, the higher your level of education.    Don't let anyone tell you that it is a waste of time.    The Bible reads and teaches on 3 educational levels.  1 - Highly skilled - technical  2 - average reader  3 - grade school level    Yes even young children can read and understand it.  (when there is no one clouding their judgment/discernment)    Don't jump into it thinking that you will finnish it in a couple of days.  You will miss most of the content.  Instead, take it easy. Read a few chapters, put it down, rest a moment and try to realize what the chapters were talking about.  You will be amazed at what you will find.|`|H23SiRRwaa	It doesn't pay to argue with a Christian ,they've been brainwashed not to listen to logic.|`|bUHn1Pu0aa	I think you ;have answered your own question.  You are obviouly not a stupid person.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	First decide what you mean by religious and spiritual.  They can be at opposite ends of a continuum.  If religious people are bigoted or intolerant, then they are not spiritual.  So yes, read, read, read to improve your knowledge, but remember that the Bible is not the only book to study.  As some other answers point out, there are some very wicked (not spiritual) parts to the Bible.  Leviticus has some dreadful things in it that we are hopefully too compassionate to sanction today.|`|RT05lfKqaa	Yes.  Also read the parts they didn't bother reading.  And discover the books that the church has hidden away for years that were also found with the bible.    The bible is incomplete.  What is in it is there by vote and there is a tremendous amount of material left out.  Example - reincarnation was part of the  Scriptures from the King James Version of the Bible which hint at Reincarnation. Reincarnation was taught in the Roman Catholic Church until 553 A.D. when it was voted out (3-2) at the Council of Constantinople.    Find the history - read also the Nag Hammadi it is a great reference to what is missing.   And the story then makes so much more sense.|`|597c2cb57b5dd60ca91e8fdd1a7325c6aa	Asking questions is always good. But why argue about something you know only from what others tell you about? Keep asking questions and do your research from the information so you can sharpen your mind (not debate) spiritually.|`|3ViTBLovaa	Yes it is a very good idea because you'll understand where they are coming from, and they will see that your not a christian just because you haven't read the bible or because you don't know anything. Also if it's one of the less dedicated Christians you'll make them feel like an idiot and they'll stop debating with you, ensuring your victory. However the one thing about religion is that you don't have to back it up with facts. And even if you know very little, all that matters is that you believe in that very little you know. Because it's based on faith, not thought. So the only way to win a debate or to convince religious people that your opinion is worthwhile is to appeal to their hearts and their minds. Not just their minds. Reading their texts, and learning what they believe and why will help you form a better perspective and give you a better foundation for your argument. Besides the bible is filled with a lot of wisdom that you can apply to your life without believing in Christianity, so no matter what you'll end up learning a thing or two.|`|jq85LU0gaa	Its ok to read the Bible even if your a non believer I  own a Bible  and I'm not of that faith.|`|8da82103fe0f8016ae2e59b5de8eb5ecaa	Absolutely,  I suggest, maybe even going as indepth as researching the documents the Bible was translated from in its original lanuages.  Even look at what the Bible says about itself, instead of what everyone else has to say about it.  You sure do never know what you will find until you look.  The more evidence to view the better to see how to handle matters, definately.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	I am a Christian scientist and I agree.

Sams Wholesale club and all wal-marts throw tens of millions of pounds of food away each year.     Example: I went to Sams to returna shirt. While I was there a woman returned an entire cart load of groceries for an inaudible reason. The food consisted of canned fruits and veggies, soups and chili. She also had fresh fruits and veggies and cereal,rice, canned cokes, cake mixes and much more. I asked the clerk why she returned it and she said she believed it was soley to get a refund because the old man that was with her had originally bought it. She said it happens all the time.     I then saw cart loads of food behind her. I asked her what they were going to do with all that food and she said it goes into the dump behind the store.     I asked her if I could take it to the mission house and she said no and that it would do no good to talk to the manager because people had tried for years to stop the waist but wal-mart comes back with the fact that they are not willing to get sued in case something bad happens.

I f you look at Veterans, they have also basically been stepped on. Their VA benefits are slowing coming to a halt.

They were popular wear during the anti-Viet Nam war; however, wearing someone's jacket with their patches is something that will have to be answered by someone from the service.

9ZQnd2rmaa	First,about the English--they are not,as many believe, all Anglo-saxon (germanic). Dna studies have shown that the vast majority also have celtic/pre-celtic descent; in fact in some places in the west, this is far more common both maternally and paternally. The Vikings also gave a fair bit to the gene pool in certain areas.    The stereotype is lanky and fair (blonde to light brown hair) and blue eyed with a slightly longish face and nose. However, up to 50% of the English are actually brown or hazel eyed and dark hair is not uncommon-again more from the south-west into the far west (Cornwall) which has a very 'aboriginal' phenotype (similar to the Welsh.)     Interestingly,the Romans described the English natives as lanky and fair 'they look like the Gauls'. This in interesting because that appearance (which people have considered to be germanic or Nordic) was obviously strong in the population CENTURIES before any Anglo-saxons or vikings ever set foot there|`|U6jZnE34aa	bad teeth and pasty skin.|`|s7qckOHbaa	austin powers|`|UIhbK2xOaa	This is what comes to my mind, but obviously there are lots of exceptions: tall, big boned, slightly overweight, pale, round face, sandy light brown hair, large, droopy, blue grey eyes, a medium sized nose that is rounded at the tip, and thin lips.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I highly doubt that there is a typical looking English person.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	The English have germanic roots and features, but the most profound feature of the English is the nose, I agree.

British" not "british Passed down"  If you can make that distinction, than this could solve a lot of problems in the world, because the truth is, you cannot go around saying, "Nose, therefore, British!" It is just not fair.    There are no "general classic looks to most ethnicities"  Some looks are more common in some ethnicities, but are not "classic"  MANY MANY MANY people, for example have "jewish" noses who are NOT jewish.

AA11440601	We think that Jesus meant the moral Law but not the ceremonial parts of the Mosaic Law concerning of dietary purity, temple worship and sacrifices.    Matthew 19:17-78 states:    Now someone approached him and said, "Teacher, what good must I do to gain eternal life?"     He answered him, "Why do you ask me about the good? There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."     For Christians, Jesus fulfilled the Law of Moses.    Christians are not held to the ceremonial parts of the Mosaic Law concerning of dietary purity, temple worship and sacrifices.    Christians are held to the moral law of God, some of which is expressed in the Ten Commandments.    However Jesus took the Ten Commandments to the next step summarizing them into the two Great Commandments:  ? You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.  ? You shall love your neighbor as yourself.    And teaching things like  ? Everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  ? Everyone is our neighbor including our enemies.    Therefore we have to go much farther than the original recipients of the Ten Commandments ever dreamed.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, part 3, section 2: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...

But it is our desire to follow the law to the best of our ability.|`|a8kAassWaa	In Matthews record of what is commonly called The Sermon on the Mount, these words of Jesus are recorded: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished" (Matthew 5:17-18).    It is frequently argued that if Jesus did not abolish the law, then it must still be binding. Accordingly, such components as the Sabbath day requirement must be operative still, along with perhaps numerous other elements of the Mosaic Law. This assumption is grounded upon a misunderstanding of the words and intent of this passage. Christ did not here suggest that the binding nature of the law of Moses would remain forever in effect. Such a view would contradict everything we learn from the balance of the New Testament record (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23-25; Ephesians 2:15). Consider the following points.    Of special significance in this study is the word rendered abolish. It translates the Greek term kataluo, literally meaning to loose down. The word is found seventeen times in the New Testament. It is used, for example, of the destruction of the Jewish temple by the Romans (Matthew 26:61; 27:40; Acts 6:14), and of the dissolving of the human body at death (2 Corinthians 5:1). The term can carry the extended meaning of to overthrow, i.e., to render vain, deprive of success. In classical Greek, it was used in connection with institutions, laws, etc., to convey the idea of to invalidate.    It is especially important to note how the word is used in Matthew 5:17. In this context, abolish is set in opposition to fulfill. Christ came ...not to abolish, but to fulfill. The meaning is this. Jesus did not come to this earth for the purpose of acting as an opponent of the law. His goal was not to prevent its fulfillment. Rather, he revered it, loved it, obeyed it, and brought it to fruition. He fulfilled the laws prophetic utterances regarding Himself (Luke 24:44). Christ fulfilled the demands of the Mosaic law which called for perfect obedience, or else imposed a curse (see Galatians 3:10,13). In this sense, the laws divine design will ever have an abiding effect. It will always accomplish the purpose for which it was given.    If, however, the law of Moses bears the same relationship to men today, in terms of its binding status, as it did before Christ came, then it was not fulfilled, and Jesus failed at what He came to do. On the other hand, if the Lord did accomplish what He came to accomplish, then the law was fulfilled, and it is not a binding legal institution today. Further, if the law of Moses was not fulfilled by Christ, and thus remains as a binding legal system for today, then it is not just partially binding. Rather, it is a totally compelling system. Jesus plainly said that not one jot or tittle (representative of the smallest markings of the Hebrew script) would pass away until all was fulfilled. Consequently, nothing of the law was to fail until it had completely accomplished its purpose. Jesus fulfilled the law. Jesus fulfilled all of the law. We cannot say that Jesus fulfilled the sacrificial system, but did not fulfill the other aspects of the law. Jesus either fulfilled all of the law, or none of it. What Jesus' death means for the sacrificial system, it also means for the other aspects of the law.|`|Gp160xHOaa	Following the old testament law,meaning the  commandments?

Fear is the main focus it uses, it's effective yet fear leads to rebellion that is why we have so many branches of christianity.

R2MsEyDOaa	Moral justification for an afterlife of eternal suffering - a tool to have people behave in a way acceptable to society.    I think 'eternal suffering for non-belief' is a dark ages concept but I do believe in good and evil personalities and behaviours and I do believe that something bigger than we are put us here. And I think that bigger something gave us a brain to figure things out for ourselves. A lot of people, it seems, do not use the brain they were given. Heaven and Hell are right here and we all spend moments, weeks or years in one or the other.    If you do not believe in heaven, then why would you believe in hell? And if you do believe in hell, then what do you believe is your other option? I have a hard time believing in Christianity myself, but then heaven and hell are not restricted to Christianity. As for heaven and hell, believing in one and not the other is even harder to grasp, especially if the one you believe in is the one generally perceived as a negative.(Your question hints at belief in hell - at least it does as I read it) It must be a very gruesome life to go through if one only believes in the negative. In any case, the definitive word in your question is "believe". In the end, it does not matter what any religion believes, if you do not believe it too.    Not believing in a religious doctrine still does not give anyone the right to be evil as defined by the society you live in and if society can, they will see to it that you are punished for breaking their rules here and now, regardless of their religious beliefs.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	The Idea was that people get judged when they die and if your good you go to heaven, bad you go to hell, right? Well, since genesis God has been trying to make people want to be good and we just don't get it. Everyone was sinning and all humans were evil. God came to earth in the form of Jesus and was the first in a long long time to be good. He was tortured and killed for it. Jesus (/God) Loved man so much that he was willing to be tortured for us to show us the way. Now, if you let him into your heart, he becomes part of you. When you are judged God looks at you and sees Jesus.    Technically you can get to heaven without him if you live a pure life, but no one has done that since Noah.     Here are your options:    Be pure (impossible) > No Jesus > Heaven  Be Evil > Have Jesus > Heaven  Be Evil > No Jesus > Hell    Its your choice, be judged as yourself or be judged as Jesus.|`|TwfyliKiaa	you rejected Jesus.

"Did God really say.....?"    Adam and Eve died because they did not believe.  Death, that 'thing' we see all around us everyday, is Exhibit A, B, C, D,....X, Y, and Z in the case of 'Did God mean what He said?'  Death proves again and again and again that the soul that sins must die.    You see, it does not say the soul that does not believe will go to hell.  It says the soul that sins will die.  The kicker is that not believing is sinning.  So the soul that does not believe will die.  And dieing is separation (that's why you feel the heartache that you do at a funerals...the heartache of separation).  So dieing is separation and separation from God is hell.    You could easily say that it would not be moral for God to punish eternally except for one thing....God provided a way...and it cost Him His only Son.  And we're left with simply this...we believe He did provide a way for us to be saved or we believe He did not.    If we believe He did, no sin is held against us.  If we believe He didn't, well then look to Exhibit A for proof of what happens.    'Zombie', by the way, is a trancelike corpse....basically, Exhibit A.    I sure hope you don't get fooled by the oldest question in The Book.    iamnotbut...I know I AM.
cECRv4NMaa	I am not sure what the time limit between is (if any), but it is definitely possible. They call it renewing your vows in the church. We are doing it on our 25th aniv.

However, I have several friends who had civil marriages who later got married in the Catholic Church.

Their initial wedding vows had been taken outside of the Church, and were not considered religiously valid.|`|mSFjbetxaa	If your Catholic and not divorced you can.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	Yes it is possible to get married.

Theologically speaking, a justice of the peace is not authorized to preside over the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony. Therefore, couples who are legally joined together by a justice of the peace are unmarried as far as the Church is concerned.      >    Sort of. Like I said, a justice of the peace is not authorized to preside over the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony. So being joined by a justice of the peace does not constitute marriage.  Therefore, the Church will most certainly want couples joined together by justices of the peace  to receive the real Sacrament of Holy Matrimony.      The thing is - if you plan on getting married in the Church, it makes no sense to bother with the justice at all?      >    The Church does not recognize a union by justice of the peace as a valid marriage. Therefore, the Church frowns on couples who seek union via legal means only.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Yes, it certainly is possible. I'm not sure how you could be Catholic and not know that matrimony is one of the Sacraments, but probably your parents failed to make sure you were properly educated.    Anyway, make an appointment with your priest, explain the problem and ask what the next steps are. You and your spouse will require a little education, I assume, and then you can have your marriage convalidated (sometimes called "blessed").

See the picture here? You can't afford to fix your car, you can't get to work, you lose your job.  Having money would alleviate those problems but of course there would be other problems.

758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	It is a great shame that the BBC gives him so much air time for promoting his religious (atheistic) views, which he passes off as scientific.    A major flaw in his reasoning is his straw-man argument that Christians are supposed to believe that God created all species as we see them today.  This was a common belief in Darwin's day, and Darwin was right to dispel this false idea. Where Attenborough and Darwin go wrong is in thinking all life is related.    God created the basic kinds, and there has been a good deal of selection and variation within those kinds.    Attenborough is quite happy to falsely promote the straw man view, and he is quite happy to promote the idea that natural selection equates to evolution, when based on observation it does not.  I suspect he has a pretty good idea what he is doing, and therefore I think hs probably can well be described as a deceiver.|`|5ljN0M2Caa	God created everything.

The whole point of what he was saying was that some people exclaim the greatness of their god by talking about the beauty in the world. What he was trying to say was that there is just as much ugliness and misery that the gods are hypothetically equally responsible for. D'uh.    Also the very fact that it is called river blindness is a clue as to its most common life cycle, though not exclusively so, but it does cause blindness. Just as Toxacara causes the blindness of over 80 million world wide each year. He could have chosen anyone of the numerous life threatening and crippling parasites and diseases as an example.

Taenia solium causes 50,000 deaths each year, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), malaria etc.    So his point is valid, even if the example he gave was partially inaccurate.  I think the point he was making was that the worm does this with no malice, it has been created (if that's your belief system) in a way that may cause serious harm to someone infected for no good reason.  A benevolent creator, in his view, would not do that.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Answers in genesis - I forgot how hilarious that site was, thanks for reminding me!

I think Attenborough simply used a cheap example to try to suggest God was not "Loving" if he allowed a parasite to live in an eye.    While I like most of his nature documentaries, I feel he simply hasn't given any lengthy consideration to the possibility of a God. Using such a simple claim about a parasite that can live in an eye is an obviously shallow way to draw conclusions of such topics.    I think you have proved a great point, and shown that was a terrible example he used.

Besides that, I am at a loss to see what you gain by discreditting so great a man by such nit-picking.  Do you think that this somehow proves that evolution is wrong, or that it is ok to send hate-mail, or even that God is real?        EDIT:  But, as I say in the first paragraph, there is nothing to correct - you are nit-picking.  The infestation of the eye IS necessary under heavy infestation, as you yourself make clear.    Besides that, the man (who IS great - theology aside, his documentary presentation and writing are second to none in any field) is merely presenting his own reasons for not believing in a 'loving' God.  He is not particularly encouraging others not to believe, and even if he did, that is absolutely his right - he is not being forceful nor even coercive.|`|DphUE9tbaa	I don't know the name or lifecycle of every parasitic worm in the world, but I would say that the principle of Sir David's argument remains the same and is unaswerable.

In most societies throughout the world, siblings usually grow up together and spend a good deal of their childhood with each other.

AA11085356	First off, is your relationship legal?    Second, you have only been together for 3 months. I wouldn't go all out and spend $80 per plate at dinner. I think a casual restaurant will be fine. And I wouldn't buy an expensive gift either, if you wanted to get her something. Some flowers, a card, and maybe a CD that she has been wanting.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	Whew! Glad you took the time to give some more details, like her age?   When I first read your question I thought to myself "three months? now that is really robbing the cradle!" I figured it had to be a typo, or I misread it!   Well what to do? What to do eh?   Romance is a prickly thing with girls and we boys do have a hard time making sure they're well taken care of in that arena but we do have a tendency to muck it up on the wee hearts we love. I can't say what would be best with your girl but I can give some advice.  Do not buy her roses for flowers. Too many of them are the cheap ones and they die off real fast. The roses that do not die off real fast and carry a strong scent cost an arm and a leg. Unless you are willing to put out a lot for just one "good" rose, as opposed to a dozen cheap roses.   We older men tend to spend our money on bouquets of Carnations, they last for weeks and the memories are with the date for as long as they see them. It keeps you and the memories in front of them longer than (a lot longer) a dozen cheap roses. And they are beautiful flowers as well so you gain good points in a number of ways in the girls heart and memory.   As for dinner it would be nice to take her to a quality Chinese restaurant because the food is always tasty and order something you've never had. Chinese food is always a winner with dates in the beginning. Afterwards take in a movie "She" wants to see. Always, always, always when you take a girl out to a movie? You let her decide what movie to see. I don't care if you hate the freaking actress, the actor and the movie! If that is what she wants to see? Then take her there! And bite your tongue throughout the whole movie whether you like it or not. Hopefully and useually the dates always pick a "chick flick" we boys can handle. So that shouldn't be a problem.  The night is for her, make sure you have reservations at the restaurant and a back up for the movies if either she doesn't want to go to the movies or the movies are sold out. It happens at valentines, movies are inundated with the same dates taking the girls out for a romantic evening.   All the best to you on your date.  EDIT: A lot of the people are going on about the age of the girl and the legalities, unless the sex life is engaged don't worry about it because it seems they have left that out. The age of consent to a sexual encounter is sixteen or thereabouts, dating is not a sexual encounter.  A four years difference isn't all that much with a young couple.|`|VELnLnIKaa	hotel room lol|`|wqchA8B7aa	Take her to a nice restaraunt, but not too fancy that it would make her uncomfortable (and not laid back like TGI Fridays).|`|zhk8o514aa	200 dollars can come a lonnnnng way if you spend it wisly.  Have you been listening to her hints?  Odds are, she has been giving you them now and then.  "Ohh isn't this pretty" "I love the smell of this perfume" " I miss Mexican food"  " I just want to get away from all these people"    Women love to give these stubble hints, and its up to us to interpret them!    So sit back and think deep.  How can you make your valentines really special? Where did you two first meet? What special moment have you had together and how can you bring that to valentines day?  What can you do to totally surprise her and yet swoon her heart ?     I can't tell you what to do on valentines day,  every woman is different. ...Your mind and your heart can make this valentines a really special day.      Good luck.    P.s no extension cord as a gift..please|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I would take her to a restaurant somewhere between TGI Fridays and  a really really expensive restaurant.  A nicer, quieter restaurant would be good but you don't need white glove service or a menu without prices.  $200 should be more than enough for dinner and a bouquet of flowers would be a very nice touch.  Forget the roses though. They are so overpriced at Valentines.  A nice mixed bouquet can be picked up reasonably cheaply.  Grocery stores actually  have nice mixed bouquets.    And BTW, your relationship is not illegal in Canada.  As far as I know the age of consent ranges from 14 to 16 in most jurisdictions outside Canada and it varies from state to state in the US (with the most common age being 16).    Good luck! :)|`|JBLcMQ9haa	Do you know that you being with her is ILLEGAL!?!?!|`|YcwHV9qVaa	tgi fridays is good then buy some flowers she doesnt care|`|79uzTFl7aa	16 - 20?

Three months isn't that long, so I think that you should go to TGI Fridays, get her a nice meal, and spend some time with her after dinner. You should also get her some flowers and cute little stuff, but don't go too crazy.|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	200 pound is more than enough for a 16 year old girl and if you been going with her for 3 months now i would take her to the city especially since your asking this question means you were thinking about it and i presume you want to.

BUT dont take her to the mall. its very crowded.  if you arent very creative, then a simple dinner that has good food, and isnt too expensive.    i think 200 dollars should be enough.'    it doesnt really matter where you take her, as long as you are both comfortable and talk to her.    maybe during dinner, surprise her with a little gift .      ;D i really hope that helps|`|qaD1jAQYaa	Three months isn't that long, and if she isn't used to being able to spent that much money, she might feel a bit awkward if you take her to a very expensive restaurant.

dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	I guess it would depend on what role you want the God parents to play in your children's life. If you want them to direct them in a spiritual way or help them to grow in your religion then it wouldn't hurt for them to be baptized.  But if you were just thinking about naming these people as guardians for your children in the event that something happens to you and your husband, then no it's not necessary.  In this case though, you need to have this stated in your will.  Or your children will be given to a family member.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	"Godparents" serve three functions:  In religion, they are responsible for the religious upbringing of the child if the parents die. In such a case, you;d want people who echo your beliefs, whatever they are. Jewish parents choose Jewish godparents. Catholic ones would probably require baptized godparents, who would adhere to the same faith. Etc. Etc.    Aside from religion, there is legal guardianship, where you designate someone to be your children's guardian in the event of your death. That requires a legal document, but does not require anything else.    Finally, some people just want to extend their family for the sake of their children by designating friends as "godparents"--with or without the "god" part. some just refer to close friends as "auntie" and "uncle" so the child feels some closer connection.    No one can tell you what to do.    Do what your heart and mind tell you is right for your family.    EDIT: I just re-read the question and realized you were talking about whether the CHILD should be baptized, not the godparents.  This is even simpler: if you do not believe in baptism, then the answer is "NO." If you were Jewish, I'd say the same thing about ritual circumcision.    Why be hypocritical and perform a religious rite that you do not believe in? You might just as well call in a shaman to shake a dead chicken in your child's face. (Of course, if you DO believe in that, then by all means, do it!)    Choose godparents who believe as you do.|`|URO3gDXcaa	no.  my god kids are jewish.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	Baptism must ONLY be done to someone who knows and understands what the event represents (10 years old or more and mature) . . . babies do not.

RoFTfke3aa	well your the first I've helped allot of people but not anyone with this much detail put in.  And you said that your 13...  in my experiences I think your to young to have you first shift, yes your werewolf alter may be ready but your alter still has to wait on you to be ready.  I kinda went through the same thing, first try not to get to angry, second if you feel the change coming then lock your self in a room with a clear view of the sky.  You first shift will most likely be on a full moon.  It's rare but not uncommon to have a first shift out side a full moon.  And when you do shift make sure you have some type of meat that you can eat when you shift, or you might do what I did.  I ate my neighbors cat.  but any way  just stay calm and for the love of  christ don't do any thing stupid.|`|AA10810835	Take laxatives xD.

So my advice is look for a master massager, one of those 'pressure point chi' folks, they'll redistribute your body energies and whatnot and you'll feel better.  Along with that you might have some inhibitions, human self fighting your wolf self, human wants to stay human wolf wants to be free, for that I suggest taking a look into the occult community for ways to bypass that.    For the letters..well..if they slip a note in your locker then you just have to keep watch if you want to find out who they are, if they break in leave a note and lock it back up for you simply leave a reply where they left theirs--I doubt it's the case but thought I'd put all my ideas up.|`|Su0LaNhoaa	go see a therapist sweetie...you need to talk to someone|`|ABAcvFVbaa	too much twilight honey now u think ur jacob black|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	Dammit the Twilighters have moved from vampires to lycans.

The realm of Japanese animation is based on escapism and the to be other than normal begin answered.      Anyway, I spent 8 years in a cave in China learning this secret.  I will get in trouble for telling you these sacred truths, but it is now time for them to be released to a new generation.     Although it is subtly different for each individual, in order to release your inner wolf you must first imagine how physically strong you can be.  This begins to heat your blood and cause separation of the animal cells from human cells.  If you do not feel it immediately, it is normal to do some push-ups or another aggressive exercise at this time to get blood in the muscles and the heart pumping the wolf cells more rapidly throughout your body.  Then you must look at yourself in the mirror concentrating on the transformation, and again on the power aching to explode inside you.  Often at this stage it is required that you give a deep and primal yell as you break something to create a separation in time of before and after. This should never be something living or unnecessarily destructive, but it could be something close to you like your cell, furniture or ipod.  Once it is done you should do more push ups before picking up the broken object and recollecting how it was sacrificed to release the enemy/gift of the werewolf that resides darkly in your blood.

Iqp3ZUAlaa	Which Queen Elizabeth? There are two in the UK who were/are  the reigning monarch.  http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page46.as... has a history section for Queen Elizabeth I,and a Royal Family biography about the current queen.  Here's what is says about Elizabeth I:  "Her 45-year reign is generally considered one of the most glorious in English history. During it a secure Church of England was established. Its doctrines were laid down in the 39 Articles of 1563, a compromise between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.     Elizabeth herself refused to 'make windows into men's souls ... there is only one Jesus Christ and all the rest is a dispute over trifles'; she asked for outward uniformity.     Most of her subjects accepted the compromise as the basis of their faith, and her church settlement probably saved England from religious wars like those which France suffered in the second half of the 16th century.     Although autocratic and capricious, Elizabeth had astute political judgement and chose her ministers well; these included Burghley (Secretary of State), Hatton (Lord Chancellor) and Walsingham (in charge of intelligence and also a Secretary of State).     Overall, Elizabeth's administration consisted of some 600 officials administering the great offices of state, and a similar number dealing with the Crown lands (which funded the administrative costs). Social and economic regulation and law and order remained in the hands of the sheriffs at local level, supported by unpaid justices of the peace.    Elizabeth's reign also saw many brave voyages of discovery, including those of Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and Humphrey Gilbert, particularly to the Americas. These expeditions prepared England for an age of colonisation and trade expansion, which Elizabeth herself recognised by establishing the East India Company in 1600.     The arts flourished during Elizabeth's reign. Country houses such as Longleat and Hardwick Hall were built, miniature painting reached its high point, theatres thrived - the Queen attended the first performance of Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Composers such as William Byrd and Thomas Tallis worked in Elizabeth's court and at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace.    The image of Elizabeth's reign is one of triumph and success. The Queen herself was often called 'Gloriana', 'Good Queen Bess' and 'The Virgin Queen'.     Investing in expensive clothes and jewellery (to look the part, like all contemporary sovereigns), she cultivated this image by touring the country in regional visits known as 'progresses', often riding on horseback rather than by carriage. Elizabeth made at least 25 progresses during her reign.     However, Elizabeth's reign was one of considerable danger and difficulty for many, with threats of invasion from Spain through Ireland, and from France through Scotland. Much of northern England was in rebellion in 1569-70. A papal bull of 1570 specifically released Elizabeth's subjects from their allegiance, and she passed harsh laws against Roman Catholics after plots against her life were discovered.     One such plot involved Mary, Queen of Scots, who had fled to England in 1568 after her second husband's murder and her subsequent marriage to a man believed to have been involved in his murder.     As a likely successor to Elizabeth, Mary spent 19 years as Elizabeth's prisoner because Mary was the focus for rebellion and possible assassination plots, such as the Babington Plot of 1586.     Mary was also a temptation for potential invaders such as Philip II. In a letter of 1586 to Mary, Elizabeth wrote, 'You have planned ... to take my life and ruin my kingdom ... I never proceeded so harshly against you.' Despite Elizabeth's reluctance to take drastic action, on the insistence of Parliament and her advisers, Mary was tried, found guilty and executed in 1587.     In 1588, aided by bad weather, the English navy scored a great victory over the Spanish invasion fleet of around 130 ships - the 'Armada'. The Armada was intended to overthrow the Queen and re-establish Roman Catholicism by conquest, as Philip II believed he had a claim to the English throne through his marriage to Mary.    During Elizabeth's long reign, the nation also suffered from high prices and severe economic depression, especially in the countryside, during the 1590s. The war against Spain was not very successful after the Armada had been beaten and, together with other campaigns, it was very costly.     Though she kept a tight rein on government expenditure, Elizabeth left large debts to her successor. Wars during Elizabeth's reign are estimated to have cost over 5 million (at the prices of the time) which Crown revenues could not match - in 1588, for example, Elizabeth's total annual revenue amounted to some 392,000.     Despite the combination of financial strains and prolonged war after 1588, Parliament was not summoned more often. There were only 16 sittings of the Commons during Elizabeth's reign, five of which were in the period 1588-1601. Although Elizabeth freely used her power to veto legislation, she avoided confrontation and did not attempt to define Parliament's constitutional position and rights.     Elizabeth chose never to marry. If she had chosen a foreign prince, he would have drawn England into foreign policies for his own advantages (as in her sister Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain); marrying a fellow countryman could have drawn the Queen into factional infighting. Elizabeth used her marriage prospects as a political tool in foreign and domestic policies.    However, the 'Virgin Queen' was presented as a selfless woman who sacrificed personal happiness for the good of the nation, to which she was, in essence, 'married'. |`|AA12148951	being a virgin queen|`|ZD1MsbJdaa	Umm Which Queen Elizabeth?|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Duh.

2g2eqH19aa	Hi,    I am sure this site will be able to resolve your questions.    http://www.countriesinformation.net    Thanks,  Roy|`|ba180dfcc817dd2837c0cad6a65df7b6aa	1. Firstly, you have to be aware that there is some controversy about sending used clothes abroad. Many charities prefer to avoid the transportation costs involved, and rather resell the clothes locally to generate funds to be used, as appropriate, abroad. There are also some who fear the negative effect that the influx of used clothing has on the developing countries' own textile and clothing industries. Here is an article from the United Nations that takes a benign view of the used clothing trade.  http://un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2006/issue3...    2. This article suggests how you might do it, and the possible charities involved. You will note that it also reiterates reservations about transporting used clothing.  http://www.ehow.com/how_4392668_donate-c...    3. I don't know what suitable charities there are in Brevard County, but here are some possible leads for you, and they have some interesting ideas too ...   Humana People to People  http://www.humana.org/TextPage.asp?MenuI...   Planet Aid  http://www.planetaid.org/TextPage.asp?Me...   Shoe4Africa  http://www.shoe4africa.org/donate.html    4. Whatever you decide, please make sure that you are aware of the overall purpose of the charity, and that you have no qualms with it. Personally, I would not engage with any charity which has evangelising as its mission. You, however, may have other matters that need to be taken into consideration.
9qUnD0sBaa	They never where giants,the word that was translated as giant actually means great as in, larger than life. They are powerful  psychic beings. Able to use telekinetic energy, and hear thoughts, they can predict the future.  Yes ,they continue today.  There are many things from the past that continue today,  they don't stand out so much , they are  quieter. They cant stand crowds, the multitude of thoughts cause them anxiety  They have relationship issues, they feel everything too  much. Some have little idea of who they are. A few physical anomalies , different eyes, larger than most and haunting.  Small bony ridge across shoulder blades.  Appendix not in the correct place or missing, and some are tall  but not all. They sense each other, with out speaking.They have passionate sex.|`|W3ptH1JCaa	By their arrogant attitude and the way they strut around beating people over the head with self-righteous judgement.

I think the definition of Giant is accurate generally speaking. This first angel/human race would have died in the flood, though, but you hear it again to refer to giants elsewhere in Scripture.    Jude mentions fallen angels who did not stay in their abode (some say he was quoting Enoch)...I forget the verse. The book of Enoch indicates this too     don't know who the first one's war.    The Lord bless you.
dPJr1Lbmaa	You confronted her to her face and good for you. Does she forget its a FREE COUNTRY for you also. She even had her child with her, I mean no wonder these poor children grow up with such stupid ideas in there heads if this is an example of a parent.  So what your siblings where being loud, they are children, children can sometimes be loud. If she had an issue with that, thats one thing I mean it can be annoying but her having an issue with your faith, thats another. Yes she is free not to like Islam but she is NOT free to insult a perfect stranger minding there own business.  You confronted her, said what you had to say and walked away. I think you should have left it there though and not flipped her off, it only gave her further opertunity to insult you. But you where angry and rightly so, I know we dont all think rashionally when in a state of anger especially when attacked. You did have the right to feel defensive.  I mean "let out of a cage"? Who the heck does she think she is? The Queen of Sheba? And what does she think THE country is ? Paradise? Notice I did not say Her country as it does not belong to Her, and I did not say Your country as I dont want to assume it is or isnt either way THE country does not belong to anyone, its ALLAH'S country as is every country on his green earth!  Peace to you sister and Insha ALlah in the future you will do the same and confront someone but maybe take the higher ground afterwards LOL and no flipping off lol?|`|AYs6iFlLaa	You didn't do the right thing. Sorry, that's my opinion. bring on the thumbs down! Islam already gets a bad note and when our own Brothers and Sisters act this way it makes it worse because we should be examples of the truth and light of Islam.    A man slapped me in front of my children, for being Muslim in his "White Christian State". I called the police. they did nothing. I walked away with my head held high.     It is never easy to be degraded or ridiculed. Most people ask me questions, but when I over hear things like that, I simply smile at them and sometimes start a simple conversation. Ignorance is what keeps us separate. Knowledge, understanding and compassion is what will unite us.     You draw more bees with honey, than you do vinegar.    @ under the black flag- I am not always so patient. I just make a concious effort to be extra well behaved when encountering Non- muslims and when I'm not sure of my surroundings.     The incident I spoke of happened in Pennsylvania when a young boy ran out in front of my car, I almost hit him and he was scared so, I got out to see if he was ok. I was traveling from Texas to New York.  White, Christian, State was the way that the man who slapped me described the State of Pennsylvania. I might add that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has one of the largest Muslim populations in the US. Muslims have poulate Philly for over 50 years.    Sister, please don't take any of the answers as a put down, all of us have made mistakes. I make them every day, and despite the fact that I think you were wrong, I didn't say that it didn't make me crack a smile. :) Inshallah, you will gain some patience as you grow older.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	give it a few more generations, hopefully by then natural selection will take place and most of the worlds prejudice idiots will be weeded out    and by the way, you're not helping your case any by acting the way you did.  if you're calm and present yourself in a polite way, the daughter will begin to question why it is that her mother doesn't like certain people.|`|Eos7bQKRaa	u go girl!|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	LOL  Wow, props to you!

And I'm not trying to be rude, but maybe next time, carry yourself in a more calm manner so you can prove her wrong about what she said. Just keep on standing up for yourself.

Your initial response was fine, but after just hearing hear speak twice, that should have been enough to walk away. You just need to realize she is an idiot, and will not have a good relationship with her children. Idiots will collapse upon their own stupidity. So the most satisfactory revenge is to let them be. It's certainly sad, but some idiots are just too stupid to be saved.|`|IdV7TOcOaa	man i wish i was right there with you    i would give that woman both my fingers both her and her daughter    i agree with briggette, but if someone shares their opinion of muslims in a calm and decent manner, than i would do the same      Wow. Mash'Allah Brigette, that is a very brave, courageous thing to do. Alhamdulliah!!!!  Wallah, i am speechless, theres nothing to describe ur reaction right there, infront of your children.

Ignorance is not the problem, the problem is when people judge others and insult them without even getting to know them.    Your reaction is natural although I would recommend that you never respond to insult with another insult. This person's behavior has actually reflected her own nature and education, so we don't need to  become like them.    In a similiar situation, I would react in different ways (depending on the weather):    - Sometimes it would be enough to smile and wave to them!   - Or just ignore them.  - Or tell the kids to lower their voice because we have some ignorant people in the shop (say it loud, enough to be heard by her)  - Approach them and say: I've heard what you said and I would like to thank you for showing your level of education and behavior.  - Approach them and offer a visit to a local mosque where they give Information sessions about Islam and Muslims.    Take care.    Peace/salaam|`|U2ISEjb8aa	I doubt this even happened. Most of you people make this stuff up to give the west a bad name, but at the same time do not hesitate to flood the place.

Happy Journey!|`|wGQvgeXDaa	Mashallah sister Bridgette. That wasnt easy but I admire your patience.    I have also experienced similar remarks and i must admit at times, i wished i could have handled it more maturely. Sister bridgette is right in saying that our reactions especially us, women of this Ummah are always misunderstood as the way Muslims behave in certain difficult situations. We really cant erase this notion, but we can help dispel that but acting like how mature, professional, true Muslims should handle situations such as this one.     They are ignorant to see their own faults. We already know that yet we fall prey to our anger and forget to see a window for Dawah. I have been a bi-atch before too since I know Im in the right path, but I changed my ways when I read about the noble life of the Prophet and his way of calling people to Islam.     It's never easy. But inshallah, one small battle at a time will do. Our real enemy is ignorance, we are ignorant of our deen as much as they are when we act this way. We must stretch our patience as much as Bridgette did and more and more and try to correct other people by gentleness. May Allah guide us always.|`|DO7lDtqxaa	I would have been so sweet honey would have been sour.   I would have apologized for the kids annoying her.

DArAz67Caa	one is of passion-----the other is of principle-----you answered your own question-|`|N8Im0nQLaa	A sin of passion is probably more fun and involves being naked.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I do not recall hearing these terms before.    I would think that a sin of passion is a sin that arises in part from a temporary and heightened emotional state - such as anger or rage, that somewhat or, perhaps,  greatly reduces a person's ability to control his or her actions.    I would think that a sin of principle in contrast to this is a sin that involves careful premeditation - principled, but disordered thinking and rationalizing.     These distinctions are relevant in determining a person's culpability for the sin.   The difficulty of determining such subtleties is part of the reason God forbids our making eternal judgments of condemnation.|`|gHSarVD1aa	Sin is missing the mark. If you miss it by an inch or mile , you still miss it.|`|aBxdyqShaa	"There is no sin above another."      Sin means: offense to God.   And one offense is just as great as any other.  They all only have one cure;  Christ's sacrifice.   Good deeds are not the cure, or being good either.   He died to remove our spots.    And by grace we have his forgiveness.|`|AA11440601	The only place I have ever heard of these terms is in the book "The Scarlet Letter."    I have never heard these terms in modern Christianity.    Sin is a deliberate thought, word, deed, or omission contrary to the eternal law of God.     In other words, sin is anything that hurts your relationship with God.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...    With love in Christ.|`|bUHn1Pu0aa	I guess its like Manslaughter & Murder?

Then if your girl friend comes home,  catches you and says do you have anything left for us? and you say yes and do it,  that's a sin of principal.
S4QBvAaGaa	Poor you and parental supervision! I sense a lot of truth questions but I found some of these anyway:  *Go to the kitchen and select a condiment for the person to eat, preferably nothing that needs to be cooked.   *Have the victim sing a childrens song at the top of their lungs.   *Make the victim smear peanut butter under one armpit and jelly under the other. Then, use two pieces of bread to clean it off.   *Sit the next round on the lap of someone.  *Trade and article of clothing(like socks) with the person on your right.   *Imitate another player and have everyone try to guess who you are.    *Go into the bathroom and make a toilet paper hat. You have to wear it for the next two rounds.   *Create a mystery drink for the victim to drink. The victim must take at least two swallows.  *Eat some toilet paper or regular paper.  *Have a word drawn on their cheek with a marker or pen to last for the rest of the sleepover.  * They have to suffer being tickled for 30 secs moving as little as possible. (not sure if you're allowed to tie people up with shoestrings or something at your sleepover)  *Make a prank phone call.  *Speak in an ultra high or deep voice for the rest of the game, or night.  Good Luck! :)|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Adult supervision sucks!|`|DfwmLBapaa	put little slips in diff colored baloons then blow thwm up. one color is truth and the other is dare|`|IJiJbtATaa	get ice creame and put it on the person to your lefts big toe and lick it off|`|hG8Zo8mkaa	If there are boys they have to go to the beach with you and wear a bikini of your choice btw if you do this sentd me the picture at wangtrevor@gmail.com
l2BjWA5Baa	I have studied Russian, German, and Danish back to back for several years.  When you are fairly proficient in a language and attempt to start a second one, then your brain automatically fills in words from your second language to make up for things you haven't learned yet in the third, but as you're in Spanish 1 it should be a problem.    Russian and German together was never difficult as they are drastically different, even different alphabets - so I don't believe that will give you much trouble.  Where I ran into trouble was trying to add on Danish, which is a close relative of German.  If you wanted to start Italian I would caution you against it, but since your languages have virtually nothing in common, I think it's a fine idea.    How are you doing in Spanish? It's second semester now, so you should have some read on what your language skills are like. If you're failing or constantly have to ask the teacher for help, you may simply not be cut out for language. Not everyone's brain is wired that way! But since you have an interest, if you enjoy Spanish and are doing fairly well, I think you should do it!    p.s. Korean is next on my list of languages to learn! Lucky you =]|`|dirIBdToaa	it takes alot of brain power and i suppose you might get confused|`|8ucq6SEjaa	yupp it is.  i took french my freshman year but moved this summer and they dont offer french at my new school so im stuck taking Spanish, which im fluent at, and is sooo dang boring in that class. but i would imagine korean is much harder.  you can always give it a try though...  Good Luck! =)|`|s3YuchHoaa	I am learning native Spanish, intermediate Italian , Begginers French, Portugese, and German. It is possible I just focus on the languages I like most and learn different ones on different days.I learn Spanish,Italian, and Portugese most days but sometimes get bored and work on french or german. Good luck Korean seems hard , Spanish is very easy.|`|iaOktaU1aa	Well, if you have a gift for learning languages, it shouldn't be too hard. Just look at me, I started learning Japanese a year and a half ago, and I started learning Spanish half a year ago, and I do just fine learning both at the same time. I would honestly say that it's not actually all too difficult, but it might be different for you. My suggestion is, if you want to learn both, go for it!|`|dtfWBFJiaa	well, spanish and korean are really different languages. so, unless you're really smart or you're super neat, i don't think you should. but, if you want to learn languages that are related to each other (such as korean and japanese) at the same time, then it'll be easier.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	spanish and korean are two seriously different languages, i propose you finish with spanish now and take korean later because you could get easily mixed up and tired and you will soon give up on learning one of the two or even both|`|ohUm00RYaa	Not if it is two languages that are so different.  I have a friend who took japanese and french at the same time but then again my school has all genius iq bastards so idk|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	well, it might be easier if you imagine that you are not studying two languages, but rather dealing with two new friends, which lifestyles are different. you can become acquainted with both, and the more time you give to any of them, the more you will know him. and you can very well get acquainted with both of them, at the same time. the same will happen with two different languages, just store in different zones of your mind what are the features that define each one. I don't think that if you have 2, 3 or more new friends you will just mistake any one for another, do you?    EDIT: the above been said, I forgot to tell you this: that if you allocate more of your time to any of the two languages, you will probably learn it faster. the decision there is of how fast do you want to learn a language. try giving priority to one and learning the second one in your spare time, that may work perfectly fine.|`|lrsLI2JGaa	Back in high school, I took French, German, and Ancient Greek all in the same day, one class after another.  It wasn't hard.  My mind kinda just switched gears from class to class and bam, I was ready to learn that language.  Even for homework on those nights, I just switched gears again.  It's probably easy for me, and I can imagine it being confusing.    Once or twice I tried to think of a sentence and I'd switch languages in the middle of it.  Like, J'aime meine Mutti.  If you go for it, just pay close attention to what you're doing.|`|L5vOW6ggaa	I went to school in the Netherlands.  Like everybody else I had to learn three foreign languages at the same  time: English, German and French. That was no problem.  (Check my answers on this site: I write in two foreign languages here.)  My girlfriend went to a school where she had to learn Latin and Ancient  Greek on top of those. She took Biblical Hebrew in an optional class.  Six languages & our native Dutch.   I think two foreign languages, that are very different, should be easy.  The more languages you have learned, the easier it gets to learn a new one.
6ELSwKKvaa	I haven't read prop 8 so I can't say if I agree or disagree with it. I do know that I support equal rights for gay and lesbian couples. I would like them to be able to be married in the eyes of the law.      It amazes me that the "church" as a whole is afraid of it when they won't have to do the ceremonies if they don't want to. Also, even if they did the ceremonies... only God will say if it is approved by Him or not. It doesn't really matter if the church approves because God will either approve or disapprove. I personally believe He approves of it.     The biggest reason it needs to be approved by the law is so that gay and lesbian couples will be protected in the same way that heterosexual couples are. They deserve to have the same rights to their loved one that a married person has. They have a right to their pension. They have a right to their health care. They have a right to a legally binding contract so that if one partner leaves, the other isn't left holding the bag.      The Churches are spreading the word that homosexuality is immoral and only married couples can have sex but at the same time, they refuse to allow homosexual couples to be married. If they want to slow down the sexual immorality in the homosexual community, let them make binding contracts to stay with one another. It's more realistic than expecting them to stay alone their entire lives.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	OMG that is great I laughed so hard about it.

This should not be an issue in my opinion.

GEfUTyi8aa	its not about how a person looks when they look in the mirror its how they feel about themselves.  One could be beautiful but look in the mirror and see ugly because they are hiding horrible things about themselves..... or one could be not so beautiful and look happily into the mirror because they are at peace with who they are... the mirror is a reflection of yourself and not necessarily about vanity....    perhaps on those days you feel ugly is when you did something you were ashamed of.....whether intended or not....

When I look in the mirror I like seeing that I've been able to make it to another day, that the fact I'm still seeing myself in the mirror everyday means I'm still fighting, and the world hasn't broken me yet no matter how much it bends me sometimes. I see myself as very imperfect, especially physically, but I've learned to accept it, and it no longer matters to me. Your body is just a body, and your much more then your body. Don't let people make you think differently. Keep yourself conditioned and healthy but don't worry so much about being small. It doesn't matter. What matters is that you have a functioning body, and your not deaf, or blind, and you have a fully functioning brain. So do something with that beautiful, fully functioning body of yours. When you die, people won't remember what you looked like, they'll remember how you lived. So live a life worth remembering.|`|W3ptH1JCaa	I think most of us deal with that self-doubt when we look in the mirror. Don't feel like there's a class of "good-looking" people.

Don't give up.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	I was just thinking about that yesterday!    There was this actor on TV (also very short) and I tried to imagine myself in his shoes...    I am extraordinarily good-looking - some would say "perfect."    I also have the benefit of being highly intelligent and personable.    Interestingly, I dated a girl who was beyond beautiful - I mean stunning!    But she had anger issues.  Once, she demanded that I pull up to a very nice hotel.  She told me to wait there a minute for her.    She slammed the door and stomped into the hotel entrance, past the valets and the desk clerk and grabbed a large pot with a plant in it.    She came out of the hotel, carrying the plant and very nice pot - opened the back of the SUV I was driving and put it back there, came around to the front and got in, steaming MAD!    "I hate everybody!" she said, wiping a tear from her eye.    I asked her what the Hell was going on and she finally explained to me that if she had been unattractive or dressed poorly, she would not have gotten away with what she had just done.    She explained that people assumed that because she was professional looking and beautiful, she was doing nothing wrong.    This made her furious.      It was a theme throughout our relationship:    She would do outrageous things and people would still "love" her - because she was beautiful.    I tell you, it nearly drove me nuts.    Yesterday, I wondered what it must be like to be uber-short.  To have all the essential feelings and need just like everyone else - everyone who is "normal" - yet forever, having to live with the fact that you are visibly different.    I wondered just what I would do.    I suppose I would try to make my personality be rather extraordinary (larger than life?) - I would probably try to compensate in other areas of my life as well.    But, I would inevitably go somewhere where I had not been before - somewhere new and get those damned stares and people acting:    1. Like I'm some freak  2. Like I'm their freakin' brother - to show me how open-minded they are or something - going out of their way to make me "feel" normal.  3. Like I'm not there at all.    It would seem to be a lose, lose, lose situation!    What could I do?    I felt that I would have to absolutely face exactly who I was as a whole person.  The greatest thing I could do would be to find a way to maximize my honest self-confidence - a self-confidence that perhaps "normal" people could never understand.    But me, a physical oddity living among giants, would have to be so very comfortable with myself that it would quickly set people off-guard, long enough to give them a glimpse of the World from MY perspective and let them understand that I AM also NORMAL - that they would/could see me as another "SELF".    From that point, if I am successful and if the people I meet are comfortable enough with themselves that they will be able to benefit from my acquaintance, everyone will feel good about it.    (This is me still thinking about what it must be like)    The benefit of my situation lies in the fact that the friends that I do make, will be true friends.  I know already that they are the kinds of people that most others would be lucky to know.    I can imagine that 'bad days' for someone in your shoes must tempt you to all manner of negative thoughts and insecurities.    But I also imagine that from an early age, you have developed a rather extraordinary "survival psychology" which has enabled you to rebound into a "glass half-full" kind of guy.    Your perspective cannot be shallow.  There are many who live 'in the mirror' - unable to see anything but their beautiful image - and when they are older and fatter and wrinkley-er... they will not know what to do.    You will.    I would suppose that you - in a few senses, stand heads and shoulders above so many beautiful but shallow people.      So what, if you're the stand-out?  Make the f*kin most out of it, I say.      You will.|`|2LsR22g9aa	Sometimes before I get in the shower I think, OMG it must be cold in here. But it doesn't bother me because I know my warrior stands tall when it counts.

AA11717874	Cesar brought an amount of order to Rome after he defeated the rebellious generals and assumed power as dictator. brutus, along with other roman senators didn't mind that too much because it was in their best interest to have a strong leader. the problem came when the roman senate started to think that Cesar was trying to set up a dynasty, a line of rulers that would usurp the senate's power or even disband the senate all together. that's when the plot to kill Cesar started. brutus was cesar's friend but hated the idea if a dictator and made his choice.

In fact, it's kind of turned into a tradition. Depending on your relationship you even could loose points if she doesn't get them from you! In the least, just one long stemmed rose is a good idea. Keep in mind that different colored roses all have different meanings. Red roses mean I love you, Yellow is for friendship, orange is for passion.    Most people give a dozen roses on Valentines Day.  If that's too expensive, like I said above, a single long stemmed red rose can be very meaningful.    If you do decide to order roses and get them online you might be interested in a survey I saw recently that CBS News did to find the best company to order from. It kind of takes the risk out of it. The survey was done to see who offered the best value and who actually came the closest to delivering roses that were the same as in the pictures. The company that won out was FromYouFlowers. You can see the video clip of the survey CBS news did at www.orderrosesonline.net    Sorry for being so wordy here.

Course there is always exceptions, but for the most part: flowers + girl = happy girl! One rose, two rose, white rose, red rose, which ever or whatever you think would work. Course I think buying her a dozen roses may be just a tad bit too much for a beginning of a relationship. Also you don't have to get roses, you could get another flower or bouqet that looks just simply gorgeous and go with that. Roses are beautiful, and I love 'em, but they are kinda cliche of a gift. Good luck on the wooing!|`|zoJmDBpUaa	Give her roses. That's what girls are looking for on a Valentine date.    1 Rose - Love at the first sight; you are the one  2 Roses - Mutual love between both, deeply in love with one another  3 Roses - I love you  6 Roses - I wanna be yours  7 Roses - I'm infatuated with you  9 Roses - An Eternal love, together as long as we live  11 Roses - You are my treasured one; the one I love most in my life  12 Roses - Be my steady|`|AN4zUCnwaa	Well my friend, I think I would buy her at least a rose. You want this girl to know that you care about her. It doesn't have to be wonderful, just let her know how you feel about her. Girls love for you to be romantic. So, take it from me, buy her at least a rose.|`|P38ULZbraa	I think maybe one, save the dozen for if and when you are dating. Girls love roses, or at least I do [: Maybe you can also get her a small stuffed animal.|`|IrahyL2Qaa	yes get her 1 count 'em 1, rose and the sweetest card you can find...then lean in for the kiss ;)|`|FCTggSTkaa	I say, don't overdo it by getting her a full set of complete roses.  Maybe to the typical box of chocolates and get her a rose or two with it.  Then it wont seem like you're "doing too much" by giving her a full bouquet but you'll still make her feel pretty special :D|`|3WEkGZknaa	roses are really generic.    get her something that she will like A LOT.    for example by boyfriend loves to work out and eats cliff bars.  i made him a bouquet of cliff bars for valentines day.  at the time we had only been together for about a month.    get her something personal|`|R9SFjgnsaa	Yes 3 red fresh roses , It means I love U ....... Make sure they are not fully bloom as U don't want their petals to fall off buy the time U send the flowers to her .. Tips get a not full bloom rose before reaching her house sprinkle some hot water on the rose . it'll open up and look very fresh ...  Fresh means respect to the other party .... Happy dating .... Wish you and your partner a long lasting relationship :)|`|EFnnqpbDaa	You shouldn't go to the extent of getting her a full bouquet but you should get her one, a flower to show that you are friends, and a rose to hint towards the whole love thing. Maybe get her another little gift on top of that, but don't over do it. Hole it works out and good luck!!|`|0k2xuCqYaa	If you are going to buy her roses dont buy her red ones because red symbolizes "love" and your relationship with her is still fresh. Its the thought that counts but you dont want to move to fast. If you are planning to get her roses make sure they are either yellow for "friendship" or pink meaning "strong like". Are you only going to get her roses? If so buy her a half dozen. Now if you plan on getting something else how about 1 rose in a nice vase and a box of candy. You cant go wrong with sweets (  : You seem nervous? Im sure she will love whatever gift you decide.|`|AA10023535	No don't get her roses if you guys are in the half friends / half cuddly phase. Get her a bouqet of really bright colored wildflowers. Tell her you thought roses were so typical and you just wanted to bring her something pretty to let her know you're thinking about her. Hand them to her with a cute smile then either change the subject and suggest something to do or if you drop them off leave them with her with a dashing smile then tell her you'll see her later. Always be the last one to say anything.|`|uZye4jMIaa	get her 14 roses and she asks why 14 roses u tell her why...remember feb.14 valentines day!!!
AA12059450	The ENTIRE LAW was REPLACED... just as Jesus PREDICTED.    Yes, Jesus said he didnt come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, (Matthew 5:17) but this DOES NOT MEAN THE LAW IS STILL IN EFFECT. The result was the same, once fulfilled, the law was no longer in effect.     The very next verse, Matthew 5:18, LOOKS FORWARD to the time when the law WOULD BE SET ASIDE. "...Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law UNTIL EVERYTHING IS COMPLETED." This UNTIL clause REINFORCES THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE LAW. It ONLY makes sense when we understand that the law was intended FROM THE BEGINNING to be SET ASIDE... Saying that the law will remain "UNTIL..." presupposes that it would some day no longer remain.    Jesus' "NEW COMMAND" in John 13:34 replaces the "moral code" of the law.    "So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other."    ... The standard for love that Jesus established, that we love "JUST AS I HAVE LOVED YOU," requires much more of us than merely keeping the portions of the law dealing with our relationship with one another.      Of course Jesus' teaching here fits perfectly with Pauls later teaching:    Ephesians 2:15 Through his body on the cross, Christ put an END to the LAW WITH ALL ITS COMMANDS AND RULES. He wanted to create one new group of people out of the two. He wanted to make peace between them.    Colossians 2:14, He WIPED OUT the WRITTEN LAW with its RULES. The Law was against us. It opposed us. He TOOK IT AWAY and NAILED IT TO THE CROSS.     Galatians 2:16&21 (excerpts) No one can be made right with God by obeying the law... What if a person could become right with God by obeying the law? Then Christ died for nothing!    Romans 3:20 So it cant be said that anyone will be made right with God by obeying the law. Not at all! The law makes us more aware of our sin. 21 But now God has shown us how to become right with him. The Law and the Prophets give witness to this. It has nothing to do with obeying the law.     Galatians 5:4 Some of you are trying to BE MADE RIGHT WITH GOD BY OBEYING THE LAW. You have been SEPARATED FROM CHRIST. You have FALLEN AWAY FROM GODS GRACE... The ONLY verse that talks about falling from grace, and they did it by trying to follow the law!    The 10 commandments along with the rest of the law (technically described by "commands and rules" from Ephesians 2:15) were "set aside" when they were fulfilled or completed at Jesus' resurrection. We are no longer bound by that law.    BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE LAW IS WORTHLESS OR MEANINGLESS!    Romans 15:4 Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us. The Scriptures give us strength to go on. They cheer us up and give us hope.    So we see that Paul's teaching is exactly in line with Jesus' own prophecy about the law. Early in Pauls ministry, the other apostles and the elders in Jerusalem were asked about non-Jewish converts to Christianity and their relationship or responsibility to the law. Here was their UNANIMOUS RESPONSE:    "The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the non-Jewish believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:     Greetings.    We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. We all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: YOU ARE TO ABSTAIN FROM FOOD SACRIFICED TO IDOLS, FROM BLOOD, FROM THE MEAT OF STRANGLED ANIMALS AND FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY. YOU WILL DO WELL TO AVOID THESE THINGS.     Farewell." -- Acts 15:23-29    Notice that the ENTIRE body of rules contained in the Old Testament was reduced to ONE SENTENCE.|`|TwfyliKiaa	The law was given to point out that we need to be saved. Sin used the law to condemn us. We can not be saved by the law so that's why Jesus lived died and rose.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	You can not understand government with out knowing it's history.  The Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures is the history of mankind and the theocratic government enforce at that time leading to Christ.  The New Testament or Christian Greek Scriptures is the conclusion of the old government because Christ came to the earth to fulfill the law (Mosaic Law) and also to provide hope for the Future.  It also tells mankind HOW WE can have a good relationship with Jehovah and gain what the the Jews of ancient times lost when they rejected the Christ.|`|aBxdyqShaa	Could it be that they were written by the finger of God Himself?|`|AA11616515	The OT was a different administration {dispensation} we now live in the Grace administration exemplified in the seven church epistles -  Romans,  I & II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and  I & II Thessalonians.|`|MXRXG62oaa	This question always makes me wonder.....  think of the Bible as a timeline. Which it is. It begins with Creation in Genesis and ends with the end of the world in Revelation.  There are 2 covenants, the covenant made between God and the Israelites, and the New Covenant. Testament means covenant by the way. The covenant was binding until death. Jesus died and opened the gates of heaven and ended the old covenant. Read Hebrews for more info on this "new covenant"... 10 commandments..... I've always thought we should follow every part of the old testament thats not CANCELED in the new. Sacrifices are canceled for one thing. another thing is some of the clean/unclean laws are canceled... Ironically though, some Christians believe we should just throw out the whole old testament... not so.  Christmas and Easter are not biblical. Sunday being the holy day is NOT biblical .The Sabbath has never been canceled or change. If you look at the sequence (3 days and 3 nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth)...if you believe Jesus died on Friday, 3 days and 3 nights does not come out to Sunday morning! There is a lot of misleading, misguided facts surrounding Christianity...We should follow the Ten Commandments and anything else Jesus has commanded us to do...|`|AA11824333	We don't disagree with the old, now we are under grace not law.|`|43ddce78f10a425be595e294663e4900aa	from what I've heard, the new testament is set in the current age and the old testament was meant for earlier people. The 10 commandments were laws set by God for everyone to follow and now people use them as moral codes.|`|gHSarVD1aa	The Law stands intact. It is not outdated. We are simply further away from it.     (Now for your question)    The reason has to do with the fact that nobody can possibly keep the law so we concentrate more on our current relationship with Jesus that is part of our daily lives. The law shows us that we are guilty. Christ saves us. I personally like reading more about my savior then my sins.|`|g4lxDSmtaa	A misunderstanding of "the law".    The whole word of God is good, as it tells us (that's both OT and NT)  The OT is full of prophecy of the NT and even for now (in fact, mostly for now).  The 10C are part of the Mosaic law which Christ came and fulfilled to give us the spiritual law (harder and is kept spiritually and has spiritual rewards, where the Israelites had a physical law, kept it physically and were offered physical death for disobeying and physical life in teh promised land for obeying).  There is also a moral law which is included in both the OT and NT which governs 'behavior' for want of a better word.  Its a big subject, but collect all the Scriptures talking about the law in the NT and that may build a picture for you.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Jesus actually restates, in a way, the 10 Commandments in the Sermon on the Mount, found in Matthew 5-8. We do not ignore the OT or the 10 Commandment, it is simply a matter that Jesus fulfilled the old law of the OT. The OT is the teachings of the Jews, prior to the arrival of Jesus. The NT is the teachings of Jesus Himself, as told to His disciples.|`|93733684831cb258957f05ced7910d86aa	Drooper is right the bible is not outdated we just got comfortable with compromising a little all the time then we are far away from our father the teachings become unfair and too hard for us and we complain how unfair it is. the truth is we strayed and we need to come back. God Bless. Love. Amen.|`|bikDnJdlaa	First of all, the 10 commandments are a part of the law, which was given to the Israelites while in the wilderness because they would not obey God.  They were observed for many, many years because there was nothing else given to replace them; until Jesus. From then on we were no longer under the law, but under His grace.  The Old Testament is a collection of writings of the prophets of old. And Jesus Himself said in Luke 24:25-26 after his resurrection: "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"  So I would say we disregard the teachings of the Old Testament because we are fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets have taught us.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	The old testament contains more prophecies then the new and most of these prophecies that have not been fulfilled yet kk.  They are still equally vital today.   The only part of the Old Testament that is not vital are commands that have been fulfilled in Jesus under the new covenant and the Levitical law.  Even they are vital to our history as a church.   The commandment we follow now is the law of love.  Jesus says to hang all the law and the prophets on this law.  The old testament followers were under this law as well but they just never got it so God added another 9 commands.  What is the first command?  LOVE.  You bet your socks the OT is vital today for everyone who waits for Gods return.  I'm really glad you don' have one more k in your initials.  Love Kent.

xL6zc0bOaa	Not if they have a good and caring doctor, who knows a lot about the welfare state.|`|jjt2enntaa	I think physically and mentally disabled elderly are neglected.  It's just too easy to warehouse them somewhere and forget about them.|`|8owwzmFUaa	No I don't think so . It all depends on your own behavior.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	The media reports so often of senior citizens being abused by people  in their families abusing them, while in their care. This is so common  now, that perhaps the general public turns a deaf ear. Until it's their  turn to be cared for or neglected, by those staff members who have  them as patients in their nursing homes, and also by the patients'  own children. I think that those of us, who can live a longer life in their  elderly status by remaining well are the fortunate ones. As they can  remain at home, and still be active with some assistance in house  cleaning, or some other assistance they might need.    But those who are dependent on some one helping them with more  than that, are at the mercy of the care giver, whomever it might be.It   seems to be a more modern dilema than during my parents or grand-  parents day, when your mother or mother in law would come to live  and be a part of the family til their death. But most women didn't  work outside of the home, and so they did have the time for the  drudgery and work that caring for the ill and elderly often involve.  Today they are shuffled off, and live quiet and sedate lives with noth-  ing to look forward to and so they become depressed in a short  while and will themselves to die in many cases. Yes, it is true  that sort of thing is a major problem in the US. And that other  countries have families more devoted to the elderly and they are  wise to set an example for their children. For everyone gets' old  and stays old for a very long time, until they are suddenly not  there anymore. Respect and love your parents and know that as  they age, their bodies don't always remember to recognize what  they once were.  But keep them in your heart for what they were  and still are to you. Love should never fade away.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	I am certainly not neglected.    My family would not allow it.    I don't know any seniors that are.    I live in a small rural community - everyone knows everyone.    I do know of a senior man who was miss treating his wife - also a senior.  He had the beginning of Dementia.  He was put in the nursing home but only lived for a month.    It probably happens more in the larger cities where it's hard to keep a handle on it.  Where neighbors don't look out for each other.    Very good question.  I hope you speech goes well.  DeeJay.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Some are. A neighbor of my mother's owned her own house and allowed her daughter and boyfriend to move in with her.

Plenty of little children are neglected by their parents, teenagers living on the streets because they have not family support.

Age is not the only aspect of neglect.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	I just wish people were nicer to everyone these days.It just seems there are alot more angry people out there now.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	When a company takes a Ch.11 bankruptcy so the CEO, CFO and COO can continue to get their bonuses, and obscene compensations, they seem to be able to cut off pension and health care. That's aimed directly at the elderly. When someone swindles the elderly out of their savings, they get "house arrest" for a couple of months, of a minuscule fine. The swindler, just killed the elderly just as if he cut off their air supply. Other robbers and crooks go to jail for long periods. Those that prey on the elderly are seldom dealt with harshly. I'd say that's neglecting the elderly. Now lets consider Jimmy and Tammy Baker. But that's a whole chapter.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Yip.

It's hard to understand if someone is switching back and forth.    Both languages are useful.  Either way, to really be able to use the language, you're going to have to continue your language education after high school... get involved in the Deaf/Spanish-speaking community in some way.  Whether Spanish or ASL is more useful depends on what field you're going into.  It is more common to speak Spanish, but there are also many more Spanish speakers than ASL users.  It's up to you.
E11fB7iAaa	It is because MEN are designing the restrooms!  Men do NOT need a lot of stalls because most times both men and women are only going to tinkle, anyway.    Women need stalls for obvious reasons, they have to partially disrobe to urinate, they sometimes have their periods, etc.      When designing any public bathrooms EVERY architect needs to realize that men need more urinals than stalls, and women need a lot of stalls and sometimes baby changing tables!!  And, to those maintaining these facilities: Bathrooms should be pristine clean!! And, fully stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, soap, tissues, and hand lotion.  AND there should be an odor neutralizing system in place and functioning properly.    The cleanest restroom I ever went into was in a 7-11, right off the first exit into Sacramento.  Absolutely immaculate!! I told the two nice ladies that were running the place that their ladies room was as clean as my own bathroom at home.|`|raLSNm3Paa	Then never expected so many women to show up.  And they didn't really care.|`|98XExOmqaa	they already are bigger and much nicer than most mens bathrooms i've been in. some of them have pictures and a few of them even have couches. pretty sweet. i always figured women took longer in the bathroom because it was so nice in there. sorry, but you guys do take longer in there than men do. usually that's why there's a line.|`|AA11312653	A few years ago there was a proposal in our Florida legislature to alter our building codes to reflect the fact that women's differing bathroom needs and our greater likelihood to have children with us made it inaccurate to suppose that "same number of stalls for each gender" is a fair policy. One proposal was to to have 3 stalls in the ladies' room for every 2 stalls in the gents'. Another was to require a certain number of "Family/Handicap" bathrooms that are self contained -- a single private room large enough for two adults, with toilet and sink -- so that these are available to ladies should a line form. So far as I know, neither proposal was given serious consideration. This from a state which has taken the trouble to debate and pass legislation on such burning issues as whether or not "Truck Nutz" are obscene. http://jalopnik.com/382185/truck-nutz-no...|`|g4AAZRuxaa	You are right about that.|`|AA10064810	Usually, there are more facilities for women but men can get by with  urinals out in the big area while we have to have stalls.  No place is designed with enough bathrooms for intermission.  If they did, the cost would be horrendous.  What I think should happen is that if there isn't a men's line, that women be allowed to use their facilities.|`|AA11616515	Wait  I thought you guys wanted equal rights|`|L2bQifUXaa	A business has no incentive for making bigger bathrooms... they don't benefit from it.

AA10064810	From what I've seen of this kind of thing, what is happening isn't unusual.  Next time, contact everyone and ask for a reply and do the work online.  Whether you should tell the teacher or not???  Is it tattling??? Just get up there and do most of the talking, make it as good as you possibly can.  If everyone gets a good grade because of your work, that's part of what's bad about group projects.      You know when you meet to make up the power point, several of them will still not have read the article.  Just show it and ask for any suggestions and improvements.  Then, be sure you are up there where everyone in the class can see you run it.    Do not let their bad work habits destroy your grade.  If you decide to tell the teacher, do it quietly, one to one, but personally, I wouldn't. Now if you are asked point blank, tell what actually happened - I did the Power Point, John thought of the labels, etc. Don't say who didn't do what.|`|AxeOdUFQaa	Thats a tough one...  Well if your really mad at your group then go right ahead and tell the teacher. But if your not too upset and you feel like being nice then just hope you will do good. I was recently sick and I couldnt go to a meeting to help plan a project and now I hope that my group wont tell the teacher that I did nothing to help them..|`|BbK8BVNwaa	You need to meet them all in person at once and tell them that either they have to start working on it equally, or you are going to talk to the teacher about working on it alone because nobody else in the group is putting effort in. That is giving them a chance, without getting the teacher involved right off. If they truly are serious about it, they will understand and get to it. If not, I would talk to the teacher and either ask to work alone, you seem to be already doing well, or to be assigned with another group.|`|KsJoh2gsaa	You should contact your group members and tell them you feel like they aren't putting in enough effort. If no one offers to put more time aside for your project, just do as much as you can and hope for the best on Monday. You may briefly mention your situation to your teacher, so he or she has some clue of what's going on. This way, if a situation occurs where your group does not do well, your teacher is already aware of the problem at hand.     Try to be impressive in your own contribution to the presentation. Try to make it clear that you gave it time and thought and put in your share of effort. If he or she feels the presentation is inadequate and decides to give it a bad grade, you should then attempt to argue for your own separate grade. Your grade should not suffer because your group was lazy.    But before doing any of this, you should really try to push your group and give them a chance to prove themselves. Who knows, maybe they'll surprise you on Monday!    Good luck and do your best!|`|L2bQifUXaa	Ughhhh that is the exact reason I HATED group assignments in school! There are always a few people who don't do anything. My view on it is just to do the work yourself. It sucks that these people are getting off easy, but look at it as if you are just doing it for yourself.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	NO!  That would simply show that you have no idea how to be a group player.  There are other times for you to shine on your own.  But this particular situation served many purposes; to show that some can, and will work with others; others will slack off if there's someone to do the work for them, and on other levels as well.  So if your presentation is the one used, just let the group get the credit, and file this away under experience.

reyJSRCaaa	Do you have family? Tell them how you feel and ask for help, even if you haven't talked to them for awhile. Prayer and a church community can really help you as well. Reach out to others. The Hour of Power prayer line can help, you can access it through your library internet. Call a suicide hot-line to get you through tough times.    Go to the library and read about Buddhism or the book The Power of Now (E. Tolle?) or M. Scott Peck's The Road Less Traveled. Instead of comparing yourself to others and what society thinks it is to be a success just live for yourself and live for today. Let go of desire and be satisfied to live in the now.

W3ptH1JCaa	JW's criticize all other religions, but do have a special dislike for Catholics. This is a product of Joe Rutherford's influence. He was the second president of the Watchtower Society, and for some reason he really, really hated Catholics. Old watchtower publications from that era have cartoon pictures making fun of the pope, and are filled with vitriol towards the Catholic church.   As far as gay people, unfortunately this is something the jw's share with most other christian churches. I don't agree with them, but I can see that most christians are very negative towards homosexuals. In fact, that's one reason I am not a christian.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	Not sure what is missing from your conversation here.  We would not out right support a religious organization who puts on a carnival for the intention of raising money to support it's religious activity's in spite of how much fun we could have there.  Some JW's are self employed just like a lot of other people who are eking out a living these days.  Many of those who they may work for or who they have working for them, may be of other religions.  That does not make us hypocrites.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	If what you say is true, from what I've read on this forum, JW's are standing in a very long line of other Protestant Christians who say the same things.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Explain this Veronica- what do you mean by this remark " would accept support from Catholics"... accept what?- Pray tell..|`|uuSj24Xxaa	JWs hate everyone that does not follow their rules.

They also get help paying their light bill thru a Catholic charity.  They all proudly tell their story about when they have been approached to volunteer they decline because it is false religion.

Everone in existence is prone to sinning, no one is perfect. So NO, we don't single out any group of people only actions. We hate what God hates and we all need help to conform to God's standards.    It sounds to me like you are very bitter. Why do you air your dirty laundry in public? It makes you look unstable and full of hatred for Jehovah's Witnesses which then would be hypocritical in view of your question.    People here just like controversy.

We don't say negative remarks about our neighbors regardless of what religion they are. Some individual Jehovah's Witnesses may make disparaging remarks about other religions, but we as a whole feel that doing that is ot showing love for our neighbors. When Jesus was at the well he talked to the Sumaritan woman respectfully, and so did Paul when he conversed with people of different faiths, they set the example for us. Any Jehovah's Witness that tells you that he hates anyone, is not practicing what he preaches. that's why we don't take part in the military, because the thought of taking another human life is repugnant. Jehovah God doesn't hate athiest, catholics, or mormons, therefore no Jehovah's Witness has a right to.

uVQ6OSu3aa	Yes my friend, Black people do get sun burn and it can be severe. Also, when a person blushes if you remember ones face gets warm from the rush of blood to the capillaries throughout the face. Now, what Lynn had stated is an opinion based maybe on the number of Blacks she has as friends, but to say most Blacks do not want to be darker than they are is a myth. Its that the skin does burn and depending on the amount of time one spends in the sun as you know, you can become sun burned. Ive seen hundreds of Blacks at the beach with their shirts off and swimming, and even many with sun screen on. Oh and the Black person may have already had it on, or may have thought you had sun tanning lotion and simply was making a joke. Good question Blue ~!|`|8G42oyydaa	yes the sun burn and get tan lines just like we do, they can blush, you just have to be observant|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Yes they do, we just often don't see it !  When I was in the Cayman Islands about 15 years ago, I jokingly told our house maid at our hotel, who was a native of the island, that I hoped to have a tan as dark as hers when I returned home.

Most don't want to become darker than they are,  because they were more acceptible by even their own race members  if they had lighter skin. I was surprised by that information.  I was  also told that Mexicans' feel the same way about allowing their skin  to tan them darker. So the concensous is, that the lighter the skin  the more accepted they are in any race, and they try to avoid getting  any darker. There is a mind set, that you are a lower class  of citizen, the darker you are. And it may be more so in today's  societies.

93733684831cb258957f05ced7910d86aa	Q: Is it a sin to use birth control, or to have marital relations with your wife without the intentions of having a baby?         A: Thank you for your question, and your evident desire to obey the Lord in even personal matters of life.    To answer your question, the short answer is no. There is no Scripture that says it is a sin to use birth control, nor does it state that having marital relations with your wife becomes a sin if you do not necessarily intend to have a baby nine months later, although Genesis 38:6-10 gives a very specific case in which God disapproved of one form of this action.|`|GSZGmH14aa	I am a Mormon. I can tell you what we believe if you'd like ...."Children are one of the greatest blessings in life, and their birth into loving and nurturing families is central to Gods purposes for humanity. When husband and wife are physically able, they have the privilege and responsibility to bring children into the world and to nurture them. The decision of how many children to have and when to have them is a private matter for the husband and wife."    God has a plan for the happiness of all who live on the earth, and the birth of children in loving families is central to His plan. The first commandment He gave to Adam and Eve was to be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth (Genesis 1:28). The scriptures declare, Children are a heritage of the Lord (Psalm 127:3). Those who are physically able have the blessing, joy, and obligation to bear children and to raise a family. This blessing should not be postponed for selfish reasons.     Sexual relations within marriage are not only for the purpose of procreation, but also a means of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual ties between husband and wife.     Husband and wife are encouraged to pray and counsel together as they plan their families. Issues to consider include the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children.     Decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple. Elective abortion as a method of birth control, however, is contrary to the commandments of God.         I hope this helps.. God bless|`|becec76668683de8a2441cb4fc3963c6aa	Most Christians do not approve of birth control because they believe that it allows for you to have free recreational sex without having to worry about pregnancy.                                It's your choice though, many Christians have used/are using birth control.|`|FOZGMadaaa	How can two walk together unless they agree. Does your husband agree? That is all that matters.|`|Yy2VyTpTaa	the bible doesn't frown upon a married couple   having sexual relations.   But on Genesis 1:27-28 it reads And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.|`|Zo6TQY6haa	Humans were designed to be able to have sex at any time. Where as most mammals have a period of estrus (heat).   In the beginning, after the Flood, Humans were to repopulate the earth.  Now the earth is becoming too populated. Natural resources are drying up, available land mass is dwindling.  There are also many starving children in the world who do not have parents and need someone to love them.    I'm sure, at this point after the world has been repopulated and progressed so much since the time of the Flood, God would understand the use of birth control. In the end, you don't even know if He Himself influenced the design of such devices for humanity. Using a condom, for example, is not a sin in my opinion and protects both you and your loved one as well. Why would God want more and more children born on this planet, when so many millions of them are parentless, starving and dying, or being abused every day? Makes no sense to me, but that's just my opinion.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	I don't believe in indiscriminate sex even within marriage and birth control is a necessity for responsible sex with in a marriage .  keep in mind they didn't have modern day birth control in the days the bible was written. they didn't even understand chemistry as in medical physiology.|`|RT05lfKqaa	"Do unto others as you would have done unto you."|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Yes, especially if it is a type with leads to unintended miscarriages, as you have mentioned.  I would recommend praying to Mary, Jesus' mother, for spiritual guidance.    God bless!  Dave|`|3ViTBLovaa	according to the bible, acting out of lust is a sin. Which is what you do when you procreate. So now that you have your desired number of children you should abstain from sex completely, and deny your biological urges. There's nothing in the bible about birth control because they didn't have reliable methods back then. Unless you count leather condoms, herbs, and the withdraw method. The first one was painful and unpopular, the second not very reliable, and the withdrawl method isn't mentioned anywhere in the bible as a sin. Only when that one guy used it to directly disobey god. I think something about providing his brother's wife with a child, and he didn't want to so the Lord killed him. But no back then you were encouraged to multiply and spread Christianity. But right now we are overpopulated. Birth control doesn't kill anything. The only reason its considered a sin is because it allows the acting out of lust without the consequence of pregnancy. And if your going to have sex anyway, having too many kids to take care of is more of a sin then using any type of birth control. So really birth control is the opposite of sinning.  I can't give you an answer based on scripture because there's nothing in scripture against birth control. I assure you the ancient jews and the early Christians used whatever methods available at the time when they didn't want any more children.|`|6QheioCMaa	I don't believe birth control in and of itself is a sin, think how many children there would be, from all income brackets and backgrounds,  and how many more children would be suffering.     the Bible says that anything that is apart from faith, is sin. God gives each one of us a measure of faith, certain gifts, and abilities. God gave you everything you need to be a good mother to all of your children. And if having babies for 20 years was part of His plan for you, you would have the faith to do it and would have known it for a long time because you would WANT to do it,    Some woman have the desire for 12 or 15 children and are able to do it. Me, I could never do it, that's not my purpose and or my desire. God had other plans for me to do with my life besides raising children. I had 2, they are grown now, and I knew in my own heart, that if I didn't do something about it, I'd be raising children all of my life and unable to do the other things, that I knew the Lord wanted me to do with my life, so I used birth control.    I would say, that you know in your own heart how many children you can handle taking care of, and how much you can handle.  With more, comes more responsiblities.     I don't believe the Lord would want us to bring children into this world if we KNEW we would have trouble handling other responsibilities on top of raising more children. I think it would be sinful in God's eyes,  if we continued having children, that might cause other responsibilities or other family members to be neglected or cause our physical health problem or cause our well being to suffer from it. "Whatever is not of faith is sin", and there's no faith in that.    He wants for you to be strong, and happy and healthy too.  Having children is meant to be a blessing.     As wives/mothers, I just don't think He expects us to take on more than we know ourselves, our spouse or other members in the family can't handle.      "..........anything that is not done in faith is sin" ROMAN 14:23    **If God wants for you to have more children, He will give the desire and you will have everything that would be required to raise them.  Including faith & assurance.  You won't have any doubts.    Blessings!|`|2ieiGIhTaa	With 6 billion people in the world, birth control is a necessity.

It stopped the eggs from being fertilized juts like tylenol stopped these bad *** head aches.    ss|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	I'd say that NOT using birth control is a sin.      there are 6.6 billion people on this planet.    Oh- the bible doesn't say anything about birth control because the bronze age goat herders that wrote the book hadn't a clue about condoms, STDs, IUDs, the pill, or (quite obviously) human sexuality.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Check your Bible.  I'm sure it says nothing about it.  Make your own decisions in life.|`|ihSvdnOvaa	No. There is but one sin and that is rejecting the Christ, who is Satan.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	In the old testament, yes.    The same old testament that tells you eating shellfish is morally wrong.    It is a sin if you believe the pope is infallible. The same pope who brought a bishop back but had to kick him out when he learned he denied the holocaust.    Look, this whole thing is just retarded. Really it is. If using birth control to keep your number of children manageable between two legally married adults is grievously immoral in anyone's worldview I don't know what to tell you.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Birth control pills prevent an egg from being released; if it isn't released, it can't be fertilized.  The hormones in it simply cause the part of the cycle where the egg "matures" in the ovary to be skipped.      The bozos who talk about birth control that kills a fertilized egg have no idea how "the pill" works.  Go on the pill, and have children when you choose.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Why not have your tubes tied after you have your last child? There's no reason you should be a slave to your fertility. Birth control is not a sin.     The earth doesn't need more people. If you want a large family there are plenty of kids who need loving permanent homes. They are  worth the challenges they will bring to the table.|`|OMDLu028aa	I think it's great you're trying to follow God's word.    Personally, I think it is a sin. I definitely don't judge people who use it because it's hard to see how it is a sin, but here's my reasoning:    Sex is a gift from God.There are definitely proper ways it is supposed to be "used". For example, no sex before marriage. With the gift of sex comes the beautiful gift of procreation. Honestly, think of that potential!! It's amazing!!! To me, it's an insult to God to take this beautiful gift of sex, take only the part you want out of it, and shove the rest of it back in His face. To me, that's what contraception is saying. To use his gift properly is to   1)to enjoy it AND   2)trust God to give you a child only when He feels you are ready. But you should always be open to the possibility.    I know I will never use artificial contraceptives. I trust that God will give me a child only when I'm ready. And NO! he is not expecting you to pop out 20 kids. There's something called Natural Family Planning, that, when used effectively, can be just as, if not more effective than condoms. It's using a woman's cycle (i.e.-something God gave you) to plan when you think you should have kids. The difference is you are not seeing a child as a curse and will still be open to it if God so chooses. I know plenty of families who use it and only have 1-3 kids. I also know some who have 8+, but I know they always wanted that many. It just requires more self-control (i.e. what you do when you wait until marriage to have a sex in the first place)    So ya, that's my view. Again, I understand how that morality is a bit confusing, but hopefully you'll sort of get what I'm saying.    Good Luck!!|`|MAAxboH7aa	Don't think so...    I think it is even more of a sin to have more kids when you can't afford it.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Go forth and multiply.  The bible says you have to have 20 kids.|`|ybFg4umCaa	The pope thinks it is a sin, I think it is common sense. Use it if you don't want to fall pregnant|`|27r4Cw4Zaa	If you believe God's word then using birth control is considered "Spilling of the seed" and it is an abomination unto the Lord.    Hosea 9:10-17; Exodus 23:25-26; Deuteronomy 7:13-14  In the Old Testament, God punishes Israel for corruption by preventing childbirth and pregnancies.|`|AA11908076	Technically it is...ask your preacher, he'll be able to help you. There are classes your church offers called "natural fertility" they help you work around your period so you don't get pregnant. I don't think that's 100% effective, but it is a sin. :/|`|SPNHhFXoaa	No.

87f3a97394d3a4fe5774bb71ca8eef5caa	As a Catholic, you should always read and interpret your Bible using the Catechism of the Catholic Church. It teaches that there are four senses of scripture: Literal, Allegorical, Moral, and Anagogical~ God bless!|`|KHVu10bMaa	Yes. Always take the bible literally unless it otherwise specifies in the text. Some things are not literal (mostly in prophecy) and are but signs and symbolism. Mostly if it says " a sign" or something to that nature before the text then it is to be taken figuratively. But always let your heart lead. If your hearts says it is literla do not challenge it.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	No, you DON'T read the bible literally in all cases. Remember, the Old Testament especially was assembled using writing techniques that incorporated truths alongside legendary events. The way that the scholars of the faith have come to understand this is by carefully studying and taking the biblical stories apart by similar writing style and technique.     After this they are able to extract the parts that were allegorical and the parts that were purely historical. there are many good books on this that your priest can recommend if you want to study this in depth for yourself. If not, simply talk with your priest to help understand it, He's trained in this stuff.     The dates in the Hebrew Scriptures are often reliable. The Hebrew tradition of temporal documentation was accurate enough, even if at times it seems skewed due to evolving understanding of time and aging in their culture.     We know, for example, the dates of the reign of King David, which is a historical element of the Hebrew Scriptures. Abraham's tale, which is mostly historical with certain story-driven elements incorporated by the J source, has less specific dating possibilities, though an approximated timeframe can be established.    Ask your priest more, he can explain it. Certain things we date just for the sake of being complete, such as the Genesis story, which is not a literal event, but an allegorical story.    Good luck, read and ask questions. I did when I was a kid.|`|fHGIvF7saa	Are you a Catholic?  Here is the answer.  Things that look like they are real stories, or real statements are true.  Things with weird animals etc. are prophecy.  Which most all have been fulfilled.   Either the Bible is true or it is fiction, You have to find that for your self.  I personally found out a lot from a bible study with the Seventh day Adventists which knocked my socks off  You might want to try them.  Truly with only an open mind and prayer can you find the truth.  As far as the dates depends on what they tell you.  One should never, never, listen to just one source at first.  Once you see the grand picture God has spelled out then you will know|`|XsTJPMHqaa	A previous answer-er has it right. Scripture is interpreted differenlty based on the passage. Your prof. is the first Catholic I've heard of believing in Creationism, but nevertheless it is a theory allowed to be held by The Church. It is also possible he was using the phrase "Creation" in reference to the time the Jews held to be creation if you're talking OT. They would have, after all, based their chronology on their beliefs.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	You are studying the Hebrew scriptures. You are probably seeing their dating system.|`|2RygPGRaaa	Not a Catholic, but yes you should take the Bible LITERALLY. If you can't believe what you read, then what can you believe? If you have questions, you need to seek out the answers until they are answered. This is how your faith grows. If your priests are telling you not to believe the bible as literal, you need to find a new church, one that is bible based, on the LITERAL Bible. It makes a huge difference.

UIT1khqtaa	it's a short form for 'comment-allez vous'  which literally means - 'how are you?'    so, it's not rude at all.  vous is for formal use. which means that you're a stranger and that has nothing in common before. or if you're older or professional.    to answer, you have to simply say whether:  - ca va bien, merci. et toi? [very good, thank you. and you?]    OR    - mal, tres mal. merci. [bad, very bad. thank you.]    similarly,  'comment allez-vous' is the same as...  - ca va comment?  - comment ca va?  - ca va?  - comment es-tu?|`|8ssiOsDzaa	it's an abbreviation of the expression "comment allez-vous" which means how are you. french people use this abbreviation when they're familiar with someone, like instead of using the whole expression. so it's a nice expression!  the answer to it is "ca va bien merci, et toi?" which means "i'm fine thank you, and you?"|`|4N91sG5Iaa	goggle it|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	if that person is a friend, then it's not rude    actually, doesn't mean anything, he wanted to say, I think, "comment allez vous?"    just because he's using "vous" which is formal, I will definitely discard the possibility of rudeness.

The original arms of South Australia were granted in 1936.  They had supporters (a woman holding a  horn of plenty  and a male shearer holding scissors and wool).      The new arms were granted in 1984.  The news arms have a Piping Strike, the symbolic bird of the region.  They have no supporters.  Supporters are optional for government entities, and it may have been an artistic decision.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Because it is the land of the barbie, and they kill and eat the two animals depicted on their coat of arms and flag; an international distinction for them.    You may call Australians anything, but late for dinner.  They have their priorities all straight.

One of many reasons that i am not religious is because i know that a being of "ultimate wisdom" would never put people through the pain that comes with life.|`|UyTYeYLMaa	Here's the deal: this world has pain, obviously. Why? Because there's love. Love has the greatest value in the universe; no one can argue that. Since we have the ability to love, there also comes the ability to hate, and sin. That's what brings pain and suffering.     So, to answer your question, ultimately pain can be blamed on God, since He's the one who allowed us to love. But without pain, we wouldn't have hate; without hate, we wouldn't have love; and love is more precious than anything else.

Victimization through sexuality is wrong. This includes sex with children, animals, the mentally retarded and anyone who does not freely give consent. Promiscuity can be used to victimize people, and the media (visual and music) practices victimization through sexuality as a routine activity.    Heterosexuality (I've always been one of these)  is the mammalian default; I see homosexuality and bisexuality as variations that appear (and probably proliferate) as an escape valve for sexual energy that is useful for population control. Humans are by nature serially monogamous; culture imposes long-term monogamy.|`|brX80VS0aa	All sexuality is natural and should be regarded as such.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	Sexuality is a perverse dillusion.

Dave|`|2aMCV2yPaa	As a Christian, I believe what the Bible says about any sexuality that deviates from heterosexuality--that any deviation is wrong. That said, sexual sins are not the only sins mentioned and no person is without sin. While I've no problem with recognizing a particular sexual practice as sinful, it's important to refrain from judgment of the person himself. After all, I've not walked the proverbial mile in his shoes. I believe that God is concerned not only with my ability to recognize sin, but how I treat the sinner as well. I try to look at any sin from a biblically balanced (though that phrase may seem oxymoronic to some) perspective.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Human sexuality is a wonderful thing and a gift from God. It's important to express your sexuality with someone whom you truly and completely love, and whom your sexual relationship is a part of an overall lifelong relationship of love, trust  and giving.    Homosexual tendencies in any capacity are a mis-aligning of the pneumatic self-identification with the somatic and psychic. Like physical or mental disorders, the spiritual displacement causes a deep-seeded confusion in the person, resulting in unnatural desires.     Homosexuality is a difficulty that many people must bear. It is not inherently sinful to be homosexual, but to act out this unnatural desires IS sinful, as it dismisses the value of the loving and authentic relationship between married partners.     I personally believe that far less people in the world are as deeply homosexual as they claim. A combination of horrendous supposedly scientific writings, combined with a society that dehumanizes the body to an instrument for pleasure, has motivated people who have slight misalignments that could be coped with, and twisted them to pursue unwholesome relationships.    Those who are bisexual can still enjoy healthy, loving relationships in the most natural and God-oriented manner, but they are pushed by societal ideals towards incorrect relationships. Of course they aren't the only ones. Heterosexuals are harmed just as much by this culture, pushing people into having relationships that are harmful from the start, tricking them into thinking temporary sexual fulfilment is true happiness, and denegrating their bodies only to lead to misery later in life.

Buddhism and Taoism, like other religions, aren't based on empirical evidence. They make claims that the universe operates a certain way via standards that are normally restrained by common sense; claims that are not based on any sort of inductive logic.    As far as ethics is concerned, there is much to be learned from every religion, Buddhism and Taoism especially. Morality is never restriained by learning. :)|`|f61TFB6taa	Buddhism states that since you cannot control pain around you to alleviate your suffering you must stop desiring things, even food, sleep, or water. If you don't desire that at all then you wont feel any more suffering. I agree with that but I don't necessarily practice it since I really like to eat, drink, and sleep more than I absolutely need just like every other normal person.    Also Gautama Buddha decided one day to abandon his family to find inner peace so I think that is kind of crap considering his message of alleviating suffering...|`|Z9hcP2b5aa	Buddhism is based upon watching truth inside your body , mind & emotions and then overcome them. Any imagination or belief is discarded, howsoever good it may seem. Slowly you become aware of more subtle truths . The idea is to open the window of mind.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	I am a former atheist and agnostic... I am Christian now but still have trouble with some of their practices.  When I was Atheist Buddhism was a possibility for the simple reason it is a philosophy more than a theology.  However I didn't like any ideas of conformity dealing with spirituality.  I didn't think there was a spiritual side to us but organized anything slightly religious drove me crazy.|`|tBwdVpG4aa	As an atheist, I don't take Buddhism seriously.  I have the same problem with it that I have with other religions.  It says there's an afterlife but offers no proof.      I don't know that much about Tao.  It appears to be mainly about putting one's will in accord with nature, of which it is part.  That makes sense.  But traditional Taoism also includes a bunch of deities that do not exist.

oL6FUbshaa	Actually, the Bible tells us why dinosaurs got so big       Reptiles never stop growing   It's just a simple biological fact that reptiles grow all their life and never  stop until the day they die.   When you are 17 or 18 years old, you stop growing. You stay that height the rest of your  life. Reptiles don't do that. They just keep on growing and growing as long as their lifespan  will enable them to. In other words, the longer they live, the bigger they grow.       Look at the genealogies from Adam and Eve up until Noah   You'll find that just about everyone back then lived to be 900 years old   Adam died at 930 years of age   Noah died at 950 years of age   Instead of dying at 80 or 90 like people today, they died at 800 or 900  which is about 10 times longer then the average lifespan today       If people lived 10 times longer back then, so would lizards   Whatever it was that allowed people to live 10 times longer back then, more than likely  it would not have effected just people. It would have effected the whole  ecosystem, including lizards.       If lizards lived longer, they would have grown much bigger   If lizards lived 10 times longer back then, and reptiles never stop growing until the day they die,  then you can imagine how big they must have gotten. Reptiles in the day of Adam and Eve  would have been absolutely enormous. Lizards in Noah's day would have been huge!   Scientists have found fossilized remains of crocodiles that reached up to 40 to 50 feet in length   Fossilized Remains of sea turtles have been found that reached enormous sizes, much bigger than any   sea turtle today.       What caused dinosaurs to fossilize?       Fossilization is a very rare and unusual occurance, not an everyday event   The usual animal that dies in a forest, under most normal circumstances, does not become a fossil,  and neither does the usual creature that dies in a sea or a lake. The dead creature just floats and   disintigrates. It's body is destroyed by predators, bacteria, and the elements.   According to the best available evidence, animals and plants cannot become fossils unless they are  buried relatively quickly and deeply in the appropriate materials       What conditions would be most ideal for the kind of massive fossil formations found in the sediments?   Creation Scientists believe it would be a violent, global flood catastrophe.   Dinosaur remains worldwide are associated with water-laid sediment       The fact that we are digging up the remains of gigantic reptiles and lizards up out of the ground, most of which are completely  fossilized, this gives us ample scientific evidence that living things really did live 10 times longer back then, and there  really was a worldwide flood.       Dinosaur remains do not contradict the Bible, they confirm it!         How does radiometric dating work?       It doesn't!   Radiometric dating methods have been found to be very questionable and many times inaccurate   According to the Journal of Geophysical Research, new rock in the form of hardened lava flows produced  estimated ages as great as 3 billion to 10.5 billion years, when they were actually less than 200 years  old.   According to Science Magazine, shells from living snails were carbondated as being 27,000 years old.   The million year age estimates that are assigned to dinosaurs by evolutionists are presented to the public  in such a way to where they seem to be scientific fact, when in reality they are actually quite  theoretical       Not all scientists agree that dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before man.   Creation Scientists suspect that dinosaurs did not become extinct until about 3 or 4 thousand years ago,  sometime within the history and memory of mankind.   The flood in Noah's day occurred approx. 4,400 years ago.       Not all the dating methods agree with those million year age estimates   If you carbondate dinosaur bone tissue, you'll find it to be only a few thousand years old.    However, evolutionary scientists purposefully will not carbondate dinosaur bone tissue because  they know it will give them an age estimate of only a few thousand years.   Since this doesn't match their assumption of millions of years based on the Geological Column, they won't   even bother to carbondate them. Instead they'll use other forms of radiometric dating like potassium-argon  or uranium-lead, which will give them the million year age estimates they are looking for based upon their   pre-concieved idea of evolution.|`|K91tfiLCaa	Conservapedia has an actual photograph of Jesus riding a dinosaur.    Giz|`|QZaR2Ueoaa	It's possible that dinosaurs co-existed with humans before the flood. After the Flood, there were only humans and animals.  What's wrong ifGod really created everything in 6 days? (7th day is for rest)  For the common people, it's hard to believe that everything was made in such a short time.|`|WVXHQv4Faa	In the book of Genesis, the first chapter that opens with God designing the earths function like water, wind, sun, darkness, living creatures and humans counts off in 7 days. On the 7th day God rested. Yes impossible, if for God! So what could these days represent? In Revelation it reads a day equals a 1,000 years! Now that makes more sense, 6,000 years to transform the earth into an planet that could support life, including large creatures that could control the huge amounts of vegatation that would be growing out of control until the earth became more populated by humans.   The flood, which came during Noah's day put an end to all the dinasours, it essentially drowned through out most of the earth and froze them on the polar ice caps (Mammoths have been discovered with food still in their mouth on the ice caps perfectly preserved).   Most of mankind was wiped out and the dinasours right along with them.   Jesus came to the earth much later, about 1,000 year later according to the bible chronology. So Jesus never had a chance to ride a dinasour but he did see them created when he was by Gods side during creation!|`|JLfSKYPJaa	Modern man which means related to you and me was created less than 6000 years ago during the replenishing of earth or the creation in the bible. the dinosaurs you speak of were dead in the ground ,remnants from the earth that once operated with a different law of physics than the world now. At some point in that period humanoid type creatures co existed with them, the proof is in the ground. Once you realize this fact there is no longer a great divide between religion and science. Which is logical for there can be only one truth, if it is true in one it is true in all. The world of old with animals or life branching off in different directions (evolution) And the new world where animals or life is only born after their own kind generation after generation as the new law of physics as mandated by the creator of the new world.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	The dinosaurs died in the flood, so would have been long gone by the time Jesus was on the scene.

But if you read the Bible, you'll see God has no problem wiping people off the face of the Earth. Noah found favor with God and he and his family were spared. Moses wouldn't allow God to wipe out the human race. God wanted to and start over with him (Moses). There are teachings in the Bible (although I can't seem to remember where) about man before Adam. He was just the first of our kind.

What about plants?    We have to kill, its impossible not to.  But I'd say the best way is to cause the least amount of suffereing in the world that you can (and I believe animals, plants, and even simpler life forms experience suffering, not just humans:  or at least I don't know that they don't so think its best to assume that they do)|`|d17dab2f5223f525668cd6b49aa634e2aa	Killing can be justified in the cases of punishing criminals.

I think there are instances where no woman should be forced to bring a child to term. What if she was raped, even worse, raped by her own father or other family member? No one should be able to tell her "too bad, abortion is wrong".|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	Some cases where killing is an option, in my opinion:    1) To alleviate chronic, unwanted, or end-of-life suffering (i.e. euthanasia of an animal or a person)    2) In defense against lethal bodily harm (i.e. defending yourself from someone who is trying to kill you.  "Harm None" does NOT mean "Be a Victim")    3) As a punishment for murder (I firmly believe that if you intentionally take someone else's life in an unprovoked, deliberate manner, your own life is forefit)    4) For survival (i.e. killing animals for food, either by humans or by other animals)    In all cases, the killing should be done in the most humane way possible, and to avoid inflicting intentional additional suffering.|`|c0d447d5427083fdc0a9fc2ceec2786aaa	No, God gives to us 10 rules ,one of them is  Not Kill.|`|6e7bc0d334b5f4362202aa7db743ee5daa	tough question. i personally belief that murder is justified sometimes. when a person is killed for no good reason then the murderer should be killed. war is justified murder because if you don't kill the enemy then you will be killed. or in the event of a crime that pits your life against the criminal then murder is justified if it will save your own life.  personal standards rule my beliefs. not very religious now, but i was raised in a roman catholic household.|`|434f308c3063deeecbf8c9fd06930e2eaa	Here's the answer I ask myself when I think about that: did Jesus kill anyone? He didn't. Since I'm Catholic, I ask myself another question: can I think of a saint that killed anyone, and didn't ask for forgiveness or feel that they had done something wrong? I can't. I think human life is sacred - we can all agree on that. The question becomes when that life begins (abortion), and if it's ever okay to end it (death penalty or mercy killing). I don't think either is justified, but people have a lot of different opinions on it.   I think the idea of killing animals is up to your own beliefs a lot more. Some people argue that God gave man dominion over all the animals. I would answer that "dominion" doesn't mean that your necessarily have to eat them. In fact, if you choose not, you're doing a good thing, regardless of whether or not people believe it's necessary: you're making a sacrifice.   I believe all war is wrong. If you're interested, check out the Catholic doctrine about "just war". It has good reasons, and though I think that with the advent of Gandhi we can accomplish anything without using war, the doctrine of just war is a great compromise.|`|fe74480b9415416f1ea44283895ebb1faa	Morally killing shouldn't be justified at all as all life is sacred and taking of someone else life is wrong. However, there will be times where people are forced to make a decision on whether to take life. Would you kill to defend yourself against a killer (kill a murderer in self defense)? Would you kill to defend others (kill a suicide bomber before he blows himself)? Would you kill as a deterrent (death sentence for drug traffiking)? In such cases, it wouldn't be a question of being justified or not but whether killing is needed, or not needed.|`|a0b7868e708e65e91e0695199525dffeaa	In biblical times it was an eye for an eye and usually up to the family members of the victim.

2c6d6656c90472510989452b9715ab48aa	Il Regno Unito  una terra magica ed elegante che si  sempre distinta per la sua cultura e la sua storia, ricca anche di misteri. Il pi famoso di questi  sicuramente quello del Lago di Loch Ness. In questo lago le acque sono nere e fosche, alimentate da corsi d'acqua talmente torbidi che anche le trote hanno un colore nerastro. Tali acque custodiscono gelosamente alcuni segreti tra i quali quello di un terribile mostro o, come dicono alcuni, un dinosauro che  sopravvissuto al passare dei secoli. Oggi di tanto in tanto vengono fatte rilevazioni al sonar nelle profondit nel lago, che hanno rivelato il movimento di masse voluminose a profondit notevoli. Gli scettici ritengono che queste siano dovute a sollevamenti di alghe e sedimenti sul fondo del lago. Altre leggende riguardano i castelli di origine medievale che sorgono al centro di immense distese di prati verdi e spesso sono avvolti dalla magia e dal "soprannaturale". Fra i pi incantevoli troviamo quello di Leeds Castle e quello di Caerphilly Castle. Il primo sorge su due isolotti al centro di un lago abitato da cigni neri; questa ambientazione ne fa un castello da sogno e per questo non poteva certo mancare la presenza di un fantasma, che in questo caso  quello della Green Lady. Curiosit inglesi Harrod's  il grande magazzino per eccellenza ed  anche il pi famoso, dove si pu comprare di tutto: infatti il suo slogan  "omnia omnibus ubique" ("tutto per chiunque dovunque"). Qui  possibile depositare denaro e prendere in prestito libri; ci sono parrucchieri per cani e un'agenzia di pompe funebri. In questo grande magazzino vennero installate le prime scale mobili di Londra, nel 1890. La notizia Sapete perch gli inglesi guidano a sinistra ? La risposta immediata : perch in Inghilterra non c' stata la ... Rivoluzione Francese. Ma andiamo con ordine. Fin dall'antichit le strade strette inducevano a tenersi sulla sinistra: era pi facile cos sguainare con la mano destra la spada o un'altra arma per difendersi dal nemico. Comunque nessuno, fino al 1300, aveva imposto leggi riguardanti la guida a sinistra; tutto cambi con il papa Bonifacio VIII, che obblig i pellegrini a tenere la sinistra e questa imposizione si diffuse in tutto il mondo cristiano. Ma durante la Rivoluzione Francese Robespierre, come sfida alla Chiesa, impose ai francesi di guidare a destra. E Napoleone, pur essendo mancino, non si preoccup di modificare la regola, anzi la estese a tutta l'Europa. Per lui non riusc a conquistare l'Inghilterra, cos nell'Impero Britannico si continu a guidare a sinistra. Vivere a Londra Per visitare Londra occorre ben pi di un sabato e una domenica. Bisogna soggiornare in questa citt un paio di mesi per conoscerne dal vivo i miti e i riti. Sarebbe simpatico conoscere alcuni dei pettegolezzi sulla famiglia reale leggendo il "Sun", uno dei pi diffusi giornali inglesi. A Londra  molto importante il rito pomeridiano del t, che  la bevanda nazionale da quando l'India era colonia inglese. Lo sapete che  stato in Gran Bretagna che per la prima volta comparvero le mode e gli atteggiamenti di contestazione, dalla minigonna ai capelli lunghi per i ragazzi? Ed  in Inghilterra che  partita la Rivoluzione musicale del pop-rock, con quello che alcuni critici considerano uno dei fenomeni musicali pi interessanti del XX secolo: i Beatles. Un posto molto speciale, dove cogliere dal vivo immagini per capire Londra e l'Inghilterra, sono i parchi cittadini dove  possibile sostare, nelle tiepide giornate di tarda primavera e d'estate, e spesso gli inglesi si stendono sui prati per prendere il sole. In questo articolo abbiamo cercato di "descrivere" nel miglior modo possibile tutto ci che c' da sapere sul Regno Unito.

When the 10 tribes were scattered abroad, most of them crossed over the Caucasus Mountains (that is why they are called Caucasians).  Many settled in Europe and later settling The US, and Canada.  Our brothers include the Irish, German, and Polish to name a few.    GOD is not a racist.  He made us all and saw that it was good.  He also has appointed Kings and Queens of all races of the Earth, which will take their offices after The LORD's Day, And Judgment has been rendered.
NUcIiXnBaa	Alright! First! Find out if she is bisexual before you do ANYTHING along the lines of telling her!!! If she's not then you could totally push her away.    I started having feelings for my friend when I was in 8th grade... But shrugged it off then. Then about a year ago, it started coming up again - I started having a crush on her, and came out to her that I was bi... She didn't mind at all, in fact her dad is bi, but I know for sure that she is straight! I wanted to tell her so badly that I had a crush on her, fantasized about kissing her... But, deep down I knew that telling her would only be a really bad idea! We've been friends for nine years and even though she has accepted my bisexuality doesn't mean that she wouldn't freak out if I told her that I had a crush on her.     Also, ask yourself what is more important - Your friendship with her, or the possibility of having something more with her. To me, my friendship was worth more. It wasn't something I wanted to lose.     I am not exactly sure how you should find out if she is bi... Unless you just do it kind of casually, like point out a chick that you think is attractive and ask her what she thinks, and if she says, "Oh yea she is..." Or something like that, then perhaps, jokingly say, "So would you kiss her?"... Or ask around...     Whatever you decide to do, I hope it turns out good for you!|`|onfTqFe4aa	I agree with the person above me. I was also in a similar situation (well I kinda still am). But the thing about it is, if you really feel strongly about her and really care about her and love her then 9 times out of 10 she already knows, without you even having to tell her. My advice like everyone else's is way out the possibilities. Are you willing to risk your friendship? It's easy for someone to accept who you are, but its a bit harder when their beliefs or feelings linger on the line. Im not saying don't do it, but mainly I just wanna say don't do it on Valentine's Day, becuase it's a special day that you'll remember whether it turns out for the very best or the very worst. Just do it on a normal day whereit might be a little easier to forget if things don't go according to plan.    hope it all works out|`|84bw3h7caa	yyy|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	aww.. i think that's cute.. wait three months when u look your best!!|`|abeHfpdZaa	you're a chick right.? that's kinda iffy unless you're positive she is also bi or gay.|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	honestly,  if she's "become distant" since you told her, she might not feel the same way..|`|GJb2OSrnaa	she feels close for your trusting her...but maybe got distant cuz she may feel your preference towards her...    she totally should accept you, but I wouldn't get you hopes up....u never know...  my best friend that the same thing happen to...(i have the same scenerio) she holds it over my head....we even had sum fun with each other..but she was jus bi curious..er i call it 20 80  LOL, but now she holds it over me... " the reason we were great friends Iz cuz YOU wanted ME...all kinda snooty about it.... forget that...drove me nutz...I liked her after I got to know her..but she pulled it the other way..saying I was attracted then pursued a friendship to get closer....

Johiu2cwaa	Smarter than you, obviously.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Atheist has nothing, inherently to do with smart.  It just has to do with an absence of god delusions.  Every single baby is born atheist, and nobody except their parents go around claiming that they are very smart.    If being atheist makes me look like a fool in your eyes, I can live with that.  Your opinions are just not a very important part of my sense of self worth.    And, yes, I would think your god hypothesis is sort of funny, if it wasn't so destructive.

Mas existem muitos que s?o muito inteligentes, cultos e sbios.    Mas n?o se pode generalizar, pois existem milhares de pessoas, n?o crentes, que s?o analfabetos.    Por exemplo, creio que voc n?o  crente. Mas h erros de portugus em sua pergunta:    "Por que quanto mais religiosos menos inteligente a pessoa se torna?"    O correto, meu amigo, seria assim:    "Por que quanto mais religiosos menos inteligenteS aS pessoaS se tornaM ?"    Ou assim:    "Por que quanto mais religioso menos inteligente a pessoa se torna"    N?o se utiliza, em uma mesma frase, singular e plural como voc usou.    E a? Voc  candidato a crente por causa disso?    Pense bem...

fd9ae9ce94db33af7591d24b07d343d1aa	I don't know if you could call it a fight exactly, but a week ago some Pikey nicked our football, and we all went in to try to get it back. He got away from everyone else and it was just me in his way. He tried to go into me with his shoulder, shouting 'WANNA PLAY RUGBY THEN', oblivious of the fact I have played rugby since I was seven, and taken people much larger than him down.    I wasn't going to try to flaw him though, I just tried to grab the ball of him, but when he held on tightly I pushed to the flaw and knocked the ball out of his hands. One of my mates went and grabbed it. When I was walking away he, being angry that I'd taken him, punched me in the back of the head. It didn't hurt, and I knew I'd won, so I didn't even look round at him, but several of my friends mocked him for his 'brave' sucker punch.    Later he came, with a dozen of his mates, and threw a bin at me, and challenged me to a one on one fight.    I knew the terms though, it was only ever going to be one on one if he was winning. So I just stood there and told him I wasn't going to fight him. Didn't work though, as he, his pride obviously torn to shreds just by me taking him down lightly, repeatedly tried to punch me in the face. He only succeeded three times, and none of them hurt, so when I saw a gap in the circle that had formed around us I just walked out, laughing at how such a small thing could offend someone so much.    Morals of the story: Pikeys are easily offended, and although you should always stand your ground, going into a fight usually makes the situation worse, as can be seen that I came out with not a mark on me, or any loss of face whatsoever.|`|96b1e9b236975c043013ac6118f8b712aa	I was a sphomore in high school and this guy kept doggin me about my bro bein gay. so as we were playin basketball during PE we played a little rough and he shoved me, i pushed back and we went at it.

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	People who expect to see hell may actually imagine hell is real, but that is extremely rare. If a person is really sick with guilt or brainwashed to fear the terror of a cruel god, he can imagine a hellish place temporarily, like a bad dream that carries over into death.     Go to http://www.near-death.com for lots more (and more accurate) information on the subject.    By the way, there's a lot of evidence from Jews who have had near-death experiences that they are in heaven, too, and sometimes are met on the other side by Moses and other Jewish prophets (Jesus not among them). "Heaven" is an equal-opportunity place, not reserved exclusively for Christians. And to turn the question back to you, hmmm, what does that tell you?|`|AA11417031	it tells you of undeniable proof that heaven and hell exists.|`|623a908782c29feac8a544a439a66e4baa	Use of imaging techniques like MRI has shown that near-death experiences can be duplicated with certain drugs.

AVxYA6Heaa	Hey sweets,  Maybe you should write her a letter, if talking to her face to face is to difficult or distracting take it out of the equation.  Sometimes writing down what you feel can be more powerful then talking face to face, this way there is not interruption either.  Psychologists use this as a tool sometimes for people that have had a close loved one die, and the person left behind has regrets, it really works to get your feelings out on paper and then give them away, it is a relief  I took some Psych classes for a past career, and that is something I picked up.

Thankfully, I was able to talk to the powers that be, and get things swapped back to "normal" for me.

If the apostles were lying about seeing the resurrected Christ, then why didn't they take back their story when they were individually being tortured to death? Every one of the apostles (Except John, who died a natural death in exile on Patmos), were killed for their faith. Wouldn't a liar recant this story to save his own life?     What did the apostles have to gain by making it all up? What good does fame do for a dead person?     I accept the apostles' story because the witnesses were creditable.    PS: Yes, I have heard the crack about suicide bombers, but the main difference between the modern bombers & the apostles are: (1) the bombers did not see Mommand personally, so they are not eye-witnesses to anything (Unlike Peter, & Paul, who claimed to see Jesus alive with their own eyes and then died rather than take it back); and, (2) the bombers are killing innocent people (others) for their faith, not suffering for it (I assume that blowing yourself up is quick & painless compared with being crucified.).|`|3381e18382f4c1b4fa4c9cb470d789fdaa	If you don't believe in GOD then why does it matter to you what a Christian believes?

They should be able to refridgerate the flower until you pick it up and provide a small, specially designed, container to put water in.    Failing this, buy your flower a day in advance and keep it in the fridge with water, and it should last the length of the play and trip, if handled carefully.    This is what they do for flowers that are made up in advance for weddings etc.    An alternative would be to buy a decent fake rose, and attach a card with ribbon, that way, your idol can keep the flower forever, everytime s/he sees it it will remind them of you, and it solves the problem of transporting a real one.    There are some very nice wooden roses available from gift shops.

It is in a parable where Jesus says that it is more difficult for a camel to go through the eye of the needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven (because the rich man all but refuses to share his wealth with the poor).  The "eye of a needle" was a small entry into the city that was next to a main gaet.  I always pictured a big castle door that has an alternative little door to enter through quickly so the whole huge door didn't have to be opened.  To say the least, it was impossible for the camel to go through the littler door since camels are rather large animals.|`|56e72ea74295dd6834ddb3da59577602aa	If you read the original it is not the eye of "The Needle" it is the eye of a needle.

Whether you believe it is a "person" or not doesnt matter because the moment the sperm and the egg become one it has breathed life into something that will eventually grow. Now some may claim that without the mother this living thing would not survive on its own but the same could be said for a new born. If a new born cannot survive on its own does that mean its not a worthy life? The key issue here is the mother. I believe in pro-choice which means i believe that since the fetus is taking refuge in the mother before being born it should be the mothers decision on whether or not it should stay there if the technology is available. Moraly, do i think abortion is right? not really, but i do believe that in some cases you must pick the lesser of two evils such as rape victims, poor reckless teens, very low income families, drug abusers, etc. Of course the negative side to this is that since we live in an equal society we must also provide this service to those who abuse it.|`|zR0Dcdevaa	I think it's murder.

Abortions will happen, whether it's legal or not.  The only difference is whether or not the MOTHER will survive; the fetus is dead either way, because girls/women WILL get abortions if they want one badly enough.  I grew up in the 50s, and saw a couple of friends die in the late 60s because they couldn't get a legal abortion, and their oh-so-Christian parents didn't teach them the basics of the conception process OR birth control because it might "give them ideas."  THAT it what is unconscionable, in my opinion - not the loss of a few cells that nobody wanted to start with.    I firmly support the feminist groups that teach each other how to DO abortions safely in preparation for a time when they might become illegal once again through the efforts of ignorant, illiterate fundamentalist Christians who've never seen what a botched abortion does to a woman.  The real charge of "murder" should be reserved for those who condemn a woman to back-alley abortions and death because of sepsis, when an abortion can be done safely and in sterile conditions.|`|736afc7cc6a4a8fd39900662c2379a91aa	How about if someone would have wanted to "off" you?

She asked the doctor if he would help her have an abortion because she had a 12 month old already and couldn't handle another baby.

Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing.      Has God ever stated that a person would be called to account for injury to an unborn child?    Ex. 21:22,?23: In case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul.       How serious is the willful taking of a human life for a reason not authorized by God?

To tell someone weather or not they should believe in abortion is like telling someone what God they shoul believe in. However, I do think that it is wrong if the woman is using abortion as a form of birth control. That is wrong to me, and should not be done.  If I knew I that I would not be able to take care of a child of mine, I would have an abortion because there are to many harmful things being done in adoption homes that no one hears about. People will get meolested, raped, abbuse, neglected and anything else you can think of in adoption homes. Yeah I know, not all of them all like that but would you really want to take a chance? Also, some babies grow up knowing they have a horrible life and hate it. Some of them, end up commiting suicide, wich is very sad.   And also, think about it. Would you like to be the baby with that horrible life? I know i wouldn't, which is part of the reason that i DO believe abortions are okay. Still, a woman should not be using this as a form of birth control and if you are able to have the baby and to take care of it and are stable enough for one then i don't think you should be having an abortion, but then again, im not someone to tell you what you should and should not do. And, i know everyone has their own persepective and i think everyone should respect each others opinions.|`|MejGuWr0aa	I believe it is killing a poor baby.

Anyways, abortion is very important. It wasn't until fairly recently (think revival of religion in the late, late 1800s) that abortion became a sin in Christianity. Until then, it was anything goes in that regard. Yes, many upstanding Christian women would get abortions without religious repercussions. When abortion is legal, there is less chance that people will be getting back alley abortions and the topic of babies is in the open. Raising a baby is not for everyone and nor is carrying a baby to full-term. For some, it is just not feasible and they should not have to deal with that for the rest of their lives. And, yes, for some women, abortion affects them deeply. For others, it is no big deal. I do not think it should be used as a form of birth control (seeing as there are cheaper and easier ways of offing fertilized eggs), but I will not make that choice for another woman- it is up to her and her alone.    Also, here's a question for those who think it is murder. What punishment would you assign the woman? Her doctor?|`|LwHPgAXgaa	I believe a women has the right to do what she feels best too do.

They shouldn't have a choice think about it, put your self in her shoes.|`|VgC5ip1xaa	Heh, I gave you a star, this is after all a massively controversial issue, how much more interesting can you get than asking for opinions on that?    Anyway, I personally am a pro-choice person. Contrary to popular belief, I don't think it's ok to just go ahead and kill babies because I'm evil and like to tango with satan every now and then; I just believe the repercussions of making abortion illegal would outdo any good.    First off, I think the whole "murder" argument is sort of ridiculous. The way I see it, you don't have sex, you don't have babies; you use birth control, you don't have babies; you get sterilised because you've had enough children, you don't have babies; you get an abortion, hey what do you know, you don't have babies. Claiming that abortion is murder is just semantics. In all of the above cases a potential child and life is prevented, and yet with the exception of birth control in some views, these things aren't considered evil. So why is abortion immoral? Because since the child has started to develop, it is valued higher than a potential life that has yet to form. It still has no thought processes, no emotions, no experiences; but because it's started to form it is therefore considered more valuable than the potential life you throw away when you prevent pregnancy. I don't see the point to this.    If these people are "pro-life" surely they wish to create and preserve life don't they? Even if you don't believe what I just said, you must also take into consideration, that if abortion is illegal, people will be a lot more cautious about getting unwanted pregnancies and be more likely to avoid them. Now at first you may be thinking "well isn't that a good thing?", and while I believe it certainly is, it doesn't necessarily help in preserving life. Think about it, with abortion legal, a baby is conceived and then aborted. With abortion illegal, that baby never even gets conceived in the first place, because the would-be mother isn't willing to take the risk if it's impossible to get it aborted. So either way, there is no life, yet anti-abortion people call themselves pro-life. I know of course that this doesn't apply to all cases, and some unwanted pregnancies will still occur, but I'm not done yet.    Now, what about the unwanted babies that are conceived and would normally be aborted? Surely they are all saved and everything is nice and wonderful now right? Wrong. Dead wrong. I don't know about America, but here in Australia, abortion used to be illegal, and when it did we had what were referred to as "backyard abortions". These were really horrible things, where women who didn't want children would try to kill it off themselves, since they couldn't get it done safely by a doctor. If people aren't legally allowed to do it in a safe way, they will still try, and there will be repercussions. I won't go into detail about how the abortions were performed, but I will tell you that they involved the use of the metal wires that are made into coat hangers. I'm sure you get the picture. These attempts at abortion, were highly unsafe, and not only killed the baby, but in many cases caused serious damage to the mothers. It could kill them, or make them sterile. There's something for the pro-lifers to consider, what about all the children in the world whose mothers have had abortions before? There are many people who've had abortions and then later decided to have children. If abortion was illegal, these mothers might have killed or sterilised themselves attempting the abortion themselves, and all those lives would never have come to be. Pro-life huh?    So there you have it. With abortion illegal, many of the aborted children pro-lifers attempt to "save" would never come to live anyway, and many other lives would be lost, or damaged; possibly enough to outweigh the number of supposedly "saved" lives. I would also like the point out that "pro-life" is a very unsuitable term and should be changed to "pro-babies" as many pro-lifers support the iraq war and hunting (for example, sarah palin). There are also the many cases I provided above, where pro-lifers completely disregard many lives besides the ones of aborted children. And to finish off, a quote I read on Y!A, which I personally thought was rather brilliant:    "Forcing a woman or young girl to gestate against her will is a form of slavery" - RU486|`|yxtIpZYFaa	I myself feel that its wrong... I know people say things like "I'm not ready for this".  But IMO there are plenty of want-to-be parents out there that would love to adopt and make great parents.    That's my OPINION.  You know, that thing that we're all entitled to.
zOP3LEc0aa	Hang out with many different types of people.  Try to hang with the popular kids,  but when it comes to them not even talking to you,  or inviting you places, stop.  If that happens they probley think you're following them around.    If someone talks bad about them, stick up for them.  If the word gets out about you sticking up for them,  they might like you more.    Just dont follow them around.

nQW1MSMpaa	It is normal during adolescence, and even afterward for some, to get aroused by the some features of guys. Generally it is the penis of other guys that causes arousal, but it can also be the butt (if you're a butt guy).    This doesn't mean anything other than you are normal, there is no need to feel disgust with yourself because there is nothing wrong with you. This may, or may not, pass after adolescence. Try not to pass judgment on yourself, take this one day at a time and realize that 'normal' comes in a variety of flavors, it isn't all vanilla.    Look at questions 17 - 18 in the link below.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	Wow you know I told myself that for years trying to be "normal" around your age I mean I told my self that exact same thing and to the girl I first came out to. Now I say  I'm gay and I know it and I know I knew it than I just didn't wanna fully admit it.

WHat do you mean you get disgusted with yourself? Do you mean you get disgusted at yourself when you are arousesd by males? Hey, you can't help it. Note that there really isn't an exact "girl personality" it's just a stereotype. Eventually you'll meet the person with the right personality. Don't  worry you'll find the right match if your keep you mind open. Don't be so hard on yourself. You should avoid forcing yourself to be something your not, or you'll find yourself extremly unhappy. If you want to be safe keep you options open, and instead of quickly declaring something.|`|8Pbevy7laa	Maybe your gay bi or just curious. It is very common to think this way when you're 13.

But for right now if guys turn you on and girls don't then yes that would make you gay.|`|PTdrapBjaa	That's exactly how i felt at 13 now that i think about it.

First of all do NOT be disgusted with yourself!   I think the reason that you are disgusted with yourself is because your dad has shown that personality and you have either learned it from him, or you are afraid that if you are bi he may show disgust towards you. Both are bad, and you should not be disgusted at yourself for this!    Secondly, you are bi. Or possibly even gay... Do you like ONLY the personalities of girls or are you aroused by them too? If you are aroused by them, then you are bi. But if you only like their personality, then you are more than likely seeing them as more of a friend and you are probably gay... But, don't worry so much about that part right now.    The first thing you need to work on is not being disgusted with yourself, because who you are attracted to is not something you can help. Embrace who you are!

Honestly, I only hear maybe 1 blonde joke every 6 months...because I laugh at them and move on. That's what you should do too.|`|Uy58ixnvaa	Ah, lighten up. Blonde jokes don't have an ounce of truth in them, and most people don't really believe in them anyway, with so many smart blondes out there. Blondes have been made fun of just like every other group/race out there. There are worse jokes.|`|bltgAc9Maa	Considering that I'm not a blond, then NO is my answer.    But I think the right person to answer that question is yourself. Do YOU feel offended by those jokes? If you do, then just ignore it. There's nothing you can do but just act mature and brush it off. Angry at the jokes themselves won't do any good for you, trust me. Just try to ignore it and move on with your life, that's the best thing that you can do.|`|iv9T4Ctgaa	It may be difficult, but you need to ignore it.  In our society, there has been and always will be (despite all the touchy-feelies out there) jokes with at least one ethnic group, religion, nationality involved.  My daughter is a blonde...had a 3.9 GPA in high school...while sporting braces.  She loved blonde jokes.  I'm 2nd generation American of Polish descent.  I love Polish jokes.  I was the butt of many jokes.  However, I let those jokes "bother me" like water runnign off a duck's back.  Self-deprecating jokes may help, but you must know exactly when top use them, otherwise, they bomb.  Research Henny Youngman's jokes, e.g., "I get no respect.  One time my parents got me a dart board with an automatic return."  Unfortunately, the "dumb blonde"  (aka "bimbo," aka "ditz") is a stereotype from many decades ago in the film industry.  "So...a rabbi, a priest and a minister walk into a bar..."  these type of jokes have also been around for many decades.  For the most part, nothing pejorative is ever intended, but people make create the pejorative meaning and start a ruckus, often citing damage to one's self-esteem because of the joke.  This type of mentality leads to radical, extreme midsets, e.g., in Maryland (?) kids in elementary school are forbidden from playing "tag."  Reason?  Being "it" will cause that person to develop a stigma and will damage their self-esteem.  Another example:  In some schools around the country, teachers are forbidden from using red ink to grade papers.  Reason?  Red is a "harsh" color and will damage the students' self-esteem.  (So will telling a student he/she is "wrong" if an incorrect answer is given to a question.)  Evergreen College in Olympia doesn't (or, at least didn't when I was in Olympia...looking for a college) issue grades.  Nope.  No A's, no B's, no C's.  Just "Pass" and "Incomplete," I believe.  As soon as I found out they didn't issue grades, I permanently crossed them off my list.  I depend on grades as a measure of my learning.  I compete against myself, not others.  Need another example?  In another school, in intramural sports, no one "loses."  Because losing lowers your self-esteem.    Think about what you said, i.e., "People tell blonde jokes around me because they know it bothers me."  Well, if you make them believe that it doesn't bother you, they may stop.  Then again, they may not.   That you're in honors/AP classes may make them feel jealous or inadequate, so they try to lower you to their level.  Life is not fair.    Thick skin is something you should learn to grow.  It will become like armor and help you in your future.    Remember..."Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."    In closing...Did you hear about the Hindu who went up to the hot-dog vendor?  He said, "Make me one with everything."      Good luck.|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	its just like black jokes and white jokes...its just a joke!|`|U6jZnE34aa	blonde jokes are true.

And it also pisses me off when some White Women try to measure up to their hair colors. I'm blonde so I have to be a hot, oversexualized, "exotic" bimbo.. I'm brunette so that automatically makes me intelligent and "serious".. etc etc... It's DEGRADING and idiotic...     Geesh... when will it stop!
263NkN3paa	I agree with you in that western culture is being blindly adopted by our Indian youngsters without pausing to think of the pros and cons of it.Becoming westernised doesn't necessarily mean that you are liberated.You must have heard of 'Swaymvar' in our Indian system where girls had the freedom to choose their grooms.So wasn't our culture modern?  It is necessary to take pride in your own culture and not blindly imitate the west.So Indian youngsters where is your ego guys?|`|mqSauKKvaa	It appears for the time being. But the 'ORIGINAL' Indian Culture (ANCIENT Indian Culture - not the modern one) is so STRONG that it will stand the test of time. It can counter-balance the negative sides - - if any - - of the Western Culture.     It just depends on how we can 'work out' for our country. For this, we are to eliminate our negative sides - the modern distortions - from the Ancient Good things.    If the concept of ET (Extra-Terrestrials / Aliens) can be considered superior to the Humans, then why can "we" not become like those ET's - here and now on this very planet earth - overtaking the USA, UK & CANADA ?? Who are those three countries - compared to the entire outer sky?    We the INDIANS now must target to become as developed as those fascinating concepts of the ET's. And through such a simulation, we  can conquer the heart of the World.     Let us all hope India rise back again. Use my NEW idea.    Best of luck...|`|XQYD48MYaa	In ancient india, women were more free and were able to choose husbands by themselves, unlike modern india, where parents choose for kids.     How can a culture that restricts freedom for women would be great ?    And the real problem is not culture being lost,......its you.....you are afraid to embrace freedom.|`|7XuEyRvNaa	And what makes you think the so-called outsiders respect our being prudes? What they respected was our tolerance. Our friendliness. Our assimilation of even foreign cultures(Portugese in goa, the muslims, the christians, the parsi/jews) as our own. Our ability to adapt and survive despite so many invasions. Most of the foreigners have this image that we are a very tolerant and loving society. That we have a joint-family system.    And much of that is gone now. No more joint families. We are no longer tolerant. Ram sene is a good example. We fool foreigners into thinking that we respect women, but Ram sene hooligans beat them up.     ------------------------------    Let me elaborate. Because I am sick of idiots coming up and babbling about western culture invasion and Indian culture!!!    A) What the hell do you mean by "western culture"? What is this western culture? With hundreds of countries out there, what is western culture for you? Bet you anything you can't even phrase it beyond, "girls wear skimpy clothes and girls goto pubs!"    B) What exactly pray thee, is the problem with public kissing? With billions of Indians pissing and shitting by road, spitting paan on walls, swearing and fighting, the numero "obscene" thing you find is two folks expressing love? Are you truly an idiot who equates kissing with sex and thinks people get pregnant by kissing? What next? A guy and girl talking, hurts your conservative ways? Govt. should make all girls sit at home?    If you are talking about us wearing western clothes, it is our grandparents and great grandparents who gave up the dhoti-kurta and put up rules in office about wearing suits. Believe me, lots of people would probably love to see women dress up as they did 500-1000 years ago.    You don't ask why Indian men all try to get a job in US/UK. But woe befall a woman for wanting to marry a NRI in US/UK.  Greed is justified only in men, right?     You are coming across only as a true male chauvinist prude pig who is unable to handle the idea of women doing as they wish, in a similar fashion to indian men.     There!

Many punjabies settled in US, UK, Canada.  Punjab's doaba region is know as "N.R.I belt", when these N.R.I visits India, also bring "western culture" with them. Our youth here trying to mimic these N.R.Is.  Also our own Bollywood is also responsible for spoiling our culture.  People in India becoming more materialistic. By performing stupid acts in public our youth want to show that, we are "Modern".

2PDmoZxNaa	The time I got into the most trouble was my freshman year in college when a campus cop caught me with a group of friends smoking an... illegal substance... in a car. He knocked on the window, when we rolled it down a cloud of smoke came billowing out. Not fun. We all had to have a long talk with the Dean... who put us all on probation for the entire year and we had to go to drug counseling... and the worst part... it happened in December right before Christmas break, so they sent a letter home to my parents explaining exactly what I did, and they received it the first day I got home. The worst was having to deal with my parent's wrath through the entire month of Christmas break. That was over four years ago and I still cringe when I think about how stupid I was.|`|AA11113174	Never been in trouble.

WaYZQhnHaa	Eye contact is fine, as long as the other person isn't invading my personal space.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	you shouldn't stop making eye contact because it shows that you know what you're talking about and that you have self confidence. people should learn how to maintain eye contact even when it makes them nervous. as for your professors, it's not considered to be  impolite if you make eye contact with them! on the contrary, it shows that you understand what they're saying and it's something you should keep on doing. nervousness will fade away in time and practice. personally, eye contact makes me feel strong.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	LOL    Keep eye contact with regular brief looks away, otherwise you're staring which makes you seem creepy.|`|LA5VwAvIaa	eye contact = confidence and truthfulness PERIOD.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	When I'm talking to someone, if I'm face to face I also keep eye contact. It makes you seem more confident and like you actually know what you're talking about. Looking away like you said is kind of rude. It makes it look like something else more interesting has caught your attention.    I get what you're saying about being nervous around professors and authority figures. Normally I have no trouble talking to them and asking questions, but sometimes if I'm like sitting at a desk while they're standing and if they're answering a question and keeping eye contact it makes me feel a little awkward.    Here's the bottom line:    When you're talking to someone always keep eye contact if possible. Most people, especially older people like professors will see it in a positive manner and will take you more seriously than someone who glances around. It's makes your conversation more engaging and meaningful. Don't worry about how you're making them feel, because majority of the time if you'll be respected for doing it.|`|beiztH7iaa	I love people who make good eye contact ... it makes me feel like I have their attention completely, and it can be quite mesmerising actually!  I'm really not sure why your friends and acquaintances look away or look down - perhaps they may feel the intensity of your gaze is a little too strong. I like it though! I think it makes people seem attentive; it also makes them appear honest and confident ... people who avoid eye contact can sometimes come across as shifty or insecure.   I find most people make very good eye contact with me, and I enjoy it. . I do know a couple who don't; they are people who I am aware are a little bit nervous of me (they have no reason to be!). It doesn't annoy me though - I just take it as a cue to be extra gentle and reassuring towards them.   I don't think you need to worry too much about the way you feel when you're involved in one-on-one interaction with your professors. Clearly, you are a little in awe of them, and that's very sweet, but you don't need to be - they've been where you are once too, and just want to help their students now. Try to make eye contact when you are speaking to them; it is perfectly fine to do so (as long as you're blinking and not staring!!). You won't always feel this nervous in their presence either. The more interaction you have with them, the less daunting it will seem.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	i tend to stare at peoples mouths or nose, lol  and every now and then i take a 2 second glimps at their eyes, lol  i have problems|`|q40k1KTvaa	I'm usually pretty shy around people, but if I know them really well I can look at them and make eye contact for a while.   But after a while I just feel weird.  Like, if someone I don't know very well tries to make eye contact with me, I look away.  I think that you should just casually look them in the eye once in a while, and sometimes just look around. Or look at your hands or something.   'cause I think sometimes it does make people uncomfortable.   But usually with professors, they don't really mind, I don't think. Because if you have respect for them, that really helps if you look them in the eye and say whatever you want to say.    Sorry if this is kinda like, yes do it, don't do it, yes do it, type of thing.   But I guess it just depends on what situation you're in.
6Whz1p5Eaa	The body of Christ has bigger fish to fry right now than minor debates over predestination.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	the argument of Calvinism was set up to battle the arminian view, and doesnt help or hurt your Salvation, it only gives us something to argue about instead of sharing Christ to the lost|`|0A7xLrz2aa	Because the early Church Fathers were Catholics and not Calvinists.  Calvinism IS heresy.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	I don't have a deep knowledge of the early theologians, but from the cursory looks at the corresponding Wikipedia entries, I think Calvin would have largely agreed with them.  Iraeneus' wrote against gnosticism, and Calvin would have had no argument. Also no argument against the concept of Trinity. And Calvin would also agree with and quote Mark, supposedly written by Barnabas.    Yes, salvation doctrine is extremely important when it comes to witnessing.  The "free will" side would by definition have to congratulate Man as well as God since both share in the salvation process.  Calvin points out God's foreknowledge, predestination, and effectual calling in bringing the sinner to repentence. Grace comes before faith, in other words, rather than after it.    And in this grace, the Christian has the assurance that God will not let them go.  Those who believe for a short while and fall away, were not chosen in the first place.  It's important to remember though that we do not know who is saved and who is not, neither do we place ourselves any higher than Hitler or Saddam in our ability to merit Heaven.  Arminian belief generally denies the ability to merit heaven, but advocates "all you have to do" salvation which is an internal contradiction.

ry2XcFm6aa	We're ASIAN dude...P.I. is in Asia....it's just people are confused because we don't look mongoloid (East Asian Origin) If a Filipino looks east asian then it simply means he/she is mixed.    Reasons why people call us Pacific Islanders:  - Most of us look like one. (Hawaiian stuff like that)   - Truth about is is because our ancestors were Austronesians (indigenous to ocenia and southeast asia, Pacific islands).    Ok now there is no such thing as a Filipino race...its a nationality...Filipinos can look east asian, Brown (native Islander), or even Spanish (latin look)....but yes dude we're asian because we are in Asia. Asia is a big continent so it doesn't mean they're all Chinese coz that's what people tend to think.    link: These are the countries that have Austroensian ancestors. (the ones inside the circle)  http://www.omnivoyage.org/Image/chris_pa...|`|r8rykCkGaa	My son, Jon, read all the history on this subject and he says they have a lot of Spanish blood in them and that is why their names are Spanish names but there are some who are Asian and some who are pacific islanders, there is a mixture.|`|lWobDwmnaa	im half filipino and i ask alot of people that. i think we're just both.  but idk|`|AA11700517	I consider them as Asians because Philippines is in Asia. But most Filipinos have Spanish blood, so I'd say those are Eurasians specifically.|`|2kR4sX48aa	fillipinos are awesome asian i think|`|HimBbU6caa	My best friend is Filipino, and he is very much Asian. It's true that The Philippines was a Spanish province at one time, but that European influence is virtually long gone. Most Filipino's speak more than one dialect of their native language, but only a very few speak Spanish. Pacific Islanders also have completely different facial features. I can tell a Filipino apart from a Pacific Islander with relative ease....usually. Some Filipinos look more or less Asian than others, but I have never met a Filipino who looked like a Pacific Islander.|`|lhLGeCrtaa	Filipinos, actually nor Philipinos. Asians, I'm sure, though with a mix of Spanish heritage, Malay, Hindu, Indonesian, Chinese.|`|pfke6Jieaa	they are asian (i know many filipinos).|`|qahczCNCaa	I don't know much about the Filipino culture, but I know that east Asian cultures usually have something in common.

I'm not sure what they officially are though.|`|8VDoimSLaa	Asians...just like all the others are trying to say, since we do belong in Southeast Asia. And MAN!!! you are Filipino and you don't know that?? I guess you are more American than Filipino (or wherever you are from, I'm a Filipino living in New Zealand.)    And yeah...there is no Filipino race. We are a hodge-podge of nearly everything, since Filipinos in general seem to marry off foreigners. I don't know why that is, maybe because they find those kind of marriages more prestigious.|`|315d08ffe32ebab370b799724d5f19a6aa	Filipinos are south East Asians.

7Bj4AAo8aa	All preached Islam; they told people to worship the God of Abraham alone with no partners and to do good works.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|dKgkHZf3aa	Abraham trusted God and beleived what He told him, Jesus was God's son and shared God's beliefs, and Muhammad just spoke with Gabriel so who knows what he beleived.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Abraham got confirmation from God that his son from Sarah would produce a Son through whose line the Messiah would eventually Come. This may come as a shock to some, but God was not speaking about Ismael.     Jesus eventually arrived at the full limit of the time and PROVED himself the Messiah by his words & deeds. There is No Greater Prophet that walked this Earth than Jesus Christ.   Jesus did not speak of another Prophet coming a few Hundred years after Him- why not?.. because there are None. Mohammad surely was not a Prophet in the line of Jesus Christ because Mohammad introduced a teaching that was diametrically opposed to what Christ taught. For instance Christ said " go forth and make disciples.. baptizing them.. Mohammad & Islam in General does not practice Baptism- ergo Mohammad's teachings are NOT in Harmony with Christ.   There is NO affiliation between Jesus & Mohammad of ANY kind- despite what people may say or think. Mohammad worshipped a god unknown to Jewish & Christian at that or any other time in History.

cPQ7TBcuaa	Many of the poverty stricken areas contain large numbers of blacks.

It is also about how they are raised. Another factor is the people they hang out with. Black people tend to hang out with other black people (not always, but a lot of the time, anyway). Blacks and crimes are like whites and drinking/drugs. There is a lot of the time peer pressure. Or, if they have been abused or have been through rough times, they will tend to act out. People that live in rough neighborhoods have probably been through a lot (being shot at, being beaten up, being hurt in any way by neighbors) and want to act out. Hopefully this helps.|`|vhuzsMPsaa	I suspect Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox News, and an empire with influence over kings and the president is more dangerous than any black teen.

The reason why there is more gun violence and gang activity in the inner cities is because of:    *Poverty  *Limited Educational Resources/Outlets  *Broken homes  *Drugs  *Turf Wars  *Government doesn't give a damn  *Corrupted Police  *The ideology of "No way out, I'll live and die by the Streets", it's all they know.. better known as the "Hood Mentality"    The fault lies with Government 1st! Esp for not seeing the reason why we fight for stricter Gun Laws. Not putting more funding into education in the Inner City or funding into After School programs to keep kids off the streets! And the way that young black males are treated in this society, as delinquents in many cases, how do you expect their mentalities to develop? To aspire to be the President when all they get from there Government & Law Enforcement Officials is humiliation!  Secondly, fault lies at Home. Parents need to STEP UP and do their jobs w/ their children! But many of these parents are uneducated or aren't financially blessed to get out. And the parents carry that "Hood mentality", so it trickles down until someone can break the cycle.    And there are PLENTY of White's that live in the ghetto! It's called Trailer Parks, or many poor middle American small towns! There are PLENTY poor White Americans in this country!     But what you forgot to ask is this.....    Why are so many HATE CRIMES committed by White Americans, many who aren't poor or live in the "ghetto" that go unreported! And many of them get slaps on the wrist!    And you know why Blacks & Latinos are more likely to end up in jail than Whites... here's the name of it.. INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM and an UNEQUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM! A white offender who commits the EXACT same crime as a "Minority" offender, gets less time or a lesser charge! And that's fact!    And WTF do you call these little bored white kids who have so many Neo-Nazi crews and go around terrorizing Mexican's, Blacks, Gays, etc???? Are they not a Gang? Are the Klu Klux Klan not a Domestic Terrorist group! Are you F*iNg kidding me!?    And in God's name are you getting this ridiculous statistic of Blacks committing more hate crimes towards Whites??! That is the dumbest.. it is absolutely BOGUS!!    This question pisses me off because it is RIDICULOUS in every aspect and it's racist and it makes my blood boil that you actually have the nerve to judge when you don't know **** about growing up Black in the Inner City in this country! You don't know the FIRST thing about the racial struggle and unjust way of life these people are conditioned to! HOW DARE YOU!    And I'm more likely to report you because I'm so angry! How about that!    And come on dummies! It started in Africa? Are you serious?! I swear, some White Americans really need to reevaluate what comes out of your mouths!    And the Winner is: I got reported for telling Becky how much of a Wack *** scum of the Earth skank she is on another question. So we're both in agreeance here :)
46fouwFfaa	I do like tradition. I don't know if it's possible for my family to follow all the cultural traditions that my parents followed since we do live in a country with a glaringly different culture. We do follow some traditions such as courtship, visiting sick people, host mourning gatherings when a death in the family occurs, burn oonsi (incense sticks) to scent the home, and do baramba (a dance). I do hope to live in Somalia for a bit to fully experience all the traditions.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	We fight every Christmas over how to hook up the newest electronic device.

Phelps did it while being a role model.|`|s5RQvM7Daa	I think people accept it in different scenarios for different reasons.  Personally, I couldn't care less that Michael Phelps smoked pot, mostly because I don't think pot is a big deal (safer than alcohol, really), despite the fact that I despise him.  Anyway, some factors:    People look at adults who smoked and say "well, they grew up in the 60s-70s...  everyone smoked then, it was sort of the norm" but today there is this big drug-fearing craze, which is understandable with the more serious drugs, but the research on marijuana points to it being safer than about any other drug/alcohol.  Also, he's an athlete, so people care more about him "polluting his body."  It might be different, too, if he said, "yeah, i've smoked in the past" and come out with it like that rather than having pictures taken of him doing it.|`|JgNMqaPmaa	i don't see the big deal id do it lol hell id do it with him the smoking not anything else although :)|`|SsEAvhs7aa	Because he lives in Mickey Mouse of America, the most prude country in America.

Don't you think that you shouldn't do this anymore?    Don't you agree????????????????????|`|JBkB1ZLJaa	No  Don't look at the straw in the other's eye.  Take the pillar out of your eye says your bible.  God love all of us and to think that others have to be condemned because what they believe do not fit the program would be an injustice.  They sincerely think they are right and others are wrong as much as you do.  Which one is to blame?   God is fair and talk to us through thoughts.  Why would he put in some-one's heart a conviction that would afterward condemned he.  When one truly believe as fact that he is right, you can be assured that he didn't  plan it in his head.   If God was to punish his presumably ignorance, it would not be a very good God. The God you are talking about no one is interested in it, for it is a bad one.|`|J01CJembaa	What about the Jews who were around before the Jesus?

The Father is the one true (that is, almighty, or absolute) God.    2 Chronicles 2:5 And the house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all the other gods.    Deuteronomy 10:17 For Jehovah your God is the God of gods.    Psalm 97:9 For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth"    John 8:25-59 .?.?.Therefore they began to say to him: Who are you? Jesus said to them: Why am I even speaking to you at all?... He that sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.... I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.... What things I have seen with my Father I speak... But now you are seeking to kill me, a man that has told you the truth that I heard from God.... If God were your Father, you would love me, for from God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth.... ?Because I, on the other hand, tell the truth, you do not believe me... If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the father except through me"    I appreciate your answer on my question about atheists. And I wanted to say that if you feel like jesus can make a change in your life, go out and seek him. He is love and he is unimaginable joy. Karina, as a Christian, i have to say that i love you will all my heart and I want you to go out and be saved. Any wounds that you have he can heal them. And even more, he can make you truly happy. Remember Paul in the bible. He prosecuted Christians but God changed him and made him one of the greatest servants of God. He can do that to you Kristina! I am glad that you take time to listen to God once in a while. God loves you and so do I. Don't fill that gap with anything else.

Believe Him.  don't base your life decisions on the bible.  i think it is a lot easier to make a sort of mental list of morals.  they will absolutely change in your life.  i always find my self thinking about things and then i realize some thing that hurts and bam theres a moral.  if everyone lived by the same rules and base d their decisions by the same rules, then wouldnt everyone be all similar?  the onlu=y difference would be different environments and situations.

AA11447853	Dear BT:    Thank you for your excellent question.  I have been a Witness for over 25 years and have attended many wedding ceremonies - I have never seen a unity candle at weddings performed inside the Kingdom Hall or outside, so I did research on the Internet to find out what it was.    Per Wikipedia, it is to solidify the marriage, possibly to indicate interfaith in a marriage, etc.  One portion of the explanation mentioned the origin:  "There is some speculation that it may have its origins in Zoroastrianism or New Ageism but this has not been proven factually."    Any couple getting married, whether inside the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere, would do well to research traditions and other practices in a wedding ceremony to ensure nothing is displeasing to God.    Witnesses do not do the following:  no throwing of rice, no throwing of bouquet, no lavish wedding with extremely huge cake, not a lot of bridesmaids and groomsmen (10+ each side as an example).  Bride can wear whatever color dress she wants - doesn't have to be white even if first marriage.  No secular music in Kingdom Hall (e.g., no wedding march music but kingdom melodies as some marches have pagan or mythological backgrounds).    For example, according to www.bridesvillage.com, the wedding garter, "One of the oldest accounts of the wedding garter belt holds that the tradition emerged from the widely held belief that possessing a piece of a bride's wedding dress, especially the wedding garter, was a sign of fertility and good lucka superstition so strong that wedding guests were known to rush the altar and tear apart the brides dress immediately after the ceremony!"    I have been to Witness weddings of those living in the US but originally from other countries.  These friends chose to wear their country's traditional dress rather than a suit or wedding dress - nothing wrong with that.    Wedding practices for Jehovah's Witnesses may vary due to culture but in the United States, a Witness wedding isn't that different from any other wedding except practices with pagan roots are not done.    Gr8ful|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Debbie said it best. It is a Happy Occasion and one that is shared by both the married couple and those in Attendance. I have never heard of this Unity Candle thing you speak about. In fact I'm still to see Candles used at any Congregation Function..seriously.|`|AA11025703	Basically we have simple ceremonies.  We of course make sure that the marriage is both legally correct, and Biblical.  IE, both persons must be single, one male, one female, etc.    The one Officiating generally reads some scriptures, about the sanctity of marriage, perhaps he might talk about the couple/share anecdotes.  There is no "tossing of the bouquet",    As for the reception, this can be quite varied.  However, the reception would also follow the Legal requirements of the land and Bible principles.  It might be open to all, simply for the family, or some combination of the 2.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	A regular wedding ceremony with a short talk beforehand about the duties of husband and wife. And to stay close to God in your marriage. Then a reception with or without booze and dancing is optional...but not wrong...dancing should be modest...and drink responsibly.|`|n7bok7NRaa	I'm not a JW - but I have family members who are. They have very normal wedding services that are open to the general public. They are as varied as normal Christian weddings, other than they preach their own version of the Bible and whatnot.    So yes, a JW wedding may have a unity candle, or it may not.    To Ashley, all the JWs I know use the internet quite often. They don't view it as sinful in the slightest (heck, most of them use it as a tool to get more Watchtowers out! XP).    EDIT: To the other girl, I've seen them done both in Kingdom Halls and at a normal hall. It is done by one of their elders who has the power to wed (just like a Christian Pastor/Father).|`|O3WYA3WGaa	I am curious about this too.    Those of you who know can you also tell me whether the ceremony is in the Kingdom Hall or just at the courthouse? Also who performs the ceremony, an elder?    Thanks!|`|9S6xT3Onaa	There would be a talk at the kingdom hall about the roles of husband and wife in marriage and the sanctity of marriage and would be performed by an elder who has a legal right to perform marriage the ceremony would differ according to the law of the land.

Ka1pGYzCaa	Well I'm white and I talk regular English lol.  I hope what I say doesn't come off as offensive because I don't mean it like that at all.  But, I think part of the way a lot of black people talk is a southern twag.  I mean if you look at how a white southern person talks, and listen to a black people talk, it's very similar.  Like "a'ight" for example, white southern people say it too but it sounds "redneck" but it's still the same word just a different accent - still southern nontheless.  Moving on, I think a southern twag as the base of it, then when rap became popular they created their own "language" (ebonics).  *shrugs*  It annoys me because I can't understand what the hell anyone (not just black people) says when they use it, lol|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	between 14-30 some will talk like that but once they hit late 30's it goes away and they realize how dumb they sounded..|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	First I doubt if you are Black. If so I apologize for saying you are not. Based upon the wording of your question you appear to make a distinction between yourself and other Black people that seems a bit disassociating. Second not all Black people speak incorrect, broken English. I suggest you not paint all Black people with a broad bush. There are universal slang terms that have become synonymous with the American English dialect. These words and terms have transcended the boundary of race and have become part of a culture. I won't go through every example but for instance the word "bling" has made it's way into the lexicon of American words and catch phrases. Third English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and French are languages we were forced to learn to speak over time. Many of us don't know our native ancestral language. This is a travesty in the since that we had to adapt in order to survive. Meaning, we had no choice. Even with that said there is no excuse one shouldn't at least attempt to master the language they speak fluently. Why do Black people speak with a slang dialect or broken English? For the same reason White people do it. It part of a subculture. Either you are a part of it or you are not.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	because rappers do it.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Wow i cant believe im saying this but you sir are a racist...to blacks...?|`|MyV9qm99aa	Media, rappers have been looked up too in the past as models, but for some reason it started in the 1990s when Tupac(1990s, not when N.W.A(1980s started.

They think they're ghetto and cool but they really just lose respect themselves as people. I don't know why the media promotes that.

However, I think that there are two reasons. First, many blacks are (naturally) raised amongst other blacks, either by family, location, or just people's tendency to hang out with others of their race. If those surrounding them speak 'gangsta', then it is natural for them to develop the habit.    But I wouldn't attribute their way of speaking to natural development alone. I think that many of them feel peer pressure. If all of their friends speak gangsta, they will too. It isn't the best excuse, but it would serve to isolate the person (to an extent) when they refuse to speak like their friends.|`|hE1FPOliaa	haha first of all despite wat ppl say here asking a question like this does not make you racist its just curiosity.  im pretty sure it has to do with where they were raised and how pop culture has influenced them.|`|lQ628oD7aa	it is because the vocal chords in african americans are much different than other races thus you get ghetto which is actually the same as cracKer talk except at a slower pace and lower decibel level. its science ***** gett it right.|`|DVET41lcaa	Cus they think its cool and makes em look cool.

AA11287223	We as individuals can lose salvation and local churches can fall into apostasy (fall from favor). The church that was established in the 1st Century has never totally disappeared from the earth. As you read the New Testament though, you see that false teachers were already popping up in the church and leading many astray to be lost in eternal damnation. The TRUE church that Jesus rules over, His Spiritual kingdom, worships just as is described in the NT. They are organized just as described in the NT. They do not have any book of creeds or doctrines. The Bible is their only guide. If you want to learn more, please feel free to contact me.|`|AA11528101	The "Jews" he was speaking to wasn't the general population, it was the ones in charge - the Pharisees.    Therefore the "nation" the Kingdom of God was given to - or should say given Back to - would be the general population of Jews. By turning back to Torah and refusing the tradtions and reforms of the Pharisees, the Kingdom of God is kept in the hands of Torah-observant Hebrews, both Jews and Gentiles who convert to Torah.    The Church never recieved the Kingdom of God, sorry to say.  By their own admission, they refuse the Torah of God. Anyone who refuses the Torah of God refuses the Kingdom of God.|`|AA10302491	Mat 12:43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

Mat 12:45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 22 Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 23 And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24 After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!

Thirdly, it is impossible for "you" to be here "at least 3 generations" becuase "you" is singular and one, single person can belong only to one generation unless his/her mother and father are also father/daughter.

It all exists in the dimension of His Spirit.  If one never enters through the door then it doesn't exist to you.  That is perfectly understandable.  Jesus opened a door to God that never existed before.  He doesn't force anyone to enter, He just says, "whosoever will may come."  Not a problem if you don't want to.
AA12020838	In 1118, a French crusader called Hugues de Payens and eight fellow knights founded the Military Order most commonly known as the Knights Templar.     ...At least I think that is the relevance......|`|9ab8d863362bf9a4e5243f56a792454baa	Eighth day.....|`|AA12049149	Dont know ask the Free Masons
AA11928225	That is more a question of translational bias on the part of the Christian translators of the Hebrew. And likewise to some degree on the part of the Jewish translators -- especially in regards to passages that might point someone to a particular Messiah.  Notice for example the elimination of "Shiloh" from the Jewish Publication Society translation of Gen 49:10 even though the Artscroll maintains it.    One of the many problems Christians have is in the fact that they call these books "the old testament", when they don't have a passage (even in their "new testament") that calls this collection by that name.  The "old covenant" which is being spoken of is the "covenant of sin and death" -- not a collection of books.  They have misappropriated the words and misapplied them.    Beyond that, the Protestant "old testament" in Hebrew is exactly the same as the Tanakh.|`|AA11528101	Simple, in order to continue their religion, they must do one of two things - rewrite their copy or just tweek it enough to support their "new testament".    Since the Jews have held the Tanach long before the Christians came to be, rewriting it is difficult. Therefore all they can do is tweek it by translating various words so that it would appear to support their new testament.    You see, if Christians were to translate their old testament according to what the Tanach says in hebrew, they lose much of their prophecy and their basis for jesus being a god. They can't afford this.

AA12225848	Since, theres no Scripture condemning the act of masturbation as a sin, it stands to reason that its an act which has the potential to be honoring to God and is in accord with the fact that the Holy Spirit lives in the believer. Solitary masturbation is not an act which harms the individuals body, nor does it involve the joining of one body and spirit to another as is the case with sexual intercourse. Through the releasing of sexual tensions, it can act as a barrier to seeking release through immoral outlets. A part of honoring God with our bodies is doing whatevers necessary to keep our bodies under control.  In the area of sexuality, masturbation can be an effective way of doing so.|`|b2e813fc07229d59579a2f1898d212eaaa	hai    medical science says it is not harmful to health  and it is a necessary action for your healthy mind and body. it is better than u r going some other ways to become satisfy. that may cause of deseases.|`|8bf3e8a271d75e4c644688a9d68d1015aa	No. It's a natural process for relieving sexual tension.|`|AA10707135	Matthew 5:27-28    Pretty clear... check it out.|`|AA11179498	No there is no sin because it's the safest way of sexual gratification. Every religion does permit legitimate sex with ones spouse and if someone commits adultery it is termed as sin whether it is Christianity,Hinduism,Buddhism etc.If sexuality is no sin then how masturbation is sinful? It is the orthodox notion in every religious mind percolated through generations.Actually it is the best outlet provided by nature to control everyone's sexual desire.|`|AA10933193	Even babies, once they discover their genitals, find it pleasant to fondle them and babies can't sin, even though they were born into sin.     That being said, the scripture I can't recall but I know what it says...it says that thou shalt not spill thy seed on the ground. That scripture also is used when speaking against birth control. It's in the old testament is all I can remember.     If you are a Christian, lots of things in the New Testament negated things in the Old Testament, for example, an eye for an eye was refuted in the New Testament by Jesus Christ when he said to turn the other cheek.     Some sins are obvious, but most of what people feel are "sins" are really not. Anything in excess is a sin. Eating is not a sin but eating in excess is, etc.     Hope this helps.|`|AA11792242	yes|`|b3868a612315c225aeb2ec9a385321e8aa	Read Dr. James Dobson's book Preparing for Adolescence, and there is no scripture about it.

Darwinism doesn't fit the classic definition of an organized religion.  There is no deity, no ceremonies, no holy book (as Mr. Darwin's work is but a small part of what the field of studying evolution has become), no encompassing set of beliefs, and no specific system of values or morals.      They teach it because it is currently the theory that has the most parallels with the physical evidence we have found on this planet.      Christianity and Catholicism are religions, involving Deities, Ceremonies, Holy Books, Religious Tenants, and entire belief sets.  Darwinism is far less encompassing, it is more akin to plumbing than religion.       Would we have them teach that water flows through some miraculous force created by a deity, or should we just teach them about gravity, pressure and flow and let them know that any field of knowledge is never complete.  At least with the latter we'll have flushing toilets.

Fairly oppressive colonial rule at that.  1950-ongoing- To quote Wikipedia...."Since independence, India has seen sectarian violence and insurgencies in various parts of the country...It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief Sino-Indian War in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and in 1999 in Kargil."  Not so harmonious huh?

Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:    8" 'These people honor me with their lips,         but their hearts are far from me.    9They worship me in vain;         their teachings are but rules taught by men.'[d]"      10Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand. 11What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.' "      12Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"      13He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. 14Leave them; they are blind guides.[e] If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."      15Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."      16"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them. 17"Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? 18But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.' 19For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 20These are what make a man 'unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.'

To know what are clean the animal has to have 1) hooves, 2) the hooves must be split, 3) and chew cud (grass). This would include a list of beef, lamb, goat, deer.  Pig is not allowed because they do not eat grass but feces and other refuse.    At the part where you quote, verse 42 and such, it is stating on what creatures other than was already written are unclean. So this would be all others like cats, dogs, spiders, centipedes, snail, crab, mouse, things like that.    So, if you like to, you are allowed by God to eat beef, lamb, venisin (deer).|`|8dfcba338365ec3982283ea9b1453848aa	Hello Keltin,    It is confusing at times, but if you ask God for wisdom he will show you everything you ask.    Please know that Leviticus is from the Old Testament (covenant) and when our Brother Jesus came he created a New Testament (covenant).    This new covenant granted us many blessings and also that we are free from sin if we confess what we may have done wrong.    God lives within you right now at this moment and expresses through you will your talents. Once Jesus came the only sin is to not be rooted and grounded in Love.

"Let no one in any way deceive you, for that day cannot come without the coming of the apostasy first, and the appearing of the man of sin, the son of perdition."    Deuteronomy 13:6-10:    If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; [Namely], of the gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: BUT THOU SHALT SURELY KILL HIM; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

Allah, Yahweh, and God are all "God" to each religion.  But each teaches about sin in radically different ways.  It'd take some lengthy theology to get into it, but here's my take.  I believe in God of the Bible as a protestant christian.  The God i believe does not punish someone else for my sins.  No where in the Bible does this ever come through the pages.  If He did , no i dont think that would be fair.  Lucky for me i believe He is just and righteous, not unfair.|`|48b7092edb5736cad35fd19a2b5c7239aa	God does not punish one race or religion for an others actions.  All answers are in the Bible!

I could not find any hadeeeth with this number which says such a thing. The only thing I could find was this    Sahih Muslim Book 023, Number 4969:   Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who drank wine in this world will not be provided with pure drink in the Hereafter, except in case he repents.      Book 023, Number 4970:   Ibn 'Umar reported this hadith from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) through another chain of transmitters.       What we muslim know is that the Quran has taught us that every soul will bear it's own sin, then how can Chrisitians or Jews bear a muslims sins?!    The Holy Quran says :"Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to Allah. 35:18    Say: "Shall I seek for (my) Cherisher other than Allah, when He is the Cherisher of all things (that exist)? Every soul draws the meed of its acts on none but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is towards Allah. He will tell you the truth of the things wherein ye disputed."6:164    Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another; 53:38    So please give us your source.

Por isso, a histria de Pandora come?a antes da prpria Pandora.     Desde que Zeus (Jpiter) e seus irm?os (a gera??o dos deuses olmpicos) come?aram a disputar o poder com a gera??o dos Tit?s, Prometeu era visto como inimigo e seus amigos mortais como amea?a.   Sendo assim, para castigar os mortais, Zeus privou o homem do fogo,  simbolicamente, da luz na alma, da inteligncia... Prometeu, "amigo dos homens", roubou uma centelha do fogo celeste e a trouxe  terra, reanimando os homens.     Ao descobrir o roubo, Zeus decidiu punir tanto o ladr?o quanto os beneficiados. Prometeu foi acorrentado a uma coluna e uma guia devorava seu fgado durante o dia, o qual voltava a crescer  noite.     Para castigar o homem, Zeus ordenou a Hefesto (Vulcano) que modelasse uma mulher semelhante s deusas imortais e que tivesse vrios dons.  Aten (Minerva) ensinou-lhe a arte da tecelagem, Afrodite (Vnus) deu-lha a beleza e o desejo indomvel, Hermes (Mercrio) encheu-lhe o cora??o de artimanhas, imprudncia, ardis, fingimento e cinismo, as Gra?as embelezaram-na com lindssimos colares de ouro... Zeus enviou Pandora como presente a Epimeteu, o qual, esquecendo-se da recomenda??o de Prometeu, seu irm?o, de que nunca recebesse um presente de Zeus, o aceitou. Quando Pandora, por curiosidade, abriu uma caixa que trouxera do Olimpo como presente de casamento ao marido, dela fugiram todas as calamidades e desgra?as que at hoje atormentam os homens. Pandora ainda tentou fechar a caixa, mas era tarde demais: ela estava vazia, com a exce??o da "esperan?a" que permaneceu presa junto  borda da caixa.           Pandora  a deusa da ressurrei??o. Ela por n?o nascer como a divindade  conhecida como uma semi-deusa. Pandora era uma humana ligada a Hades. Sua ambi??o em se tornar a deusa do Olimpo e esposa de Zeus fez com que ela abrisse a anfora divina. Zeus para castiga-la tirou a sua vida. Hades com interesse nas ambi??es de Pandora, procurou as pacas (dominadoras do tempo) e pediu para que o tempo voltasse, sem permiss?o de Zeus elas n?o puderam fazer nada. Hades convenceu o irm?o a ressuscitar Pandora, devido os argumentos do irm?o Zeus a ressuscitou dando a divindade que ela sempre desejava. Assim Pandora se tornou a deusa da ressurrei??o. Para um esprito ressuscitar Pandora entrega-lhe uma tarefa, se o esprito cumprir ele  ressuscitado. Pandora com dio de Zeus por ele ter a tornado uma deusa sem importancia, entrega aos espritos somente tarefas impossveis. Assim nenhum esprito conseguiu e nem conseguir ressuscitar.           http://www.desejosesonhos.hpg.ig.com.br/...|`|c18361a8cfb0286b9355352d69e655c8aa	bom, ela nem existe, mas pela mitologia ela esta no deserto das almas perdidas, dentro do templo de pandora, e o templo esta acorrentado as costas de um tit? chamado cronus  se vc kiser ir la, boa sorte

AA10170942	Yes Christians should respect other faiths. A christian person saying that those who aren't will go to hell is unchristianlike to SAY, but it is a basic belief of their faith. They are also supposed to tell other people about the Bible and Jesus and that is also a part of their faith. So it isn't that they aren't respecting others faiths it is only that they are practicing their own; the others do not have to accept it and then that should be the end of it.

I've heard stories about what other religions believe in and quite frankly I think that whoever they believe in, is very unforgiving and merciless. I believe in GOD THE ALMIGHTY , JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR AND THE HOLY SPIRIT and my GOD is a very forgiving and understanding GOD. He has died on the cross for our sins. If you look at the way these other believers lead their life, you'll see that they lead their life the way their god intended them to do so.They terrorise and kill, even of their own kind.I would never follow a god that wants me to kill.I know this sounds contradicting as christians also kill as these people do, but our religion does not instigate it.

As mulheres portuguesas n?o casavam nunca no ms de agosto, pois nesta poca os navios das expedi??es zarpavam  procura de novas terras. Casar em agosto significava ficar s, sem lua-de-mel e, s vezes, at mesmo viva. Os colonizadores portugueses trouxeram esta cren?a para o Brasil.

Os romanos deram ao oitavo ms do ano o nome de agosto, numa homenagem ao Imperador Augusto, quando estavam acontecendo os mais importantes fatos de sua vida, destacando-se, dentre os principais, a conquista do Egito e sua eleva??o  dignidade de c?nsul. Porque, como e quando agosto come?ou a ser um ms azarento  que ningum sabe explicar.     As mulheres portuguesas n?o casavam nunca no ms de agosto, poca em que os navios das expedi??es zarpavam  procura de novas terras. Casar em agosto significava ficar s, sem lua-de-mel e, s vezes, at mesmo viva. Os colonizadores portugueses trouxeram esta cren?a para o Brasil.     Na Alemanha, entretanto, as mulheres n?o acreditam no poder mgico da supersti??o. Enquanto em muitos pases maio  o ms das noivas, l as mo?as sonham casar no ms de agosto. Na Argentina, n?o  aconselhvel lavar a cabe?a durante todo o ms de agosto. Quem lava a cabe?a em agosto est chamando a morte.    A verdade  que a cren?a popular de que agosto  o ms de desgosto n?o  somente um ditado popular que rima; , tambm, uma supersti??o internacional de grande aceita??o entre ns, principalmente na zona rural do pas, destacando-se, de modo muito particular, em todo o Nordeste, onde o processo de coloniza??o foi homogeneamente portugus.     Mas, apesar de muita gente se dizer incrdulo nos azares prprios do ms de agosto, muitos n?o se casam, n?o se mudam, n?o viajam e n?o fazem negcios em agosto. A verdade  que as pessoas - acreditando ou n?o - preferem n?o brincar com o mgico, com as coisas do sobrenatural.    Existem muitos registros histricos de desastres e outros fatos ruins ocorridos durante o ms de agosto. Conhe?a algumas dessas datas:    No dia 24 de agosto de 1572 Catarina de Medici ordenou o massacre de S?o Bartolomeu, que ceifou milhares de vidas.

Na cidade de Nova York, no dia 6 de agosto de 1890, o primeiro homem foi eletrocutado numa cadeira eltrica, como se o governo americano, arvorando-se em defensor de sua sociedade, achasse justo tirar a vida de um homem que tirou a vida de outro, isto , fazendo a mesma coisa.    Em 24 de agosto de 1910, o Jap?o invadiu a Coria, s custas de muito sangue, de muitas lgrimas.    No dia 1o de agosto de 1914 come?ou a 1a Grande Guerra Mundial.

Mais de duzentas mil pessoas morreram nos dias 6 e 9 de agosto de 1945, quando as cidades de Hiroshima e Nagazaki foram destrudas pela bomba at?mica, deixadas cair pelos pilotos Thomas Ferrebre e W.

Em agosto de 1959, um incndio que destruiu uma fbrica de tintas, no Rio de Janeiro, fez cinco vtimas, entre as quais trs bombeiros.

Take heart in knowing that although there are racists and bigots in the world, not all people share in their beliefs.    Additionally I commend you for not being drawn down to their level.

By the way, I'm a Christian, but a real one, not one of those "George Bush when the cameras are rolling when it suits me and I want to steal some money and kill other religions"-type christians.    I'm a Christian.  They are christians.  We have huge differences, nearly all of which they will never understand.    You seem like a very serene and patient person for someone who describes themself as a child.  Shine, and even the worst of them will have to respect you, even if they can never feel that they love you.  But that is their fault, not yours, so never, ever judge yourself on what others think or if they make fun of you.  They make fun of me, too.  I'm at peace with myself.

f1bdab5e8ca95cc957395a1c15234656aa	Meu caro Gustavo D., se voc fez esta pergunta por brincadeira, se esclare?a mais para n?o incorrer neste tipo de pergunta, n?o que Jesus se ofenda (ele nunca se ofende), mas as pessoas  que se sentem ofendidas por ter sua f de alguma maneira atingida e se foi esse o caso, ser preciso fazer um exame de conscincia, por isso leia a resposta do Hokus_Phokus, que ela  muito pertinente.    Mas se sua pergunta for motivada por uma dvida (o que eu duvido), aqui vai uma resposta:   Jesus n?o foi um mutante, na verdade ele mutou/mudou e ainda muda o mundo com seus ensinamentos e seu exemplo.   * Ele n?o tinha o olhar do Ciclope, mas tinha e tem um olhar capaz de ler a nossa alma;  * Ele n?o tinha o fator de cura do Wolverine, mas curava a todos (fsica e moralmente);  * Ele n?o era a Tempestade, mas as tempestades obedeciam ao seu comando;  * Ele n?o era o Professor X, mas era muito, mas muito mais sbio.  * Ele n?o era um X-Men e pergunto: precisava ser?

AA11764375	Yes I have,my advice is to break away from them.Get involved in things other than them(thinking about them and worring about them just makes you vulnerable to them).Emotionally distance yourself,and if you absolutely have to,end the relationship permanantly.Odd thing is suppossedly they aren't aware of how they are affecting others,gentily pointing that out might help.But I've come across a few that knew what they were doing and those are the ones to stay clear away from,as they are feeding on your emotions,need for them,need to be needed,etc.Hopefully your case isn't this severe.And good luck!|`|AA11457471	I had a friend like that.

AA11384465	It's very typical for republicans to state they want the Supreme Court to grant majority opinion/rule; but, when they don't like the decision which protect basic individual rights, they don't accept it.     Sure the Supreme Court has overruled past laws, etc.. but if you notice most of those are concerning civil liberties or equal rights for a minority.     Funny how they use this as an argumen meanwhile wanting their view to be law claiming to be the 'moral majority'.|`|AA11368537	coz some are pro life and some pro choice.|`|AA11189151	Should we have given up on civil rights because of Plessy v. Ferguson as well? Society changes and rulings are reevaluated. It's not that difficult a concept to understand.|`|AA10515207	Because only a few are making decisions for many.  The Supreme Court rules on laws already accepted as part of the fabric of society.  They are not dealing with individuals that have their own unique situations.  Their view is one of tunnel vision--just what is presented before them.    As people grow older and mature, their opinions may change.  Many years ago I read a book by a female journalist who chose to have an abortion because she thought her family was complete and another child would distract from her & her husband's careers.  She was shocked to discover afterwards that she felt regret doing it.  She began interviewing other women--some in their late 70s and 80s--who'd had abortions earlier in their lives and still regretted it.    Another example is the news story that appeared this week on Yahoo! Health.  It's just recently been learned that young women seeking abortions weren't always informed of the possible risks involved.  Now that we have that information, don't we have the responsibility to decide if the current methods are safe, or to provide a better means for those who do have an abortion?|`|AA10379545	Since the Supreme Court decided at one point that blacks were not people, should people have continued to argue over slavery?  The Supreme Court was wrong then, and they are wrong now.

Lo que comenta Arehtza, es una solo un interpretacion, los mismos capitulos que ella versa se interpretan en la religion catolica de esta manera, dicen "casados una vez", no,  que deban (obligacion) casarse:    **El candidato debe ser intachable, casado una sola vez Ti 1,6  ** Es necesario que el obispo sea intachable, casado "una sola vez" sobrio, sensato... 1 Tim 3,2  etc    Como t misma te habrs dado cuenta, en las tres citas bblicas se repiten las palabras ?una sola vez?. Tendramos que preguntarnos por qu les dice que solamente una vez, si se supone que todo cristiano solamente se puede casar una vez.  ?Acaso los obispos eran casados una vez y los que no lo eran podan tener varias esposas?   Por supuesto que no.    La razn por lo que dice eso es que cuando en aquellos tiempos se convertan a Jesucristo muchas de las personas  antes haban tenido varias mujeres e hijos. Al aceptar el Evangelio no podan continuar en esa situacin. Tenan que tener una sola esposa y cuidar de sus hijos.    Es por eso que cuando en la Biblia se dice casados ?una sola vez? es para RESALTAR que si queran ser diconos, presbteros u obispos no podan serlo si antes de ser cristianos haban tenido varias esposas e hijos con ellas.    La biblia es un libro maravilloso, pero debemos ocuparnos tambien en los tiempos que se escribio, no en las interpretaciones que la gente pueda darle a su convenir.........

Suerte.|`|8aad2b979f9bcd9f16f5e5ab87e2e525aa	Dentro de la Religin Catlica, el sacerdocio no pueden casarse debido a varios aspectos.  el principal es que es un pastor es decir, su propsito es dar ejemplo y cuidar de su iglesia (los feligreses) por tanto para poder ser ejemplo de su pueblo se abstienen del rito marital para no ser causa de mal ejemplo.  Si tomamos en cuenta el Concilio de Trento, se formula y se exije a todos aquellos aspirantes al sacerdocio, seguir el ejemplo del apstol a quien Jess tanto am, (cabe hacer mencin que en la Iglesia primitiva, los apstoles algunos tenan familia, esposa e hijos), pero San Juan el era joven y para cumplir con su encargo de ir a predicar, se mantuvo puro y casto, pues se consagr en cuerpo y alma a "anunciar la nueva buena". La iglesia a seguir la vida de Juan nota que quizs la iglesia medieval requiere exactamente estas virtudes, y por eso se exige a todos aquellos que aspiren al sacerdotes los votos de Castidad y Pureza, de ah el nombre Celibato (que significa pureza de cuerpo y alma).  Es verdad que la Iglesia ha tenido pocas muy duras, y que las divisiones o fracturas que conlleva desde la reforma , hace que la misma iglesia catlica tenga varias ramificaciones. En Mxico y la mayor parte de Latinoamrica, la iglesia que continua y sigue viva es la iglesia que proviene de la europea, la cual lleva la misma misin desde la iglesia primitiva.  una vertiente diferente es la Iglesia catlica anglicana, la cual toma fuerza en Norteamerica, y en la cual el celibato no se lleva por esa razn hay sacerdotes que tienen esposa e hijos. pero es mas que nada por la misma ideologa anglosajona, quienes en todo quieren influir y ser punta de lanza, y ellos ven la iglesia como una entidad independiente y muy lucrativa.   Esta es una de las razones principales, as que cuando sepan de algn sacerdote que se case o tengan hijos, preguntnse internamente a quien sirve al propsito de Dios, o al mundo material sin tener sacrificios.

8debe8cf99c0f5d7bce05f9e4004288daa	Peace.   It is an irony that less than 2700 were killed in all battles that the Prophet fought on ALL SIDES.  Moses had 3000 Jews killed in three days for disobeying him (Exodus 32:27).  While less than 2700 were killed, our Prophet managed to turn his entire nation from one religion of polytheism to that of monotheism.    Abraham could not even turn his brothers, father or uncle to monotheism.  Moses went up for forty days and his people turned to idol worship, even though he left Aaron to watch over them.  David fought with and killed many Jewish men as well his tens of thousands (while Saul killed only his thousands).      Jesus is the direct beneficiary of the killings of the past.  Jesus did not once denounced David or Moses or Joshua who completely destroyed eleven cities, including men, women, children and animals in them and looted the gold and silver which was distributed among the winners of those wars as booty.      Most Christians and Jewish folks are either ignorant or hypocrites when they criticize our Prophet, who turned not only his own nation but his followers turned many nations to the path of Monotheism as well as honored the great ones of Israel.    Fools who say a false Prophet could do that, then they are unwittingly insulting God himself, whose true prophets could not accomplish such progress with such little bloodshed.    Those who are ignorant can not be taught and those who know are turning to Islam by the droves.      So, keep up the good work brother.  May Allah bless you.

Muslims  shouldn't hate Christians and vice-versa|`|AA11277007	Have you ever heard the Islamic so-called "terrorist" saying: We will first kill the ones who worship on Saturday, and then those who worship on Sunday.     Well it seems Friday is the problem. here is a transcript of some your friendly Friday Sermons.    Ibrahim Mudaryris  PATV May 13, 2005    With the establishment of the state of Israel, the entire islamic nation was lost, because Israel is a cancer, spreading in the body of the islamic nation; because the Jews are a virus similar to AIDS. Don't ask Germany what it did to the Jews, since the Jews are the ones who provoked Nazism. In Allahs will, he will get rid of the USA just like he got rid of them. The day will come and we shall rule America, the day will come and we shall rule Britain. Listen to your beloved Muhammed, who tells you about the most dire end for the Jews. The tree and the stone want the Muslim to bring the end to every Jew. The resurrection will not take place until the Muslims fight the Jews, and the Muslims kill them.    Why are they so threatened by Jews? They number only in the millions, while muslims have 1.3 or 1.6 billion. They live in a tiny part of the whole arab world...and they are the greatest threat to society?    Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim Maadi on his weekly TV show PATV, Sept. 12, 2004:    We are waging this cruel war with the brothers of the monkeys and pigs, the Jews and the sons of Zion.    If the Quran is such a scientific miracle and doesnt disagree with any science, then Why does it believe in such an absurd idea that Jews descend from Apes and Pigs, yet they are a higher evolved human? That sounds like something a White Supremecist would say about blacks. Stoopid.    Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya, Sharia (Islamic Law) Rulings Council, PA TV, Oct. 13, 2000    The Jews are Jews, whether Lakud or Labor, the Jews are Jews. They are all liars and must be butchered and must be killed.    Ibrahim Mudayris Friday sermon, PA TV May 13, 2005  With the establishment of the State of Israel    Quran  9:29 Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.    3. Quran Says Christians will burn in Hell. 5:72, 73 Surely, they have disbelieved who say: "Allah is the Messiah (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)." But the Messiah (Jesus) said: "O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers. Surely, disbelievers are those who said: "Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)." But there is no ilah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilah (God-Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall the disbelievers among them.    posted by TruthSeeker at 9:13 AM|`|e2b94943beccc9722b979bcbc0cd5285aa	You're absolutely correct.

The need of the hour is not to antagonise the Holy book but to isolate and condemn the group of people who are desecrating its Holy name by resorting to violence against fellow humans.

AA12060584	the point of Havin Judgement Day is to show that The Trinity has been ther for us all along but we hv been so blind as to not c it. to Show tht the only way to heaven is thru Jesus.

4606928e9064e51b62816e3c370c8497aa	It IS inaccurate about science, history and most of all, God. I think God wouldn't approve of the bible (if in fact there is one, that is) because it makes him look bad.|`|1a3351274d383d583212d81b343d74c6aa	The bible is stories, with morals, and nothing else, it shouldn't be taken ultra literally, or accepted as absolute truth.|`|2556ffc13d7ab67df759858300221ab0aa	Because the current worldview of theology as it equates to the Judeo-Christian mindset is based upon either the Quoran, Bible, Torah, what have you. To be able to know how its written and how it INFLUENCES THE THOUGHTS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN IT is essential when looking at modern theological values, and more importantly, the dangerous impact of those values.    However, one must also look at the past of each of these institutions, as well as the pasts of others, including governments, migration patterns, and also science and logic to be able to fully apply the data to a logical conclusion.|`|7e1baf1389ee729d645d9fe9842c6839aa	I would say that it IS as inaccurate and incomplete about God as it is about history and science... (assuming he exists)  You don't think the bible tells you all there is to know about God do you?  It hardly tells you anything at all about him.|`|AA11352649	I would say it is only useful in theology as one of the examples of what people believe a god to be.  I wouldn't say its description of this god should be used as a standard with which to measure all other gods.  I would argue that the descriptions of all gods should be known at least in part before you can justify your reason for not believing in them.|`|AA10044748	The bible is a bunch of bogus, no value, to much killing in it|`|AA12264300	You have to study thine enemy to defeat him.|`|AA10807212	It *so* good to have a question other than the man-monkey-monkey-man question!    If you look at the Bible in context - ie: in the time it was written, the socio-political-religious environment - it becomes a guide book about conforming to society; it tells you how to behave and what will happen if you don't. The creation stories are there to validate our existence.  While it helps to have a knowledge of theology - and as atheists, it's not just the judeo-christian religions we should be aware of - ultimately what we are arguing about is faith. And all the knowledge in the world can win that one.|`|AA11430900	Theology is more about belief and perception.

My mother only knows about christianity.. she has never had the desire to learn about any other religion because they are not valid in her belief.  I have looked at a good number of them and decided that the concept of a deity is not valid.

Yes, the Bible should NOT be looked at for historical or scientific information, as all of it is way off ... And, I agree that the Bible IS inaccurate and incomplete with regards to God, "if" he exists..... So whats your point??    Unfortunately, in order to have an understanding of religion (say christianity), one must read this incomplete and inaccurate record. But that is ONLY because you have no other sources other than this inaccurate book. What else would you have me read to learn about it???|`|AA11898455	It's a valid source of crap.|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	it is the only true source for any knowledge.|`|AA10969632	I didn't read all the answers to your theology question, but they probably meant you should be familiar with the theology of a specific religion before arguing against that specific religion.    Most atheists would argue that *if* a god exists it is not the anthropomorphic god depicted in the bible.   So, no the bible is not a valid source for knowledge about god.  (If I thought it was I wouldn't be an atheist, would I?)      The bible is only a trustworthy source for understanding the theology behind Christianity...nothing more.  It would be kinda dumb to try and argue against Christianity without understanding the underlying theology of their belief.

Su un lato del rotolo  scritto che tutti i ladri saranno cacciati da essa, sull'altro lato che sar espulso anche chi fa giuramenti falsi. 4Il Signore dell'universo dichiara che manda questa maledizione perch entri nella casa di ogni ladro e di chiunque fa giuramenti falsi nel suo nome.

22ce8e0f7a489a92cd1c218341bd6f77aa	A veces pedimos no lo que no es para nosotros, me explico, como madre tu hijo pedira algo que no es conveniente para el y tu como madre no se lo daras aunque el lo pida siempre.  Me sigues verdad? Bueno puede pedirte por ejemplo, dame dinero mami, tu no se lo das, pero le dices mira el vecino necesita que le laves el carro y te pagara o algo por el estilo; no se lo das pero lo ayudas a conseguirlo de manera honrada que a la vez le crea responsabilidad y autoestima.  Bien, tal vez Dios piense (creo yo) que si no consigues un empleo trabajando para otra persona, es que tienes una habilidad que pueda generar tu propio empleo y no has caido en cuenta y El quiere que la desarrolles pues para eso te dio ese talento. Tambien es parte  de como forjar el acero, para hacerlo mas fuerte, mas seguro, construirlo sobre roca y no sobre arena.  Tal vez es una leccion no para ti si no para tu hijo, que vea lo dificil que es la vida, lo duro que hay que trabajar para ganarse el dinero y asi de esta manera cuando se le de todo a el, no lo desperdicie ni malgaste y aprenda a usarlo sabiamente. Se que no es facil, pues mi situacion es la misma,  Claro que Dios existe, tienes tu hijo contigo y no es un perdido de por ahi; El  nos da las cosas en justa medida, y solo El sabe esa medida y porque, no desfallezcas y ensenale a tu hijo a sortear la vida de cara a los problemas y de la mano de Dios con tu ejemplo.   no es solo un consejo, mi situacion es la misma que la tuya y te comprendo. es por eso que soy Fenix, revivo de mis cenizas  Un Abrazo muy fuerte|`|91ae52cc9dd8d1bd9816cd1b71d012b4aa	Imagina esto:  Tu hijo adolecente, al que quieres tanto, te pide un auto deportivo, tu tienes el dinero para comprarselo, pero, se lo compras??? tu sabes que el no esta preparado para algo asi, y que al cumplirle sus deseos lo podrias estar enviando a la muerte, en un choque a alta velocidad, ya que todos los que no tienen madurez para menejar suelen hacerlo a alta velocidad, y mas si tienen un auto que sirve para correr!!  Asi que que harias, les das el carro, sabiendo a lo que lo expones, o prefieres a que cresca y sea mas maduro para porder con la responsabilidad de tener un carro asi????  Piensalo, lo que Dios quiere de ti es tu corazon, quiere ayudarte, pero probablemente tu no estas lo suficientemente cerca de el como para que puedas con lo que le pides, mirate, dudas de el tan pronto, y si tuvieras de todo, con mas razon no creerias en el, piensalo bien, lo que el quiere es que crezcas espiritualmente primero, antes de darte lo que le pides, porque tu no has madurado lo suficiente como para tener lo que pides, porque un reclamas a Dios, envez de confiar en lo que el esta haciendo, asi que acercate mas a Dios, el te ama muuuuuchisimo, y solo quiere lo mejor para ti, por eso aveces Dios dice "No", no es que no nos responda, busca mas de el, tienes que congregarte, no busques excusas para no hacerlo, busca un buen lugar donde hacerlo, donde en verdad busquen a Dios, y asi creceras espiritualmente, y Dios concedera las peticiones de tu corazon.    La biblia dice en 1ra. de Juan: "Amados, deseo que sean prosperados en todas las cosas, en la medida en la que prospera su alma"|`|e7287bf10625a35480f10335e6beb5c5aa	Quiero decirte que Dios no da empleos, perdon si te ofendo, pero el solo concede oportunidades, solo necesitas estar atenta y aprovecharla en el momento preciso, piensa, porque tienes que aguantarte? porque estas desilusionada de todas las religiones? parece que te sientes una victima de la vida y de los demas, y creeme, si sigues sintiendote asi, asi sera por el resto de tu vida, cambia tu manera de pensar, reacciona, TOMA LAS RIENDAS DE TU VIDA!!! se que como madre quieres lo mejor para tu hijo, y lo vas a lograr solo si cambias las actitudes negativas, los pensamientos negativos que tienes acerca de ti misma, y, tambien tu hijo puede ayudarte no crees? es trabajo en equipo.

ANimo|`|c77c713093acbe1e33d64031e4913520aa	Bueno para comenzar DIOS si existe.  DIOS no tiene preferencia con algunos y otros no.  No pongas los ojos en las religiones sino solo en DIOS.  Piensa en esto tienes una profesion para obtener un buen sueldo, disculpa la pregunta pero debemos poner los pies en la tierra, si solo  tienes una ocupacion el sueldo que obtienes es bajo, no te pueden pagar mas de lo que no sabes hacer ;los sueldos estan basados segun el grado academico que tengas.  Tienes que ser especifica con lo que quieres ,piensa que tienes en tus manos ,me refiero que sabes hacer ,muchas veces tenemos aptitudes y cualidades que no sabemos explotarlas.  Tu puedes obtener dinero extra por ejemplo ;cocinando,cociendo,vendiendo,etc.  Orar es hablar con DIOS hablale  y has un trato con el dile que leeras un capitulo diario de la biblia o lo que creas que le vas a cumplir;yo se que el te escucha,aveces tenemos rencores o raices de amarguras contra alguien  u odio ,medita es esto busca en tu interior de tu corazon o mente que es lo que tienes contra alguien y cuando tu perdones a esa persona de seguro las cosas van a cambiar en tu vida.  Si nunca le has dicho a JESUS que entre en tu vida dicelo y el cambiara todo tu ser pero dicelo de corazon.

Menos aun creo en las religiones, asi que es probable que no te sirva demasiado mi respuesta.  Pienso que la manera de lograr un cambio no es orar, sino poner todas las energas en lograrlo.  Orar pidiendo a dios que te ayude, es depositar el esfuerzo, las ganas y todas las energas en lo que "alguien" que no sabes si existe o no, pueda hacer para modificar tu estado laboral (hablando de tu caso particularmente)  No s cul es el trabajo que tienes actualmente ni que tipo de trabajo estas capacitada para hacer, pero creo que quizs puedas dejar tus datos y curriculum en las numerosas pginas de busqueda de empleo que existen y esa sera una manera de empezar a hacer algo concreto por conseguir un trabajo mejor...  Por otro lado, dices que crees que dios no existe (en eso coincidimos) y luego agregas que "pero si existe, por que no me ayuda a m".  de hecho no es dios quien va a ayudarte.

Ore al Padre por sus necesidades especificas, yo se que El ya las sabe pero a El le gusta que le digamos lo que necesitamos. ?Ya acept a Dios como su unico y suficiente salvador personal? ese es el primer paso para cambiar mustra vida. Acerquese a una iglesia no importa a que denominacion y hable con un pastor o un sacerdote de su necesidad para que le apoyen. Es dificil estar en esta situacion pero saldr adelante, ya ver. Yo he tenido que aceptar un trabajo mas fuerte y de noche parapoder pagar mi trabajo de graduacion y asi poder obtener mi titulo de licenciada. Todos en la vida tenermos tiempos dificiles pero debemos superarlos......No crea por favor que Dios es injusto pues El tiene sus propositos, recuerde la historia de Job que tuvo qu perder todo para poder volver a ganarlo y no fue DIos el que lepuso la mala situacion sino el diablo, pero aun asi Dios no lo abandon JAMAS...Animo y siga adelante|`|2f892571d5f1d1364925b7a87179e043aa	bueno, al no estar en tu situacion no se como puedas sentirte, me imagino que mal teniendo ademas de los problemas que dices la perdida de la f, sinembargo, permiteme aconsejarte diciendo que no deberias concentrarte tanto en Dios para obtener lo que necesitas. Muchas personas creen que Dios los ayuda y otros (como tu) creen que Dios ayuda mas a otras personas, ninguna parece correcta si analizas los casos: el otro dia una amiga me dijo que creia en Dios porque la ayudaba mucho a mi pregunta: "en que cosas?" ella respondio que cuando no queria mojarse cuando llovia, Dios hacia que los taxis pasaran frente a su casa. es eso cosa de Dios?, si puede ayudar a quienes necesitan un taxi por que no a quienes mueren de hambre o sufren por la guerra o la violencia?. la respuesta simple; por que Dios no ayuda a nadie, algunas personas tienen mas recursos o mejor suerte y eso es todo. No digo que Dios no exista, sino que no le importamos un pito.  No se que habras hecho para suplir tus necesidades, pero Dios no es una opcion real, asi que mejor consigue ayuda con otras personas o se mucho mas insistente en tus propositos.      Mucha suerte!|`|968a60a2396df9f0bb1846f983b4ee52aa	primero que nada tienes que tener mucha fe, no te desespere dios sabr cuando te dar lo mejor..pero tu tienes que poner de tu parte y buscar ayuda existen becas y tu hijo puede trabajar tambin pero es fcil decir dios o hecharle la culpa a dios si uno no se ayuda entonces no todo lo puede hacer el...sabes ese es el mal el que te tiene desesperada no dejes que el mal se apodere de tu desesperacin, sabes cuando ores arrodillate y olvidate de todo y empieza a hablar con dios y veras que el te dar respuestas...al decir que piensas que el no existe ya dudastes de el eso nonono...ya veras cuando lo conosca vas a ver que es un dios maravilloso y es el mejor amigo de uno as que ten fe y pon todo en las manos de dios pero sin desesperarte y lo tuyo llegara.. si estas en este mundo es por algn motivo y ese motivo pronto lo sabrs.. hay una frase que dice ayudate que dios te ayudare....el har el resto,pero acuerdate tienes que poner de tu parte y confiar en ti..    suerte.........ten mucha fe|`|827c022239daff0325d68226cff1a491aa	?Yo si creo que Dios existe y te lo digo de corazn!!! Se trata de sentir la energa positiva en todo lo que haces, alguna vez todos los seres humanos atravezamos por situaciones tan difciles que nos sentimos desolados y que a nadie le importamos y creo que es algo que solo sentimos nosotros pues en realidad a veces no nos damos cuenta pero hay gente pendiente de nosotros, incluso la misma energa positiva que transmites a los dems y a tu alrededor hace que vengan cosas an ms positivas, yo no s si tu creas en Dios, pero sea cual fuere tu creeencia es necesario creer en algo, en alguien y lo ms importante en t mismo, pues es una fuente de poder inagotable, ya que si las cosas no se dan a la primera tienes que seguir intentando hasta lograrlo, talvez requiera un poco ms de dedicacin pero es posible lograr tus metas o sue?os, todo lo que te digo y que realmente se ha convertido en mi forma de ver la vida es que el ser humano necesita tres cosas importantsimas: f, esperanza y amor; con todo esto puedes lograr muchas cosas aunque de momento no veas resultados tarde  temprano todas la acciones traen consecuencias positivas o negativas de t depende tratar de cambiar tu entorno y empezar a buscar otras opciones, chale ganas y trata de ser ms positiva, quirete por lo que eres y empieza a conocer todas las cosas que no conoces de t y quiz a cambiar conductas que no nos benefician, y trata en la medida de lo posible siempre tener f, esperanza y amor en todo lo que haces, ya vers que pronto empiezan a tomar un nuevo rumbo las cosas. Disfruta la vida es la nica que tenemos!!! Saludos!|`|9a269fb7062d7c039abfb153782be635aa	hola!    Pues pienso que Dios en todo y para todo tiene un propsito,  aunque pienso que no debemos reprocharle a Dios por tener o no un buen trabajo, pienso que eso ya depende de nosotros, pues Dios NOS DI LA CAPACIDAD de dar lo mejor de nosotros, NOS DI LA INTELIGENCIA para poder salir adelante, ya depender de nuestra RESPONSABILIDAD, CONSTANCIA, GUSTO POR LO QUE HACEMOS para asi poder dar BUENOS RESULTADOS , y asi poder conseguir un mejor empleo o  algun ascenso, un aumento salarial etc.    Recordemos ese dicho muy popular y muy cierto que dice algo asi " No pidas a Dios lo que puedes hacer por ti mismo".    Recuerda, el trabajo no cae como man del cielo eh !!, no llegar por plegarias simplemente, hay que buscarlo, tocar puertas, hacer mritos, no le eches la culpa a Dios por no tener trabajo !    Adems la Biblia dice "no te afanes", " mira las aves del cielo, Dios las cuida!, mira los lirios del campo Dios los viste!!"    Dios proveera !!, recuerda.    No te afanes!!    Dios te bendiga.    Saludos.|`|92c94ab6a6e776acf6fb9a29d77955b9aa	Pues mira, tienes razn, toda la razn, Dios no existe, por eso no te ayuda, pero como Dios no existe los nicos que pueden ayudarse a salir adelante son tu y tu hijo.    Observa que, si bien es cierto que la respuesta esta en que tu le eches todas las ganas y no esperes que un ser imaginario arregle tui vida, observa como otras personas con un poco mas de suerte te echan la culpa a ti de por que su Dios no sirve... que si no tienes fe, que si dios te puede ayudar pero no estas preparada para que te ayude... y un montn de cuentos para auto justificar su creencia en ese ser imaginario.    Deseng?ate de una vez y toma las riendas de tu vida, es lo mejor que puedes hacer... si es difcil, salir adelante va a ser difcil, pero no imposible, y  cada triunfo va a ser 100% tuyo, vas a ver que tu hijo saca la escuela, si le hecha ganas, gracias a solo tu apoyo y su esfuerzo... chale ganas. Es mejor que andarle orando a un ser imaginario para que te componga la vida|`|9399a8f990684535ae60f44a02e01795aa	Mira Dios nunca se olvida de nadie no importa que religin o fundamento tengas, tarda y si las cosas suelen ser muy duras y sobre todo difciles, a todos nos pasa igual hay veces que de nosotros depende en nuestra propia actitud hay que ser positivos, poner de nuestra parte nuestro mayor esfuerzo, y tratar en lo mximo de buscar por nuestra misma cuenta a donde decaemos llegar no hay nada en la vida fcil, todo depende de nosotros.|`|c377764545cf81817c0fd45b7f6a8d97aa	te sugiero que le hagas saber todas tus peticiones a Dios,lo primero  es dirigirte a el por su nombre (salmos 83:18  19) y todo se lo haces llegar mediante Jesucristo  en el nombre de cristo.  mantente segura de que el escuchara tus oraciones,pero  recuerda que estamos viviendo en tiempos crticos difciles de manejar (2 timoteo 3:1-5)   por lo menos sentirs tranquilidad si lo haces con fe, y vas a ver que poco a poco solucionaras tus problemas.  dios se llama jehov|`|5ddbbb2aaa6e82e3cac3e9e818f8dbaeaa	DIOS NO ES PARCIAL SINO QUE EN TODA NACION EL QUE LE TEME Y OBRA JUSTICIA LE ES ACEPTO. A DIOS NO LE IMPORTA LA NACIONALIDAD, EL COLOR DE LA PIEL O LAS CIRCUNSTANCIAS ECNOMICAS DE UNO NO TIENE NADA QUE VER CON EL ASUNTO, SEA COMO SEA LA PERSONA   LO UNICO QUE DIOS VE ES LA MOTIVACION DEL CORAZON Y EL MODO DE VIVIR DE UNO. CUANDO OREN DIRIJAN SUS ORACIONES AL PADRE  MEDIANTE SU HIJO PORQUE JESUS DIJO NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI.?ORA USTED EN EL NOMBRE DE JESUCRISTO Y RECONOCE QUE, COMO HUMANO PECADOR, NECESITA QUE EL INTERCEDA A SU FAVOR?                                                        PORQUE ESTA ES LA CONFIANZA QUE TENEMOS PARA CON EL QUE NO IMPORTA QUE SEA LO QUE PIDAMOS CONFORMA A SU VOLUNTAD EL NOS OYE. NO OBSTANTE PARA TENER DICHA CONFIANZA USTED PRIMERO DEBE CONOCER CUAL ES LA VOLUNTAD DE DIOS. ENTONCES ASEGURESE QUE SUS PETICIONES SETN EN ARMONIA CON ELLRECUERDE QUE LOS OJOS DE JEHOVA ESTAN SOBRE LOS JUSTOS Y SUS OIDOS A SU RUEGO. ?HA SACADO USTED TIEMPO PARA APRENDER LO QUE JEHOVA DICE EN SU PALABRA TOCANTE A LO QUE ES JUSTO Y LO QUE ES MALO?    CUALQUIER COSA QUE LE PEDIMOS LA RECIBIMOS DE EL, PORQUE ESTAMOS OBSERVANDO SUS MANDAMIENTOS Y HACIENDO LAS COSAS QUE LE SON GRATAS.  EL PROFETA ISAIAS DIJO BUSQUEN A JEHOVA MIENTRAS PUEDA SER HALLADO. CLAMEN A EL MIENTRAS RESULTE ESTAR CERCA. DEJE EL INICUO SU CAMINO, Y EL HOMBRE PERJUDICIAL SUS PENSAMIENTOS, PORQUE EL PERDONAR EN GRAN MANERA. CUANDO JESUS ESTUVO EN LA TIERRA DIJO CUANDO USTEDES OREN NO OREN COMO LOS HIPOCRITAS PORQUE A ELLOS LES GUSTA ORAR PARA SER VISTO SE REFERIA A LOS FARISEOS HIPOCRITAS. Y TAMBIEN QUE AL ORAR NO DIGAN LAS MISMAS COSAS REPETIDAS VARIAS VECES, EL QUE EST APARTANDO SU OIDO DE OIR LA LEY DE DIOS HASTA SU ORACION ES DETESTABLE, POR ESO EL APOSTOL SANTIAGO DIJO SI PIDEN Y SIN EMBARGO NO RECIBEN, PORQUE PIDEN CON UN PROPOSITO MALO, PARA GASTARLO EN LOS DESEOS VEHEMENTESQUE TIENEN DE PLACER SENSUAL. SIN EMBARGO TAMBIEN DIJO QUE SIGA PIDIENDO EN FE, NO DUDANDO NADA, PORQUE EL QUE DUDA ES SEMEJANTE A UNA OLA DEL MAR IMPELIDA POR EL VIENTO Y AVENTADA DE UNA PARTE A OTRA. ESA PERSONA NO RECIBIRA COSA ALGUNA.  MIRA TODO ESTO ES PORQUE MUCHAS VECES NO PEDIMOS LAS COSAS CONFORME A LA VOLUNTAD DE DIOS SIN EMBARGO PEDIR AYUDA PARA UN TRABAJO NO ES MALO PERO TENEMOS QUE BUSCARLO NO ESPERAR EN CASA A QUE EL TRABAJO LLEGUE TENEMOS QUE SER PACIENTES RECUERDA QUE DIOS ES EL OIDOR DE LA ORACION Y NUNCA DEJARA A QUIENES LO AMAN Y SE RIGEN POR SUS JUSTAS LEYES, TAMPOCO DEJARA QUE SEAMOS TENTADOS MAS ALLA DE LO QUE PODAMOS AGUANTAR SINO QUE SIEMPRE DISPONDRA LA SALIDA SEGUIR ORANDO PERO CON FE Y ESTANDO SEGURA DE QUE DIOS EN SU DEBIDO MOMENTO CONTESTARA TUS ORACIONES LA PACIENCIA ES UNA VIRTUD.............|`|4ca01a94cdf80338bc3ea34142d13e6baa	Dios escucha; pero tu corazn no tiene completamente fe en l; no te pongas impaciente as hayan pasado mas de diez a?os; ?Acaso Dios no te ha guardado a ti y a tu hijo todo este tiempo? recuerda a la mujer con flujo de sangre ya llevava muchos a?os enferma; pero tuvo fe: con solo tocar el borde de el manto de Jess fue sanada; fue la fe lo que la sano; Dios es el mismo de ayer; ahora y siempre y el quiere bendecirte; no reniegues y confa en el completamente; no confes en la religin confa en Dios, el te ama a ti y a tu hijo el vino a darnos vida y vida en abundancia.

Pero los cristianos hacemos liberaciones no exorcismos.    28 Cuando lleg a la otra orilla, a la tierra de los gadarenos, vinieron a su encuentro dos endemoniados que salan de los sepulcros, feroces en gran manera, tanto que nadie poda pasar por aquel camino.   29 Y clamaron diciendo: ?Qu tienes con nosotros, Jess, Hijo de Dios? ?Has venido ac para atormentarnos antes de tiempo?   30 Estaba paciendo lejos de ellos un hato de muchos cerdos.   31 Y los demonios le rogaron diciendo: Si nos echas fuera, permtenos ir a aquel hato de cerdos.   32 El les dijo: Id. Y ellos salieron, y se fueron a aquel hato de cerdos; y he aqu, todo el hato de cerdos se precipit en el mar por un despe?adero, y perecieron en las aguas. Mateo 8:28-32    Por ejemplo a la gente que juega con la ouija y que en ella no mora el Espiritu Santo es poseda por demonios, casi siempre terminan matandose (como paso con los cerdos) el mal es autodestructivo.      16 Aconteci que mientras bamos a la oracin, nos sali al encuentro una muchacha que tena espritu de adivinacin, la cual daba gran ganancia a sus amos, adivinando.   17 Esta, siguiendo a Pablo y a nosotros, daba voces, diciendo: Estos hombres son siervos del Dios Altsimo, quienes os anuncian el camino de salvacin.   18 Y esto lo haca por muchos das; mas desagradando a Pablo, ste se volvi y dijo al espritu: Te mando en el nombre de Jesucristo, que salgas de ella. Y sali en aquella misma hora. Hechos 16:16-18      13 Pero algunos de los judos, exorcistas ambulantes, intentaron invocar el nombre del Se?or Jess sobre los que tenan espritus malos, diciendo: Os conjuro por Jess, el que predica Pablo.   14 Haba siete hijos de un tal Esceva, judo, jefe de los sacerdotes, que hacan esto.   15 Pero respondiendo el espritu malo, dijo: A Jess conozco, y s quin es Pablo; pero vosotros, ?quines sois?   16 Y el hombre en quien estaba el espritu malo, saltando sobre ellos y dominndolos, pudo ms que ellos, de tal manera que huyeron de aquella casa desnudos y heridos. Hechos 19:13-16    Una liberacin no la puede hacer cualquiera|`|64324dcc1b21c24629df66638343ebedaa	. afortunadamente cada vez es ms raro, y para que haya un exorcismo se requiere que lo haga un sacerdote designado para ello, despus de muy serios y profundos anlisis e investigaciones, en el que confluyen todas las ciencias.|`|e834fac1f2609ccfdb434c575052fd89aa	Si el diablo y los demonios se apoderan de las personas.

Una presencia demoniaca solo puede ser expulsada en el nombre de Jess. No hay otra frmula. Su sacrificio en la cruz es suficiente para limpiar nuestros pecados y para hacer que el diablo huya.

What the Koran says    Immediately following 9/11, to keep people from victimizing Muslims, the government and media began telling us that the attack did not represent all Muslims. I agree with this attitude that people should not just go out attacking people who may not have had anything to do with the attack.    But the US Muslims took advantage of this to sell the US people on Islam telling us that the Koran says it is not good to kill. They quickly began telling us that Islam was really a religion of love and caring.    Were they telling us the truth? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the Koran does say in a number of places that it is not good to kill but that is not the complete verse. The complete verse is "and that you shall not kill - for that is forbidden by Allah - except for a just cause." This basic verse is found three times in the Koran.    This deception brings up several questions. First, why would they deceive us and not quote the entire verse and, second, what is a just cause according to the Koran? I found that both questions will be answered by the same verses. It is important to remember here that a number of the Muslim leaders who called themselves liberals or moderates and said Islam is a religion of peace have been discovered to have given public speeches encouraging Muslims to wage war against and kill the enemy (us.) Their excuse for these speeches is that they really meant the war as being a religious war of evangelizing. So keep this excuse for teaching people to wage war in mind as we explore this question.    Let's start with verse 4:74 - "Let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter, fight for the cause of Allah; whoever fights for the cause of Allah, whether he dies or triumphs, on him We shall bestow a rich recompense." I know that evangelists do die in the field but I have not seen too many who go into the field expecting to die. But we will continue.    Let's try verse 9:111 - "Allah has purchased from the faithful their lives and worldly goods, and in return has promised them the Garden. They will fight for the cause of Allah, they will slay, and be slain." Oops, I have never known any evangelist who went out slaying or killing those to whom they were evangelizing. I believe that this proves beyond any doubt that the war Muhammad keeps talking about in the Koran has to do with actual warfare and killing. So keep in mind that these Muslim leaders were lying to you, the Muslims in the Middle East including Osama Bin Ladden are not lying to you, and that the US Muslims who have said Islam is a religion of peace have no credibility.    But we are not going to let just one verse out of the Koran decide this issue for us. I will give you a few more verses and then we need to cover other aspects for you to properly understand the aggressiveness and ruthless mentality of Islam. You need to know that there are many more like these verses that are just as telling.    Verse 9:123 - "Believers, make war on the infidels who dwell around you."    It should be clear that this verse commands Muslims to wage war on all non-Muslims around them. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.    Verse 47:3 - "When you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield strike off their heads and, when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly."    That is what I call a harsh religion. You are supposed to strike off the heads of those to whom you evangelize?    Verse 48:29 - "Muhammad is Allah's apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers but merciful to one another."    Verse 66:9 - "Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal sternly with them. Hell shall be their home, evil their fate."    I think you would have to be an idiot to not be able to see the hostile nature and commands for the Muslims. It is clear with just these verses that the war they are commanded to wage on all non-Muslims is not evangelizing. They are commanded to fight to kill all non-Muslims including atheists, secularists, humanists, evolutionists, and all other religions but you will find that the Koran places special emphasis on killing off Jews and Christians. This is probably because of the rejection the Jews and Christians gave Muhammad. Keep in mind that I could easily have given you at least another 20 to 30 verses which are just as telling.    But don't take my word about who the unbelievers are, take the word of Muhammad. I want you to notice that he placed special emphasis on Jews and Christians (People of the Book.) We will start with verse 5:17 - "Unbelievers are those who declare: 'God is the Messiah, the son of Mary.'" Oops, I bet some of you blindly believed the Muslims who have been going around speaking at Christian churches saying they worship the same God we do (we already proved that to not be true), they also believe in "The Same Jesus" and even believe in Him more than we do, and that Islam and Christianity are the same religions. You should have read the Koran instead of letting the liars spoon feed you. Always remember this, it is considered a good deed for Muslims to successfully lie to their enemy. Then they go home, call you suckers, and laugh at you for being fools.    But, hey, lets not put everything on one obvious verse. Let's look at at least a few obvious verses like verse 5:51 - "Believers, take neither the Jews nor the Christians for your friends. They are friends with one another." Oops, strike two. How many more verses will it take for you to realize the US Muslims are lying to you and the Middle Eastern Muslims, including Osama Bin Ladden, are telling you the truth. I despise Osama for what he does but have to respect him for being honest, unlike the liars who have misle

Keep re-examining the evidence.  Listen to what different people believe and do so respectfully, don't just dismiss it because it's unfamiliar or not what you believe.    If there's enough evidence to decide that something is probably true, then tentatively conclude that it is probably true.  But if there isn't enough evidence, it's best not to believe in it.  If it's an extraordinary claim, it should have extraordinary evidence.  For instance if you tell me you went to Denny's for lunch, I'm inclined to take your word for it. If you tell me that you went to the planet Saturn for lunch I want to see a huge amount of evidence because that contradicts much of how we have seen the universe work thus far.  And if you conclude that something's probably true, recognize that that might mean it could be wrong. Don't pretend to be certain about what you aren't really sure about.  Always be open to new evidence.  Following these guidelines, I have become agnostic.  But I readily give people the opportunity to show me why I shouldn't be.|`|c05ae9147d55a911d09bf80b2f65b554aa	FAITH!!!|`|fe2e81a73e4f4e95385d69f96e64b5c5aa	It is the faith in yourself and faith in your deeds that make you feel that those thoughts and deeds contribute to bring peace and harmony with the nature.The conviction that there is a supreme power who is an abode of truth,wisdom and bliss, teaches you to purify your thoughts and deeds which entangle the pure soul with the wordly ties.

My belief in Jesus has always been with me, even though I dabbled in other religions. I came back, because, even though it is very hard to follow ALL the Christian teachings, when you choose them over non Christian teachings, you grow and feel better. God rewards us for some of the things on earth, but my Hope is for an eternal life with Him.    I have also had some physical healings after praying for healing, and this was a tangible proof of God's existence and love for me.|`|034f27cb5d63a2ae3df0086d0b19d9eeaa	I was taught of God as a child, so that would have a great consequence. Other factors play in too. But I lost my religion for awhile because of a college professor who had much better arguments than I. God help me NEVER do such a thing to another because it had a crushing effect at a time I really needed faith! It is a very long story of how I found my way back to God, but this I will say, I have no doubt in the world about whether there is a God. I've seen and experienced things that have left me a believer! If you need it, ask God to give you the faith you need. Every prayer is answered, even when we think not.     I am not religious, as I once was. I am spiritual. There is a big difference.

9b88d94914c83b11f5ebd024aaa3017faa	Na bblia - Uma das raz?es de se ter criado o mito da sexta-feira 13 parece estar ligada  histria da Bblia. Segundo o Padre Jo?o Fagundes, da Igreja Nossa Senhora da Glria, em Juiz de Fora, o Novo Testamento conta que Jesus Cristo, na ltima Ceia, sentou-se  mesa com os apstolos, que ao todo, incluindo Jesus, eram 13. Muitas pessoas consideram Judas o 13o apstolo, justamente quem entregou Jesus e o levou  morte na Sexta-feira da Paix?o. Assim, gra?as ao episdio bblico, a sexta-feira 13 passou a ser lembrada como um dia fatdico, ligado  morte.     Na histria - Diz-se que a maldi??o do dia foi fruto de uma briga entre o rei francs Filipe, o belo, e a Ordem dos Templrios, no sculo XIV. Na poca, a Fran?a estava prxima da falncia econ?mica e Filipe resolveu cobrar impostos da Igreja. Excomungado pelo papa Bonifcio VIII, que se indignou diante da decis?o da cobran?a, o rei tentou aproximar-se da Ordem dos Templrios (um grupo de cavaleiros crist?os), pretendendo uma reconcilia??o com a Igreja. Filipe, o belo, n?o foi aceito na Ordem e, como vingan?a, ordenou a pris?o e tortura de cinco mil cavaleiros. O dia era uma sexta-feira, 13 de outubro de 1307.     Outras explica??es - Inmeras s?o as explica??es para a data ser considerada "maldita". S?o justificativas baseadas em diferentes interpreta??es simblicas, religiosas, histrica, numerolgicas, esotricas entre outras tantas, mas a resposta mais lgica  a da supersti??o.|`|83c9e23aa2d1562523f9121f50e5e65caa	par os superticiosos  o dia das bruxas|`|3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	Esta supersti??o teve origem no dia 13 de Outubro 1307, sexta-feira, quando a Ordem dos Templrios foi declarada ilegal pelo rei Filipe IV de Fran?a; os seus membros foram presos simultaneamente em todo o pas, e alguns torturados e, mais tarde, executados, por heresia.    Outra possibilidade para esta cren?a est no fato de que Jesus Cristo provavelmente foi morto numa sexta-feira treze, uma vez que a Pscoa judaica  celebrada no dia 14 do ms de Nissan, no calendrio hebraico.

Na mitologia nrdica encontramos uma lenda sobre isso. Odin, chefe de uma tribo asitica, estabeleceu na Escandinvia seu reino. Para administr-lo, celebrar os rituais religiosos e predizer o futuro, Odin teria escolhido doze sbios, reunindo-os em um banquete no Valhalla, morada dos deuses. Loki, o deus do fogo, apareceu sem ser convidado e armou uma grande confus?o. Como invejava a beleza radiante de Balder, deus do Sol e filho de Odin, fez com que Hodur, o deus cego, o assassinasse por engano. Da veio a crendice de que 13 pessoas reunidas para um jantar  desgra?a certa .    Essa lenda  semelhante, ao episdio da Ultima Ceia de Cristo.    Segundo alguns relatos, participaram dessa ceia sagrada os doze apstolos e Cristo, num total de 13 pessoas. Tambm a o final foi infeliz: a crucifica??o e morte de Cristo, numa sexta-feira. E mais.

Explica-se: Jesus Cristo foi crucificado numa sexta-feira e, na sua ltima ceia, havia 13 pessoas  mesa.    Antes disso, porm, existem vers?es que provm de duas lendas da mitologia nrdica. Na primeira delas, conta-se que houve um banquete e 12 deuses foram convidados. Loki, esprito do mal e da discrdia, apareceu sem ser chamado e armou uma briga que terminou com a morte de Balder, o favorito dos deuses. Da veio a crendice de que convidar 13 pessoas para um jantar era desgra?a na certa.    Segundo outra histria, a deusa do amor e da beleza era Friga (que deu origem a friadagr, sexta-feira). Quando as tribos nrdicas e alem?s se converteram ao cristianismo, Friga foi transformada em bruxa. Como vingan?a, ela passou a se reunir todas as sextas com outras 11 bruxas e o dem?nio. Os 13 ficavam rogando pragas aos humanos.    H tambm suspeitas de que a cren?a venha de uma rixa entre o rei francs Filipe, o Belo, e a Ordem dos Templrios. No sculo 14, o monarca decidiu cobrar impostos da Igreja Catlico. O papa Bonifcio VIII ficou indignado e o excomungou. Filipe tentou, ent?o, entrar para a Ordem dos Templrios. Assim, se reaproximaria novamente da Igreja. Mas n?o foi aceito. Por vingan?a, ordenou a pris?o e tortura de 5 mil cavaleiros. Isto ocorreu em 13 de outubro de 1307.|`|c7b03e4fde3a3e8f628a80d40bfe4dcaaa	Por que, historicamente, foi nesse dia que ocorreu algo muito assombroso e trgico, que fez com que esse dia ficasse famoso por ser o dia do azar.|`|5898a39b885276fb23ce9f0ff3cfafd1aa	De tantos em tantos anos eu fa?o aniversrio nesta data, e n?o tenho nenhum azar.

Em qualquer acep??o, designa "o que  alheio  atualidade, o que  velho". Transposto para a linguagem religiosa dos romanos, o vocbulo "superstitio" veio a designar a observancia de cultos arcaicos, populares, n?o mais condizentes com as normas da religi?o oficial. O nmero 13  tido ora como sinal de infortnio, ora de bom agouro. Quediaehoje.net         A supersti??o que ronda o nmero 13 , sem dvida, uma das mais populares. Sua origem  pag?, e n?o crist?, como muitos pensam, e remonta a duas lendas da mitologia nrdica. De acordo com a primeira delas, houve no Valhalla, a morada dos deuses nrdicos, um banquete para o qual 12 divindades foram convidadas. Loki, deus do fogo, ficou enciumado por n?o ter sido chamado e armou uma cilada: ludibriou um deus cego para que este ferisse acidentalmente o deus solar Baldur, que era o favorito de seu pai, Odin, o deus dos deuses. Da surgiu a idia de que reunir 13 pessoas para um jantar era desgra?a na certa.         A associa??o com a sexta-feira vem da Escandinvia e refere-se a Frigga, a deusa da fertilidade e do amor. Quando as tribos nrdicas e alem?s foram obrigadas a se converter ao cristianismo, a lenda transformou Frigga em bruxa, exilada no alto de uma montanha. Dizia-se que, para se vingar, ela se reunia todas as sextas-feiras com outras 11 bruxas e o dem?nio, num total de 13 entes, para rogar pragas sobre os humanos. Isso serviu para incitar a raiva e a animosidade das pessoas contra Frigga, embora nem sequer existissem figuras malignas como o Diabo nessas culturas. Como a sexta-feira era um dia consagrado  deusa e, portanto, ao feminino, o advento do patriarcado fez com que esse dia fosse o escolhido para ser um dia amaldi?oado, como tudo o que dizia respeito s mulheres - a menstrua??o, as formas arredondadas, a magia, o humor cclico, o pensamento n?o-linear etc.         A ltima Ceia, portanto,  uma posterior releitura dos mitos originais, onde havia 13  mesa, s vsperas da crucifica??o de Jesus, que ocorreu em uma sexta-feira. O 13o convidado teria sido o traidor causador da morte de Jesus, exatamente como Loki foi o causador da morte do filho de deus.         A idia do 13 como um indcio de m sorte surge da concep??o que o judaico-cristianismo tem da morte, que n?o , necessariamente, a idia que Jesus teria tido. Especula-se, inclusive, que Jesus, sendo um sbio iniciado, possa ter estipulado o nmero de pessoas  mesa em 13 precisamente por causa da magia do nmero. Nas cartas do tar?, o Arcano 13  a carta da morte, at por uma possvel associa??o com as letras hebraicas. Estudiosos da prtica interpretam a carta como um sinal de mudan?as de pontos de vista, de formas de viver, e profundas transforma??es internas e externas. Mesmo quando se refere  morte fsica, na concep??o religiosa, esta n?o representa um fim em si mesma, afinal os povos antigos viam a morte como transmuta??o, uma passagem para outro mundo ou plano de existncia, em geral com uma conota??o evolutiva. Por esse motivo, as tradi??es de magia ocidental, como a Wicca (bruxaria moderna), sugerem o nmero de 13 participantes em rituais.    Supersti??es         Muitas pessoas evitam viajar em sexta-feira 13; a numera??o dos camarotes de teatro omite, por vezes, o 13; em alguns hotis n?o h o quarto de nmero 13 - este  substitudo pelo 12-a. Muitos prdio pulam do 12o para o 14o andar temendo que o 13o traga azar. H pessoas que pensam que participar de um jantar com 13 pessoas traz m sorte porque uma delas morrer no perodo de um ano. A sexta-feira 13  considerada como um dia de azar, e toma-se muito cuidado quanto s atividades planejadas para este dia.          Mas h tambm os que consideram o nmero 13 como da sorte. Um exemplo conhecidssimo do brasileiro  do auxiliar-tcnico da Sele??o Brasileira de Futebol, Mrio Jorge Lobo Zagallo.         O argumento dos otimistas se baseia no fato de que o 13  um nmero afim ao 4 (1 + 3 = 4), sendo este smbolo de prspera sorte. Assim, na ndia o 13  um nmero religioso muito apreciado; os pagodes hindus apresentam normalmente 13 esttuas de Buda. Na China, n?o raro os dsticos msticos dos templos s?o encabe?ados pelo nmero 13. Tambm os mexicanos primitivos consideravam o nmero 13 como algo santo; adoravam, por exemplo, 13 cabras sagradas. Reportando-nos agora  civiliza??o crist?, lembramos que nos Estados Unidos o nmero 13 goza de estima, pois 13 eram os Estados que inicialmente constituam a Federa??o norte-americana. Alm disso, o lema latino da Federa??o, "E pluribus unum" (de muitos se faz um s), consta de 13 letras; a guia norte-americana est revestida de 13 penas em cada asa.|`|31da2184c1edfb6105cf8adadf3bdd7daa	isso e besteira................ta beijao.........|`|dbecb6fbfaa1595225a973eb8e3ba820aa	S?o cren?as.Nasci em 13 de agosto.

Para outros, AZAR!!!!    Bem, a famosa sexta-feira 13  uma superti??o... Que por sinal h vrias...    Contarei algumas...    --->    "Supersti??o" vem do latim superstitio, que significa "o excesso", ou tambm "o que resta e sobrevive de pocas passadas". Em qualquer acep??o, designa "o que  alheio  atualidade, o que  velho". Transposto para a linguagem religiosa dos romanos, o vocbulo "superstitio" veio a designar a observancia de cultos arcaicos, populares, n?o mais condizentes com as normas da religi?o oficial.    O nmero 13  tido ora como sinal de infortnio, ora de bom agouro.       O nmero 13     Smbolo de desgra?a, j que 13 eram os convivas da ltima ceia de Cristo, e dentre eles, Jesus que morreu na sexta-feira foi, conseqentemente, ligada ao horror que o nmero 13 provocava nas gera??es crist?s.   Por isso, muitas pessoas evitam viajar em sexta-feira 13; a numera??o dos camarotes de teatro omite, por vezes, o 13; em alguns hotis n?o h o quarto de nmero 13 - este  substitudo pelo 12-a.

A sexta-feira 13  considerada como um dia de azar, e toma-se muito cuidado quanto s atividades planejadas para este dia.     Como se v, a cren?a na m sorte do nmero 13 parece ter tido sua origem na Sagrada Escritura. Esse testemunho, porm,  t?o arbitrariamente entendido que o mesmo algarismo, em vastas regi?es do planeta - at em pases crist?os - , estimado como smbolo de boa sorte.    O argumento dos otimistas se baseia no fato de que o 13  um nmero afim ao 4 (1 + 3 = 4), sendo este smbolo de prspera sorte.   Assim, na ndia o 13  um nmero religioso muito apreciado; os pagodes hindus apresentam normalmente 13 esttuas de Buda. Na China, n?o raro os dsticos msticos dos templos s?o encabe?ados pelo nmero 13.

Alm disso, o lema latino da Federa??o, "E pluribus unum" (de muitos se faz um s), consta de 13 letras; a guia norte-americana est revestida de 13 penas em cada asa.    As lendas    Alm da justificativa crist?, existem 2 outras lendas que explicam a supersti??o. Uma Lenda diz que na Escandinava existia uma deusa do amor e da beleza chamada Friga (que deu origem a friadagr, sexta-feira). Quando as tribos nrdicas e alem?s se converteram ao cristianismo, a lenda transformou Friga em uma bruxa exilada no alto de uma montanha. Para vingar-se, ela passou a reunir-se todas as sextas com outras onze bruxas e mais o dem?nio - totalizando treze - para rogar pragas sobre os humanos. Da Escandinava a supersti??o se espalhou pela Europa.    A outra lenda  da mitologia nrdica. No valha, a morada dos deuses, houve um banquete para o qual foram convidados doze divindades. Loki o esprito do mal e da discrdia, apareceu sem ser chamado e armou uma briga em que morreu o favorito dos deuses. Este episdio serviu para consolidar o relato bblico da ltima ceia, onde havia treze  mesa, s vsperas da morte de Cristo. Da veio a crendice de que convidar 13 pessoas para um jantar era desgra?a na certa.     O Filme Sexta-feira 13    Sexta Feira 13 (Friday the 13th),  o filme de terror de maior suspense.     Conta a histria de Jason, que morreu quando era apenas um garoto (13 de junho de 1957) afogado no lago por incompetncia dos conselheiros que n?o estavam atentos as crian?as. Ningum nunca conseguiu encontrar seu corpo.    Sua m?e come?ou a matar todos os conselheiros, vrios anos depois, no acampamento Cristal Lake, atribuindo-os a culpa por n?o terem cuidado de seu filho. Ela foi morta por um dos conselheiros mas Jason n?o estava morto e anos mais tarde ele viria a aparecer para se vingar dos assassinos de sua m?e. Jason usou a mscara de hockey apenas no 3o filme, antes ele usava um pano amarrado ao seu pesco?o com um furo para o olho esquerdo. Jason ainda ficou vivo por mais trs filmes, onde at fez uma visitinha a New York. Morreu em 1996 quando sua irm? lhe cravou uma adaga sagrada (nica combina??o de coisas capaz de matar Jason para sempre).

46e1cd462731e0d27d0f22b42a8e4494aa	If more people would seek the truth there would be more knowledge.    Differences    1. Christianity and Islam differ on which family tree fulfilled most adequately the promises made to Abraham. Was it the family of Isaac or the family of Ishmael (pbut)? Christian say the promise to Isaac ended with Jesus (pbut), who was the fulfillment of all Old Testament prophesy. Islam says the Muhammad (pbuh) was the fulfilling Prophet of Ishmael's tradition.    2. The religions differ on the nature of human beings. Christianity, on the whole, has a negative view of human nature and asserts that we are fallen creatures. Therefore, the doctrine of original sin is central for Christians. We are saved only by the death and resurrection of Jesus (pbuh). Islam has a more positive notion of men and women and does not believe we are lost persons. Hence, it rejects the theology which supports original sin. We are saved by following the guidance provided for us in the Quran.    3. These differing views of human nature naturally lead to differing views about Jesus (pbuh). What Christians see as the heart of their faith--the divine sonship of Jesus: his incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection; and the trinity-- are seen by Islam as distortion and alterations of true Islam, the original revelation of Allah    Similarities    1. Christianity and Islam share a joint legacy of Biblical tradition and the same heritage of prophethood. Both religions come from Judaism, share the common parentage of Abraham, and delight in the Jewish Torah.    2. Islam and Christianity are both monotheistic religions and ascribe similar attributes to God: Creator, Sustainer, Judge, and Forgiver.     3. Islam and Christianity emphasize personal acts of piety such as prayer, fasting, charity, and scripture reading. They share as well the prophetic call to help the oppressed, the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the homeless.    4. Jesus (pbuh) was born to a virgin mother.|`|AA11277007	TOO much info to be covered here    BIG difference    Muslims think Esua was the choosen line  Jews/Christions Think Issac was the choosen line    Muslims think of Jesus as a Respected prophet  Christians consider Him the Son of God himself.|`|d4977044e29fe00c94b832eddda8673eaa	The fundamental difference is Belief in one God.|`|d17dab2f5223f525668cd6b49aa634e2aa	Jesus PBUH) in Islam is Prophet and Messanger of God.

(not so in Islam)  To be a Christian is a choice and if you don't choose to be Christian, you aren't jailed or put to death. If you were a christian and decided not to remain a christian you are not  jailed or put to death!  Christianity teaches to love, forgive, correct IN LOVE WHEN necessary and to help one another. More importantly Christianity teaches US that GOD loves, forgives, corrects IN LOVE WHEN NEEDED, and helps US help each other.  Men and women are equals, Genesis tells us that men and women are joint heirs in what God has given us.    Not able to speak much on Islam, what I do know gives me the creeps.... women are to be veiled in public and not allowed to travel unless they are in groups or escorted by a man at all times, (some Muslim countries have relaxed this, but not by much...) A man can have as many as four wives as long as he can financially support them and he can treat them ANYWAY HE WANTS,   they have to pray 5 times a day facing Mecca, no pork in their diets,   they have to make the hajj at least once in their lives to Mecca to circle the Kaa'bah stone 7 times (men separately, women separately if at all)  and in worship, men and women are separate.   (actually visited a mosque when I was about 12...) My father flirted with the idea of becoming a Muslim, but he liked his pork chops and beer too much.....|`|d2ba04166ea3c66188177868225c0e6eaa	You might want to look at this    http://answering-islam.org.uk/    The stopper for me was: -   Islam allows killing in the name of God (they call it Jihad, I call it terrorism)|`|AA10768829	who Gods' messenger is.

It is no different today.|`|AA11115706	"I know alot more than you do"    Oh, that's funny.    And in regards to your foolish question, most human deaths are not caused by religious wars or negative ideaologies. Maybe you should have researched before you asked this question instead of asking people to research before answering it. Most deaths are, in fact, caused by "natural" causes, meaning death by old age, starvation, disease etc. And you do realize that many of the worst mass killings in all of human history were caused by atheists like Hitler and Stalin, right? (and no, despite what some crackpot websites might tell you, Hitler was not a Christian).    Edit: I never said that you said "all", stupid. You said, and I quote,  "If religion teaches peace, why are most human deaths are caused by regilious war or hatred other beliefs?" I just proved to you that most human deaths are NOT caused by religious war, or hatred or anything like that.    And also, if religion means any belief, like you say, then I guess even atheism is a religion. So your whole tirade is meaningless. Everyone believes something, whether it is in God or naturalism or whatever else. And the whole point is, someone calling themselves a "Christian" could kill someone, BUT THAT WOULD BE GOING AGAINST THE LAWS OF THEIR OWN RELIGION. But if an atheist kills someone, it is completely consistent with their beliefs, because there is no ultimate moral code if life as we know it is nothing more than an accident.

Most probably would not know the difference between George Handel and George Harrison primarily because their songs don't include such catchy phrases as "Uhn, uhn, yeah, yeah, uhn" and there is no mention of gats, bling or 'hoes anywhere.

e05bf9c966329e01a6bda42cf4114a13aa	"Desdemona" is a moon of Uranus. She is also a character in Shakespeare's play, viz. the wife of Othello, and who is a personification or symbol of purity as a contrast to the malevolent Iago and his wife Emily.    "Nephilim" (in Hebrew means "the fallen [ones]"), who are a people created by the cross-breeding of the "sons of God" and the "daughters of men". (See Genesis 6:1.) The word nephilim is loosely translated as "giants" or "titans" in some Bibles, and is left untranslated in others.    One could conclude, therefore, that "Desdemona" refers either to a female counterpart or a female aspect. If that's the case, then it would imply a female fallen angel.

The sorority you plegded might have been completely different from what it is now (depending on when you graduated) so it would definitely depend on the sisters above all else.
