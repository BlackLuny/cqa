Okay, so obviously iTunes didn't actually steal it, but I couldn't think of a better term to use, so yeah.   I had just clicked 'buy' and then this thing popped up saying something along the lines of 'your balance is gone' and that I'd get it back eventually. I think. Has this ever happened to anyone?

20090131135736AAEhf4k	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Cell-Phone Amplifier or booster?	Hi, I (like many others) have terrible cell phone reception. Which is why I still keep a land-line at my house running. Recently I've been online researching different cell phone carriers, trying to see if one would have better reception then the other(typing in address, which brings up a map of reception levels). Seeing as all carriers provide roughly the same "1-bar" reception, (according to map/experimenting with Verizon and sprint) Plan-B is all i could think up of which consists of some type of Antenna which would boost/amplify my cell phone reception. Apparently from what I have read- the "boosters" only work if you have good reception say in one area of your house providing other "dead-spots" with clear calling. But I digress,(thought i should give you background knowledge on my situation) my question is if anyone knows of a Cell Phone External Antenna that possibly "creates" better reception (or uses clear reception from maby half a town over lol) so I can finally get rid all together of my land-line/rationalize the fact that paying high cell phone bills is worth all the use of the phone Thank-You! =]

My ipod screen flashed a low battery signal for about a second and went blank. I can't get any display on the screen at all and it won't come up in itunes when i hook it up to the computer. I have tried charging it in my Bose stereo dock and with the wall plug that came with the ipod. Does anyone have any ideas?

About 5 months ago i bought two RCA converter boxes with included remote controls.   They both worked fine with no problems.   About 3 weeks ago one of the remote controls stopped being able to control the volume and shut on and off.

I've changed the batteries, re programmed both of them they still wont volume up or down or turn on or off the TVs anymore.   Both still change channels as long as I turn on the Tv manually and use the volume controls on the TV as well.   Does anyone know how to make the remotes fully work again like they used to?

20090131155807AAOlxOQ	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wii fit not for people with big feet?	So I just bought Wii Fit from my local Walmart...which had two copies, some kid had one and some old dude had the other...so pushed the old dude down, took his and ran to self check out and vacated the premises. (Figured it's less evil to take it from the old guy rather than the kid...he was gonna die soon anyway. Anyway I digress, so after some time of playing I'm noticing my size 11 1/2 feet are slightly too big for the board. That made me wonder, hmm just what is the "average" foot size, did they make the American board bigger then the Japanese. If not, why? It's is a fact that American's in general are bigger than Japanese people...and generally fatter too. So when making a product to satisfy two different demographics why use the same specifications. Our feet ARE bigger, its just how we are. So Nintendo needs to make a longer board or an add on to put on the board for ppl with bigger feet.      With that said, if you wear size 12 shoes+ then I dont suggest Wii Fit for you. It's fun as hell but you're going to get very frustrated with the board and probably eventually break it...*&^%$ technology wont work for me, I'll fix it with my hammer. OR you could cut off your toes, might fit then.

20090131170812AAdKWPA	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Update 2.40 wont let me play videos in the playstation browser?	So before I downloaded the 2.40 update (that incuded that photo viewer thing?) well I used to be able to watch videos from facebook.com crunchyroll.com (some people are saying google videos isnt working either) but yeah, It wont play videos from those sites anymore? I primarily use my ps3 to watch movies, tv shows and anime but the new update did something? I think it has to do with that adobe thing? idk, how should I fix it? or will sony fix it in a new update... thanks in advance :)
20090131170050AAzhNOy	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Will Free Realms make up for what Home lacks?	Lets face it, Playstation home was an utter disaster... and it isn't even officially released yet. However, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) is releasing a new 'Free' MMO available both on the PC and the Playstation store. It's basically a mesh of Home, Facebook, and WoW.    Personally I think It's going to be soo much better than home, the only thing is that it might not be 'serious' enough of a game because of it's "kid friendly world" and it's lack of focus with the job systems.   So what do you think? will it make up for Home failure?

20090131170924AAywOLI	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS2 not reading discs?!?	I have a PS2 Slim for about 3-4 years and was working perfectly normal.  NOW, my PS2 does not read PS2 discs. When I first insert a PS2 disc, it WILL appear with memory card in white screen. BUT when you select the Disc, the 'Playstation 2' logo will appear BUT it would go straight back to the white screen menu. And if i was to reselect the disc, it would keep doing the same thing.   However my PS2 does read PS-ONE games. I dont know if i need a lens cleaner or reconnect a wire inside the PS2.    How can i make my PS2 read all the disc properly.  PLEASE HELP. What is the cheapest option.
