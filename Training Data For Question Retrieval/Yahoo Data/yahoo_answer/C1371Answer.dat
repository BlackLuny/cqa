IoXRN6L2aa	well funny, this place an do with a few laughs!|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Your video turns out not to be available in my country. <br>  <br>  So I guess that means gender-melding technology won't be available here either for some time yet.|`|LrsGIkJQaa	Nope. What you've got here is Robert Webb pretending to be Jennifer Beals' character from Flashdance.<br>  <br>  I hardly think some comedian off the telly and an American actress are representative of the hole spectrum of male/female characteristics.<br>  <br>  Anyway, "the aspects of the genders", as you put it, are already melded in each and every one of us. And by that I mean that we all possess characteristics that might stereotypically be associated with the opposite gender to that which we are.<br>  <br>  All of us are a whole melting pot of different traits - both masculine and feminine. And we're all different. <br>  <br>  There isn't one prototype.<br>  <br>  But the video is pretty funny :D
5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I'm around feminists all the time and don't hear those words at all. I mainly hear these two words: recession and unemployment.

If there are any men at a college women's studies party, the "misogyny" drinkers hit the floor first.|`|D02rAMWoaa	Patriarchy passes out first...pukes also!|`|ZYp1AEspaa	This is more of a rant (well, actually a whine) than a question.
Y5vRlwYiaa	I got nominated last year as a freshman and this year as a sophomore.<br>  I didn't get a chance to go last year because I was going on a People to People Student Ambassador trip that summer. <br>  You should defiantly go if you have the financial means, I know I will be (if I have the money haha).<br>  I've researched it and it looks like a great experience and well worth the money.<br>  You shadow doctors, visit hospitals, tour medical schools, and have medical discussions with professionals in the field.<br>  But if you have the money, I would defiantly go!
m3YC7Jcyaa	depends on how deep sleeper you are, mostly no but some are more sensitive.  I can tune out and tune in any frequency. The tv doesn't have much to do with it unless its loud.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	How could it if you are asleep.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Yes<br>  Yes<br>  Yes|`|Ajy2wXiuaa	yes!!! and dont screw you mind up more, molding it with the uselessness of tv. ever since i started watching tv i lost part of my creativity, and the ability to lucid dream. i deeeeeeply regret ever watching tv.|`|cAMleGWlaa	Yes it can. And also falling asleep while watching TV means your mind will not be in a total state of rest. Turn off the TV before you go to bed and you should have a better nights sleep.|`|FVkyxQjqaa	Yeah for instance if your listening to loud music you could have a nightmare or if your watching spongebob than your dream could be total choas
6kUx7fwcaa	You know, I am not sure what you have here.  Which numbers are you correlating, the second column to the third column, the first column to the  second and third?  You can put the numbers into a formula for correlation very easily that look up the correlation you have in a table by looking at the number of N and if the absolute value of the correlation is greater than the number shown in the table.  Usually there are tables for p<0.05 and p < 0.01.  Those tables can be found in the back of the book.  Read what the tables are used for.

zXPGm2fraa	Wow sounds familiar...  Like he wants you to stay in his life but you can't gauge anything because he won't actually communicate with you.. And you care about him a lot, so you're not sure what to do and you are looking for information so you can decide how to move forward in your own life? If that's you too then I can tell you that I did stay, and he still refuses to communicate, it's as if that's how he's wired or something. I get more communication from the anti-fems here on answers then from him. I still love him, and he says he loves me sooo much, but I can't take the silent treatment and manipulation for much longer. In other words, if he's the same way, he may never listen to you. If it feels weird, it probably is.|`|PymVygFraa	Yeah he would... it seems he loves you and is trying to show it, but is probably hard for him?<br>  Yeah I think it is a good idea, you can probably have a wonderful relationship, especially when you really tell him how you feel.<br>  It seems like you can't, I think you need to contact him again, but make it important, special and telll him.  Try just once more... and then wait for him to call you if it doesn't work out at first.<br>  Goodluck!<br>  xx|`|ZYp1AEspaa	He sounds very set in his non-communicative ways. <br>  <br>  He's doing a passive resistance to your wish to progress the relationship. For whatever reason. No one on here can read his mind for you. <br>  <br>  If you keep hanging around, this will set up a power imbalance which will always get in the way of a reasonable relationship. <br>  <br>  I'd say get on with whatever else you want to do. Waiting for someone to see your pain is not a winning or attractive proposition.<br>  <br>  You don't have to have a big official BREAKUP if that's too hard; just get on with your life and stop dwelling on him.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	We already answered this question for you, and I came to the conclusion that it was YOU who was holding things back and NOT HIM!
oG3MyQTyaa	If you have received this message from someone else, I would say that they do have some type of feelings for you and they would love to express and experience them, BUT they are afraid to go further due to the fact they make get hurt. They fear the unknown and what the future holds so it is easier for them to turn it all off completely. This way, they know they will not get hurt and they can control the future. Hope this helps.|`|AA12275754	It sounds like this person is attracted to you but would rather deny it because they don't wish to feel this way towards you for whatever reason. Rather interesting really. If this message pertains to you and you want to keep this friend do what they ask and only talk in general topics nothing personal if this person isn't that important then let them be.|`|9e3mxs6waa	that you put yourself out there on facebook and its making this person want you in ways that they don't like so they want to make it better for themselves and avoid you.|`|bGtsDFxiaa	Back off.|`|bmbWOGPFaa	It sounds like a harassed priest.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	it says that you turn someone on in a few ways and they want to avoid that feeling..<br>  it says exactly what it says.|`|AA10023809	It means "You've got issues and I do not want to know about them." <br>  <br>  So now you can now write a note about how people do not make an effort to understand you, do not care about your suffering, and how miserable it makes you feel.

67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	No...nothing to do with innocent til proven guilty challenges, but everything to do with risk assessment and management. Would someone suspected of DUI be allowed to drive off in their car until the blood sample comes back, would a suspected child abuser be allowed to keep the child until the peadiatrician's report comes back, and would a suspected rapist be allowed to keep the ski mask and knife until the forensics lab did the tests?<br>  So, domestic violence..what is it to you?<br>  Ask yourself..if someone kicked the crap out of you in the street, and broke your teeth, bruised your eyes, bust your nose, and brandished a gun at you...and the police said "Until we get corroborating evidence, CCTV footage something, we only have your word against 'his'" Would you be happy they left the gun with the gentleman.<br>  Crime is a crime, by simply calling the perp husband, father, boyfriend does not make it less serious!<br>  And in the US State Department Statistics show that domestic homicides - mala against female, have steadily risen since the inception of shelters, but the homicide of men (firearms) by women in self defence where domestic abuse is a factor has actually fell in that time. So this idea that there is equality is bollocks...men are safer! Not feminist fantasy, the US government homicide statistics!|`|G50ucmllaa	"Suspects" yes.  They are just suspects.  Sadly you cannot prevent every crime.  Even if you did violate the rights of those who remain suspects there would still be people killed by those who are "innocent".  If someone is willing to murder their ex wife and children, they are willing to get a gun illegally.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Suspects??? Lady, you are on fire today. <br>  <br>  Let's just say...male domestic abuse suspects, or anyone who makes women afraid, should be jailed and have their weapons revoked. And be put on medication. And get their feminist training a la Clockwork Orange. And then shot. Then everything will be hunky dory.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	A strict constitutional reading would say that being a suspect is insufficient.<br>  <br>  However, DV convicts should lose their gun rights.  Perhaps DV suspects should be required to surrender their fireamrs until after the trial.<br>  <br>  That, by the way, is my position as well.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	IMO no one should have a gun. It's always the innocent people that get harmed by them. But in this case, or any case where someone is suspected of being violent, they should lose their right to have a gun indefinitely.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular American belief, guns do not make people safer.|`|AA12144404	suspects are innocent by definition, if convicted, then that would be another story.<br>  <br>  Taking the property of the innocent would be like if they confiscated your car because you might run a red light.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	Guns are just tools.<br>  <br>  Someone intent on harming their partner could just as easily get a kitchen knife, baseball bat, or simply use their hands.<br>  <br>  So yes, domestic abuse suspects should be allowed to keep their guns.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Heck no. Probable cause is enough reason to confiscate guns from even suspected violent criminals. It can take ages for a court case to be decided, and in that period, the accused might take up arms and slaughter the poor woman who tried so disparately to get away from him.<br>  <br>  This isn't rare or uncommon. The number one killer of women between 16 and 50 is being murdered by a former or current domestic partner. The chance of murder increases exponentially after she leaves or makes attempts to do so. OJ's crime is a prime example.<br>  <br>  Even a restraining order or crimes like stalking and harassment are enough to give legal authorities enough probable cause to suspect that you're not capable of the rational judgment needed for the safe keeping of arms.<br>  <br>  That anyone thinks that it is a GOOD idea to let the suspects of crimes that are statistically likely to proceed assault with a deadly weapon or homicide is shear idiocy. Temporary suspension of the right to bear arms would prevent hundreds upon thousands of deaths. What is the prevention of wrongful violent death to the "right" to something not strictly necessary for a full and happy life?<br>  <br>  Furthermore, modern interpretations of the Constitution back up this claim. The right to bear arms can be restricted with probable cause and with legal banning of some sorts of assault weaponry in all 50 states. Such has been decided by numerous federal courts and legal scholars for decades. A substantive due-process application of the 2nd amendment to the states via the 14th amendment has never been considered valid in the way that such applications of the 1st amendment have. And even the 1st amendment can be restricted with probable cause or to advance a "compelling state interest" (this is the actual words of the decision in Locher vs New York LOOK IT UP).<br>  <br>  I'm pretty damn sure that there is no better "compelling state interest" than the protection of human life in such case in which the alleged victim of the suspected criminal is more statically likely to end up dead or brutalized than in perhaps any other crime I can think of.|`|RKLce4ltaa	If these suspects are not in custody and not found guilty by a jury of their peers, the 2nd Amendment is in full effect IMNSHO.<br>  <br>  Feminists do themselves no favors with their anti-gun stance.  You don't have to be a man to pull a trigger.<br>  <br>  Just ask Mary Winkler.
FKR45WLPaa	I agree with what Huzzle said, but I also think that humans have removed themselves psychologically from the reality of death.  There is so much that humans are exposed to, that nothing seems real or permanent.  I used to enjoy those movies until I became a parent. That is when I couldn't stand the reality of what humans can do to other humans.  We have just become so desensitized to violence that it seems entertaining now.  I have been just a guilty as anyone, but I wish that companies wouldn't make this form of entertainment available to anyone under 18.  Hope that helps.|`|9e3mxs6waa	i think its because of the fact that its wrong that people like it so much<br>  like getting something for free when you know you shouldn't<br>  people who get away with murder have a sense of superiority and control. knowing you controlled someones fait, i mean its all about power<br>  everyone kills its just wrong when humans do it<br>  but we like it cause its wrong<br>  plain and simple|`|mjddqeSraa	It's nature, survival of the fitest, it's not just humans, it's just that Humans are more intelligent enough to develop different ways of killing other than hand to hand...watch a nature program, you see every species fights|`|256891400379bbbbbce12396d37ae520aa	i believe all nature is this way human,s may in time Evolve be on this as they be  come more intelligent i hope so any way i do not know why nature was planned this way if i was a super  human i would have done better than this.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Men are responsible.<br>  <br>  The cause is the male hormone.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	It is really more an expression of needs - need for dominance and establishing pecking order to assure individual survival and territoriality which stems from a need for "family" survival and survival of dominant genes.<br>  Somehow, however, evolution is actually favoring a reversal of this trend, because the continued pursuit of this trend will ultimately result in complete destruction of the world as we know it.  Evolution is now favoring cooperation, compromise, and the assurance that all things survive as much as possible.  Consider the philosophy of Teilhard de Chardin.

You can get some very good guesses about what people are thinking although some movements may seem to indicate a certain idea or feeling but some movements only seem to mimic body language or someone may be thinking something in the back of their head and so you may thing you are viewing something that has something to do with one thing while it is really about another.<br>  <br>  The technology will some day exist to scan a brain and it reads signals and brainwaves remotely.|`|HvOJ182qaa	i can read my friends mind...<br>  well sort of.<br>  <br>  I'll be thinking something and he'll then say exactly the same thing im thinking and i'll be like yeah i was just thinking that!<br>  Or a lot of the time, we can tell what each other is thinking and we can finish each others sentences.<br>  <br>  Im not claiming to be a mind reader though, i think its just because my friend and share similar outlooks on things and have the same Sense of humour!<br>  Its funny though!|`|XstaAKLLaa	sometimes yes, especially if they're very sensitive people, sensitive to other people's feelings. women are thought to be more intuitive than men (though some people claim that this is just a myth) and i think some theories regarding intuition might be a good start for your topic. sry I can't help more.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Have you watched Poker players on TV?

Why is that woman shaking her leg? Why is he opening and closing his phone? Is she crying because something bad happened, or is she happy?

mCAWxobNaa	It's odd, I'm thinking about the best coaches in the NFL & NCAA Football and none of them were particularly great players in their day if at all.  Bill Belichick did NOT even play football (I don't think), then some of the best NCAA coaches never played a day of College ball in their lives. <br>  <br>  I actually never thought about this but it could be a matter of these guys simply having had the time and ability to master the game from all vantage points, perhaps some of it is political, but honestly I just can't think of a specific reason for this phenomenon (and we do see it in pretty much every major sport).|`|uXqDYPNVaa	That's a good question; I'll ask about it on tomorrow's episode of the sports show.<br>  <br>  Your description of Magic Johnson as a coach is telling. He didn't like it – a great coach (a good anything, as a matter of fact) has to genuinely enjoy what they do. Star players probably like playing the game a lot better than they would ever like running it. It gives them more of an opportunity to shine. Others prefer to be behind the scenes.|`|OTT79NAtaa	This shows that they haven't truly mastered the game (as if it was fair to expect that they had simply because they were individually successful). This shows us that Magic was a fantastic player not because he was masterful in the conceptualization and strategy of basketball theory, but mainly because he was physically skilled and competitively inclined.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	If your theory is true, the WNBA is going to have some AWESOME coaches in the next few years.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Star players often are stars because of innate talent, whereas mediocre players rely on hard work to achieve success.  Talented players are successful without putting forth much effort.  Mediocre players have to work hard to achieve, and they know that they have EARNED the success they enjoy.<br>  <br>  No matter how much talent you have, you cannot impart talent on another person.   But a mediocre player who works really hard can teach and mentor other players to work hard in order to achieve success.<br>  <br>  Clarification:  I did not mean to imply that talented people do not work hard.   I meant to say that success comes more easily to a talented person because they can achieve the same thing with less effort than a mediocre person.    Looking back, I see my original choice of words did not convey what I meant to say.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Actually it's very easy to understand. Star athletes are driven by their abilities to do more and to push themselves to be better. They have the talent to control their sport or to be the leader of the team. They raise everyone else's level up a notch. When they become a coach, they no longer have that control. They can't coach someone to be great. You either are or you are not. They certainly can't make the other players play the way they themselves did.<br>  <br>  The less talented players did not have those star skills. They had to work extra hard just to get a spot on the team. While the stars were given a free pass in meetings and other off the field, rink, court etc stuff. These folks had to pay more attention to detail. Watch and break down game film and  it ultimately prepared them to be coaches. In the end, some coaches are better than others.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I don't think it's really that their standards are so high, so much as that they are naturally gifted and don't really "get" why it would be difficult for others. They tend to say "just do it" and not know exactly what will be needed to improve, since they got there in a more direct way. <br>  <br>  And also I think a great athlete on a team is like a virtuoso musician. All their skill is in the doing; it's up to the coach or the conductor to make the whole ensemble work together.|`|AA10712251	there is an old saying: 'those who cannot play; coach'  that is because they usually have a greater understanding of the fundamentals of the game. they study the successful coaches and mimic their styles. they are also a lot less arogant than star player turned coach.|`|XRVJDMiiaa	star athletes are used to working with the best and have big ego so when they coach and work with average player then they fail|`|cAMleGWlaa	Star player are often only concerned with themselves (and they usually have to be to get so good) so when it comes to coaching they often have problems relaying what they know to others. Its like trying to explain something that you completely understand to someone who just doesn't understand at all. It seems like it should be easy but its often hard to put into words something that just seems so natural for you. <br>  Mediocre athletes on the other hand understand how "normal" athletes think and are better at relaying information and getting them to understand, especially if they have a good coaching style. Also the fact that there are more mediocre athletes than star athletes means there is a greater chance that one of the mediocre athletes will turn out to be a great coach
urs7M4ITaa	To see a spider in your dream, indicates that you are feeling like an outsider in some situation. Or that you may want to keep your distance and stay away from an alluring and tempting situation. The spider is also symbolic of feminine power. Alternatively, a spider may refer to a powerful force protecting you against your self-destructive behavior. If you kill a spider, it symbolizes misfortune and general bad luck. <br>  <br>  Spiders are also a symbol of creativity due to the intricate webs they spin. On a negative note, spiders may indicate a feeling of being entangled or trapped in a sticky or clingy relationship.?It represents some ensnaring and controlling force. You may feel that someone or some situation is sucking the life right out of you. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are bitten by a spider, represents a conflict with your mother or some dominant female figure in your life. The dream may be a metaphor for a devouring mother or the feminine power to possess and entrap. Perhaps you are feeling trapped by some relationship<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
IaFTUQQGaa	The main problem  of the people who are genius (not just high IQ) is that they have to be artificial in relationship to those around them.  <br>  <br>  By artificial, I mean that they cannot talk about what is going on in their heads nor their impressions of things going on around them.  <br>  Why?  because those who are around them would not understand.<br>  <br>    It is as if you were constantly surrounded by 7 year olds.   They do not see what you see, can not understand what you understand.  But they are your only companionship.  <br>  <br>  So you "try" to relate or you keep quiet  thereby seeming to be socially awkward by the 7 year olds around you.  All because you do not relate to the world as a 7 year old.|`|V4JLwTVyaa	In order to make room for the smart brain things, some of the other areas of the brain have to go dark.<br>  <br>  In other words, he's focusing more on his own thoughts and all the information running through his head, which doesn't leave him a lot of spare time to deal with emotions and social skills.|`|5ASRK3sDaa	It's not a matter of spending more time with books than people as others have suggested. Social interaction doesn't come naturally to some and its something that has to be worked on.

I always had trouble in social interactions (I've worked on it and now I'm much better at it) but I've never had to study a day in my life.

I'm not bragging, I really hated the attention it got me. <br>  <br>  Every one's brain is "wired" quite differently. It's not a matter of choosing books and computers over real people.

It's not in their equilibrium to just let lose like any regular kid, they just like to invest their time in things that are worth the while or competitived have fun at the same time, like swimming and playing water polo.|`|ShVvz5qKaa	Why are geniuses socially retarded?  Probably because it's hard to try to fit in with people that are STUPID.  It's hard enough to find someone with the same way of thinking already, so think about it from his perspective.  He goes through life surrounded by people dumber than he is.  Poor guy.<br>  It's gotta be lonely for him.  Like the kids that go to college really early.  They don't fit in with people their own age because they're too smart, and the people that he's intellectually compatible with see him as a child still.
ThE5yYqaaa	LOL same thing happens to me :P lol i don't think you can "fix" this... but if you find a way lemme know! lol i think it has something to do with the fact that your body can't physically feel that kind of pleasure (as in climax) while you're asleep... idk.. just wut i think... good luck! lol

But if you keep trying n never give up... you'll make it someday. <br>  <br>  On next... if someone betray on our trust.. just take it as a lesson...

AA12231462	Its the basic set of sociological thoughts a limiting factor for  research so if you were doing research into class you might say that you were going to be working within a Marxian paradigm so that you are signaling up which sociological framework you are limiting yourself within.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	A paradigm is a model, usually created over time, and based on observed behaviors and/or actions; or based on teachings from people we trust.  <br>  <br>  Many times, paradigms don't hold true, but because they become so ingrained in our consciousness, when they don't hold true we call that a "busted paradigm."  <br>  <br>  If you have a paradigm that Muslims are all militant, and then you meet a peaceful, friendly Muslim, you may think it's odd.  Meet more, and you may begin to question your paradigm; possibly even alter it or abandon it all together.  <br>  <br>  If you think prejudices are based on paradigms, you're right; in certain circumstances, paradigms lead to prejudice.  However, paradigms can be very innocuous.  How a businessman expects a business to handle its marketing is a good example.  If he hires a new marketing manager with different ideas, the businessman may need to change his paradigm, or he may think the marketer is "nuts" and fire him.<br>  <br>  Y!A is a great place to observe paradigms.  Many of us have paradigms, and when someone else challenges it we give their answers a low rating, or reply to their questions with negative answers.|`|ma7oJyuzaa	paradigm<br>      (n) : an example serving as a model or pattern; a set of all forms which contain a common element, especially the set of all inflectional forms of a word or one of its grammatical category<br>      "boy, boy’s, boys, boys’ is the paradigm of boy."
19b3e9abf53eb6de6b79bd8971d0d072aa	Confidence and arrogance are two entirely different things.  Being confident means that you are comfortable in your own skin and don't look for the approval of others.  You trust your instincts.  Arrogance is haughtiness, rudeness, and never something you'd want to be.  If you are confident you will be much happier.|`|AA10057370	today arrogance is considered confidence.<br>  <br>  If you do your best at work and life (be confident in yourself and realize true friends are rare and hard to come by).Try to find some friends at a bible believing church.|`|tM8kCtuGaa	be confident<br>  confidence is sexy...Paris Hilton said so herself!!<br>  && yes you have to love yourself! look in the mirror daily and find something you love about yourself and build on the things you don't like but don't ponder on them...if you truly love you it will really show!<br>  arrogance?? well...thats a whole different subject but you dnt have to be arrogant to be confident!!

That was then. Now, that would be considered stalking.<br>  <br>  As to older women seducing teenage boys, well, it depends on the age of the teenager. Men do it all the time to young females. What's good for the goose.....|`|jf1f7vNxaa	That someone was me.<br>  <br>  I never heard the song before you referenced it, and I downloaded it and listened.<br>  <br>  Not my cup of tea musically, but I enjoy the sentiment behind it.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you noticed my follow up question, because people were obfuscating my Q with the fact that the adult woman was a teacher.<br>  <br>  Still the PC set claimed that the boy would be emotionally scarred, yet nobody explained HOW a boy would be hurt - instead, they kept telling me to "reverse the genders" and see how it would fly.<br>  <br>  hardly logic - but what can you expect in PC land?
urs7M4ITaa	When you are in a deep stage of sleep your body kind of...spasms. You'll know what I mean if you have ever woken up with cramp or something. You enter a stage of 'paralysis'. This sometimes integrates itself into your dream where for example you will fell like you can't move or something. It shoudn't worry you too much. It is like...well...have you ever stayed asleep when your alarm clock is on, and then what they are talking about on the radio or the song or something comes into your dream? It is the same thing. The fact that your body is 'spamsing' etc can come into your dream too.|`|fETbCVXbaa	when you fall you are going back into your body. when you dream your soul is out of your body. You have the best dreams at a freinds house or remeber them more because you are in an unusual place and are not really very comfortable, or not used to everything, so your likley to remeber them and have beter dreams there.

fB4RfiCgaa	A lot of the traditions are being lost due to an increasingly globalized world and the infiltration of technologies making traditional life less appealing to the youth. Many of the traditions are still held, like their feast days which are open to the public and other events that are kept from outsiders. I believe that Hopi and Zuni are the more traditional of the Pueblo groups due to their historical and current isolation. <br>  This doesn't say much about family practices, but I'm sure that traditional- and modern are somewhat different depending on the family|`|AA11261867	Making grandma ride in the back of the truck!
urs7M4ITaa	Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you. At the age you are at sex dreams are normal. You may be having sexual feelings for someone but your mind and in your dreams you are associating them with a different person. It doesn't necessarily mean that you like your P.E teacher, it just means you are having sexual feelings for boys in general or maybe someone specific and in your dream that person was the teacher. It may just have been that you saw him that day or something really small like that. reams just mix things up sometimes. Don't worry about it. It is just that you're having sexual feelings....but not necessarily for him! Your dream just played it out like that. You get what I mean?|`|oil8ALh4aa	hormones|`|YhoUANPKaa	ok, that's just sick.  it's not your fault though, everybody has those kind of dreams sooner or later.  Those kind of dreams, for you, would only happen with boys, so it was probably just randomly your PE teacher.  it's nothing, don't worry.
c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	I'm really worried about you. You should see a psychologist fast.

19b3e9abf53eb6de6b79bd8971d0d072aa	Anyone can change if they choose to change.  The reason for the change in each case is as different as the people involved.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	People can change, but the proper conditions must be in place for that change to occur.  If someone continually faces the same set of circumstances and oppurtunities, it's reasonable to expect their behavior to remain more or less the same.  People change as a result of their lives changing, not the other way around.|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Education, experience, and knowledge, all sought on an ongoing basis.  The four events you list can be triggers to change, but the three I listed form the foundation needed to make changes acceptable to an individual's way of thinking.  Those who won't or can't seem to change are lacking in those three areas, either in the past or as their lives progress.  I have changed considerably as the result of all three, including some significant changes in my 60's.  A person can change their ways at any age, if their foundation is solid and they see the wisdom of the change.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Do I believe that people can change?  Of course I do, or what I do for a living would be a total waste of my time and efforts.  I think that each person is inspired by different things.  And some people aren't inspired by anything.  For me, getting tired of negative outcomes inspired me to make some significant changes in my own life....  I stopped drinking and using almost 24 years ago.  One of the most life-changing decisions I have ever made.|`|hEFthejvaa	people can change but only temporarily. no one can act a certain way forever, if so then he or she is simply pretending to someone they're not. you may feel like you're a new person, but deep down we'll always be the same people.|`|chfILbonaa	I have changed alot withint a year so much stuff has happened that i cant be myself anymore although my new self is alot nicer than my old self i am alot less motivated to succeed in school|`|PW8zXjdBaa	Yes.The honest desire to change, and understanding that change is natural and part of the process that shows us that there are more ways to be than we often can see.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the loss of your friend.

7obFZ2Gyaa	It's normal for Guys to cry  if they think  they are losing  a girl  or woman  they love .  Maybe your b/f is depressed because  he thinks  you  don't love him.  I get that way  especially if I am with a girl a long  time and  things start going  all wrong ,  I start thinking about the memories we had .   Your bf  could be the same way maybe  he thinks you two won't be together and that makes him sad.    I cried in my exgfs  car  one time  and she  kissed me  because  I  suspected her cheating with  another guy.  she said  she loved me and she wasn't  cheating on me.   <br>  Talk to your bf and ask him why he gets so emotional  when you  argue or when you talk.    Good Luck !!|`|AA10690306	It depends, A huge amount of guys were brought up with the belief that you "Never Let Them See You Cry" but a lot of the younger guys were not brought up to believe that.

My bf is super emotional, but only around me...He acts all tough around anyone else too! hah <br>  <br>  It can get a little stressful though! Like what you said when he calls you in the middle of the night and you thought he was fine before you went to sleep and he is upset. hah <br>  <br>  I think he is just showing you that he does care a lot about you. <br>  <br>  Hope it doesnt get to stressful for you!|`|hSOEgpPNaa	He might be under a lot of stress.

Maybe your bf is scared or realizes what big part of his life you are and just the thought of you guys breaking up or something kills him so. I think its normal to cry, every person has emotions, just that others are more open to others and others just really express them when they need to be expressed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =]|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Some guys are more sensitive than others.  He must really care about you.  He may also be depressed about somethings happening in his life lately that make him overly sensitive.  Ask him if everything is going ok with school/work/family, etc.  He may be scared that you may leave him b/c of his past relationships & he doesn't want to lose you.

He is afraid of losing you and every time you fight, it makes him sad. He may be having some psychological issues that become apparent when you have disputes. You had said that after you fight, he begins to eat alot. This could be that he may have an issue like ocd or such and is unable to cope with the stress and worrying of losing you. I would try and talk with him about this and tell him how you feel. It sounds like you both care for each other very much, so if you talk the situation over with him, it can be all put on the table and then he may not cry as much.|`|ROKG41ofaa	No, there is probably going through something in his life. I know what kind of guy you mean when you say "hard." I think you should bring it up lightly with him. Like "hey i've noticed you've been really emotional when we get into fights lately... is there something wrong?" If he says no I'm fine say are you sure just to make positive then drop it. It might also be that he is stressed or maybe really in love. If it begins to really bug you say something when he's crying your ear off. like "you've been crying like this over small things a lot lately and it's starting to make me feel uncomfortable." If he's emotionally unstable, everything that you say can put him on the edge so be careful! Good Luck|`|CARmP1zLaa	Hard on the outside often means insecure on the inside.<br>  This is something the major part of the human population has problems with in one way or another, it's feeling that you're good as you are and that people around you accept you.

There's a good Swedish book on the subject which helped me alot called "Sj?lvk?nsla nu" by Mia T?rnblom but I guess you don't know Swedish /=<br>  but I'm sure there are many help yourself books to read in your language aswell.

If you just want him sexually...then go with the flow.<br>  <br>  But if you want him to want you and see you as a LADY then, you need to set some stronger boundaries and send him a msg that shows you will not tolerate, such 'jokes'.  <br>  <br>  If he is a real man, then he should be able to impress you, with a much broader range of his personality.<br>  <br>  The way he is talking to you, is the way most men would talk to a ****.<br>  <br>  If you want him to treat you like a lady...then act like one|`|NnG5GBGAaa	He's 18...for him that could be his his way of saying "he thinks of you  sexually".<br>  Not necessarily, but possible.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	It depends on what you mean by "like".  It seems clear that he wants sex; it doesn't seem clear if he particularly likes you otherwise.  If you want someone to hop in bed with, by all means, invite him over (be sure to doublecheck if legal in your area: I think 18 usually is, but you don't want to get in trouble).<br>  <br>  If you want an actual relationship, though, if he's throwing such hot and heavy sexual hints at you without real signs of actual liking and attraction beyond the physical, then it's not very likely that you'll develop much of anything beyond sex; and pretty likely that once the early thrill is gone, he'll be gone too.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	In this particular case I think the guy is immature.

tKFO3u60aa	hun, you are NOT the problem. your family is. any family who does not get you the medical help you require is at fault. i think you're going to have to do it for yourself. reach out, to hospitals, suicide hot lines, etc. do not blame yourself. it's really no one's fault, and you're not at a point where you should be making any tough judgments or decisions. suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. life gets better. death can't. plus, you are one of the few people on here who actually has good grammar and spelling! I'm serious. we need more people with your talents. Don't put yourself down, because there are a million and more great things about you, you just might not know it yet. call up a therapist, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, your local kids' hospital. don't feel alone. there are people like you, whom you will like and who will like you. please, don't give up on life. good luck<3|`|angW1Lkfaa	I  thought I was nuts then figured out the rest of the world is super crazy.

If they wont get you the help you need, and even YOU are aware that you need it, then you need to demand that they help get the professional counseling that you need. Attempting suicide is serious, and you need to realize people that kill themselves are selfish, and it hurts your family SO much more than you realize that the moment.

There's nothing in the world that is worth taking your own life, because if there was, God wouldn't allow it to exist. There will always be another way. I've thought too, but you can't. If you dont do it, i promise, someday, somehow, things will get better. I've been there before. Your family is wrong, i dont know how old you are but there are services to get you help, and if its bad enough take you away from them. Theres always light, email me if you need to talk<br>  Nthay0603@yahoo.com|`|P3HbFSn7aa	Hey! Ignore the comment telling you to go through with it! I don't think I'll be able to understand what you're going through but it doesn't mean you should kill yourself!<br>     How old are you? Are you still in school, if so go tell your school counselor or your favorite teacher and get the help you need. "they won't get me the help I know I need" don't let them control you, you can get help, better help than you're going to find on Yahoo Answers, personal, individual, confidential help because believe it or not but it's your life, don't let someone else make you feel worthless.<br>      Lots of people go through that treatment, the blame being placed on you, and I bet they're probably thinking of killing themselves like you, my advice to them would be to get help. You're smart, you open by telling us you know you need help, that means your a step closer to being free of those thoughts and becoming happy in your self.<br>     This might seem very preachy but recent.y my sister overdosed and had to go to hospital, we don't know whether it was on purpose or not but I know that is she killed herself a lot of people she doesn't even know exist will grieve for a long time, the case will be the same for you! Please get help! For me to know that you have gotten help will make me have some hope!|`|Sz8Wg1fHaa	you don't need your parents to seek help now. go to your school's counselor. everything you tell them is confidential unless you are actually harming yourself...then they will report it. otherwise everything is kept private. im a high school student and i have thoughts of suicide too... so my teacher sent me to this counselor. this counselor is not the academic one okay? so just ask around about it. and you dont want to truely kill yourself. so don't listen to people who are negative. you are strong. you can surpass this. u can do it.|`|F4ptJH67aa	As far as the suicide thoughts go, please DON'T attempt them. It's not worth it to end your life because of some mere issues. Most problems around the house can be mediated. You say they don't get you the help you need, well if thats the case then you must make it a must do priority on your list of things-to-do. If you want the help, there are people waiting to help you. Things get thrown at you constantly and the main ingredient is to learn to let them go. I know they may seem devastating at the moment, but things pass and its a part of life that we must learn to adapt to. Don't expect the worst because then you make the worst of it. Also, don't expect change over night; Rome wasn't built in a day. There are truely no reasons to act on it. You get one life and if you live it right, once is enough. Talk to someone weather its your parents, your grandparents, your friend, your dog, your cat, household pet, something or someone! Let your feelings out, also, by writing them down on a piece of paper. Like I said before, its definately not worth it to act on your thoughts so negative as the ones you say.

Like i'm gonna read all that bullsh*t.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I largely agree with you.  Excepting for one thing - it is women who bear children.  So it can never be equal.  There are far more fathers who walk away from their children than mothers.  It's a fact.  <br>  Men seem to think that women benefit in a divorce - and yes, she does benefit from the children.  Her life is also much harder because of it.  She has to work and look after her children.  And the cost can be very high.<br>  Abortions?  How would you do that?  It all sounds very well, but the reality is very different.  I have a friend who at the grand age of 38 suddenly found herself pregnant.  She'd thought she was infertile.  Her partner begged her to have an abortion - but here was her only chance of having a baby.  She took it - if she'd listened to his demands, she'd be childless today.  As it was, he took no part in the upbringing of his son nor did he contribute financially. <br>  So should we listen to men who tell us what to do when all our instincts tell us otherwise?  In my experience, there'd be a lot less children around - I haven't come across a single father who begged his girlfriend to keep the baby rather than abort it.  Rather it's the other way around.<br>  I don't like affirmative action.<br>  Yes, to equal sentences.<br>  Yes, to equal requirements.<br>  Less fund-raising for single-gender issues?  What about prostrate cancer?  Breast cancer?  What about fertility issues?  Heart disease is mainly male orientated.  Urology - again, mainly male.<br>  Should we ignore these issues simply because it's not politically correct?  What about rape centres?  Domestic violence centres?<br>  And I know that people will say that men are raped and abused, and yes, it is true.  But the majority of victims are women.<br>  I don't think we can ever have an "equal" world where we all are on the same playing field.  It would be nice though, if we were all treated as equals in respect and value.|`|ZqjGWbavaa	I'm for equality too. The problem is most people choose to live unequal lives. For all the women who take advantage of the perks and preferences granted with them, just as many men, if not more, continue to treat women as if they were privileged and to enforce this behavior on others.<br>  <br>  If you want to effect a change, you have to be the answer you seek, first.<br>  <br>  Emily: FYI, but more women are affected by heart disease than men. It's just that, prior to menopause, it's much more common among men. However, heart disease is a larger threat to women than breast cancer.|`|EWUy2YFIaa	I can agree with a lot of what you said.  Except for abortion.  When the man has an equal responsibility when it comes to sharing the physical, mental, emotional and financial repercussions of going through a pregnancy, then he can have an equal say.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	Hey, I 100% agree with you. Especially about the divorce proceedings. Things like alimony/child support and custody really need to be looked at on a case by case basis.|`|66tTuuIFaa	I want a society where everyone stops bitching about every little inconvenience they experience.<br>  <br>  Really we've all become a bunch of babies.|`|FUIBscKGaa	I can tell you are not schooled in Feminist Theory.  You would know that the ultimate goal of feminism is equal political rule if you did.  That's why we go after the laws that we do.  We will be equal only when we share 50% of political power, all over the world.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just lead everybody to one of your mens rights activists sites where they can find the phony stats to support your claims?  Oh yeah, that's right.  Mens rights activist sites are full of explicit language, and how you guys want to take the vote away from woman, and force them back into submission.  Referring somebody to them would blow your cover.  And don't lie and say you aren't one when you post the same things verbatim that they say, with an identical list of complaints.  That reminds me.  Which of these brand new girl avatars hating on women is your sockpuppet?<br>  <br>  I'm providing a link to a page that puts your complaints in perspective.  Since you want everyone to form their opinion based only on your rant, there's need for some balancing.  The explanation to your issues are there.  Read 'em and weep.<br>  <br>  Your lies are what's offensive.  You say 75% of women get custody, conveniently leaving out the fact that men rarely even want it.  The vast majority of divorces are amicable, and it's been proven that the more abusive a man, the more likely he is to file.  It's all in my link.<br>  <br>  Riddle me this.  Why do you guys not counter my claims that you are violent promoters of rape and abuse?  I'll go start a question on that right now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thelizlibrary.org/site-index/site-index-frame.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelizlibrary.org/site-index/...</a>
ohUm00RYaa	Basically it was about stealing.  The justifications are numerous everything from the great white father-noble savage complex to because we can.  Realize the justifcations are just that justifications for act of crimes against humanity.  What Britain did in Africa or france in asian or spain in americas are no different than what hitler did in europe.  the reason why hitler is bashed is because he broke the unspoken rule, never colonize a white country.  Even when the british fought the americans they did not use any of the cruel tactics they used against non-white to them.<br>  <br>  All the justifcations are based on dehumanizing the people in these countries.  so it was ok to colonize asia because they were morally backwards or africa because they were not really people(monkeys), or natives because they were savages.  They are all based on a common theme of dehumanizination.  To hitler jews were rats or vermin so its was ok to kill them, its never ok to kill people but its ok to kill rats or monkeys or savages or gooks.  Lets face it, white people lived in a time when they had the power to rape, murder, kill, steal, pillage, from anyone they wanted to, there is a reason that the British sailed all the way to Singapore to colonize rather than to sail across the chunnel to colonize France or Germany.  RACISM.<br>  <br>  Sarah is a joker.  The Europeans started the wars in africa by giving guns to to 2 groups so that they could get slaves.  Its like giving guns to britain and Germany  in 1907 and telling them to capture lots of POWs and then telling britain and germany behind each others back that you will pay them for POWs.  does Britain REALLY WANT Nazi p.o.w.s who cost money to feed?  As for the slave trade, well the slave trade largely was over but was a mostly European thing.  Ever heard of the scramble for Africa.  A 20 year period were 70% of africa was colonized.<br>  <br>  Yup chopping of children's arms for rubber, that is civilizing the savages Africans alright<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org</a><br>  /wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium#Leopold_an...|`|21jfHyi5aa	I can't speak for India and China, but for Africa, there were a number of justifications held by the Europeans for such practices. <br>  <br>  Supporters of colonialism argued that colonialism brought the end of slavery in eastern and central Africa and that the Africans should be grateful. Some Europeans also argued that they brought peace to the area between African nations.  It is true that colonialism did bring some peace to the inter-warring African nations, but for the most part, the two acts were still unbalanced. <br>  <br>  Supporters of colonialism also argued that they were civilizing the barbarians. The belief was that they were doing good to the poor, helpless savages by giving them order, religion, "stability," and education.|`|x9T5VPudaa	"They are savages and don't know what they are doing.

urs7M4ITaa	Dreams where you are in a car or driving usually sympolise your path in life and how you are taking it. In this case it suggests that you are beginning to make your own way in life. Your panic suggests that you are scared or anxious about this which is normal. The fact that you have no idea where you are going simply is showing you that in life you don't really know where you are going or where you are headed.  (also normal) You may also be worried about where your life is going or may just be thinking about it a lot at this present moment. You may be able to make a better understanding of this.

hcjFLjMUaa	The War in Darfur is a conflict that is in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Unlike the Second Sudanese Civil War, the current lines of conflict are seen by some reporters (such as those with USA Today and Slate magazine) to be ethnic and tribal, rather than religious.[6] However, a United Nations report[7] states that the various tribes under attack (chiefly the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa tribes) do not appear to have a distinct ethnicity from their attackers. <br>  Its a war on pride one race against the other, and its still taking place because its the govt plotting all of the genocides.|`|Y95TGph4aa	They occur because the groups with enough power to stop them choose not to, like the US gov.

YzoLa5Uuaa	The previous two answers are regarding memory for senses, not sensory memory in my understanding.<br>  <br>  Sensory memory refers to the sensory store. The sensory store is thought to exist for less than 2 seconds and is responsible for us being able to look at something, shut our eyes and see it very clearly for about a second before it fades. It is very different than working (improperly called short-term memory) memory which lasts 15-30 seconds. <br>  <br>  Sensory memory is important because all information that we reach is first gathered in our sensory store and then transferred into other types of memory. If we do not transfer it, it is lost almost immediately. This is a very clear importance of it-- without it nothing would be perceived. <br>  <br>  If this is unclear let me know and I will elucidate my process. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	It's not hypothesized, hon.  It exists.  Not sure what the importance of it is, but you have it.  Visual and auditory sensory memories may not have any obvious significant place in the human experience.  However, olfactory (smell) sensory memory is very strong in humans.  Smells often have a powerful emotional impact on us, in that smell is often associated with experiences that are associated with certain emotions.  I can still remember how my grandparents' house used to smell when we would go there to visit once a year duering my childhood.  It was wonderful and brought up all kinds of warm, fuzzy emotions!|`|uSZCKKqnaa	Sensory memory has a huge survival importance...<br>  We remember smells...like fire...<br>  We remember feeling a burn, like from touching a stove....<br>  We remember bitter or sour tastes...like from bad milk...etc...<br>  These memories teach us not to do it again, or invoke the flight or fight response in us if a memory is triggered.
3p6wp7DYaa	No, you're not right. A change in price will never shift the entire demand curve in any direction. The only reason why quantity demanded increases when prices fall is that the lower prices in fact increase the real income of buyers, enabling theme to buy more. It also has to do with the fact that the good is a normal good, and elasticity, of course, but within the confines of the answer choices given, you should go with D.
0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	It's difficult to interpret another person's dream without knowing them and their background intimately.  In addition, one-off dreams rarely tell you much.  Dreams to pay attention to are the ones with recurrent themes, because you're in the process of working out an internal struggle.  Either way, it's something you should talk yourself through.  Keep a dream journal, or sit down and write about the dream especially if you found it memorable for whatever reason.  A mini-recorder is good for that.  Do they still sell the ones that use the little tape cassettes for $30?  If you drive and turn the radio off, a lot of things come to mind.  That's when the recorder comes in handy.|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	maybe on some subconscious level you want to believe in god or a god.  maybe your looking for answers that pop culture and science can not provide.  maybe you ate something weird before going to bed.  maybe your lonely.
E2VUH8Q0aa	I have to agree with Eeyore up there. <br>  <br>  Here's my personal list:<br>  <br>  -People have learned the ability to lie to your face without remorse. Therefore only a few can be trusted.<br>  <br>  -Most people care less for others than they do themselves. <br>  <br>  -People will do remarkable things, to themselves and to others, in the attempt to boost their own opinion of themselves. They often do this with no regard of how they are hurting other people.<br>  <br>  -All people were not raised with the same values. You may value integrity, courage, intelligence, etc. I can assure you that some have a much different list...money, their pride, their ego, their prestige....So it becomes very important to find someone who values what you do to trust.<br>  <br>  I hear people say that we shouldn't be afraid to trust people, and that we have to be brave and open our hearts to people. I say, why? What do I gain by allowing just anyone into my heart? I say, if they truly deserve to be there, they will earn it.|`|ZXzCGJdbaa	People are out for themselves.

Don't try to squash it down - you need to feel it if you want to heal, and I'm sure your father would want that for you. Be as kind to yourself as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  If you let yourself have your grief, the the feeling of pain and loss will eventually get better over time. Although you'll never stop missing him. <br>  <br>  As time goes on, and you're able to accept it a little more, I hope you'll be able to connect with your gratitude for having such a wonderful father.

HEAVEN!!! so don't feel sorry for them, because they're "livin it up" and truly enjoying they're life after death. you will miss them until you see them again, but the good thing is YOU'LL SEE THEM AGAIN!!! God just needs us on this earth a little longer because he has something planned for us and he's not ready for  us to be in heaven yet.
wnb0EgaHaa	The advise I would give is this...<br>  <br>  If Mike has lied that many times, Kim is probably not paranoid.  She's just realized that she can't trust him, and instead of leaving herself open to betrayal again, she has developed a healthy skepticism to replace the blind trust.<br>  <br>  This is sensible and a matter of self-preservation on her part.<br>  <br>  If Mike has lied that often, but really wants to make things right, and has the capability to be honest and truthful, then he will accept responsibility for his actions, and be accountable for changing his ways and showing her through ACTIONS that he has changed.  Talk is cheap.  Anybody can say anything.  Actions tell the truth.<br>  <br>  If he is true to the character he has demonstrated so far (being a liar) - then he will never own up to his actions, but will twist and turn things to manipulate Kim into feeling like she is the one wrong and being unfair.  It's a classic manipulative technique.<br>  <br>  Kim is nowhere near as destroyed as she will be if she continues to subject herself to a relationship with a compulsive liar whom she cannot trust.  She needs to continue on the path she started.  Hold him accountable, and make him prove he is worthy of being in her life.<br>  <br>  If he's not willing to do what it takes, she's better off without him in the long run.  Someone who is willing to treat her with respect and be honest will come along.  Mike will probably continue to lie and pull the same crap over and over again, leaving more wreckage and broken hearts along the way.|`|AA11739944	If "kim"  "cant bring herself to trust Mike!" then "kim" doesn't need to be with him.

Act like a mystery.<br>  <br>  Ask him what he wants and comply but also to a way that you would like it.<br>  <br>  Analyze his whole being-- see what type of person he is and try to rapport him without knowing.<br>  <br>  You must make him feel he is worshiped but you really don't. You must make him feel like the king while you chuckle away holding him on your tiny finger.<br>  <br>  Most guys like feminine girls-- have you been letting yourself go lately? NEVER do that. You have to play mistress AND wife. You have to femme fatale like Cleopatra. Never show weakness as people might take advantage of it even unknowingly. No complaining. Persuade well... example:<br>  <br>  "You know Mike it's amazing how you can deal with so many people... they must like your charm and ways"<br>  <br>  Learn how to speak the "right way" Think before you speak.<br>  Think if it hurts the other person's feelings or ego. Remember if you want something better-- your going to have to sacrifice, even if it means trampling your own thoughts.<br>  <br>  Basically it is also like friendships-- People like to be with-- of what feels good. Feeling good is what is all down to. If you guys fight-- it doesn't feel good. And people also want people of value-- entertainment, money, humor, beauty, whatever satisfy their weird egos. That is why you must analyze the person first.<br>  <br>  If they become jealous, you also trapped them in your spell.<br>  <br>  Look at what he watches on T.V, his books, his choice of movies. What makes his eye go big? What stirs up emotion?<br>  <br>  Sometime people spill their emotions out. People spill what they like in a person. Be a shapeshifter-- also being a shapeshifter is fun. =D The information is right in front of you. I say seize the opportunity. <br>  <br>  Repetition, body language, and art of conversation-- read that and try to learn about it through books. Human interaction is also an art form.<br>  <br>  If you want the evil way, if it involves a girl he is trying to cheat with. I say if she is being sneaky and trying to steal other men, be sneaky as well-- spread rumors about the girl. Somehow it will circulate and he will hear about it and lose respect for her. But you must be a good rumormonger.<br>  <br>  If you have to flirt with other guys to stir up jealous emotions.

It is human nature, when you mad, or broken heart, you not able to take control of yourself very well. When this love go away, it only the begin to new love, and I always think so.

Good luck and think of positive side.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	cannot do this.|`|AA10510845	My brain is telling me this is more autobiographical than it is hypothetical.  You can't make anyone fall in love with someone if the feeling is not there, nor can you always revitalize a failing romance. I would say that this "hypothetical" couple is not really compatible, and it's mostly Mike's fault for being a liar that Kim cannot trust.  And Mike realizes it, so he takes off.  What Kim might do is start dating other guys to try and make Mike jealous.  Maybe he will come back, and maybe not.  But I've seen that work in some instances.  He will get a taste of what it's like to be untrustworthy, and could shape up, but don't bank on it.  Some leopards never change their spots.
rG5VxxNKaa	You are correct to a certain extent.  However, I don't believe he is a dictator as we have checks and balances in our government to avoid that (Supreme Court and Congress).   He is trying to fix the economy and he was left with a mess from G. Bush.  Other countries are also going through hard times as well.  His (Obama's) current policy will not be that effective in fixing the problem.  You have to probably nationalize the major banks or create a bank for toxic assets.  Next, he should cut taxes for both individuals and corporations.  Lastly, he should stop all capital gain taxes.|`|KIL9HrRhaa	It depends on where you go... Some countries think it's Gods wrath, most are scared, not for our well being, but they just hope we don't collapse because they know the impact that would have globally. Generally, we're still viewed as spoiled-rotten children who live in a glass bubble, buy things with play money and waste more per capita than any other nation on the planet. So are you really suprised?<br>  <br>  About your other questions... Your comments mean you lean towards the GOP perspective which is, given enough time the problems will work themselves out...<br>  <br>  Putting aside for a moment if Obama's actions thus far are benefiting us or hurting us we certainly are in an economic crisis. It's a compounded problem that fairly easy to identify... Unemployment is approaching the highs of the early 80's (currently around 8%, was 10% in the 80's, reached 25% in the great depression..if you've been following numbers the US is hemorrhaging jobs, we can expect a lot more loss stimulus or no stimulus). Auto Industry... Two of the Three US auto makers have failed and it's big-government keeping them on life support at this point. Why did they fail, because of the deregulation, unions, lack of checks and balances tied to corporate greed, lot's of reasons, many of which can be tied directly to a free market system served up Republican style for the past eight years. In that free market system the big auto makers failed, but since letting them fail would have such a sever impact on the economy, Republicans and Dems united to agree on bailing them out... At that point Captialism as we've come to know it failed. Was that a Socialist thing to do? You bet... but in the a true free market system they would fail and tank our economy.... So look at the banking, investment sector.... Republicans have deregulated and moved further away from intervention and what happens? Well Captialism happens. Corporations are bound by law to uphold the interest of their share holders over the common good, that's non disputable... that's what they have evolved into. If you read Joel Bakan's book The Corporation you discover some very unsettling truths that business in America today and you'll have a better understanding of how all of this happened. The GOP is not without blame, but not entirely at falt.. their fault is preaching the message "Captialism good, Socialism bad" without paying any mind to the real causes behind these problems... which unfortunately for them are tied to decades deregulation in the name of free-market Capitalism. So the banking/financal sector is sick also, because a bunch of greedy peope were doing what they had to do in a deregulated free market system, they were looking out for themselves and their company at and finding every possibly legal loop hole to cheat the system at the gain of themselves and their employer (Capitalism rewards this unfortunately.... What worked thirty years ago doesn't when you mount greed and subtract all morality, which realistically you must do). The GOP idea is that all these problems will work themselves out because Capitalism is good and that people are inherently good, moral, law-abiding citizens and the government should stay completely out of their way and let them run businesses as they see fit... In spite of what right-wing talk show host and authors may tell you, just because you want more regulation and more checks and balances in the US Capitalist system doesn't mean you are a Socialist...  and their approach to small-government is responsible for the mess we are in again, this is why they downplay the problem because if real (which it is) it shakes the foundation of everything they believe politically.<br>  <br>  The problem is as the GOP has gotten their wish and big-government has gotten further and further out of the way, people have found more and more ways to cheat/work the system with no concious at all to the damage they are bringing upon individuals and the economy,<br>  <br>  While the Democratic party may not have all the answers and the new stimulus isn't the end-all-be-all plan, at least the Dems are moving us in the right direction and that is away from the free market system that is currently corrupted and sick and is destroying this country. Doing nothing is NOT the answer. The credit markets are still frozen, the auto makers still in trouble, the stock market continues to plunge.... Left to a free market system at this condition (which again, not even all the Republicans want as they approved bail out money) the US would collapse. That's a reality every conservative must deal with, but they aren't instead about half of them are in denial and continue to spew rhetoric<br>  <br>  You can expect more bail out money with strings, you can expect at least partial Nationalization of the banks (must happen because in spite of getting bail out money the dirty snots won't lend and continue to keep the credit market frozen... again you free market system has failed) you can expect to see more government jobs and more taxing of the upper class....  Call it Socialism if you must, I think it's a nice alternative to pushing around a wheelbarrow full of devalued US dollars to grocery store for a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  When the Dems left the White House, Bill Clinton had managed to balance the budget... Eight years in the White House and the GOP (notice I'm not blaming just the former Prez) pushed us all over the cliff and we're hanging on for dear life... and they are continuing to tell us the problem isn't that bad...... I still believe in Capitalism and I believe Obama does as well. If you think he's a Socialist consider this: just last week he stated again he's against the Fairness Doctrine (a law that if reenacted would require conservative talk show host to give balanced time to both perspectives). Of course you won't hear about this from right-wing media because it makes liars out of all of them who have been claiming Obama would do this six months before he was elected. I would suggest stop listening to right-wing media... I'm sure Obama isn't doing everything perfect, but considering where the last President left us, even at his worst he's going to shine pretty bright.
YfIm4IqSaa	Joe sounds like a dirty old man. Or a very blue collar man, most likely in a working class suburb.  Joey sounds fun, laid back, sweet, possibly someone who's bullied on easily. <br>  <br>  I'm thinking of Joey from that really old show Full House. Of course I'm just saying what the names sound like not that they mean anything really.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	I always felt that names that end in Y, ie, or ee sound diminutive.<br>  <br>  Charles sounds like a Prince, but Charlie sounds like a cartoon.<br>  Joe sounds like a grown up, Joey sounds like a sitcome character.<br>  <br>  Unless you are a pretty impossing fella, like 6'4" + and built like a brick wall, then Joey is ironic, like a huge guy named Tiny.|`|iG6SkgB5aa	My Dad's name is Joseph, and everybody called him Joey. When he started working at Classic BMW, they didn't like that name, because it wasn't professional, so now everybody calls him Joe. So I guess Joey is more fun and Joe is more professional
bGsXsDhBaa	Having had a couple of Bloody Marys I am ill-advisedly going to answer this question and may regret it.<br>  <br>  Thank the Lord for the delete button.<br>  <br>  I became literally obsessed with the most gorgeous man last year so much so that I had to get  in depth analysis from a lesbian therapist.<br>  <br>  We were friends for six months and then one day I came home after having coffee with him and literally stopped in my tracks and realised:<br>  <br>  "Oh My God. I am completely in love with Blaze!"<br>  <br>  My friend told me to go to his apartment and serenade him with a violin and in my idiocy I did ...  at 4am after a drunken night out.<br>  <br>  Typical Cyrano de Bergerac style:  It was perfect:  Moonlit San Francisco night and I crawled over a fence and his apartment was five floors up. My violin playing is awful and it probably sounded like cats screeching but I was trying to be romantic.<br>  <br>  I see your point. <br>  <br>  It was once considered romantic to do this but according to Blaze, his neighbors, his boyfriend and the San Francisco police - it is in fact considered not only potential stalking but a breach of the peace.<br>  <br>  Oh well ...  one lives and learns.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *sheepish grin*|`|srIMFTb8aa	When this has happened to me, I have found it uncomfortable.  Not exactly creepy, but I really don't like having that much attention focused on me.|`|G50ucmllaa	Flattered and impressed.|`|fJy0vN7daa	I'd be flattered that he did that.<br>  and<br>  impressed that he had the courage to do it. <br>  <br>  =3|`|ZYp1AEspaa	This has happened to me a few times. I thought it was very sweet though they all seemed to go for very long songs and it's hard to keep the adoring look plastered on for 37 verses. <br>  <br>  It's extremely flattering, of course. It's also impressive if they have a great voice, and creepy only if they hold you hostage while doing it.|`|xvxT46iJaa	It would depend on the song he chose to serenade me with, if it was something like Creep by Radiohead, or Every breath you take by the Police, I would probably be a bit creeped out!|`|i8OezhEYaa	if he has a nice singing voice i'd be impressed and flattered. there's nothing sexier to me than a male singing voice. he'd earn extra points for that.|`|4JFtk1xqaa	I have been flattered and impressed every time   it has happened to me in my life . My husband sings to me often now and I love it! :)|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I think I would be more embarrased than anything else. Likewise, I am not easily flattered or impressed.|`|iopyAQthaa	Lucky girl Erin haha.. It's only happened to me once before and I was flattered but then it was getting a bit too long and I couldn't help but yawn.|`|WQ2FKRF8aa	It would depend how long I've been interested. It might be a tad creepy if it were too soon.|`|M5eI0UAqaa	lol. i'd giggle like a little school girl AND most probably faint xD<br>  I'd love it.|`|AA11307468	This has happened on many different occasions in many different ways.  I am flattered every time.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	If I was interested in him, I'd laugh, tell him to shut up, then kiss him. If I wasn't, I'd throw things at him.
OUbNSXjJaa	Initially I trust everybody. One they prove to be on the other side, I keep away from such people. You can consult your counselor.|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	I feel exactly the same way (except I'm still in high school).<br>  <br>  I've been like this since... around gr. 7-ish. Like, whenever I talk to people they always seem to be in a hurry to go somewhere else, or they just don't acknowledge that I said anything. Usually I assume it's just because they aren't really interested in getting to know me - actually, I think I come off as really annoying to other people. They never tell me to go away per se; I make sure they don't have to, because I take a hint and leave them alone before they straight-up reject me.<br>  <br>  When girls talk about <my name>, they probably don't talk about somebody who they think is hot or sweet or cute or smart or anything - they probably talk about this kid who... well, let's put it this way: they think I'm part dork, part creep, part class clown, and part pathetic guy who you can't help but feel sorry for because you know he'll never get a girl and probably doesn't have very many friends.<br>  <br>  I never trust anybody with any of my secrets unless they have proven themselves trustworthy to that level, which for me, would take a very long time to happen. I'm not a fool - I can tell the difference between superficiality and true friendship. And even then, there are some things I wouldn't share even with my closest friends - and others I wouldn't share even with my parents! I don't feel a single person on the planet is worth full, undying faith, because I think that's how people wind up dissappointed and hurt.<br>  <br>  So if that's how you honestly feel, then yeah, you're not alone. It's probably a result of reflecting on all the times you trusted somebody and they've let you down. I know how that feels. I see a psychologist every now and then when I feel like I need to talk to somebody. It's not a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Don't feel like this is a really bad thing. Think of it this way, you've become less gullible and are starting to take things with a grain of salt. You're not going to be used so easily by others who think they can make fun of you and treat you like you have less of a clue than they do. Just remember, though, that not everybody is in it to make your day worse - there are decent people in this world. Give somebody a chance, and if they appear trustworthy at that point, give then a little bit of trust, and let it build from there. There's nothing more valuable in this world than a true friend.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	That good stay away from those that would cause you to do things that you would never think to do. It is better to be with less people that to be with many it is the same with me I choose wisely who I will be with or what I will do. For life has change much these days even for me. life is what you make out of it Joy or sadness.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Well definitely not the media, that's for sure.|`|o0U2K84oaa	We are on our own. Even the one closest to us will betray us for themselves one day. Enjoy the moments you have.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	It would not hurt to see someone, help you get that issue worked out while getting you to face a few others I can guess at. Basicly your fine the way you are. Not trusting someone with intimite details of your life is different than not trusting anyone, not seeing anyone because of fear. Get your self out and make a few friends but do not give them the keys to your car or your house nor lend them your credit cards, laugh. Good friends take time to become good friends and even then can let you down, you have to be self sufficent and responsible for yourself at all times while being a friend when you can, not 24 - 7 care of someone else's life just yours.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	Yes you can talk with the school counselor.|`|BQsPZZfYaa	Yup.

If they were stronger than us than we would be in the same predicament that they are now.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	I am sure that if animals could think in abstract terms, they would believe that their lives were more important than ours.

If we think we can treat other animals any way we want (because we are stronger or smarter) then we have lost our empathy.  This is why society has laws that forbid cruel abuse of animals.<br>  <br>  Human life is more important than animal life because: I am a human.  I value me and creatures like me more than other animals.  Most people are similar.

All reasonable people know that this is true, which is why all civilised societies value human life above any other life.<br>  It is because God created mankind in his own image.

It is very unfortunate that cruel people are out there, and do so much harm to animals.  It's understandable that we eat them, they are natural food source for us, but we should have the decency to raise them in a clean environment where they have room to move around, be outside, and when the time comes kill them quickly and humanely.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you will be one of the few people out there that tries to avoid eating meat from slaughter houses where animals are treated poorly, maybe find a local butcher who slaughters animals that have been raised on farms.  <br>  <br>  And hopefully, you will be able to respect all animals, not just the kind we eat, but all animals you come in contact with, and try your best to make their quality of life the best it can be. People have the ability to make things better for animals, but not many people are interested in doing anything for them or their fellow man for that matter.<br>  <br>  And in response to the post about the bible.  God did give us animals to eat - but He also expects us to respect them, show compassion, and not abuse the gift He gave us.

These are all kind of balances for your whole body, emotion and spirit. Try to figure out the lessons which you are able to carry out goodness for any other beings. I think it this way!!
ZvWt2qEQaa	You still love him but he has second thought about you.|`|fETbCVXbaa	Your boyfriend might be having second thoughts about you and your relationship. You feel like you don't know where your life is headed and might feel like your just trapped inside one big mess. You might feel small against the world adn like you need your boyfriend there. When you need to see how things really are.|`|874EAxkfaa	i would say your eye was probably wandering,you are guilty! in dream you get punished by bf.
OZ0DgzrJaa	Not really.  Skills are automatically unlocked at each level.  (Exception: Epic skills, which must be purchased from trainers.)  Every time you gain a level, the skill cap on ALL of your skills goes up by one.  <br>  <br>  Learning the skills is automatic, as soon as you are high enough level to qualify the skill is yours to use.  If you want to improve the skill however, you will have to spend TP on it.  You gain TP every level, and can spend them on any skill you have available to you.  You can raise a skill one level at a time or several at once, to the current skill cap.  <br>  <br>  Your character can have two classes.  You can only BE one of the classes at a time, but certain skills from your other class are available to your current one.  The TP pools are separate for each class, it is like you have two separate characters that happen to share inventory.  I THINK that joint skills leveled in one class carry over to the other class as well.  Please note you have to earn the skill in one class, before the other class can use it.  The secondary class must also be high enough level to qualify for the skill before they can use it.<br>  <br>  Example:  A level 16 Rouge gets Duel Wield, a joint skill.  If your secondary class is a Knight when they hit level 16 they will gain access to Duel Wield as well.  However, if your rouge level is only 15, then it doesn't matter if the Knight is level 30, until the rouge has learned Duel Wield, the Knight cannot use it.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	Video games is the place to post this. It's a game not anthropology
re1ufu46aa	Hahaha- totally normal. Probably just wish fulfillment! Are you getting quite close with you're boyfriend? Vivid sex dreams are extremely common in these circumstances. Could you feel everything? If you could, it's a lucid dream. :)|`|urs7M4ITaa	Totallly normal....maybe it is your subconscious telling that you are just ready to have sex...|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Yeah that's normal :)  I have had a couple dreams before that made me really excited when I woke up the next morning haha.  I thought about them for a couple days too - very vivid and fun.
2hAuIg5baa	through body language, art, dreams, and also your eyes tell allot about a person|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	That's a hard one.  Basically if you can't express your needs isn't that why you get depressed and get physically abusive.  You have a few alternatives.  Work on it on your own, which is obviously not something that is easy to do, or things to over come. From my point of view I think that when you get over loaded it's the time to talk to someone.  If you are lucky enough to have a best friend who is understanding and insightful this may help somewhat.  But, in reality the real answer is you should go to a therapist.  Going to a therapist is not a bad word, it is sometimes the only way out.  Don't listen to other people who put down therapy, there is no stigma attached to it, it can <br>  get you past your problems and you will lead a more productive life without these problems|`|b43c053e3ac43caf8628f3280701c547aa	when you think of the topic in mind quickly write it down-- that way it will never go away.<br>  <br>  when you think of an idea that spare moment might never come again<br>  <br>  write things down.<br>  <br>  also categorize them example:<br>  <br>  my future goals<br>  <br>  my current goals<br>  <br>  what bothers me in the past that I can fix<br>  <br>  money<br>  <br>  finances<br>  <br>  self image<br>  <br>  humanity<br>  <br>  what I really want|`|a0e860622cad16b1ca5481f614822134aa	body language|`|gyNadSFpaa	u do whatever u can to obtain it! even if it kills u....
5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Look at those 100's of posts you're getting from the radical, angry  feminists who are looking for love..either there aren't many radical, angry feminists (omg, we all know there are legions of them, don't we?) or they are not looking for love (ah, sweet solitude?) or how can it be-they already are in a loving relationship with a man. <br>  <br>  I have no idea if I'm radical or not since some days you're a radical feminist in this forum if you say you think women are equal to men, and I usually only get angry after I read a couple of incredibly stupid questions here or have to deal with an incredibly stupid government manager, but believe it or not, I was just myself and had guys falling for me like crazy when I was looking. Shocking but true. I'm not a het but I'm bi, so it's close, lol. But I don't hate men, but I can try, just for you?|`|wkjncmHTaa	Why, do you need some tips?<br>  <br>  Compliment them, tease them, talk about my fantasies, give them lots of affection ... and the rest you'll just have to imagine. Seems to be working so far :-)|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sorry...since i lack the "radical" part of that label, I can't answer you.<br>  <br>  But you might ask my husband.<br>  He knew I was a feminist when we first met in 1981---and it didn't stop him from wanting to marry me. We have a child who is now close to 18, and have been married for more than 21 years.<br>  <br>  And i am still a feminist, after having been a part time working, stay at home mom.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Wait....if they hate men, (as you state they do) why would they be interested in falling in love with one?<br>  <br>  Your question contradicts itself.
0NcRUSCoaa	Yes, I would look past the lie.  The best friend is being really petty, especially when your sister has apologised.  I think she may be better off without this friend. With friends like this, who needs enemies!|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	yes i would look past the lie. i would be understanding and not mad, what kind of a friend does that|`|tM8kCtuGaa	yes... the bff is really over reacting!! true friends dnt do that...esp if your sis really needed her and if she was pregnant she would have needed her bff to be there not be stubborn!! she apologized and there is nothing else she can do about the sitch but let her bff calm down and come to her senses if she dnt...life goes on!
AuI8A8JMaa	I'm a bad man.|`|K4zsztkRaa	No I don't. I think people have a different personality online then they do in real life. It doesn't change, it starts out different.<br>  <br>  I talk to my online friends differently than my real life friends.<br>  <br>  It's hard to let your real and total personality come out online.<br>  For the most part I guess I'm the same person, but there are some differences.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Connor|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Not necessarily. Some people (like, well, me) don't bother changing who they are and what they think when they go online.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Some do, some don't.  <br>  <br>  We all have multi-faceted personalities, and some are comfortable and confident enough in themselves, and have enough of an independent personality type that their online persona and real life persona is pretty much one and the same.<br>  <br>  Others may be timid and shy in real life, afraid to stand up to anyone or speak their minds, but behind a cyber wall become aggressive and even abusive.<br>  <br>  It's just like the real world...you have pretenders and fakes, and you have those who are sincere and truthful.<br>  <br>  Online is just an extension of the real world - good, bad, and ugly exists in abundance.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I wouldn't say my personality is different in real life, but I am a lot quieter.  I would not express my opinions with the frankness that I do on here.  In fact, in real life I seldom express an opinon to anyone.  This is what makes the Internet so refreshing.|`|OTT79NAtaa	Perhaps. Maybe jewelry and I would find love within minutes of meeting. <br>  <br>  <br>  ..But seriously, jewelry, I added details to your comments on the question about women not raising men's self esteem <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvvZDknTTA9cKgOeKr90IE7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222152833AAmG96n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|WkLJI40baa	In real life I am much nicer.|`|3wWpKexoaa	Yes, I think it does for some people, but not so much for others.<br>  <br>  In real life we have to deal directly with people, don't have time to think out a good reply or research what we want to say, we are just as people find us.<br>  <br>  Online we might really be just the same as in real life, but will the baility to take the time to think about how we reply to people and deal with them.<br>  <br>  Of course for others, they get a thrill out of stepping into another persona, so they do.<br>  <br>  So yeah; depends on the person.<br>  <br>  Cheers :-)|`|WQ2FKRF8aa	People sometimes lose their "real" life persona when they get on the internet and can be "anyone" they want to be. It's a slippery slope that many have fallen into. And face it, the computer has a button that you use to turn it off. So when you're online persona is creating problems, hit that button and get back to real life.|`|096b7gBHaa	i don't really swear in online world, and when in real life, i would fell more sinful to swear since it is directly by my tounge.<br>  <br>  so i'm pretty much the same, especially that i don't put pics but just my thoughts on web, so it makes me being more of myself than some myspace barbie who would meet demands to nude from men|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I think we are still our basic selves, but meaner and sometimes trickier because we can be. Probably more honest too, though I think many people fall into the trap of supposing that abusing and insulting people is being honest.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I don't believe one can switch personalities but one will show different sides when either face to face in the real world or online|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Not their personality, but more so their attitude and demeanor.|`|G50ucmllaa	Yeah, I am nicer in real life too...  I think most of us probably are.  Its easy to say things to people when you do not actually see a human.|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	in real life im more funny...|`|i8OezhEYaa	I think it's very true that some people's personality does change online. I have an extremely shy friend who can barely hold a conversation in person, but online takes on a new identity. She chats over the computer like it's nobodys business and blogs uncontrollably.|`|DrqmIfJiaa	Of course people are way more open online because its not direct confrontation, so people are more likely to be mean or hurtful.
SCeIOtZpaa	When I notice myself starting to feel lonely, I try to stop and thing about embracing the fact that I have a moment of peace, and time to myself.  I try to think about my life and things I want to accomplish, and what I have already accomplished.  I try to focus on things I normally don't have time to think about because I'm busy with everyday life.  I also try to think about little things that make me thankful to be around.  <br>  <br>  Usually after I do that I feel better, and not "sad and lonely" the way I had felt before I started thinking about all those things.|`|l34etpuSaa	find something to do that requires concentration like reading or art or something similar|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	shut! I'm marry and I still feel lonely! but what I do is I start doing things, and making my self busy stops me from thinking about it...|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Wallow in misery.|`|G8rt7EDnaa	Turn on some lights ..  ( not off if your lonely or it may make you depresedd )<br>  an put in a good movie..|`|E2xG6bpnaa	wish I had someone to talk too|`|AA10665398	talk to my friends. by calling them or texting them.<br>  i talk to my kitty (she always listens!) and to other people in my family who i like talking to.<br>  or i write my stories. my characters are always there for me! =)
sziO5hK7aa	act. stand straight, focus on voice tonality, maybe even try imagining everyone else in the room are a bunch of idiots. from experience, i can tell you that you will feel a lot worse if you don't go through it, than if you go through it and it didn't go so well. better regretting something you did than not doing it at all. this experience will be valuable. anything that is of value does not come easy. there is no logical reason you cannot give a speech, if other people can so can you. believe in yourself.|`|cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	Focus on what you are saying and how you want to say it.  Practice it a few times.  Realize that a brief pause to the audience sounds dramatic when for you it may feel unnatural.<br>  <br>  Also realize that everyone there is pulling for you.  They're on your side and want you to do well.<br>  <br>  If you have supportive friends in the audience, focus on them.<br>  <br>  And if you have to do talks regularly and suffer from nerves, you can also try Toastmaster's.  They have groups all around the world and you can learn to deal with nerves and become a better speaker.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|YVasdve0aa	Practice makes perfect.  Practice in front of family or friends.  By feeling confident and well prepared you won't be as nervous.  From my experience normally once you are up there it goes away.  The hardest part is just getting past the first 30 seconds.  Once you feel you are well prepared do something fun to make the time go by faster and take your mind off of it.  Being nervous is normal.  It won't go away completely and in fact sometimes it makes you a little better.  For now try the things I already mentioned.  Good luck.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Re-present, I mean represent.<br>  <br>  Be bold. Show your acumen and courage. You are master.
hSanptMjaa	while i am a feminist... i think the word most is misused here, maybe some but i defiantly wouldn't say most.<br>  i'm 100% heterosexual, i don't find the female figure arousing at all<br>  too soft lol|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Bi?<br>  <br>  I thought they all muched rug in their studio apartment with the 65 cats eating their faces!|`|aWEybdDFaa	Hey, did u know that all teachears are bi, police officers, DOCTORS, and most LAWYERS!...LMAO! U 2 FUNNY.<br>  <br>   You became a feminist because it was an easy way to get with BIsexuals as yourself, why not go to a lesbian bar or lounge. A lot of bisexual women don't want to TELL the world that they enjoy both men and women. Was this your way of screaming to us that you're bisexual, I hear u but really don't care. I have a wife a husband already.<br>  If you want to tell the world that you love both men and women than go make a sex video & put it on u tube.<br>  <br>  Babe no one here cares that u're bi whom lives to assume|`|S2vI4VEXaa	There's no actual basis for that. <br>  And if there were, who cares? One's sexual orientation doesn't have anything to do with it.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Becuas most feminists AREN'T bi. You are.|`|zXPGm2fraa	what does one thing have to do with the other? I don't think that most Masculinists are bi, are they? Maybe they are? Is it anyone's business?|`|1fruneZ1aa	Nope- never had any inclination to be bi-sexual. I actually like men- I just<br>  don't want to be controlled by one.|`|FUIBscKGaa	Elaine, I am heterosexual.  I've never been sexually attracted to women, and have never been physical with another female.  As liberal as I am, and as little as I care about negative judgements from others on how I should live, I assure you I would say it if it were so. My family wouldn't even care if I were gay, so being closeted would not be required.  I was raised in the movement, and my mother and father were active second wavers.  I've talked about this one here, but you must have missed it.  I have been happily married to the same man for almost 12 years, and we have raised our kids in the movement.  I am absolutely certain that I am heterosexual, as well as being a feminist.<br>  <br>  I look forward to discussing Feminist Theory with you, as well as the wonderful feminist philosophies that you must be familiar with, now that you are a feminist.  Even though your posts all kind of sound like you are trying to convince people something about feminism that isn't true, I'm sure it must just be me.  I'm sure you must do other types of  posts, too, and I'm just missing them.  I'll keep an eye out for them, though, since you being a feminist now means they must exist.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	I think the women you are referring to who label themselves straight, are in fact straight.  Most of them will fool around with girls just to get attention from guys.  They are not truly bisexual.  This is simply a trend in recent years.<br>  <br>  I do think sincere *bi-curiosity* is common among females in general though.  I am surprised you feel that people don't accept bisexuality as being common among feminists...I always felt like a lot of (ignorant) people assume feminists are all man-hating lesbians!<br>  <br>  Edit:  Interesting observation about bi-curiosity in men.  I bet you're right :)
xvxT46iJaa	I can honestly tell you the thought is terrifying. Having never given birth i am more focused atm on the actual process, rather than the result!|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I could care less, I do not plan to ever give birth to anything!|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Scared both times..I felt like my insides were ripping open.|`|V1MptCMiaa	I'm torn between feeling amazed and terrified.  It's pretty cool that I can create another human being, but I also hate that one day, I'll have to.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Terrifying. I wish I couldn't.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Euphoric..|`|IwUpusQiaa	it's a surreal & scary notion.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Knowing that I can give birth makes me feel like I am connected to nature and a part of nature itself. It feels sublime, knowing that I can give life to another human being. Knowing that I have the power to be able to give life to another person.|`|096b7gBHaa	first i was freaked out. felt like i'll lose my whole world just for giving birth since it looks damn painful. i couldn't even imagine how could babies come out from where only pees can go through.<br>  <br>  it's ironic and creepy, but now i'm just getting how it works.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Miraculous and creepy. My husband and I got a vasectomy so they'll be no chances of that happening yay! I personally see it as really creepy, but I know loads of women that love it.|`|3d984205bb4d04e11f5941ec98252b01aa	Like a burden...the idea terrifies me. I mean a penis hurt so much, cramps are killer painful and I cry, I don't want to try childbirth EVER. <br>  <br>  I will throw a party when I find out I'm sterile...everyone invited!|`|PwvU3LQBaa	I have had 2 kids and I don't want any more so it feels horrible knowing that I could get pregnant if I stop taking my birth control pills or they could fail.  I really don't want any more kids.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	Like a burden.  It sounds horrifying, painful, and scary.|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	it feels kind of cool that another human being can come out of my body...but i don't want kids, so it's not happening with me|`|srIMFTb8aa	Creepy.|`|M5eI0UAqaa	I don't want to  - too scary, all the side effects all the pain...all the freedom taken awaay!!! oh noooo!! <br>  <br>  on the other hand being able to bring life into the world, is quite extraordinary natural talent and a wonderful gift/ability. hmmm.|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Many women feel empowered, saying...now that I've gone through childbirth, I feel like can do anything.<br>  The pain...unlike any other in the world, hard core.<br>  The result...nothing short of a miracle.|`|tvbKA4f5aa	Emotional, powerful, scared, all wrapped up in one|`|AA11104372	Awesome.|`|4inCVHEvaa	extremely thrill.2 think that he/she would b my own flesh n blood.i know itll be painful but who cares.im just happy, happy, happy.|`|1wIek546aa	irrelevant.<br>  <br>  i'm not having kids right now, or any time in the next 5 years or so...so i really don't care.|`|yUdIMO6Maa	scared because your actions effect there life|`|ZYp1AEspaa	It's extremely surreal. My children and I agree on that.|`|iopyAQthaa	I feel like I could take over the world.... no really.
xsyAljhaaa	For the same reason they were reluctant to give all men the right to vote: The "commoners" tended to be blithering idiots, and the aristocrats--the Founding Fathers--would have been insane to let the illiterate masses guide the countries future, or so it probably seemed to them. You are talking about UNIVERSAL suffrage which for women was achieved in 1920, but women could vote before then in some states as early as 1869. Un-landed white men couldn't vote until 1870 with the passage of the 15th Amendment, but since universal suffrage means all men -- not just the white ones -- women in the US had universal suffrage before men. It wasn't until 1924 that American Indians were enfranchised.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Because they thought that we were illogical and incapable of making a decision.  Women were seen as crazy and guided by emotion, men were seen as Intelligent and logical.|`|H55nCLqPaa	So reluctant? <br>  <br>  If you want to see reluctance look at the various civil wars that have had to be fought throughout the world to gradually extend political enfranchisement to most men. You know when there is 'reluctance' to let you vote when you have to fight a goddamn war over it.<br>  <br>  Women got the vote handed to them on a silver platter.|`|2TavF36Daa	It was a matter of culture.<br>  <br>  Women had to "fight" for the right to vote; because in our culture at that time, men were considered to be the head of the family. He spoke for the family.<br>  <br>  Changing culture is a very difficult thing to do. It often takes a form of rebellion to do so (violent or non-violent).|`|G50ucmllaa	Just America?  Other similar countries gave women the right to vote about the same time.<br>  <br>  Norway<br>   1913<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Denmark<br>   1915<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Iceland<br>   1915<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Canada<br>   1917<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Austria<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Germany<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Hungary<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Ireland<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Poland<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Russia<br>   1918<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  United Kingdom<br>   1918<br>   18 years (was 30 years until 1928)<br>   <br>  Belarus<br>   1919<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Belgium<br>   1919<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Netherlands<br>   1919<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Sweden<br>   1919<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Ukraine<br>   1919<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Albania<br>   1920<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Czech Republic<br>   1920<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  Slovakia<br>   1920<br>   18 years<br>   <br>  United States<br>   1920<br>   18 years|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Because the Patriarchy would have preferred them to concentrate on making sammiches in the kitchen|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Look at what they have done to marriage laws!|`|pRv6CZGjaa	well you have to understand that at the time women voting was considered an absurd idea, because up until that point women had always been viewed as (for lack of a better word) "second-rate citizens." their traditional role was to stay at home, cook for her husband and children, and tend to anything that needed to be done in the house. also, it wasn't like the rest of the world had already granted women's suffrage and america was acting out of defiance, but the fact that women were even able to protest showed that america was ahead of the social curve when it came to equality between the sexes. at the time, there was only one other country where there was protests for women's suffrage, and that was great britain.
f05KdsZkaa	that is what's happening to me.. what you do is if you have finally solve and understand the reason why you firstly ignore and hid yourself then its time for you to get over, accept it and try to change yourself and be who you are again. you can try to do what the above answer suggested, exercise, put yourself out there again.|`|0DtsNuWAaa	Being alone and a recluse has become more the 'norm' for you.  It's easy, it's safe.<br>  <br>  You need to push your boundaries and exercise...just like an athlete does when they train.  Push a little more, everytime you go out, stay out a bit longer, or go out a little more frequently. Push yourself everyday<br>  <br>  Sooner of later going out and being social will be the norm...and staying home, will also be nice to do, but it won't be your main existence.|`|6tR0gS5kaa	The fact that you acknowledge that this behavior has become a problem for you shows that you have good insight and a high chance for success.  There is no one right answer, several avenues need to be explored, like; what reinforcement lead you to become reclusive? what do you fear about being in social groups that makes you feel "awkward and insecure"? I suggest you speak to a psychologist who can help you to break down the psychological barrier you have  created that is holding you back from feeling confident in social groups and developing close relationships.  The first step is seeking help... you can do it :)|`|DUUJryfEaa	I, too, tend to avoid people and feel like it's become a really bad habit.  You have to change your whole way of thinking just to break that sort of rigid thinking and behavior patterns.  I've sought professional help, personally, because I needed the encouragement and security. Maybe that would help you, too.
d88r9fKMaa	To be honest with you, that is insane. There's nothing wrong with having a sacred toy or blanket or anything but what you are doing would let people think you're just trying to seek attention or you're just trying to create a scene.<br>  <br>  You would do yourself much justice to try being optimistic in life and behave normally and try not to dwell on the unfortunate events of the past that you say you've been through.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	Baby girl! As long as this isn't a B.S. post, I'd like to change your poopy diaper. Grrrrr!|`|LiKMlFfzaa	yea i would love to be a friend and no its ok that you want to be a baby  hope we can chat your my baby girl|`|E2xG6bpnaa	That level of deviance is interesting... did you come up with this on your own... I knew a guy in high school that wore a baby cap everyday but he did it for the attention.  Calms you... drawing attention to yourself calms you?|`|h9djwAVRaa	when was this *ever* acceptable in society??|`|ShVvz5qKaa	Sounds like a bullsh*t question.<br>  But if that's real, then there are men out there who like that.

NYU37jfGaa	Well, in the 1920s most single women worked for a living, but were sometimes limited in what they could do, they might have found it difficult to get promoted etc, and were usually paid less than men.  Women who married generally expected to give up work unless they were very poor and had no choice but to keep on working.<br>  <br>  The 1920s was a decade when marriage was seen as a more desirable option to most women than staying single and pursuing a career.  a lot of pre-WW1 educated women had stayed single, 50% of female college students in the 1890s never married, but in the 20s celibacy was out of style, and the ideal was to have a good time, go to parties, etc, and get married. <br>  <br>  In the 1930s, with the Depression, it once more became a fashionable option to be single and pursue a career.  The marriage rate fell sharply, and more married women went out to work too, as they needed to supplement the family income in hard times. <br>  <br>  Nowadays women are generally expected to keep on working after they marry and after they have children, in fact as far as I can make out they're expected to be back at work as soon as they are out of the delivery room.  Some people feel this is a good thing, but personally I have my doubts.<br>  <br>  However, for women who are interested in pursuing careeers, it is easier now than it was in the 20s, there are more opportunities for women to enter professions like law, medicine, business etc, and they are likely to get paid the same as men and have the same opportunities for promotion.

I believe the Bible - there are two options based upon whether or not a person accepts or rejects the work and claims of Jesus Christ.  Those who insist upon rejecting God and pushing Him out of their lives will have the privilege of living without him for all eternity - and suffering because of it.  Those who embrace Christ and the truth of the Bible will spend eternity with God.  The choice is made during this life.  The Bible says it is appointed to man once to die, and after that, the judgment.  Hope this wasn't too long.|`|exKRjygnaa	When you die, you stop thinking, and nothing happens afterward.

I'm currently involved with the exploration of feeling and emotion (moving away from the mind)....its filling my life with the kind of mad zany exxperiences that I thought were gone for good when I stopped munching psychedelics every day!

There is more to life out there that we don't know, and perhaps never will know.<br>  <br>  However, unless you are one of the lucky ones that doesn't need to earn a living or conform to peer pressures of owning a house and starting a family, then the reality of your life is going to be somewhat different to the dreamy World of your thread.  We all have to spend many hours being conformist in order to put food on the table and a roof over our heads.  The very nature of what you imply in your thread is contradictory to the conformism most of us experience in our every day lives.

iUzSlmSbaa	It's not clingy nor needy to invite someone you worked well together with. it's a nice gesture. Some people at work don't want to mix their private life with their work life even if they get on very well with the other person and even are more than just work colleagues but share some problems and ideas with each other and ask about ''how was your weekend and ask that because they really care, not just because they are polite..still some don't want to mix the work life and the private life.. and the other person may feel uncomfortable meeting the friends of the work colleage.. she doesn't know them.. she only knows the person she worked with so I would not take it personal if this person declined an invitation.. and if I was the person who got invited by a work colleague.. I would think it's nice that she wrote ''Miss you'' that would give me a good feeling of working with her again..I would see it as a nice gesture on her part to want to invite me out and the fact that she accepts when I say '' No, when I thanked her and said.. sorry can't come but i am thinking of you.. I would say neither one is clingy nor needy and would not distance myself.. if I no longer worked with her.. or if she was not hanging out with all her friends and invited me just to meet her and go for a coffee with her or do something together.. I would probably go on another occasion and try to get to know her better but not when all her friends are around then i would feel a bit like a 5th wheel.. I would appreciate her kind thoughts and consider her as more than a work colleage and not clingy or needy.. probably I would want to go out with her at least once to see what she's like away from work.. but just us two..|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	The very fact that she has a group of friends rather than just you indicates to me that she is probably not needy or clingy.  I have a large group of friends, with a few select friends that I always enjoy spending time with.  One of those very close select friends recently invited me to meet for dinner with some other mutual friends, but I had previous plans.  I thanked her, told her I loved her and ended with "Let's get to gether soon."  She is neither needy nor clingy.  And she is a close friend.... I wouldn't even consider ending my friendship with her.|`|AA11324847	See, I don't believe in the term "needy", if someone needs me, I'm there for em. It's a term people have coined to belittle others. If you think someone's "needy", obviously you think you're too good for her basically. And as far as the question goes, if it's suddenly bad to show a guy how much you appreciate him, then he doesn't deserve you...|`|2uPrnOleaa	Nope I wouldn't think so. At first mention she seems like a thoughtful person who's not so fond of talking on the phone. Nothing wrong with that in my opinion!

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	The Desperate housewives show portrays women horribly. The show makes women look like they do not have a single redeeming quality-but that's why it's a tv show-it's meant to entertain, not reflect reality. And I didn't say it was good entertainment either. I can't watch it-it's too dumb for me to stand more than a few minutes of it--I get restless and change the channel.

UBcBjRMfaa	Being Canadian I would say that it was meant as a defense against Manifest Destiny. The fact that Western Canada is still Western Canada and not Northwestern United States is kind of where I'm going haha. But you could have food for thought in thinking of it as inadvertantly conforming to Manifest Destiny, in a different sense than Manifest Destiny was meant. (The U.S. is the one with the destiny to control N.A., according to that particular article. To think that Westward Expansion was a contribution to it would be more along the lines of race I think...)
