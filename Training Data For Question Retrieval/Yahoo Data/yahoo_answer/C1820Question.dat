Hello, I've got a long train journey this weekend, so want to take my laptop and watch a film on the way. i don't think there are any power sockets with the seat, so only have battery life.   I have 3 options for watching the films -    -take DVD's with me   -Watch a film stored on my HDD   -Move the film to a flash memory stick and watch from that.      which will give me the best battery life, or would there be much in it? My instinct is memory stick, as I know memory stick use less power than HDD and probably DVD, but I don't know if the computer would use the HDD anyway whilst watching it.      thanks for any advice!

It is VERY strange.  I have now deleted all codes from all the boxes in "edit profile" from "about me" all the way down to "heroes".    When I click "view profile", it still shows the layout.  I have another profile and when I put up a layout code or any other code for that matter, and then I view my profile, it appears immediately.  When I delete a code, be it graphics from Photobucket, a YouTube video a layout code, etc and then view the profile, the thing I have deleted is always no longer there.    And yes, I have clicked save every single time.  I just looked at all the boxes in "edit profile" and they are all empty right now, which is what I want, because I am trying to isolate a problem.  The best way I know how to get rid of what's causing it is to delete all codes and start over from scratch.    The other problem is that every single thing I have is smushed over to the left and has to fit in a couple inches and the rest from there over to the right of the screen is blank.  All graphics in comments are cut off.  When I had graphics of my own from Photobucket embeded, they were cut off down the middle.  You could only see the left half of the picture.    And "about me" is appearing below all other interests way down at the bottom below the comments.    What do you think it could be and what would you do in my situation?    Thanks.  :)

However, whenever I copy it across (or place it, or export it) things move in the image when it appears in InDesign. I wouldn't mind so much, only the image is complex, and fixing it every time is very frustrating.      To get around it I have tried importing from Photoshop, which seemed at first to work well - only now the image is hugely bitmapped. The image is 300dpi and at the right size (in cm) for how it will appear in InDesign.      I have a second image, this one created in Photoshop, and that is also losing quality on the transfer from Photoshop to InDesign. Can anyone advise me on either problem?

Every time I tried to go to answers it told me I would have to register again.  The only thing I can think of was,  I got a suspension notice because of my answer to describe dolphin sex.  As a BS in biology person I thought I knew the answer.  I did not use any language that might offend unless you count the words genitalia or Organ as too graphic.   damn I hate having to type my address over and over trying to get in.  Has anyone else had a  similar experiance?

20090205045125AAXhvb0	Computers & Internet;Software	What codec pack plays .rax music file (the real music format)?	I thought K-lite mega codec pack is perfect enough to play any sorts of media files. But music purchased from rhapsody before 2007 (the time the mp3 store launched) were saved under the .rax format. And k-lite has no filter for this format. K-lite also doesn't have a solution for music purchased at  the previous sony (atrac) music store "connect.com".      Anybody knows any real codec to play .rax? even realplayer can't play .rax. Only rhapsody's own software (downloading tool) is able to, but problem is I'm outside of united states right now and can't access downloading of this software (rhapsody is not available outside of united states).

20090205043907AAd3deK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Image rotation in Java?	Hey everybody. I'm gonna start an Asteroids game. The forseeable difficulty is that I cannot figure out a way to implement image rotation. The examples I've read online are way too damn complicated and it's just ridiculously complex for one task. I don't want five classes just to use rotation. I know some trig (I've made things chase the player and such) and I'll try to learn to use Graphics2D if I have to. There's gotta be a way using pi and angles. I'm sure you've all at least seen Asteroids. Turn with arrow keys and move forward in the direction your facing. That idea. Any sorta simple, semi-easy to understand ideas?

20090205045720AAKFBwV	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Would Ebay be a safe website to buy items on?	I heard some negative stuff about it, that when you use paypal or your credit card it's not kept private, other people have access to the card number & your information. Normally  when you purchase items online its kept private so no one can find out your card number. This way they can't buy anything off your card!! I hope this makes sense!!!       What do you guys think is it safe, or am I better of on Amazon.com?

I reinstalled Windows last sunday and im sure I dont have any viruses here. I think the problem may be rooted in BIOS options but I can§t work with that w/o help.      Can you help me please ?

I've already had 2 bug or virus cleanings from a Dell anti-virus service package that we purchased.  We paid $239 for 4 times and I've already used 2 so I hate to call them again.  The only things I can think of are #1 someone is hacking into my computer and trying to look up things and that's why my cursor is all over the place or #2 it could be because I introduced something looking at some sites I shouldn't have been (no need to go into detail, I'm not the only one out there curious about such sites).  There is a guy that I met online that works w/computers and would probably know how to hack into them and he has my e-mail and I think he may be a bit obsessed.  Could it be him?  I wonder because my computer said "spyware hs stolen...see the contents" a month ago before I had it cleaned by Dell and it listed an IP address (what's that?) of 98.206.173.24 (can I find out what that is) and it LISTED THE TOWN HE LIVES IN (which is also in my county though).  I'm just sick of starting to type something though and then it'll print a couple of extra letters or the cursor will jump to another line!  HELP!  What do I do?  THANKS for ANY helpful advice!
20090205062123AAPIIkg	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++, why am I still able to access an out of scoped object?	Ok, here is my situation: I was testing for fun if i could still access an object that was declared in a function but returned by reference to the calling function, and the results were quite unexpected... here is a snippet of code to help u understand:   --------------------------------------...   #include     using namespace std;      class Cat{    public:     //memory management     Cat(){cout << "constructed" << endl;}     Cat(const Cat & rhs){itsAge = rhs.itsAge; cout << "copy constructor" << endl;}       ~Cat(){cout << "destructed" << endl;}            //public accessor methods      void SetAge(int age){itsAge = age;}     int GetAge() const {return itsAge;}     private:     int itsAge;   };       Cat & create();      int main(){   Cat a2 = create();  //copy constructor    cout << "age: "<< a2.GetAge() << endl;   return0;                 }      Cat & create(){    Cat a1;    a1.SetAge(10);     return a1;   }   --------------------------------------...   My initial hypothesis is that the object declared within in the function create() would go out of scope before the object returned by reference. This was half correct as the statement "Cat a2 = create();" produces the output:   constructed   destructed   copy constructor   age: 10   Press return to continue...   destructed   This indicates that the object declared in create() is destructed before the copy constructor is called... which doesn't make, what is the copy constructor copying? i thought once an object when out-of scope *destructed*, it could no longer be accessed. yet i am still able to access the object's data member through the method GetAge().. any help understanding this would be great, please explain with source code as it's easier to follow.

20090205062204AAKzfeL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	At risk for identity theft?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me. ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET.

20090205060339AAwd40f	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why does my laptop screen go dull when I plug the charger in?	I recently bought a Dell Latitude D630. It was fine until recently, where the screen brightness is fine when the laptop isn't charging, but when it is charging the screen goes dull, it's still visible however. My power options are 'Dell reccomended' which should result in the opposite (brighter screen whilst charging).      Also, after a while using the internet my browser (both with firefox and IE) will crash, acting like the internet has disconnected. I can still access skype/msn and it still claims to be connected. This isn't due to the firewall/antivirus as I've disabled both which doesn't make it work again. When it's restarted they begin working again.      Any ideas why?       Thanks

I have not altered U torrents settings since starting the original set of downloads.    I've followed the FAQ suggestion to turn off the Desktop Indexing Feature which apparently is a common cause only to find it wasn't enabled anyway.

20090205065831AALkl9z	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	More keyboard problems...?	The keyboard my computer comes with doesn't work (it plugs into a ps2, purple port).  I got another keyboard that also plugs into a ps2 but that keyboard doesn't work either.  Next, I tried a keyboard that plugs into a USB port and it worked.  That keyboard doesn't belong to me so I purchased a PS2-USB port converter to use with one of the PS2 keyboards.  Neither of the PS2 keyboards work with the converter... Do you think it is a problem with both keyboards or something is wrong with the converter... or is something wrong with my pc?  When I first plug the PS2 keyboards into any of the ports, the 3 lights (num lock, caps, and scroll lock) light up very briefly so some electricity must be getting through to them. But none of the keys work. I also have an on-screen keyboard it appears very skewed and is difficult to use.  I can't boot into safe mode because the on-screen keyboard does not open until I have logged into my computer, long after initial start-up.  I've tried system restore but there are no restore points before today.  I have no idea what to do next or even what the problem is!      FYI: I have Windows XP Home Edition       Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

Hi,    I own a Windows XP, and today when I switched it on, I got this message:    "Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:    \WINDOWS.I \ SYSTEM 32 \ CONFIG \ SYSTEM    You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows setup using the original setup CD-Rom. Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair "    Problem: On starting up the PC, I get the above message, and at the moment, I cannot find any setup CD-Rom.    But, if I do, how major is this problem? ie: Will my files and photos that I hadn't got around to backing-up be recoverable?     I've been having a lot of problems with the PC being slow and sluggish and crashing recently anyway, so I may just invest in a new one - but if I want to transfer my documents and files from this PC, yet can't find the setup CD-Rom -- can the data/files/photos be recovered from it any other way?    Thanks for any help!

I was using a Nvidia Geforce 9400 GT PCIe graphics card which had worked as expected for 3 months. I then connected to the monitor to my on-board graphics and everything worked fine. I then tried reinstalling the drivers for the 9400 GT which didn't work. Then I disconnected all the hardware that I could to check that it wasn't a power supply problem. I also put another identical card in the PCIe socket to see if the card was faulty which it wasn't. Could there be a problem with the motherboard? What else can i try? my motherboard only has 1 pcie socket so i cant use another. The motherboard is 2 years old now. Someone previously made a comment about the CMOS battery. I don't understand this, how could it affect the pcie socket? Please help :)

20090205070400AAWvwW1	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Restoring an ex-display laptop?	I bought an ex display laptop but realised the shop I bought it from, Comet, had already made their own settings etc on the laptop. For example, the C drive is called 'comet' and although I can change the name of the computer when I receive files and download things they are always saved under the name 'comet'. Also, when I turned my laptop on it started up just as if I had used it before (because its ex-display). For some reason I can't help feeling this laptop is second hand, even though it hasnt been used before exept to show people in the shop.     Is there a way I can restore the laptop to its factory/original settings so that when I turn it on it is as if it has never been used before and I am the first person to have used the laptop? I want to run the startup seetings that would have run if the laptop was turned on for the first time.     I have a HP G60 and it is on windows vista home premium.

How do i erase my Facebook Hot Bids profile???!!?	okay this was probably the stupidest thing i have ever done!!! :( :(   i just got a facebook profile and i was invited to be part of a thing called Hot Bids. What it is, is that other members of Hot Bids look at your picture and rate you Hot, Gorgeous, Sexy, or Pleasant. the more "good" votes u get, the more Hot Bids "cash" you get, making it more likely for u to get in the top 100.   anyway, i joined thinking it would be cool for me to get other teens my age sayin i'm hot. i've only gotten hot and gorgeous bids so far, but they're ALL from men that could be my DAD's age... disgusting *shudder*... anyway i can't figure out how to delete my mini-profile... please help me!!!    thank-you =]

20090205073000AAoqCsr	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	Does Myspace automatically log you out when you've been idle for a certain period of time?	I'm suspicious that my b/f is secretly messaging another girl on Myspace, because I will see him online, then he'll go offline, and then she'll immediately go online (my guess is that he sends her a msg, logs off, she gets e-mail notification that she got one, then logs on to see it.)  This happened last night, and when I questioned him about being online at 11, he said he must have left it logged in when he went to bed at 10:30 (he was offline by around 11:05.)  I didn't think Myspace did this when you had a cable connection.  Any thoughts?

Hello, I noticed a few days ago that the clock on my comp desktop was not staying at the right time after the computer had been turned off so this resulted in me having to adjust the date and time every time I go on. Anyway earlier today when I booted up my computer there was a weird black screen with a load of technical writing on it, it said press f1 to continue at the bottom, I didn't really read it but I continued so that I could get to the log in screen, another screen came up saying "verifying dmi pool data" it stayed on for about 5 seconds then went to my normal user log in screen. I was confused by this as it has never happened before. I turned off my computer and turned it back on, this time it went through a normal process then just to the screen that said "verifying dmi pool data", again staying for 5 seconds, before moving on to the log on screen.   Should I be worried about this? Will it cause any problems? Will it stop me from logging on next time I restart my computer? Any help appreciated!

Now I cant even do anything in safe mode because explorer.exe is gone there too... Help!

This probably isn't a big thing but it's slowly driving me mad!! Any help is much appreciated!!

But everything seems to favor the buyer now.       Examples:      * Paypal "holds" money until you give them a tracking number and the post office finished the shipment.      * Buyers generally win disputes and you're out the money and the product.      * Sellers can't leave negative feedback to deadbeat or otherwise kooky buyers.

I have 5 times, and still see this pop-up.       There's no real problem, as iTunes will still burn CDs and rip them perfectly fine, the pop-up's just kind of annoying.       Thanks!

I would like to take several shots from a movie DVD, convert them into a video file format acceptable to After Effects CS3, bring them into AE to add a few extra effects.       I'm doing a little project, private, only for myself... a 1950s movie where several visual effects were needed but the producer ran out of budget. I have some original storyboards & thought it would be interesting to try to recreate those "missing shots". I have AE and would like to see if I could add a few matte paintings.      What is the best file format that would preserve the original video quality/imagery through the download/conversion of a DVD clip -- and then import it into AE? (I'm trying to avoid compression and information loss. Unfortunately, After Effects doesn't accept .avi files).       Thank you very much for your suggestions & help.

20090204192131AAppStf	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Computer free space problem?	I have Windows XP on a Dell computer.  Over the summer when I defragmented my computer, the program told me that I had 47% free space.  Since then, I have not added any major programs, and the biggest programs I have on there are the Sims2 and the Zune software.           When I went to defragment my computer a few weeks ago, the program said that I only had about 1-2% free space!  I deleted almost all of my programs and the majority of my pictures and documents, and I still only have 11% free space.         Like I said, I don't have any huge programs on here and nothing new was added between the summer and now.  I don't know what could have happened!  Any ideas and how to fix the problem?

My current gf hates them and wanted them off. They didnt mean anything to me so we made it a group effort to delete them all and so we did. Keep in mind this was done on a Kodak photo program on my pc. We deleted them all within the program. Keep in mind we did not empty the recycle bin. The next day she looked at those same folders and they were BACK!!! and she blames ME for restoring them. I DID NOT RESTORE THEM.       So my question is what possible things could take place that would restore files on their own? Keep in mind that the recycle bin was still full of the files that we deleted. That means these files were duplicates. What is going on?

She downloaded a facebook application for making a layout page but it looks legit.  The first day the desktop screen changed.  Now the boot and shutdown background screen shows a giant facebook image...  This totally seems like a virus or bug, but using several anti-virus programs I have not found anything.  Also, now her internet explorer will start opening infinite new windows and she will have to restart the computer to get it to stop.  Does anyone have any advice as what might be happening?  If I had a bit more info I am sure I could fix it myself or have a friend help.  So, maybe someone else has had this happen?

So upon a random, accidental scan of a recently downloaded movie file from a legal website, i scanned the file using spybot and it said this was contained in the file as heuristic. I googled it found it was spyware or a trojan etc. So far mcafee, avg and spybot dont detect any virus or any file on my entire computer doing a full system scan. But when i scan ANY avi/mp3 etc (music/video) file it detects the smitfraud-C. Nothing has happened to my computer as of yet and i dont know how long its had. I just downloaded a separate, new song and it was detected as well. Is this just an error with spybot or do i have a real problem.      TL;DR. Smitfraud detected in all audio/movie file, is this real or fake.
