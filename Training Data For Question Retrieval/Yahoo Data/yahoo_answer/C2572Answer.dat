EzxsnELDaa	I get a similar issue with my CD player in my car, but the player is like 10 years old, so I've just written it off as age.  The car may be a 2008, but do you know how old the CD player is?  <br>  <br>  You should see if you can check.  Also does it happen specifically when you turn the heat on?  Something could be loose somewhere and piping hot air into the back of the CD player.|`|SiaWY5n2aa	i have never heard of that in my life. my CD player heats up my CD only if its summer and Ive listened to it about 30 times!!! if its an 08 i would bring it back to Mercedes and flip. for the price of that car it should make cd's for you not heat them up<br>  p.s. NICE CAR!!! i love mercedes but they are out of my budget lol|`|H5n6bglYaa	it seems like a fail safe. It's like, when the cd player starts to over heat it shuts itself down to prevent it from burning out. it's just like when your car over heats it shuts itself off!

Now its a little different I think the md-80s are getting quite pricey with the new planes having being lighter and more efficient that is why they purchased quite a few 787s . .
G0i9793Xaa	"All Elantra are heavier than Japanese cars of the same engine capacity/physical dimensions. That means higher fuel consumption can be expected. More frequent breakdown due to wear<br>  Basic design is for short service life span, so expect to face many 'premature' replacements"<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the most BS answer I've ever heard. I OWN an Elantra so I can tell you about some things and point you to other owners.<br>  <br>  First off, the engine in the Elantra is a little bigger and stronger then in the more common small cars so the power to weight ratio does not play a factor ............ as if 150 lbs makes a difference in a car's reliability. Plus, when this generation model came out it was a little bigger then other cars it was competing with at the time so the size justifies the weight. <br>  I own a 01' Elantra GT with over 140,000 miles on it. Because of the extra glass for the hatch it weights about 100 lbs more then the regular Elantra but I haven't experienced any 'premature replacements" because of the extra weight. In fact, I still get about 33-35 mpg on the highway driving depending on how fast I'm going so the "extra weight" doesn't seem to effect the Elantra. <br>  <br>  To answer the question the things you should look for is proper maintainace on the engine. It uses a timing belt and has various belts to run certain components meaning the belts should've been changed every 60,000 miles. The fuel pump and thermostat are also common things to look out for. The transmission uses special fluid called SP-3 that should be changed every 30,000 miles. Anything else can ruin the tranny.<br>  I can definitely say that the Elantra is a reliable car.

AA11435704	Have the van computer checked for codes. Some auto parts stores will do this for free. The service engine light is telling you that there is a trouble code in the computer. The code that is set will give you a starting point to find the problem.<br>  <br>  You do not say what engine you have in the van. If it has a 3.0 it is very possible that the bearing in the distributor has worn and is causing the intermittent problem that you describe.

AA10286987	Maybe not in terms of power but you will notice a jump up in drivability and smoothness of the engine. If you have and older car cleaning up your engine grounds or replacing them will help reduce resistance in the sensor circuits and electronics.

You might even notice brighter headlights, easier cranking and starting making your battery and alternator work less and last longer.

The firewall remark can be handled for about $8.00 at a hardware store. Buy you about 12 inches of cow chain, and a couple of #8 steel bolts. When you drop that thing in there and get it bolted in, put that chain around engine mount on left side and put your bolts through it. That will keep the tension on the mount constantly, so it won't rock to the right when you demand torque from it, thus not busting distributor cap on firewall.

Hopefully you can duplicate the problem and get the fault to return.<br>  <br>  Resolve all the hard faults so you can get them out of the way.

bqLvWpcZaa	Depends on the vintage...up until the 90's, with a few exceptions, they were pretty much square and boring ( styling wise ). However, they were also over-engineered and very solidly built. That began to change in the mid 90's with the introduction of the W210 E-Class. That design brought some flair and character into the design which was seen by some to be almost radical for the Benz family. Also, Benz was beginning to push the envelope for the development and advancement of electronics in their vehicles. Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. This brought reliability scores down and Benz is still trying to play catch-up to this day with those scores.  They are getting better though...|`|Yv2HVP5saa	the w124 is good old mercedes car.|`|pAYx91XJaa	professionally build. Very solid body. Good and smooth engines. Transmissions are not bad.

BsMkp3nPaa	i'm sure you must mean volts not amps because it should put out between 60 and 150amps depending on the alt. the voltage should be 13-18 volts depending on draw. if it's putting out 35 volts the voltage regulator is fried if it's internal one take the alternator back. if it's external replace the regulator.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	The internal voltage regulator is fried and probably grounding through the case and blowing the link. If it were the body computer the check engine light would come on|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	The alternator is actually capable of putting out over 100 amps if the car has rear window defroster. I don't know where you are getting the 34.9 amps at. At full field you should be getting around 15 volts at the battery. the alternator is capable of producing up to, but only,18 volts if disconnected from the battery which would harm electrical components. The blown fuse link is not related to the charging system. It is related to a component in the system that at times uses more voltage than the fuse is capable of allowing (short or too heavy a draw). A bad battery will cause a higher than normal volt reading at the battery while the engine is running but will not blow a fuse or fuse link. A bad regulator, located inside the engine controller, will either show no charge or over charge and both will turn the engine light on.|`|19d654a99e6c7a370dd79614d0c24a53aa	my guess would be the internal voltage regulator is sticking

19d7e808f705d0eb2191698f57cf4853aa	You would save the price of an oil change, that's all!<br>  Most manufacturers say that 7500 miles is OK for light driving in mild weather.|`|jieKgKF1aa	engine would be fine most new cars now recommend 15000km (9230miles) service durations on their recommended oils|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Probably nothing. Modern engine oils are a heck of a lot better than the old oil. Just remember to change the oil and filter at or near the manufacturer's recommendation in the future.|`|M2ISWWIkaa	I would say it is alright to go that long, especially if you aren't driving in dusty conditions. However, I wouldn't drive too far after 8,000 just to be safe. Your engine will always appreciate new clean oil. The important thing is to make sure you have a good oil filter, and to check your oil periodically to make sure it isn't dirty. Also, make sure the oil level is where it is supposed to be on the dip stick. Black oil is never good.. get that changed! Your oil should look a deep amber brown.|`|qWmwI9PBaa	3 months / 3,000miles is old school.  Check your owner's manual to find out exactly what they recommend.  It does not hurt anything except your wallet to change the oil "too often" tho.<br>  <br>  As for not changing it often enough, it will eventually cause a build-up of sludge in the oil jackets, preventing proper lubrication and eventually damaging the bearings.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	not really a lot of problem really its not good for any motor to go 3000 miles  with out oil change but i had a old nissan that i drove three yrs without changing oil i just added to it when it was low .. it was wreak that couldnt be fix so we used it for a offroading an dit was running ok still when we sold it|`|nlMgXhoEaa	well if you go too long your motor will seizes up and be totally useless. or when you finally do it soot would come out insted of used oil. LOL|`|tjLbXhtEaa	theoretically you are correct.But before you start doing this find a garage that will test your oil after oil changes. They will be able to tell you how long you can go between changes. The garage I used for years was a fleet/ truck garage. I was on the road all the time ( 60,000 mi/yr) I got to the point where I could go 6,000 miles between changes. Do not take my advice have you oil tested to make sure you are not doing any damage. took about three oil changes for them to get me to the 6,000 mile mark|`|F5PUol8vaa	You are probably ok. I would be more concerned about the filter than the oil. Your oil filter has a bypass valve that opens when the filter gets full of contaminants and can't filter any more. That allows unfiltered oil to circulate through the engine. If you have a good quality, high capacity filter, that will help it last longer. Most oils today can handle the extra mileage. Don't make this a habit though. A new engine is very expensive.<br>  I recommend using synthetic oil, with a high quality filter. go check out www.amsoil.com|`|JjiX0ghYaa	change oil.so long as oil is kept up should be ok.Ive seen people never change oil.and have 1000000 plus miles.now this is not recommended.and can void warranty.pay a little now or allot later.

The easiest way to check whats going on first is to check your voltage at the trim motor with your trim button pushed.

FKJaQXQLaa	Poly spacers work perfectly well with any lift.  I have 3.5 inch springs on my ZJ and use 1 inch spacers to get 4.5 inches of lift.  If you already have the longer springs that are giving you all your lift, it will be perfectly safe to put 2 inch spacers on.  It becomes unsafe when you use spacers to get most of your lift.  I would go for the 2 inch versus the 3 because your shocks will be fully extended at full flex.  It is good to have a little something left in your shocks at full suspension droop.  Just make sure that your sway bar links and brake line extensions can accommodate the extra height.  I hope that you have adjustable track bars as well, as the extra height will throw off the suspension geometry.  As for ride quality, it wont change it at all.|`|uH32skl3aa	The spacers that go beneath the springs will work. If you extend the brake lines and your drive shaft angles are not so severe that they cause vibration,  Hope you have a CV drive shaft now. To be safe you should have a dropped pitman arm and sway bar extensions.  As far as it being safe;  In 1982 they stopped making the CJ-5 because a few people with no brains were driving them like corvettes and they rolled them and sued. A brainless Judge blamed the manufacturer and they had to pay.  A jeep is made for off road as it's prime objective. Yes they can go on paved roads but you have to have brains enuff to know it can not be driven like a vett.   Have fun, good wheeling and be safe.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Spacers will not work at all with a suspension lift.  It does nothing.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	NO, do not get the spacers or install them, they are not designed with other lifts and you can easily case the spring and spacers pop out of position, and can happen even if you have to make a quick stop. A lift over 6" is not safe do to center of gravity and suspension dynamics. But if you want the is up to you I would try a body lift or try Full Throttle. They are a company that make extreme lift kits that no one else dares build and is not cheap<br>  And don't forget a good Auto insurance policy
s8cZsSX0aa	Chances are you have a light that is hitting the light detection sensors on the lights.

You can flip an SUV a lot easier.<br>  <br>  The ARE a bit light in the front end if you drive in windy or snowy areas.

I clearly recall crawling through the dirt with some kind of explosive rounds going off over my head. There is certainly significant physical training required. You will run a mile and a half every day or so, and if you are going to be on an aircrew you will experience survival training, where you will be trained to survive in situations like those that you may find if you are shot down behind enemy lines. If you do not pass, you will not complete the program.
PEN3hha7aa	Anything is doable, but the 1000 difference is something you are going to play hell getting someone to accept.  brakes, rotors and struts are not that big a deal but tranny problems are.  if it were me and i heard anything about transmission problems of any sort I would not touch it.  You have to realize that once they find out the transmission leaks they are going to look for everything they can to devalue your minivan, and they are partly right. <br>  <br>  Realize that they have to get that van back into driveable shape and it may not be cheap so they are going to make you pay that price in effect by dropping what they give you for it.  SOME dealerships will inflate the price to fix the vehicle and tell you there are probably other things wrong whether they exist or not.  Again,  all that does is lessen what you get for the vehicle and raise the amount you have to come up with.  A dealer will not budge on the price to fix your trade-in.  Besides, history says you are better off selling the car to a private owner rather than trading it in.  I would take the van to a mechanic and get a quote or two on what they want to fix it.  You need to be able to go to a dealer with verifiable repair prices so they can't dispute that part of the deal.  <br>  <br>  It is common knowledge that all dealers want to make X amount on every sale.  That amount could be represented in dollars or percentages<br>  that equate to dollars.  The fact is that they may give you what you want for your minivan but rest assured they will jack the purchase price up to make up for what they are losing on the trade-in.  Do the math, they are....<br>  <br>  I would get that transmission looked at first before you even think about going to a dealership.  You may be better off if the rest of the vehicle is sound by getting it fixed and save the rest of the money.<br>  <br>  LOL,  going to a dealership in a hurry to buy another vehicle is just like the old say that "you should never go to the grocery store when you are hungry"..  Either way, you are going to spend more than you wanted to.  Think about it...|`|O86dnuQuaa	give it a try. the most that can happen is the salesman turns you down.

You can run a CarFax check to see if there has been any evidence of odometer fraud. Does it mean the guy didn't just turn it back recently? No, but it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  You can also kind of tell by the condition of the car itself if the mileage is completely off. With only 53k on the odometer things should look pretty good. Have a mechanic check it out. They should be able to tell you if your engine looks all run down like there's a whole lot more than 53k on it.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	If it's electronic they are very hard to change as the mileage is in the memory of the ECM.

fFnsJ7maaa	If you are traveling with children, you won't have to stand. If people don't give you their seats, the conductor or car attendant will make people move. No one wants to travel with fractious kids so people will be very helpful. I've only seen the trains have standing room on holiday weekends or on commuter routes. <br>  <br>  Traveling with kids in the sleepers is great from what I've seen. The family bedroom in on the lower level, and tucked away at one end. Not many people will wander through. (Watch carefully at stops, though. There's much bustling going on, and a mobile child could slip out.) The rocking of the trains puts the kids to sleep. One parent can get up and walk around the whole train, or go hang out in the lounge car for a while. Meals are included. If the kids are mobile, they can (with a parent) explore the train. I do suggest that Mom take a nice relaxing hot shower. Maybe two. <br>  <br>  Take all the luggage you think you'll need. At some stations you can get a Red Cap to help you get everything to the train. The extra luggage storage is on the lower level, so you can get to anything you'll need. <br>  <br>  Oh -- and make sure you tip the Sleeping Car Attendant.

Here is a list of pros and cons of speed radars.  <br>  <br>  Pros:  <br>  *Speed radars help to decrease the speed by flowing traffic.  If drivers know there are radars or speed cameras present in the area, they will likely decrease their speed.  <br>  *They promote awareness.  As said if someone knows the cameras are there they will be careful of their speed.  It keeps one in tune with their driving habits. <br>  *Creates a system of responsibility.  If a driver is caught and is fined due to speeding, it causes them to keep their speed lower in the future to avoid further fines or accidents. <br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  *Chance of malfunctioning.  Man made products have their faults.  Sometimes the cameras may malfunction if  they are not kept up to date causing drivers to be falsely fined.  <br>  *Driver caught without actually speeding.  There have been instances when a driver may have been speeding but was not caught but in the process another innocent driver was fined because the flash caught the wrong vehicle.

e5a8d266043232315ad5a0064438012caa	Yea...all so far is wrong.<br>  You had it right, it's when you're hauling *** into a corner simultaneously  applying front brake and letting off the gas. You then start slowly and gradually letting of the front brake as you are already established into the corner. The idea is that since you are applying loads of braking power which is compressing the front end you don't want to just release the front brake because you would immediately uncompress the front it which is where all traction is being supplied. The result would then be a classic low side. There is a pretty good explanation supplied on youtube by a trackday school i've been to a couple of times provide below. They have a bunch of other good videos like body posture, proper corner lines, and some other good random vids.

ZBFE9AqZaa	You first have to give the output of the alternator in amperes. Then you need to give how much is the cars usual amperage draw from the radio , accessories, etc.  The alternator needs to be able to put out enough amperage to handle the total load from above.<br>  <br>  for the answer wattage = voltage (12 volts nominal from the battery and voltage regulator from the alternator) x amperage (amperage from th e alternator or battery).<br>  <br>  for the radio you need 1,000 watts/12 volts or almost 100 amps. if your alternator is not strong enough the battery will have to make up the shortage.
CFA4KG2Uaa	yeah the same exact situation happened to me and all of this stuff happened because the water pump went out.. your battery lights came on because the water pump pulley is probbably jammed up which made the belt break off or come off which connects to the alternator.. since the belt for the alternator isnt running the battery isnt charging and which made the battery light come on. and the power steering went out because the water pump connects to the power steering belt too so when you gert it replaced you are going to need both power steering and the alternator which are both related to the water pump. and the car was in a cloud of smoke because the car overheated. and possibly all the coolant sprayed out and was burning on the hot engine.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well gee guy why didn't he stop right when the light came on or when the temp spiked.  Something happened that caused the belts to come off.  There is a wide range of things that causes this but that was an easy fix but now the head is likely cracked and its time to bury another post late 80's changeover to junk BMW.<br>  <br>  If you go ahead and fix the car your not going to need a new power steering pump and alternator and maybe not a new water pump.

With a hose and a belt it was back on the road.|`|9fB4rrZgaa	Hi Jenny,<br>  <br>  Not the easiest to diagnose without seeing the vehicle. (Even with all your good info ;) )<br>  <br>  However, an educated guess would be that the waterpump bearings have failed causing it to seize and throw off the polybelt (fan belt).<br>  <br>  With no belt driving the the steering pump, coolant being pumped around the engine or alternator being rotated you would get all the symptoms above.<br>  <br>  Good luck in getting it sorted.<br>  Pyth

But drivers can speed up to get ahead of the merge traffic.<br>  <br>  Drivers who don't check there mirrors every so often to know what's coming from behind them and on their sides.<br>  <br>  Drivers who don't look far enough ahead to have time to react.<br>  <br>  Drivers who follow too closely and don't keep a safe following distance (the 2-3 second rule or more depending on reaction time of the driver).<br>  <br>  Drivers who don't slow down for bad weather (rain, fog, snow). Or drivers who drive too slow (20 mph on interstate) in rain. Drivers should only reduce their speed by 5-10 mph of speed limit on interstate and keep greater following distance (10-12 seconds) in rain. If it's a downpour, of course reduce your speed more. I've seen drivers following closely in the rain, which makes no sense to me.

ZBFE9AqZaa	Your owners manual or Toyota can answer it. If the timing belt brakes it will cause severe damage to the engine if you run it while it is broke.<br>  <br>  Talk to a Toyota mechanic, My last Honda's manual said to replace the belt at 60,000 miles. But the mechanic asked what is the majority of miles highway or city. It was highway and he said it was o.k. to wait till 90,000.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it looks like it needs changing. while your there working on it then you might as well change it then you will know your safe.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	i do not know if toyota is an interference type, but that only minimizes damage in the event of a failure. you see the thing tearing apart so yes replace it now when it is not an emergency. if it is an interference engine , this will save you allot of time and money and possibly an engine|`|jUfm3KJUaa	depends on your budget...

I have heard that on some 2005 and newer cars this has been extended to 100,000 miles. Play it safe and replace it now. It will cost a lot less to do it now than if the engine is running when it fails. This scenario will bend or break valves, chip piston domes, and possibly bend connecting rods, resulting in a destroyed engine.|`|ktMefP0oaa	If you are already there, change it, the belt is probably fine for another 50,000 miles, but three  things I always change in the front of the engine is the timing belt,or chain, the water pump, and front seal.
XhirXRkpaa	You really should hire professionals to move your piano.  At least if they damage it, they have insurance.  If you accidentally damage it,  you have no recourse.  I have a piano that I cherish dearly.  We just moved in July, and the piano traveled about 12 miles safely for only about $200.  Many companies have a minimum price that they will charge you for moving a piano because the job could take up to four guys.  I called a bunch of places.  Some of them wanted to charge as much as $1200 for the move, so be careful.  Some people quote high prices because they really don't want to do the job.|`|dqLoa5Jdaa	I would recommend a pro.  3 miles or 3000 miles away doesn't matter, 90% of damage happens moving the piano in and out of the house.  There are 3 types of pianos, which one do you have?<br>  upright/spindle-Chest high, 2 legs in front, sits against wall <br>  Baby Grand-Waist high, 3 legs, sits in corner or center of room<br>  Saloon-Similar to upright in appearance, plays reels, old finish.<br>       The first one you can tackle yourself if there are no stairs.  All you need is a 4 wheel furniture dolly.  Simply place underneath the piano in the center, you need to lift the piano straight up in the air or you could break the front legs.  These can weigh up to 400 lbs so be safe when placing the dolly, communication is always the best.  If you can place in the front center of truck and strap it, thats the best.  If not, choose the wall you'll make less turns with to destination.  Make sure you remove the dolly and blanket wrap the piano and strap it to the wall before transporting.  Load the piano with the unfinished back against the wall.  If its one of the other two you need a pro.  Both are excessivly heavy and could cause serious damage if handled or disassembled improperly.  I would have to say about 200-300 to move the upright, and about 300-500 to move the other kinds.  A moving company can do it, but remember they have a lot of costs.  The have to insure your piano, insure there men, pay there men a minimum set of hours, pay for fuel, pay for equipment.  So be very wary of a cheap mover, probably not insured or even qualified to move a piano.  If you live near chicago I can move any of the 3.
O86dnuQuaa	It's a holdover from the earliest days of gasoline sales. Back in the 1910's and 20's, gas was 2 to 4 cents per gallon, and most cars only held 10 gallons or less. A price increase of 1 cent back then affected people about the same way as a $1.00 change does today.|`|XNRcSsRWaa	its really almost 2.09 they just try to trick you with that|`|k3EObSxwaa	Give "thisiscr" 10 points, she is correct. I remember when there were no electric pumps, one would hand pump the gas into a large glass container and then let it flow into the car by gravity. I also remember when Kansas had a sales tax in "mills". 10 mills equaled one cent, and there were one mill coins. If the tax was 6 mills and you didn't have enough you gave the clerk a penny and he would give you back 4 mills. That is your history lesson for today.

fc2d0fa7c58212b70cf18f5dc42d4094aa	The Sylvannia Silverstar Ultra bulbs are whiter with a color temperature of 4100K, the Philips X-treme Power bulb has a color temperature or 3400K.  Halogen is is somewhat yellowish so Sylvannia puts a light blue coat on the Silverstar ultras to make the light whiter.  However this tint also blocks some of the light and therefore it is less bright.<br>  <br>  So the Silverstars are definitely whiter but the Philips are likely brighter but yellower. <br>  <br>  I had Silverstar Ultras and they were definitely an improvement over stock lamps and much, much whiter.  I replaced them with Toshiba HIRs and while these are not as white, they are much brighter and fill out the light pattern much better.  If your headlight uses 9005 and/or 9006 bulbs, consider getting HIRs.  They will last quite a bit longer than  the Sylvannias or the Philips.<br>  <br>  You probably will not notice a huge difference between the Sylvannia Silverstar Ultra bulbs and the Philips X-treme Power bulb in terms of brightness , you are much more likely to notice the difference in the whiteness of the light and since the difference in brightness is not very great, the whiter bulbs will likely seem brighter.<br>  <br>  So I would consider the price difference to be a major factor because neither bulb will last as long as a standard bulb and if you use them lots the life span could easily fall under a year.  (Look around the internet, there are lots of complaints about this.)<br>  <br>  If you want the whitest and brightest white possible, HIDs are the only way to go but to get set up for those could cost quite a bit but there is no comparison.  They blow any halogen out of the water.
T6y2zIO1aa	Clean the new bulb with alcohol and don't touch it with bare fingers when you replace it.|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	Make sure you have the right bulb. Check the numbers/letters. Check the connections to the bulb, as they may be corroded. But the biggest reason why headlights burn out so quickly is because people touch the bulb with their fingers. The grease on your fingers burns the bulb out due to the high heat of the halogen lamp.
72ddVB2iaa	I think the 250 Ninja should be required riding for everyone who gets their license. Learning to be fast on a relatively slow bike will make you a much better rider. If the 250 is too small for you, take a look at the SV650SF. Even though it's a 650, it is a much better bike for a new rider than a 600 Super-Sport. <br>  <br>  If you spend the time to learn the skills you need, you will always be faster than the squid who got in over his or her head and never learned how to handle their bikes.<br>  <br>  There are people who say they got "bored" of their 600 after a season of riding. All that means is that they never learned how to ride. <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to take the MSF course and get fully licensed. After you do that, go to a big multi-brand dealer and start test riding. A good dealer will let you spend time on nearly everything they have on the floor, though some will be very careful before letting the 1000s and the hypersports out without close supervision. My local dealer has a rack of helmets and leathers that are there just for test riders. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SIpnLbcMaa	Either kawasaki zx250 ninja or something else in the 250cc range or if you feel confident i would say something no higher than a 600cc bike.<br>  <br>  cc= cubic centimeters (referring to the displacement of the engine)<br>  <br>  sport bikes (street legal) usually range anywhere from 250cc to 1400cc <br>  <br>  some 600cc bikes could be:<br>  Honda CBR 600<br>  Yamaha YZF-R6<br>  Suzuki GSX-R600<br>  Kawasaki ZX-636 Ninja<br>  <br>  There are also a few 500cc bikes.<br>  <br>  I recomend buying used/pre-owned unless you are loaded and don't mind buying another bike after messing up your first bike if you drop it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|I9WjPm7Caa	Kawasaki Ninja 250, no question about it|`|i1qZER3Uaa	CBR GSXR r6 and zx6r are all bad bikes for beginners.  they are Race replica bikes, and fast as hell. lighting fast for a beginner.  and can get you in trouble just as fast.<br>  <br>  ninja 250r is the way to go.|`|r1WMBKvuaa	A used Kawasaki Ninja 250.

Can you specify the wattage (rms and peak) of the speakers? If so I can accurately tell you whether you will need an amp or not.<br>  <br>  An amp amplifies the sound (or output) produced from the cd player. In an essence it makes the sound louder and cleaner.<br>  You should not have any issues w. or w/o an amp on your battery as long as your battery and alternator are in good working condition.<br>  <br>  If you do experience signs (lights blinking,dimming, failure to start) you may need to upgrade your battery to one that has a higher cranking amp, upgrade alternator, or you can purchase a capacitor. A capacitor is like a mini battery. It will store unused energy and will release it when the amp needs it. The capacitor goes inline with the main power wire (between batt + and amp).<br>  <br>  Hope I have helped you somewhat!|`|7ObGOaPPaa	No you don't have to get an amp.<br>  an amp does just what its name implies. it amplifies music signals, making your speakers play louder and clearer. but you don't need one.<br>  <br>  as for your battery. It will only be drained if you play your music with the car off, and even if you do play your music with the car off, you'd have to be playing it for a long time to drain your battery really low. you don't need to worry about your battery unless you install a subwoofer with an amp that draws a lot of power.
RXMHqNhsaa	There really shouldn't be any tangible difference between the weight distributions of the hard and soft top - they made the hard top quite light, you see.<br>  <br>  No, the real reason why the miata has awesome handling is because, a) the chassis and suspension were engineered with some skill, but more importantly, b) the miata is VERY light. If you think about it, an overweight person is far less agile than someone who is lighter than them. Works the same way with cars.<br>  <br>  And of course, the six-speed is more refined and more fun. But I'm a bit of an enthusiast and like changing gears. If you like the 5-speed, whatever, it's not such a huge issue.
dlwkNC5maa	Your question has a lot of variables to consider:<br>  <br>  Take an edelbrock carburetor and look closely at an old Carter AFB, by the way AFB stands for aluminum four barrel. These two carbs are virtually identical. A decent street carburetor but not the best for performance standards. Then take a look at a  Holley 4 barrel. A simple design probably considered one of the easier carbs to tune and modify. However, what purpose are you using it for? Drag racing or street performance, most choose the Holley. Econmical price and simple, bolt on and go usage, I suppose most would use the Edelbrock version of the AFB although I am sure there are plenty that would say to use the Holley.<br>  <br>    One more thing to consider, if this is going on a truck that will do any off roading, I would find a good Quadrajet with an electric choke, and have it rebuilt. These carbs, while a little more difficult to set up, make excellent street and 4 wheel drive carbs as well. They have smaller primaries and larger secondaries (they are know as a spread bore carb as opposed to the other two which you are asking about, the are square bore carburetors) which allow them great part throttle driveability and economy as well. As you can see, this is not a simple answer to just throw out there but one that will most likely require more research for you to make a good decision. Whatever you decide, make sure to get a carburetor with an electric choke, Trust me, you will be happy with this decision the first cold day you have to start the car.  Good luck, MK|`|0795bf45cbd31dc5899b83be293327bdaa	edlebrocks work out of the box as do holleys but edlebrocks are not as easily tuneable as a holley.   With holley carbs you can change out almost all the parts easily and they are easily available at any parts store, edlebrocks are a little harder and the parts have to be ordered.  So with that if you have a street car that you are not going to really mess with then get an edlebrock, if you have a hot rod and are going to be constantly trying to find way to make more power go with holley|`|5xxuKzXPaa	both are great once they are set up. the problem with an untouched holley is very simple, if you back fire you blow a power valve then you are getting to much fuel. edlebrock, i do not have any information on to this point. there is a kit to keep you from blowing the power valves though.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	a holley is always going out of adjustment and is a bunch of head aches, the edelbrock is a take it out of the box and bolt it on and basically forget about it.
DydFQ0fcaa	It's pretty easy, I'll walk you through it.  Start by draining the cooling system. If your radiator has a petcock, open it and drain the coolant into a bucket or some other container.  If your radiator does not have a petcock, loosen the lower radiator hose clamp and let the fluid drain out. If it's draining really slowly, take the radiator cap off to release the vacuum pressure.<br>  <br>  While the old pump is still mounted, remove all of it's plugs and fittings.  Next, loosen and remove the fan, belts, brackets and hoses. <br>  <br>  Now you can unbolt the old water pump.  Be sure to use a scraper to clean all of the old gasket material off of the engine block (this is important). <br>  <br>  You will have to remove the fan mounting studs from the fan hub on the old water pump.  This can be done by using a pair of vise grips, stud puller socket or double nuts.  To use double nuts, put two nuts onto the stud, tighten one against the other, then using a wrench on the nut closest to the hub, twist the stud out.  One nut will lock against the other and you will twist the stud right out. <br>  <br>  Put some teflon tape onto the threads of any plug or fitting that has been removed from the water pump and screw them into the new one. Carefully place the new gasket onto the pump.<br>  <br>  Install the new pump.  Work slowly and make sure the gaskets stay in place.  Before you screw the bolts all the way down, apply some thread sealer on the threads to prevent water from seeping past and causing a drip at the bolt head.<br>  <br>  Once the new pump is in, re-install the hoses and hose clamps.  Now install the belts, pulleys, brackets and fan.  Snug the fan into place. It's a lot easier to tighten the bolts down after the belts have been adjusted to the proper tension. <br>  <br>  Once everything's back where it should be, fill the radiator with new engine coolant and start it up.   Run it for 10-15 min or until it reaches operating temperature then shut it off.  Go back under the hood and check for leaks.  If everything looks good, you're done!|`|QiEv6YqJaa	Like the first poster said, you should spend a couple bucks and get a manual.

The engine has to be under load.  I have in the past put a brick on a gas petal and walked away,  The only thing that happens is it runs out of gas.  The drive to reverse works ok BUT the car can usually still go after one way or the other. What you really want to do is just beat the body up its all sorts of fun.  Last one I trashed was a 93 740 it was a nice car nothing wrong with it but a bent and ripped up drivers seat. looked good too.<br>  <br>  Oh on don't forget to yank the SRS and ABS computer plugs for added fun..|`|H8XpaaPDaa	you can't really throw a car into reverse while moving ON NEWER cars. the car's computer won't allow it to shift. but apparantly you can do that on older cars like from the 70's.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol why not slamm on the brakes at highway speed while turning?<br>  <br>  or go really fast over speed bumps!!! or go really fast over the bumps where rail way tracks meet the road...i swear you'll be guaranteed's to get air bourne!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  don't forgot to put all this on youtube!!!|`|aa9gieAIaa	best way to kill your engine is to run it out of oil. best way to kill your suspension often is to hit curbs while turning. (i know all about both) taking off hard from every stop is hard on your clutch and trany though some cars have better tranys than others. another good way to ensure spectacular engine failure is to put some diesel in the gas and inject unreasonable amounts of nitrous oxide under open throttle.(knock knock bang!) to keep it alive change your oil/filter keep it in good tune plugs coolent etc. and use good oil. oil is not created equal, some is worth nothing some is worth far more than the list price. i use ashland(valvoline) oil and mobil one synthetic for my car and most small engines and for all out race stuff i use race oil. never use garbage oil if you want you engine to last. i change oil at say 5k mile intervals for engines that are fresh and easy on oil and 1k to 3k mile intervals for worn engines. you cannot change it too often though. sorry to lecture but this cannot be over-stressed!|`|AH5LVBFpaa	Change your oil at least every 2,500 miles, regardless of what the owner's manual says or the oil companies recommendation.|`|J6J8nh96aa	if ur wanting to mess up your car just go about 65 to 75 mph in drop it in frist put if u want to take care of it just do normal maintance

Hah|`|AH5LVBFpaa	This is just my opinion of course, but I own a Jetta TDI and get about 42 mpg (diesel) with good power and it is a very solid car.  I have owned it for about 6 months but love it.<br>  <br>  Also, if you ever have the need to pull a trailer, the TDI is capable of pulling 1,500 lbs.  If you like to go camping or otherwise would like to have that capability, this is the only economy (35+ MPG) car I could find to do that.|`|RXMHqNhsaa	Honda Accord I reckon.

It's to override your automatic transmission. For instance, if you were going up a hill your automatic transmission doesn't respond to the incline where as you can take over and compensate for the sluggish response, which could save gas and strain on your engine. It's mostly just a control preference that some people enjoy having.|`|0795bf45cbd31dc5899b83be293327bdaa	some people like to have the manual feel without having to use a clucth.  Also those engines make alot of power in the top end of the rpm spectrum, and to use all the available power sometimes you have to shift alot later and that gives you the option to run through the gears.|`|EuiWiIaDaa	Im going with Gem in the lotus or something like that...also it is to make it more sportier in order to get it into higher RPMs which is where 90% of cars get their peak horsepower. Also, your car cant see corners where you could stay in the same gear, going in at high revs, and coming out in mid range.|`|7zZCCxC5aa	that's for people who like driving sticks. it'll also make the engine sound really powerful. manuals are fun to drive. it's all personal preference. a lot of cars are doing that now.|`|Z7HHGz7Raa	some people like being able to shift gears because it is more gas efficient. being able to do it without using a clutch and having the car do it for you is easier and people are lazy so they're willing to pay for it.|`|oY7v3qTJaa	cause a comes before b. duh genius!
YjpCbc9daa	160 hp is the horsepower of an average economy car, like the tC and Camry (same engine). However, 160 hp is good for the tC's price, as the R18 Civic (its direct competitor) puts out 140hp. <br>  <br>  Seriously, it's nothing to brag about though, as many other cars will have more horsepower than you. Ex. All BMW's are more powerful that your car. My Civic Si's K20 engine puts out 197bhp as claimed by Honda, and usually, I would say 200hp would be the average of all the cars (including SUVs, pickups, etc.)|`|KizSQWrxaa	Nothing really to brag about. Ill start braging if its 300 hp or over.|`|0795bf45cbd31dc5899b83be293327bdaa	that is about the stock rating for a scion nothing really to brag about|`|AA11745513	It's nothing I would brag about. 400 hp is lol. 160 hp is about average for most I-4 engines now a days and those cars are made to be economy cars.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	its good enough to get you around and to keep up with traffic|`|nJNsM9efaa	No, it's not something to brag about.  Completely average those cars have a sporty "look" though and are pretty solid.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	It's average in today's world-perfectly fine but nothing at all to brag about.|`|GrYhFNMdaa	No that's around average for a regular car. Mine has 250 hp and i don't brag about it. Still not that much i think|`|jnCuYQ3Baa	If you plan on racing then haha no. <br>  But otherwise its fine for getting where you need to be.
addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	According to any car magazine or car tv show you read or watch, Chevy is the best truck.<br>  <br>  But the Ford F150 still sells better because it came out first.<br>  Same with the Mustang and Camaro. The Camaro was always more powerful, quicker, faster, but Ford always sold more Mustangs than Chevy sold Camaro's because the Mustang came out in 1965 and the Camaro came out later in 1967.|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I would suggest taking a trip to your local library and spending a little time going through some back issues of the consumer reports to see how they rated the different models for what you are considering. Then, take a look online to see if there is any updated information as far as safety.<br>  <br>  Finally, the last thing to keep in consideration is Ford is the only company that didn't need to rely on a goverment bailout, which means they must be doing something right.<br>  <br>  By the way, I drive a 2005 Saturn Vue and I love my car.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps answer your question.|`|POJNnWhDaa	Both are good.. I like Fords, but I worked for GM for 8 years, so I'd drive either one. I'd walk before I drove a toyota or nissan.<br>  <br>  Both of the current GM and Ford trucks won motor trend truck of the year when they were newly released. Honestly I think they are about equal; tough, good looking, well built. I think Ford's is a bit newer, so it has some newer, better options.|`|SiaWY5n2aa	chevy all the way. but the best trucks out there are actually the foreign ones. toyota makes one hell of a truck|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	gas ford<br>  diesel dodge cummings|`|AA10511536	The are both good. However, here are some differences. The Chevy is a little plusher inside, better ergonomics. The Chevy also gets about one to two real world mpg better on gas economy. Thirdly, the Chevy has an outstanding (newer models) locking rear differential. I have one in my 2007 two wheel drive,and have never been stuck, plus, I've pulled out a Dodge truck with my truck and trailer attached out of the sand in the desert, also, pulled out a Toyota Tundra out of a mud hole in the desert as well. <br>  As to the Ford, they are durable, and generally less expensive than the Chevy. Plus I think you have a greater choice of options with the Ford. Last but not least, I traded in my Toyota Tacoma for the Chevy, for a couple of reasons --size, and the Tacoma's "indestructable bed" was destructable.|`|MekUlyGpaa	there is no question about that ford is junk <br>  chevy trucks are the best <br>  there is a reason that people say <br>  Found <br>  On<br>  Road <br>  Dead <br>  on a quiet night in the country you can hear a ford rust<br>  i would rather push a chevy than drive a ford|`|nJNsM9efaa	I like Fords, not to mention financially their company is doing better which could mean the new trucks are better.|`|AA11264416	chevy, everybody says that ford is the best selling truck which might be true but that don't mean anything, personally i see more chevy trucks on the road than ford or dodges, but i'd rather drive a chevy, ford or dodge than even be in the driver seat of an import

RWjvcCYoaa	Anyone who tells you you'll get a loan isn't in the car business. They don't have a clue as to how difficult it is to get approved today. The truth of the matter is you won't get approved. Not by a prime or subprime lender. <br>  <br>  You have no credit history. That makes you too high a risk. Lenders have no idea how reliable you'll be in making your payments since you haven't established that yet. And if you're not making a minimum of $2,000/mth, you'll get turned down for that too. <br>  <br>  No matter how much you put down, it won't help you at all since you have no history of making payments. No lender will take a chance on you. The only way you might possibly get a car is at a buy here/pay here lot, which I don't recommend. Their cars are crap and they can charge up to 99.9% APR. That means a $5,000 car will end up costing you $25,000 after you're done paying for it! And it's very doubtful it will still be running then.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Buy a cheaper car for the money you have now.

AA11032586	I just acquired a 1986 GMC Sierra 1500, SWB with factory air, 1 owner with 37,000 actual miles. I rebuilt a 1984 Massey Ferguson tractor and for payment, he signed the title over to me for 19 hours of my labor. I have an awesome truck to work with.

sCqdisvnaa	Not so much an off-road vehicle as a soft-roader or cross-over, the X3 is optimised for on-road rather than off-road travel, although it's surprisingly competent in limited off-road use.<br>  <br>  The handling is very car-like, well damped and with the typical BMW precision and feedback.  The ride tends to be on the firm side, and the interior materials are arguably inferior to some of the competition.  It's definitely on the compact side, less roomy (and luxurious) than something like a Lexus RX350 that sells at a similar price (although it arguably drives better).<br>  <br>  The car is not actually assembled by BMW but by Magna-Styer in Austria, but reports of its reliability seem to indicate no major issues.<br>  <br>  My personal choice would be a 3-series wagon, but if you like the BMW driver-orientated virtues, and want this sort of vehicle, you will enjoy the X3.|`|9fB4rrZgaa	Hi Moviefreak,<br>  <br>  I have driven a fair few in my time, all different models and engines.<br>  <br>  If I am honest they are not the best looking cars in the world and they have been criticised for the lower than normal ground clearance for off roading.<br>  <br>  However, I have been to an off road course in one and I think they are amazing. In addition to that the handling really has to be experienced to be believed. They never feel as if they are 4X4 models, more like sporty saloons. <br>  <br>  This is due to the X Drive Technology which distributes the power as required to each wheel.<br>  <br>  The 3 litre petrol is something else trust me.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to get a test drive, see it for yourself. As with buying any car, a lot depends on what you want it for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, Pyth

NdlgA13Kaa	follow what i tell you take the sub out push it down a lil with your thumbs if you feel and hear a grinding noise that means that while you had it hooked up to the amp it messed the sub up the sub shouldnt be able to touch the coils if so change the speakers hook them up and bump that system|`|oU3MKR1Xaa	It sounds like you may have the subs wired for the wrong ohms rating. Rockford Fosgate P1's are single voice coil 4 ohms if im not mistaken? All sony amps are only stable at 2 ohms so the subs will have to be wired down.<br>  <br>  You should have the subs wired in a way that the pos. of one sub is connected to the pos. of the other sub. From this other sub the wire will run to the pos. terminal on the amp. The neg. is the same. Run wire from neg. terminal on one sub to neg on other. Then run wire from the connected subs to the neg. terminal on the amp. This means the subs are wired parallel and should be stable at 2ohms.<br>  <br>  Check this and make sure the subs are wired in this way. If they are and the problem persists make sure that you have a good ground. The ground cable should be no longer than 3ft. It should be grounded to a clean metal surface. Seat bolts work well or any other bolt that connects to the frame. <br>  <br>  If this also does not correct the problem. Check your rcas going into the amp to make sure that they are not crossed up (in amp output) also check for this on the back of the head unit.<br>  <br>  This should correct your problem if not possible something to do with the amps internals. <br>  <br>  Hope I have helped!|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	check your wiring to your subs better and then check the subs, one of them might be shorted internally.|`|7ObGOaPPaa	how do you have your subs wired to the amp? if you have them bridged to the amp at a 2 ohm load then that is probably why it is going into protect mode, because most amps can't handle a load lower than 4 ohms when bridged.
oU3MKR1Xaa	Yes they can work. Are they single voice coil or dual voice coil? What is the ohms stable rating of your amp?<br>  <br>  You will have to wire the 2ohm sub parallel and run the 4ohm sub in series to drop it down to 2ohms. 2ohms is the common stability rating of most stereo grade amps. <br>  <br>  A good subwoofer wiring diagram is available at www.the12volt.com<br>  <br>  Hope I have helped. Happy Bumping!|`|7ObGOaPPaa	yes it can work. you will just end up with a not so normal final ohm load when you wire them together. whther they can be bridged or not depends on what ohm load your amp can handle bridged, and how many voice coils your subwoofers have. so we need more information in order to better help resolve your issue.
TdrgZwnoaa	If the person that opened the door is of legal age then he/she is at fault. If the person is a minor then the driver would most likely be liable for allowing the door to be opened in a driving lane.<br>   The cyclist, however, should not have been sharing the lane with the car and must bear part of the responsibility for the accident.|`|AA11264416	well seeing that your not supposed to open a door let alone get out at an intersection or stop sign then its really the passengers fault for not looking first before opening the door, but the driver can be liable because technically the driver is responsible for anything done in or with the vehicle, how was the cyclist supposed to know the passenger door was going to open while in the road|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I would think the driver and passenger would be at fault. But then again, aren't bicyclists suppose to go with the traffic and not pass cars on the right side? The bicyclist should have been stopped behind cars at the red light, if going straight. If the bicyclist was planning to turn left at the intersection ahead, then they're allowed to use the crosswalk I think.<br>  <br>  So, I think it could be the bicyclist's fault for illegal passing. They have to follow the rules of the road just like cars do. Cars can't pass on the right shoulder.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Your passenger should exercise care in that he or she should have checked to make sure that it was ok. In MA, they want to make it a law where the person getting out the car needs to make sure that it's safe to do so. <br>  <br>  My world - everyone needs to pay attention and take nothing for granted. The cyclist should have erred on the side of caution. The passenger should have looked first. Clearly that did not happen.<br>  <br>  The passenger was wrong. If you are going to get out at an intersection - still in traffic - then you have to be extra careful for bicyclists. Hello. It's common sense. But accidents happen. <br>  <br>  I hope it turns out well. I feel for the parties involved. What a tough and horrible situation.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Where did he stop the car? It sounds like he was still in the driving lane. If he wasn't pulled over to the side of the road then he's at fault. <br>  Also the person opening the door is supposed to look for cars or bicycles coming from behind. So it could be both of them (driver for not parking the car correctly, passenger for opening door without looking).<br>  <br>  Anyway, my guess is that this is the driver and/or the passengers fault, not the bicyclist at all?|`|AA12103453	Driver is at fault, you are responsible for your passengers.

You pull in to a parking lot to get out, even if the person is being dropped off and the driver isn't getting out.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	the bicyclist is not at fault if he was riding on the side of the road <br>  <br>  he can go here, the passenger should not attempt to exit the car at a red light, and must wait until the car pulls into a parking spot next to the curb. And if a passenger must exit, he should look to his right before opening the door.he has acted with neglect.<br>  <br>  the bicyclist can and will sue the car owners insurance company and win. the driver of the car is responsible BUT  not in this case because there is no way to stop a passenger from exiting at his/her will.|`|TrgbEjXoaa	Depending on where you are, it's not very likely that the driver will be held liable.  Bicyclists like car drivers have to watch where they are going.  By the same token, however, was your friend using a turn signal showing he was indicating where she was stopping.  Were his brake signals working?  Was he in a designated and marked stopping area?|`|AA10132629	"sgold" is correct but the biker was also in the wrong because he passed the car instead of staying behind you and following the rules of the road.

DgCPMYpmaa	WTH? He wants to do it himself but he's asking a question like how much pipe does he need? Jack the car up and map out what you're going to need. I sware a car's exhaust is like Quantum Physics for you to understand. To bend pipes you use a crimp bender or preferably a mandrel bender, if you don't have access to one of those then I guess you can't do a custom exhaust. Make it straight pipes (no muffler) if you want it loud. Just leave the downpipe alone since you don't want to make your own and weld the bungs on for the o2 sensor and mess with the cat.

HWlgjocBaa	do not tell them that you are paying in cash until the final price is determined. and after you test drive it, tell them that you really love the car, (if you do) and offer a really low price. if it's a 10,000 car (dealer price), offer 6500. they will be like no way! and go and talk to their manager and come back with "we can go down to 9800 but that is as low as we can go" and just act like you are very busy, and have others to go see, and act like you dont need to waste your time there dealing with this fool. tell them "ok, i can do 7300, but i cannot go any higher than that" and this will continue for awhile until you get down to a price you like. if they can't go down enough, then get out of there. there are dealers out there who NEED to sell cars, and they are desperate. you just gotta find them<br>  Good Luck!!|`|HE23qtamaa	I think it's really tricky, but the first thing you need to do is be knowledgeable about the cars you're looking at. Know what features came standard (so the dealer can't try to convince you that this car is worth more because it was some "added" feature that was actually standard on that make/model etc). Also, know the KRB values, and how much mileage would be considered normal or high or low.<br>  <br>  Once you find a car you like, ask the dealer straight away what the best price he can do for you if you pay cash. Then, just haggle a bit to see if he'll drop anymore. I've heard of people getting 10-15% off, but it depends on the vehicle and the dealer. If it's a really popular car that is in demand, you might have less luck bargaining. But it's worth a try. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uuvachYZaa	Check the value of the car - www.kbb.com<br>  If it is poor condition, expect to pay extra for repairs so keep that in mind. <br>  You need to be set in your offer, offer them $500 - $1000 less than blue book value, tell them you can have cash the same day (or soon) and go up from there if you have to.

AA10274130	Well, It could be many things, but my first thought was about when it dropped.  The backing plate/dust cover could have been bent sufficiently to be rubbing the drum or rotor.  There's possibility 1.  #2, low air pressure will cause a tire to make a MILD squeal, but not too loud.  However, if you didn't get the lug nuts tightened properly AND it has low pressure, the wheel will squeal on the hub.  Possibility #3 would be the drop damaged a wheel bearing, but that isn't likely.  so, in any case, pull in to a qualified tire dealer and have them look at it.  A noise like that shouldn't be overlooked.

I have a 95 GSX that I put over 150k on the original 7-bolt engine without it showing a hint of crankwalk. Keeping any car well-maintained is key. Talk about unreliable: The GM 3.X V6 is probably one of the most trouble-prone engines out there. Intake manifold gasket failure, anyone? <br>  <br>  Anyway, if you decide to go with a DSM, you'll have to figure out which generation you want. 1st and 2nd generation DSM's have the most aftermarket support and the turbo and/or AWD models are great platforms for drag racing and auto-cross. The 2g non-turbo/FWD cars use the Chrysler 420a engine and still have a great aftermarket, but are generally less performance-endowed. They're still great, reliable cars, however. Any of the 2000+ cars are not considered DSM's, but still have a good aftermarket following, but not so much in the performance sector. These cars are generally harder to modify and tune without running into issues with the computers and such. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a sporty car that's dirt cheap and can be modified to perform better than the majority of the cars out there, look for a 1st generation (90-94) turbo FWD Eclipse, Talon, or Laser. You can buy one for less than $1500, and for another $1500, you can be running 13 second timeslips at the dragstrip, assuming the car is well-maintained.|`|Q4DNMw1aaa	Ide go with eclipse because there are no limits to what you can put on them like bodykits. plus better gas miliage.

Reason I ask, is a similar event happened to a friend of mine in their dinghy and outboard.<br>  They managed to row back to their sailboat, get the dinghy up in the davits and eventually got back to their slip.<br>  He took the engine to an outboard dealer for repair and wouldn't you know it?  They sold him a brand new outboard.<br>  When I met him for lunch a few days later he told me about his accident, the "whole lower unit was busted", etc. I askd him where the motor was and he said in the back of his truck. After lunch, we went to look at it. I picked up the lower end and spun the propeller around. It whirled like an airplane's prop.  I told him what I thought had happened and he couldn't believe me. He said he'd find out for sure and let me know.<br>  A day or so later he called me to tell me my guess had been right, after all.  He had gotten too close to the breakwater and the prop had hit a submerged rock. The shear pin had broken, as it is suppose to, so the propeller was just spinning on the shaft. Generally, shear pins cost around fifty cents and take maybe 10-15 minutes to change out.<br>  IMHO, I certainly don't know what happened in your case but is it at all possible that something like this might have or could have occurred?<br>  By the way, my friend repaired his old outboard and let's his son use it on his old fishing boat now.

kRbkiPvnaa	when I was in School we did an experiment in shop class to test the theory that placing a battery on concrete would make it go bad. We placed one battery on wood, the other on concrete, there was no difference after a month so we proved the theory wrong.

w6LbjqrQaa	If you researched your can a little bit more then you would find that the HX is the fuel efficiency model that came with vtec-e, the form that takes away fuel in order to get better mpg's.  That aside though what you could do is get a d16y8 cylinder head and ecu which will give you more power through normal vtec as well as a small bump up in compression. From this base of parts the standard fare of I/H/E will work for you<br>  <br>   I wouldn't bother though because the HX is a great fuel milage car, keep it that way and laugh at all the SUV's at the gas stations.

lhhgXNxRaa	Yes, they may, in their used car lot of course. But there is no guarantee that they will have all model and year. Dealers sell their used rental cars (which is usually newer models) and whatever the traded-in vehicles they have, so you may see non-Honda vehicles also. Since dealership has higher storage cost, they may not sell the older cars since they consider them as harder to sell, less desirable or carrying lower profit. I think 1995-1998 Civic is probably difficult to find at dealers, but you can try.<br>  A friend of mine even found a used Honda Civic in a Ford dealership, so it all depends on their traded-in stocks.<br>  Your better bet will be used car lots, CarMax, or other used car dealers.|`|42b68e89556dc280a2061994ea854c1aaa	It will be harder to find these older models for several reasons.

The people there should be able to tell you which ones will work best for you. You may have to get them professionally painted if you want a certain color, like the factory color. Check with the parts counter at the dealership too, they probably have an accesory book right there on the counter full of things that you know will fit your truck.
