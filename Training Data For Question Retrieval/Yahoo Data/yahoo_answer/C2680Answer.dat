YzXuJOqUaa	Sounds pretty normal to me.  I've had cats all my life and it just sounds like your cat is shy in personality. :)  With the scratching thing, my cats often do that to the floor, I don't think it means anything though.|`|435c271Kaa	Cats are independent weird creatures to begin with. None of these things are abnormal, my cats also scratch the floor before and after eating.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Sounds like you just got the cat and its still trying to adjust. So stop introducing things to the cat to stress it out.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Were you the first person to have Kitty? Because it sounds like she might have been abused. As for the vacuum and radio, cats don't like loud noises. The scratching I don't know about. The only scratching my cats do like that is around their litterbox.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	She might just be a spaz. I had a cat that was a completely spaz, I actually think she had some form of Kitty Autism. She would get up on your lap but if you moved or even moved your eyes, she would take off. Other times she'd be perfectly fine and snuggle up to you. She drewled like a dog and wanted to suck on everything! And everything freaked her out. She just disappeared one day. We live in the country so there's no telling. But we had her from a little baby and she wasn't abused, just mental! So it's possible!
4SrdYUuSaa	Dear Arenitaines,    I moved 2 years ago with 2 cats, so I feel your initial anxiety -- but this worked for me.    I moved a "kitty condo" in an upstairs bathroom of my home the day before the movers arrived with one of their soft, covered cat beds (looks like a little, washable cave).  In this condo, I had a bowl of water and food.  The litter box was placed on the other side of the bathroom, farthest point from the bed/food condo.    The morning of the move, prior to the arrival of the movers, I moved the cats to the condo and bathroom.  The cats stayed there most of the day, until everyone left and my (theirs too) furniture was placed.  Their traditional booda (litter) boxes were already in place.    At the end of this day, I opened the bathroom door to let them explore naturally.   Within an hour, they found their kitchen feeding spot and shortly thereafter, they discovered where the litter box was (their former litter box from the former residence.)    Letting the cat "track her own way" to find the favorite furniture pieces, litter box, food supply, will make her more accepting of the new place and her adaptation so much smoother.    Good luck to you and your family.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	We moved with our cat once he was an adult and then we added a dog 2 months later! Talk about having his tail out of joint! When we first moved in, we had him sleeping in our room for a bit and made sure that we did his favorite things with him every day. We also put a couple of litter boxes in different spots to let him pick which one he wanted to use. Honestly, it wasn't as bad as we thought that it would be. He walked around meowing and sniffing everything for a couple of days, but he settled in. I think that it helps if you have a familiar piece of furniture for her to sleep on and give her a bit of extra attention.|`|AA12071655	I dont' think a cat has any real concept of what it means to be robbed.    Just take her to the new house and let her roam. Show her where her food, water and litter box are located. She'll sort it out on her own.|`|GtaOjaYcaa	DONT|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Keep her in one room. like a bathroom.  Let her acclimate for a few days and one day keep the door open for her to investigate the new home.|`|RqlPSyrzaa	I agree with everyone who said to keep her in one samll room for a bit. A bathroom maybe. It just reduced the number of stressors. After a maybe a day or tow, depening on how she seems, open the door for her to explore, but don't force her out of the room. Let her do it on her own time. And who knows, she may run out of the bathroom on her own before that. She'll adjust, it'll just take time. The best thing you can do is not worry about it, because she'll pick up on that. Best of luck.   -Walter(http://thethingspetsdo-wc.blogspot.com/)|`|zBhwEbUkaa	I just recently moved with my two adult cats, and the thing that worked out well was to lock them in one room with their cat tower, litter box, and food and water. Once we had all the furniture arranged and were done bringing stuff in, my husband and I carried them through the house and put them back in their room, only with the door open. From there, we let them explore at their own pace. Good luck.|`|6PsBG6vKaa	I just got a new cat myself.  Put her in one room in the new house with her litter box, food & water, and some toys. Let her get used to the new space a little bit at a time.  Eventually, she'll be right at home in your new surroundings.|`|9KANw3tBaa	GIve her some yummy cat food, and let her explore on her own.

AA10986942	Where in the world are you guys getting appaloosa?????  Do you see any mottled skin around her muzzle or any spots??  Horses are perfectly able to with stand winters with the coat that god gave them!  If they are well fed, have a layer of fat and a nice dry wooly coat they dont need a blanket.  A lot of them do not like blankets.    I think you have a beautiful dappled gray horse and if your aunt has breeding stock papers that means you have a paint.|`|vow5ULxTaa	definitly i nthe winter photos looks like a QH but with height may have some welsh in here and the head in the second photo suggest a mustang or nakota mixture definityly some spanish blood though.|`|8OJZYB3Taa	weel the first pictures she looks like a quarter horse maybe appaloosa but in the lats one or 2nd to last one her head reminds me of a arab lol|`|GB8fSTw8aa	Arabian, she is|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I'm going to have to say dapple QH/Arabian cross and the black one is either another QH/ARABIAN OR A ARAB/MORGAN OR A ARAB/STANDERDBRED OR A QH/MORGAN the second one is a bit more difficult.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	Your photos show a stock horse of some sort - looking like a Quarter horse.  But your comment about your aunt having breeding stock papers saying she is some kinda Paint is the answer.  Obviously, if your aunt has papers, then she is a Paint. There are two types of divisions in the Paint association, there are the horses with enough white which are in the regular division - they can be overos, tobianos or toveros.  Then there are the 30% of foals born into APHA which don't have enough white to qualify, these used to be called "Breeding stock" Paints. Now they have changed the name to "Solid Paint Breds". If your aunt's mare has papers to APHA, then she is obviously a solid Paint. Paints can come in a huge variety of colours, including grey. Yes, it is true that some Paint people try to avoid grey because as the horse matures and turns whiter, the white marks disappear. On the other hand, grey is a popular colour with many horsemen, so there are others who breed for the colour.  Basically a Paint is just a coloured Quarter horse,or Quarter horse/Thoroughbred cross. You can have quite a big variety of sizes and appearances. I could show you 17 hh Quarter horses who look exactly like a full-blood Thoroughbred, and I can show you 14.2hh Quarter horses that look more like mustangs.|`|AA11625368	Dapple grey QH grade?|`|TSQxwlbraa	Very pretty Horses :)  I think they should have blankets though..|`|iz03uvV4aa	This horse is most likley definatley NOT appy.   My guess is a Quarter Pony or QH cross - appendix maybe?  Its always hard to tell just by photos and you will really never know. The good news is she is REALLY cute~!!!|`|cSqx1DxKaa	She's pretty but the last photo where they're leaning over barbed wire is scaring the s*** out of me.      She looks like a QH or a QH cross to me.  She appears to be pretty stocky, but the photos make it a bit hard.|`|y1WSAb47aa	looks like QH to me|`|QpElKY8Kaa	The dapple grey mare is intriguing.  Beautiful head, very nice throatlatch and neck.  Neck is a bit short but forgivably so in light of the shape.  Her body looks stocky, Quarter horse-y.    The 'breeding stock paint' is questionable.  Paint is a high color horse, to breed grey, a color killer, into to it doesn't make a lot of sense. If foaled with color, the greying gene will wipe it out.   This mare doesn't exhibit any bi-color pattern, she was born solid.    Her head is refined, almost a classic Iberian profile.  I lean to the probability of Mustang in her line, or, maybe Arab somewhere.  Anyway, she's nice.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	She looks just like a horse at my barn, she appears to be  part percheron and has a kinda arabian face, I'm not really an expert on breeds but that is my guess.    Hey if I'm wrong your no worse off than you started right. lol lol lol|`|3YHZUuhyaa	she looks like a dapple grey quarter horse. she's soo pretty! i want her!|`|1O3q5T5Paa	appoloosa, :) she is very cute. looks like she may have paint or QH horse in her:)|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Not a paint and DEFINATLY not an appaloosa.

enC9TvxUaa	-Sounds like heart/lung problems.  Need to see the vet so he can take care of the dog in it's later years.|`|AA11625368	You should see your vet. Heavy breathing, weakness, & cyanosis can be a symptom of many different ailments. The biggest concern in the elderly dog in congestive heart failure. There are many meds that can be given to help stop the progression of heart failure. Good luck!|`|D1beU6MPaa	I would have taken him to the vet immediately. Last thursday morning my fifteen-year-old Cocker Spaniel was fine. That night, we knew something was terribly wrong. Friday morning he was at the vet when they opened. They took x-rays and found a large tumor attached to his pancreas. There was nothing they could do, so we had him euthanized. It hurt us terribly, but we would never let any of our dogs suffer. Your dog needs to be seen by the vet and evaluated to determine what caused this. I seriously doubt it was a freak incident. Something caused it and you need to find out what. Good luck|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	could be something serious like congestive heart failure which can cause the difficulty breathing.  Your dogs needs immediate Vet care.  If if is CHF then it may be able to be treated with medication.|`|AA11244754	the only way to know is to take him to the vet.  You have to remember that for a dog to make it to 16 is remarkable but he is a really old dog.  You probably should have taken him to the vet when he had his first episode to find out then and be greatful that he just lived through it.  As much as you dont' want to face it,  it may be time to let him go.  He has been your loyal companion for nearly 16 years of his life and this maybe his way of saying his work is done here and that he needs a rest.|`|31rOMrMWaa	well he is old i suggest you take him to the vet. but i hate to say but i suspect we wont live to long cause that is a very old age of course if its a smaller dog then maybe he will have a bit longer.
sUN7TVtzaa	the heat mat should be big enough to fit under half the cage or heat light between 60-70 watt  *substrate-sand,paper,paper towel,ect  *2-3 hides(include a moist humid one)  *cacium  *crickets(completly nessecary diet, feed regularly!)  *mealworms,super worms,or wax worms  *carry cage for Leopard gecko and one for crickets  *a book or lots of info on leos  optional things  * drift wood  *plants    a site that will help you  http://leopardgecko.com  http://leopardgeckopunk.com    good luck|`|GZ0sh4pmaa	Well first you'll need:  10 g tank minimum  paper towel or reptile carpet  a hiding place (wood for misting)  heatlamp and light bulb(it depends on the size of the tank i have a 18g so i use a watt of 150 for a ten id say about 80-90 watt)  undertank heater (the kind at the stores ive been dint have temperature adjusters, but they did have ones specific for desert lizards look for those it should cover 1/3 - 1/2 ur tank)  water dish  calcium powder (to sprinkle on crickets)  2 DIGITAL thermometers (1 hot side 1 cool side)  crickets  food to feed crickets  spray bottle.    TIPS: they dont mind being handled if u get them used to it by holding them once a day for 10 mins. but wait atleast 5 days for them to adapt before touching them once uve bought it. i personally think leopard geckos are great pets. keep in mind there nocturnal so if u want to watch it all day theres not much gonna be going on. and try not wake them up during the day. but they are very active during early mourning and late at night. i feed mine late at night so its like waking up for breakfast. give her energy for the night. good luck!|`|CdRlOsnyaa	for a heating pad get a 30-40 gallon heating pad there cost 28.99 ususally. go for a 50 wat reptile light zilla infared for night time works really god and it cost lie 45 dollars get a good uva-uvb 60 watt light bulb for the day. make sure to get him a good hiding place and you can get a rock that shakes and inside you put crickets its really fun to watch them eat with that|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	1.water dish  2.some type of substrate  3.two hides  4.calcium supplement  5.some plants (not necessary but they make the tank look nicer)  6.some crickets and worms  7.ceramic heater (75 watt works good for leos)  8.two thermometers and a humidity gage  9.feeding tongs  10.somewhere to keep your crickets and worms (plastic containers or glass jars work great)     this should be fine for the leopard gecko and good luck!    http://www.leopardgecko.com/emcare.html- check out this site.it's very informative|`|h4xcrlUuaa	not sure about the watt but someone at the pet store should be able to tell you. the heating pad needs to be able to cover at least half of the tank. (hot side and cold side). you need a hide, and also a humid hide(which is easily made). water dish and calcium dish. you will need calcium.spray bottle. humid and te,p gages. then you will also need a cricket keeper(makes it alot easier). for substrate use carpet, paper towels, or newspaper. NOT SAND. thats pretty much it. then there is also decorative stuff which my geckos like to crawl over.
enC9TvxUaa	-What about the best of BOTH worlds.  Let the breeder do it, but you visit on a very regular basis!  This would help him understand you are his new family when it dcomes time to go home with you, but he will not see you as juts a provider of food.  The local bird store here requires regular visits if they sell you a younger bird before it is wheened- GREAT technique!|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	If you do not have experience hand feeding birds I would let the breeder do it but ask if you can come over to sit in on the feeding sessions. It will help you develop the bond you are looking for by being there and you can learn how it is done so you can do it next time you want to get a baby bird.     Good luck!|`|wF52XMxAaa	Hand feeding won't result in any better bond, and parrots are quite capable of rejecting the person who fed them in favor of someone else. It does eliminate that awkward period when you have an active but not bonded bird.  It's your call whether that's worth the extra effort and risk (and you do risk injuring or even killing the baby).  see http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa0...    If your breeder is local and willing, you could just visit and establish a bond with the bird before you bring it home.  You can even do that with adult birds.|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	This is what is involved in hand feeding a baby bird; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0RO5L1ne...    If you don't have experience hand feeding, and no professional has showed you how to do it safely and properly, you can literally kill the baby bird if you do it wrong. It's very unsage to do if you are not thoroughly educated in how to go about it.     Weaned birds will bond to you, too. Hand feeding creates what is called "the baby bond" where they are "bonded" to you because they know you are where they receive their food so they come to you to get it. But a weaned bird can be the same way if you were to feed them their diet from your hand every day, or make sure to train with them a lot to where they learn to enjoy your company because of the treats they get to earn. All animals enjoy working for their food (that is why they forage in the wild) so you will still have a good bird even if it's weaned.
wipJ9OE7aa	I think that you need to keep them both, you need to go down to the basement and get the other cat, in fact I'll come over and get him/her out of the basement for you and bring him upstairs. Just kidding. Since you've stated that they've been together I think that you should just keep them together. Maybe he/she's comfortable down there. What kind of basement do you have? Is it large? Maybe he/she likes it down there. Don't get rid of them. Make a trail of food up the stairs and maybe he'll come up. He just needs to get comfortable again.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	The peeing could have been behavioral but you should have had the cat's urine tested the first time it did that to rule out UTI's!  Be responsible,  Too many animals are destroyed because of a lack of committment by "pet owners".|`|QnJvJ67uaa	If your vet has rules out a UTI why not try to re-home him yourself ?? He would probably be happier with his friend as well but you would not want to run the risk of the clean cat being put to sleep.  Its cruel to keep him shut away like that and he would most likely be better off somewhere else...but do get him checked over by the vet before you make any decisions .  Good luck :)|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i think you should move out and let the cat have the house, since you are the problem.  even a shovel to the back of the head would be more humane then what you are doing.    a cat does not decide to pee outside of his litter box for no reason after 6 years. he needs a vet, probably UTI.  if he only pees on wives things, he is getting even. she probably hates him and the cat knows it.    scared, sick cats hide.    cats that are locked in rooms and separated from human family develop problems, like running and hiding in the ceiling.    if you are not going to give this poor thing vet care and love, then please give it up.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	This happened to a few of my friends before when they got new pets... Just make sure you are giving the cats attention too... even though you may have grown to resent the animal. In one of my friends cases the cat just grew out of it... the other one they found a new home for the cat and he is now in a house where he is the only animal and hasnt pee'ed on a thing. I would not recommend the humane society... that is cruel.|`|Fmhsy8CKaa	Are they both fixed? I know my mother-n-laws cat would pee and spray everything she could because she wasn't fixed. As for the other one, it's probably just scared and so use to being alone. Plus cats like to go into weird places. If the cat didn't like the ceiling it wouldn't keep going up there. Maybe spend some time in the basement with them playing and showing them attention may ease their jealousy and make them more comfortable around your kids and even may stop the one from hanging out in the ceiling. That is normal cat behavior, probably some spiders and other bugs up there to play with. Cats are very independent but, need lots of affection. I know that when my husband and I are about to go on vacation our cats see the suitcases and will ignore us for a few days before we leave. The day that we do leave they stick to us like glue and when we get back we can't get a foot in the door without one of them rubbing on us. If the one that pees is fixed it could be a medical reason or the fact that your wife doesn't like him/her. A cat can sense that and will act out against her. Maybe she should try to get to know the cat and be affectionate to it. This can solve the peeing problem as well. Before you give them up try to show them more attention. Bring the kids down with you and spend time with both. You have to let the cats know that they aren't being replaced and that you still care about them. I'm sure that is the main reason for the behavior, that they feel neglected.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Please do not send them to the humane society.. they will be euthanized.

How about walking the dog instead, hmm?|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	People who show dogs professionally do this all the time to keep their dogs in condition.      However, you have to use a special treadmill, as a people treadmill is too short (the dog needs a longer stride).  And you have to know what you're doing -- the dog must be constantly supervised; not just tied to the treadmill.  It takes some training to accustom the dog to the treadmill.    Better for everyone concerned (like you and the dog) to get out and walk/run *with* the dog.  Better bonding, too.    BTW, it's "heeler", not "healer", unless the dog is a doctor or shaman or something.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Well the tread mill thing makes since and the dog whisper did it on tv once but I would do some researching on how to start them out so he/she doesn't get hurt in the process.  My mother-in-law but her rat terrier on her's and he would just stand on it and float to to back and jump off we couldn't get him to walk on it but when it's turned off he loves to stand on it! Good Luck, if you do make sure your really close to them.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	I've been gating dogs on a treadmill forever, but you do need to know what you are doing and use some common sense. (ya I know, for some that would be impossible) There are actually commercial dog treadmills that you can buy that have safety rails made for a dog instead of people. Some people have way to many dogs to be taking them all for a walk every day.

Puppies spend almost 18+ hours out of the day just sleeping they tend to play hard and need alot of rest to build up there energy.. They also are still growing so sleep is like there best friend.. Just a note for puppys up until the age of about 8 months you shouldnt limit there intake of food let them eat as much as they want because like i said there still growing and need the nutrients..|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	it is just a baby she is like a real baby awake for a while then dowsed in sleep.

iKxm8aL7aa	balls,chains,tubes and mini wheels.Also ferrets love to climb things,as much as i know :)|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	All you need to make this is some old cardboard boxes and a TON of tape (use good masking tape, or packing tape to hold things together).  Cut the cardboard into 'long strips' and tape it into a 'shaped hole' (rectangular, square), and cut the ends at 'angles' and tape the ends together to make mazes and 'climbers' for the ferret.  Your ferret will love you, because ferrets love to 'play' in small 'ferret sized' places ... the 'turns' and ups and downs will keep your ferret happy for many hours.  If you make it 'right' you can take them apart and assemble them differently every few days without making any more 'tunnels' ... just build well, because ferrets do have claws and can 'cut' through the tape very easily to 'escape' ...|`|bN0Imp99aa	Tunnels are always fun. You can buy those dryer hose things at the harware store for cheap and they love them! Blankets are always a big hit too. Lie a few blankets down and let them tunnel through them. You can make forts out of boxes and cut holes in them. Dig boxes are always fun if you have snow bring a bucket in. Just use your imagination, your ferret will love any attention you give her! :)|`|tMrIScCTaa	One time I took a big box, about 2 feet by 3 feet, and made a little one foot door, and some windows.  I took some old toilet paper tubes and strung them the inside top, and they loved it.  they also love to dig.  If you put a cat pan in the bottom with some dirt they would love that too.  I hope this helps.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	make her a pillow filled with stuffing and leave a hole in it for her to get in she will love it|`|LoXPIezhaa	loo rolls bound up together wth various obstacles in between and books piled like steps etc.|`|6Z29aDnjaa	Ferrets love new things they can get into. Some house hold items you can give your ferret are:    Tubes: Like from wrapping paper tubes  Old pair of jeans  Any kind of boxes: you can make holes in them and attach them with tape or kids glue.  Dig box: ferrets just love dig boxes! All you need is a deep box or deep cat pan and fill it with rice or pet store sand if you have any.  Plastic bag  Make your ferret a den: You can do this with a good size box or a empty bottom drawer. Fill it with old clothing. Some people use a old dress and make a holes in it for more fun space!  Last but not least: Think like a ferret, if it is a place you have not gotten into yet, and you can crawl, hear, dig, or chew it then it must be good. Always thing ferret safe tho.|`|xGRh8k2Baa	Most small animals are just curious and just like to run around, and usually love tunnels, so just make some with blankets or pillows or something.  My family had a guinea pig that used to love to roam all over the place and he'd be entertained for a good long time just running back and forth thru a blanket.  You could just drape a blanket off the front of the couch, maybe set up some pillows, and extend the tunnel system as far as you want to.  Just be careful to prevent the ferret from going under the couch, it was a pain to make the guinea pig come out, so I assume a ferret would be tougher.|`|uaIUBYTcaa	Find cardboard boxes or toilet paper rolls and start making a little play house for it. If you can find some old fabric you might be able to make some tunnels or something out of that. Anything that they can hide in or run through.|`|9p3AjlK5aa	i had a ferret, it doesn't take much to please them.  take a box and cut holes in it so it can run through them hang stuff from the top like strings.   have little tunnels & stuff  make it like an obstacle coarse (:|`|420e76e4daaff536c4d70d00660d1610aa	My ferrets love rolled up old carpets, old clothes and Christmas wrapping paper tubes!  They drag the tubes about and rip off any old paper they find. If you can get hold of any large cardboard tubes they love to run through those too.|`|lW1rCecnaa	Give them a empty tissue box, or oatmeal box to roll in|`|UmEMYsyaaa	Ferrets love toys, and their favorite toy is you.  Take old t-shirts and let them sleep and play with them.  Dangle the t-shirt in front of them, let them jump up to get it, cover them.  I have old socks they love to wiggle in like a worm.  One little boy loves his own "toilet" brush (not used, of course).  For a dig box, purchase some biodegradable packaging peanuts; it won't cause any obstructions in their tummies and is very light.  Play hide and seek, peek a boo, or any type of game a 3 year old would play.  Hide treats and let them find them.  Take a golf whiffle ball, put a string through one of the holes, tie it, and hand it from the top of a doorway.  This way the ball will hang down and they can play tether ball.    Oh, if you ever have to wash their bedding and other stuff, use a mild soap and no fabric softener.  Wash their stuff steparately from your regular stuff.  Dooks!|`|bepZupAfaa	i have a box with holes big enough for the ferret to get in and out of with crumpled packing paper in it(newspaper is fine). every now and then i fluff the paper some.     a basket turned upside down will entertain her. mine climb in and out of it through the handle area. she will try to lift it up with her nose to get in it too.    toilet tissue, wrapping paper or paper towel tubes aren't the best to use as the ferret could get caught in it and get hurt. tubes designed like a dryer hose are fun. i have a flex tunnel that my ferrets love to play in.    fleece throws(little blankets) on the floor are great to explore and they feel soft to them. if you have a dresser drawer that you can do without pull it out and put some soft material in it and she will climb in it to sleep.be careful if she can get up into the next drawer she will and you will find her in your clothes.    if you have snow on the ground put some in box that she can get in and out of easily and she'll love it. just make sure the snow is the light stuff and not the heavy wet stuff.    paper bags are great they like to hear the crinkle of the paper.    hope this helps and have fun with your ferret
AA10482724	I always thought that a small planted tank with a giant water beetle would be interesting.|`|7guIba8paa	very skilled??????????   yeah not really thou but yeah a frog or newt also u wont get a lot of REALLY cool stuff in a 10g salt water|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You haven't even cycled your tank yet. Five days does not make your aquarium ready.    Because of how small a ten gallon is I would suggest:  - One male Betta and a few African dwarf frogs.  - Mudskippers are unique but require more space and are brackish.  - A planted tank with shrimp. Cherry shrimp, ghost shrimp, etc.    ~You do not understand the term cycle. Cycling refers to the nitrification cycle. Aquatic animals give off waste in the form of ammonia, which nitrifying bacteria breaks down into nitrite and then into nitrates which must be removed by performing weekly water changes of about 25%. In a new aquarium there is no bacteria built up and adding fish too soon will cause an ammonia spike. The bacteria will build up mainly in your substrate and filter media.  You called the ten gallon new, and said that you treated it and have had the water running for only five days. The cycle can take as long as six weeks. Have you been adding a source of ammonia?    ~Rarely isn't never. Using a fishless cycle you should never have fish die when first introduced because of an ammonia spike. A fishless cycle is when you start up the tank and add a source of ammonia daily to mimic fish waste. This could be done using fish food or pure ammonia. I usually do this for at least a week, but longer is preferable.|`|OsVswissaa	Getting the water running for five days is not the same as having a nitrogen cycle.  The cycle is more than running water through the filter.  You just didn't mention anything about your ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels that's probably why someone would be concerned.    Anyway my suggestion is one puffer fish.  I forget what the small breed is called,but there is a breed that stays quite small.  They kind of look like helicopters hovering around.  They're very sensitive to the nitrogen cycle and five days isn't long enough to completely establish that.
T2rU15Nsaa	It may or may not be, depending on the degree of the layering and peeling, and the species of bird.   1) What kind of a bird do you have  2) How bad is it? Is it actualy peeling off, or it just looks like it?    Birds beaks, much like our fingernails, grow in layers, so it is not uncommon for you to be able to see the layers. Especially in birds that have powder down, like greys and cockatoos, it becomes more visible. But with softbill birds, like finches and canaries, their beak usualy looks more smooth and uniform, so evidence of peeling is not normal.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	yh it is  normal........................  due to weather.....just go to a vet....

Talk to her, tell her you love her--she doesn't have to understand the words, she'll know the tone of your voice. They're smart little creatures.<br>  <br>  Birds mask illness until they're really sick. In the wild, it's a survival mechanism--the weak are more likely to be killed by a predator. That's why our little companions hide illness so well--they're wired to keep it secret.<br>  <br>  Don't be too hard on yourself for what you didn't know, just resolve to learn more and know more about birds from this day forward, that's all you can do.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|uvHc7EDOaa	I feel for you, and I hope that, for both your sakes, she can hold out till tomorrow. Just keep her as calm and warm as possible. As long as shes not struggling or up set, keep holding her. If she starts to get upset, put her in a box in a warm dark room. If you have it, line the box with some shredded newspaper, it will keep her as comfortable as possible. Try giving her some water off a teaspoon or from a syringe. Break a few sunflower seeds and peel them. Do this by pushing it against a hard surface. That way she doesn't have to break them herself.<br>  <br>  I hope she makes it, good luck.|`|khP0HaQNaa	i know how you feel i just went through that last night and i was in the same situation as you as i couldnt take him to the vet until today. but all you can do if dont think like that and believe she will make it through. i thought mine did but when i saw how he was acting i brought him out and he passed away on me but at keast i saw him go. all you can do if look after her make sure she is alright just let her lay on you or wherever she wants and just be there with her which should make her happy if you are there with her. good luck i hope yours turns out better. i know its a horrible feeling but just believe.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Put her in a makeshift nest out of tissue and a cool whip bowl. Put that in her cage and put her in it. Then put a heating pad set on low under the cage bottom. Cover cage half way with a blanket or towel. Keep in quiet dim lit room. Call the vet if she makes it and get in first thing in am. may be able to save her or put her to sleep so she is not suffering. Actually holding her probably stresses her more than not. It is comforting to us but usually not to birds. Talk to her and check on her often. So sorry she is such bad shape.

uvHc7EDOaa	I know the feeling. I've had my bird for about 10 years now and I couldn't live without him (I got him when I was 8). Its not weird, Spike helped me through a very rough patch in my life when no one else could. When he got sick a few years ago, and I thought he was going to die, I cried for a week straight. I also lost my cockatiel in November, I wasn't as close to him, but it still hurts. I hope you can remember him for the good times, and continue on. It is impossible to replace that pet that you did have, but you can have a new one and love it just as much. You can get a new bird, it can be a completely different type as well. After mine died, I bought a new cockatiel, not as a replacement, but to keep me going. Get a young one that needs a lot of attention, to keep your mind off whats happened.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  RIP little fella.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	When you're ready, look up the poem "Rainbow Bridge" you'll find it on lots of pet bird memorial boards.

He should have lived to be 30. You need 2 ask your self these questions . If the dog got him- not good.<br>  birds need a vet- when they are feeling ill. They do show you many sign's that they are sick. Diarrhea, not eating, screaming for no reason, too much sun, not enuff water. Many reason's. If he just died for "no-reason" @ all- then perhap's you should consider getting another bird. Perhaps  2 this time ? He could have been quite lonely ???  Don't worry about it- I'm sure he went quick, and just be careful what you feed them. Remember: they can NOT eat everything you eat. chocolate and onions can kill him. <br>  <br>  1 more thing- if your Mom cooks with "TEFLON" Pots and Pans- he can Die from the fumes of them. It was advertised about a year ago- here in canada. They now make a "SAFER" one- called: "MIRON" .<br>  <br>  Teflon- is the ones that food do Not get stuck to. Miron is engraved on each pot and pan.

WP is incredibly difficult to do well, as easy as it often appears to people who haven't actually tried to do it correctly. <br>  <br>  To keep your horse's canter slow, you should first be aiming for a lope, not a canter. :) Start at a walk and then a jog; don't go for the lope until you have a slow, balanced horse at the first two gaits. Do a lot of lateral flexion (pull your horse's head to your knee until he gives, then release; repeat) at the halt and walk until he flexes as soon as you touch the rein. Do the same with vertical flexion--apply leg pressure (at the halt) and pull back at the same time. Continue until he flexes and gives to the bit; immediately release. The desired result is that he drops his head every time you pick up the reins. <br>  <br>  When you are loping, first work on getting a balanced, engaged lope that is a solid 3 beat, not a 4 beat or a "run" where he's all strung out. If it's a little fast, that's okay. Work on his frame (if you've done all previous work, this should be getting there). Once he's got all of those parts down, aim to go slower. Pick up the lope. As soon as he starts getting fast, basically do a one-rein stop. Use the same method you used for lateral flexion--pull with one rein to the side (he should easily flex since you've already done it). With your leg, push his hindquarters over so they are disengaged. Wait for him to come to a halt on his own. Then ask for the lope again. Repeat over and over until he realizes that he has to do that every time he gets fast so it's easier to go slow. Keep in mind, though, that most good WP horses are bred, not made, and training will help but not create a super horse. A true WP horse has an extremely slow lope that the average horse just can't do--it's more important that you focus on getting your horse to travel in the correct frame with no excess speed (even if he's not super slow) on a loose rein...with balanced, engaged gaits. <br>  <br>  Once you've done all of those things, a lot of the other things will come. For instance, once he's doing the flexion exercises, "keeping him down" (I assume you mean his head/neck?) won't be difficult because you'll be helping him develop the muscles he needs to do those things. He'll also respond every time you touch the reins. For that reason, do not just "hold" him back/down. Go on a loose rein and pick it up to correct him. Release as soon as he responds correctly so that he connects the freedom with the desirable position.<br>  <br>  As for focusing, anytime you're riding and he starts looking off, ask for something else--transition, halt, back, do a one-rein stop, etc. Use your leg/spur and give him a little nudge. Remind him that YOU are in charge and he will pay attention to you. If he's young, this isn't surprising that he does this and it will improve if you're consistent.<br>  <br>  As for your position, just practice! Once he's got a good WP jog, sitting it shouldn't be difficult. Just practice over and over. Riding is really the only way to develop a good seat; the more you do it, the easier it will become. With the shoulder's back/other position elements, have a ground person watch you and tell you every time you get out of position. When you're correct, think about how it feels so you will remember what it should feel like when you're showing and there's no one there to remind you. <br>  <br>  As for the show next week, WP and all-around horses generally have short (just a few inches) manes. If your horse has a long mane and you plan to start showing at all-around events or even just in WP, I would probably cut it (and then pull it) just to fit in, although I have seen a few WP horses with long manes (personally, I don't like the look and hope it doesn't go back in style). If this is your only show or your first one and you aren't sure if you'll keep it up, just go with what you have (assuming it's not a big show). If it's a small show, I wouldn't bother with banding (unless everyone usually does it at this show). If it's a bigger show or everyone does normally band, then you should do it as well.|`|pzqeLN8eaa	go to a trainer. haha. yeah but no kidding. you can get a lot more from going to a trainer, even once, then you will on here.<br>  but i shall help as much as i can.<br>   a good way to keep his focus is to switch everything up. don't ALWAYS ride in the same arena if you can help it. ride him down the trail, work on his jog & lope there, or go to another arena. <br>  <br>  some horses are not built to carry their heads low. for example, my <br>  <br>  QH reining mare has a wierd neck that comes out of her shoulder at an angle, almost like a TB's would, at a high angle, so her head does not stay level. she's just not built that way. however my pleasure/halter gelding has a level neck that comes out of his shoulder flat. so his natural headset is beautiful & low. <br>  <br>  it is easier to sit a trot when the horse is at a collected jog, so work on that for a while, then it will be much more comfortable to sit trot. <br>  <br>  imagine yourself sitting like a barbie. (barbie's back is always strait and stiff, in a way.) that can help you keep correct posture. or imagine your body being pulled upward, towards the sky.<br>  <br>  yes, banding & cutting his mane(if done correctly) will make him look fabulous.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	all of these except of the mane can be fixed by a tighter leg try 2 pointing(ik ur western but its the easiest way to do it) or go w/o stirrups good luck at the show

4GQubZeFaa	Your tiel is probably biting because he or she is scared by you approaching them too fast. Tiels are prey animals in nature, and therefore very timid. Please do not put your bird in time out for just biting out of defense. She was just scared. And when you do put your bird in time out for any issue, make sure it is within seconds after they misbehave. Birds are very smart creatures, but you will need to act fast or they won't understand what they are even being punished for. They will be in a completely different time zone so to speak. =P Also, when punishing your bird, do not leave them in the cage for ten to fifteen minutes like it has been suggested for you to do. That is far too long. A minute or two is enough. That will get the point across. Any longer than that, and the bird will forget that they are even in time out, and just start playing in their cage.     I suggest just moving slower around your bird. You need to accommodate their needs, just as you want the bird to accommodate yours.  Its only been a week since you brought him or her home, and they are probably still sort of nervous about their environment.      As for the flying, try taking your bird to a certified avian vet to get their wings clipped. It doesn't hurt the bird, and its like a haircut. Make sure that they only clip four or five flight feathers off of each wing. That way the bird can still glide down to the ground safely without falling, and not fall down and hurt themselves. Many birds have been hurt because their wings were clipped too short. After birds have their wings clipped, there is usually a big attitude adjustment, and they are much less attitudinal. You also won't have to worry about your bird flying away or getting into as much around the house.     If you have any more questions I suggest going to http://www.birdsnways2.com/chats/ncs/ncs...     Its a GREAT forum full of wonderful individuals who love their birds and have tons of great information to offer.     I hope this helped! =]|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Chad E and Christa M have particularly good answers.  I use time-out with my tiel--I usually go for about 5 minutes.  Make sure to say no or naughty and do it promptly.  They have about the attention span of a 2 year old, so immediate action is required. I have mine understanding that "floor means house"--which is to say when she goes to the floor to pick up stuff off the carpet, she goes immediately into her cage. She is not allowed to eat off the floor.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	You just need to get rid of those birds.  They aint on the lease and you will probably get evicted because of them.|`|0mGNwzwhaa	I've owned several parrots and this is what has worked for me in the past.  First, clip the Tiel's wings.  It is dangerous for a bird to be able to fly around a room, it also leaves them in charge of where they can go and what they can do.  Secondly, when he bites, don't yell or make a lot of noise, it's funny to a bird to get that reaction out of you, and they will just do it all the more.  Say NO and put him back in his cage and cover it.  He obviously enjoys being with you, and probably nips to get attention.  However no one wants to be bit and he needs to learn that.  After he has been in his cage for 5 minutes, you can take him back out, it he does it again, say NO again and put him back in his cage again and cover it.  He'll figure it out shortly|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Maybe he is scared of you approaching him too fast? But also, my friend has a cockatiel and he bites.. just playfully, but same as yours.. he would fly around the room, come on my shoulder, then bite my earlobe, then work his way up to my cartilage where i have a piercing there. Tell him hes a naughty boy and put him in his cage for 10-15 mins. or so. Hope it helps :) .  Best Of Luck.|`|x5HMQgQyaa	Remember: birds don't have hands. Using their beaks is how they explore their word. My pionus often uses her beak to move my hand into the right position for scritches, and uses it to 'preen' me.    When does he bite you? Is there something specific that seem to trigger it every time?     And as with moving too fast, that is somewhat understandable. Think about it: here is a giant monster, 500 times his size, reaching forward to grab him. I'd be scared too! Move slower, talk to him as you move closer so he knows you are approching, place your hand/finger gently infront of him, and if he is a good boy by getting up onto your finger nicely, reward him with a seed or treat.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	take a kabab stiks and take closer to her/him beak  and  and slowly   take ur finger to her head and give a massage on her/his head tht will help the bird not to bite try this sevral time in a day tht she get use to   to take ur hand on he/him head....|`|NpePcUWmaa	use a towel i know it sounds crazy but put a towel around ur hand they think its a mate or something i use it all the time my bird will never bite me with my towel
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	No. Guinea pigs do not take dust baths. Chinchillas take dust baths.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs should not be bathed at all, unless they become soiled. Even then, it is best to only bathe the dirty part.<br>  <br>  They really do a great job of grooming themselves!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	brush the pig daily.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	no|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	No, they don't need a dust bath. They can clean them selves well any way.<br>  <br>  In fact, they don't really need a bath at all until they get REALLY dirty.
lHEg75WEaa	Yes, they definitely can. Mine do it all the time. Sometimes I find them as far away as 4-5 feet. Its not a bad thing. I think it can be entertainment for them lol|`|uetqUAEvaa	That is normal chinchillas are soft and clean looking but they sure can make a mess.
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Go ahead and fire off an email to their corporate office.  I did that a few years ago for the store near where I live.  It was bad, pretty much how you described.  But honestly, they don't give a cr*p.  They forwarded my email to their store manager, and he called me.  I didn't return his call, because I could tell by his tone of voice on the email that it was just a moot issue and wasn't going to go anywhere other then piss me off even further.<br>  <br>  I encourage everyone to write, email, or call their corporate office with complaints about the atrocious state of their fish tanks and inexperienced workers "caring" for the fish.  Maybe they'll get the idea that they have no business being in the live fish business, and will stop selling fish.<br>  <br>  Another good idea, a Sharpie marker and/or some sticky notes to "correct" the poor info written on their tanks.  Like the pacus that only grow to 12 inches, or the figure 8 and green spotted puffers that are mixed in with tetras or loaches prefer a bit of aquarium salt added to their tank.  I always like correcting their misinformation :)|`|GrYhFNMdaa	Wow, i thought that the problem was only at the walmart i go too. Its the same problem every time i go in there. When i go by the fish tanks and the workers are walking around, i start speaking very loudly saying 'omg this is gross,these ppl have no idea what they are doing' and i go on and on. I think something should be done about. Maybe if we all write letters then they will actually get some educated ppl to look after the fish|`|a6An96Araa	I would if I were you!!!|`|PRCfCSDxaa	You could go talk to the manager. I don't know. Sadly, this is all over. You wouldn't believe some of the stuff that happens at Petco and it doesn't just happen to the fish. Honestly, stores like Wal-Mart shouldn't sell fish or any other creatures. Personally, I do not like fish and I don't want them as pets but they are still living and should be treated with respect.<br>  <br>  Another solution would be for you to sue them but you will need a whole heck of a lot of money to sue Wal-Mart. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope the best for the fish!|`|ad7c42cce90c3663b9c47e1866a1347aaa	yah most walmarts that do carry fish. all seem to be in that trend.<br>  <br>  i would of asked to see the manager right there and then to complain. yes, i do advice to write or call or do something,i would.<br>  <br>  im sure its only was fixed cause someone complained. and hope that who ever was encharged of that section got introuble|`|1bSG5LCPaa	!!!!!!!!!!!! thats mean! Its cruel.

A well written letter that provides good and thorough information without getting "preachy", one that reads as though it came from an intelligent,well mannered,and thoughtful person will have the greatest impact and is most likely to obtain the results you desire. <br>  I agree with everything you said and have observed similar travesties at many of the other "big box" stores besides the one you mention. The price structure of big stores is at the root of the problem. They suck up the easy profits and put the smaller pet stores out of business. Then they find they don't have the expertise to provide their customers with the help and advice needed by beginners. This ultimately ends with disillusioned people that will never come back to the hobby. To be totally fair the "sick fish" problem in these stores is not entirely the fault of the individual stores. To purchase in the quantities that are required by such large operations they must buy from huge breeding or importing businesses that also operate like the big stores. A few thousand unhealthy fish in a truck-load will easily be unnoticed.<br>  The point of my rant is that it might cost considerably more money to buy your supplies and fishes from a small independent store,but if you can find one do all that you can to support it,because it is being run by someone that truly loves the pets they sell.
qMkWZn96aa	I once had that happen with my new puppy, he was my first, he seemed to always have diarrhea, and I learned it was because of the food, when I got the new puppy, I was supposed to ask the previous care-takers (pound) what they had fed him so far, and I should have continued with this regimen exactly, only slowly weaning him off of this and getting him to the diet that I preferred, not doing so will cause, and did cause, his digestive system to be very upset.<br>  So if this is a newly adopted pup, please ask the previous care-takers about his previous diet.|`|uAzToWC7aa	feed him rice with puppy chow|`|KcQT4ph8aa	Crap, what's up with yer Vet? Just tryin' ta get quick munny I guess.<br>  <br>  Well, don't give yer pet human food. So he only eats chicken and rice huh. Then just give him what he wants but make it more appealing to him so he'd eat a lot. Give him lots of liquid because he's, as I'm sure of, dehydrated. You know, pets never really asked for our favor, they give us a favor.
IMPvzBk1aa	Did someone tell you that a bit would control your horse's speed?  If so, that person was mistaken.  Horses are trained to respond to leg and weight cues to slow, stop, and move sideways.  Without that training, bits are premature.  A correctly trained horse knows these cues before the bit is ever introduced.  Your horse needs to be retrained, going back to ground work.  If you don't do that, the horse will develop more and more resistance problems, and never be a reliable mount. I give you credit for being concerned with using a leverage bit on a horse that actually needs more training.....I hope you find help to correctly train your horse so he/she will benefit.  Your horse will stop on any bit, or no bit, when he/she is trained correctly.|`|rTSwouqXaa	Bits are only as harsh as the hands that use them.|`|u1HahCoqaa	A snaffle is a snaffle. There isn't a "Western Snaffle".....either it is a snaffle or it isn't. A snaffle is a non-leverage type bit that uses direct pressure from the reins to effect the horse. Many people think something is a snaffle because it has a joint in the middle- this is not true.  Basically, you pull with 8 lbs and the horse feels 8 lbs. <br>  For instance: This is advertised as a "Tom Thumb Western Snaffle Bit"  <a href="http://equisearch.com/tack/bitgallery/DCP00730.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/tack/bitgallery/DC...</a> . That is not a snaffle- see the shanks on it? Those give it leverage, and so it is NOT a snaffle, more a curb. Basically, the longer the shank, the more leverage you get. So with a very short shanked curb bit, like a Kimberwicke (<a href="http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/horse-forums/attachments/horse-training/47932d1118589549-kimberwicke-uxeter-bit-in733304_19505.jpg," rel="nofollow">http://www.horsegroomingsupplies.com/hor...</a> <a href="http://www.raraequus.com/edu1/images/kimberwick_mouth.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://www.raraequus.com/edu1/images/kim...</a> ,  you might put in 8 lbs of pressure and the horse might feel 10. But with a bit like this: <a href="http://www.saddlemulenews.com/wester4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.saddlemulenews.com/wester4.jp...</a> , you might put in 8 lbs and the horse might feel 16. See?<br>  <br>  <br>  I am assuming what you mean by "Western Snaffle" is something with quite a shank on it- correct me if I am wrong- so, you could try something with a shorter shank. Or a maltitude of other bits- there are literally thousands. Just try to go with the mildest bit you can get away with. Ask to borrow others bits and see what works for you. Your horse might like certain types of bits/mouthpeices better than others- for instance, my horse hates having moving parts in his mouth, and we still need control for jumping, so I use a Rubber Mullen mouth Pelham.(<a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.horsetackinternational.com/images/211805-rubber-mouth-pelham.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.horsetackinternational.com/hard-rubber-mullen-mouth-pelham-bit.html&usg=__y0ZX30QpMR_T4GMadxTPTEsyEFU=&h=400&w=400&sz=41&hl=en&start=1&um=1&tbnid=7t5Rffsp--6-ZM:&tbnh=124&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3DRubber%2Bmullen%2Bmouth%2Bpelham%26ndsp%3D18%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN)" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a> It has a ring where it would be a bit with the same effect of a snaffle, and one where it would have a curb-like effect. I use it with a bit converter, but one could also use double reins or just use one ring or the other.  See how bits can vary? Just try out stuff and see what works.|`|pzqeLN8eaa	i agree with Katie. those line of bits are pretty nice. i would suggest you go to a trainer and ask what bit would work best for your horse. barrel trainers with help a lot b/c they know different bits and HOW they work for different horses. and they usuaully have first hand experience with so many types of bits, they'll help you find one that both you & your horse can work well in. good luck racing! :]]|`|I55JNnvpaa	what was your western snaffle? can we have a link?<br>  <br>  The sharon camarillo collection is awsome.

DON'T get a GAG bit or change to a "quick stop"  they are really mean bits.  A mullen mouth is a straight bar bit and the shank gives you some more leverage on the horse's mouth.  <br>  <br>  Although if I were you, I'd go back to some basic training excercises with him to work on stopping.  First get him to learn to follow you when leading.  When you stop, he should stop.  Check out some Parelli or other training methods.  Then when you get ready to work on stopping while mounted, go bareback if you can.  Try this at a walk saddle or no.  As you pull back on the reins, shift your weight to your bottom.  If you have stirrups, push your heals down and forward.  Say Whoa or some voice command he recognizes as STOP.  Keep lightening your pull on the reins so that he connects your body weight shift with WHOA.  It will get him lighter on the bit, easier to stop, AND probably help your time because he reacts to you faster.  Good luck!  Have a good run.|`|uclZT4Enaa	Honestly I think that something with a shorter shank on it and a soft port would be a great choice for your sport because when you have something with a long shank you're going to have more room to be really harsh with your hands. and In that sport it is something that wouldn't be good I suppose. I have never competed in barrels but I have done poles... and you don't want to be out there slamming the breaks on!!  You'll want something with like I said a short shank and try a curb strap/chain as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out!! =]

Try using live food, just chuck it in with his tank and let it run around. I give mine crickets, meaworms and wood cocaroaches - he loves them all! He mayhave no interest in meat at all, due to the fact it isnt live food, and many beardies actually wont eat anything dead (they can be very picky unfortuntely).

qA18Nxslaa	Actually, sometimes a female leo will show signs of male gender. They may have hemipenal bulges, though not as pronounced as an actual male will. They can also have pits on the tail-side of the vent, which will closely resemble the wax-holes of a male. The main difference, though, is that males will have actual holes in the skin, sometimes a waxy plug will be showing in some of the holes (for marking territory). The bulges are usually much more pronounced, too.<br>  Here is a link that has visuals to assist you. <br>  <a href="http://www.reptilecare.com/leopardgender.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilecare.com/leopardgender...</a><br>  <br>  ~Good Luck!|`|TkJn9gO0aa	How much does you gecko weigh? Age is useless..........always go by weight, as that reflects how far along the gecko is sexually matured. <br>  <br>  A certain ID of the gender can be seen in geckos that are 35 grams(and oftentimes sooner), but 35 grams is what I've always gone by as far as a definite "rule of thumb". <br>  <br>  Females NEVER have precloacal bulges. Both genders have femoral pores. However males femoral pores are greatly enlarged and they excrete waxy cuticles. Females do sometimes have indented femoral pores which can be mistaken for male pores by inexperienced keepers, but they are only slightly dimpled.....not porous. <br>  <br>  If you have a picture of the gecko, feel free to e-mail it to me(contact info on my profile page).|`|8OjOmZWAaa	if you see bulges its a female. you will never see a bulges in female even in adult size. only males. =)|`|CdRlOsnyaa	Male Leopard Geckos show two hemipenal bulges on the base of their tails. if thats what the two bulges are then you might have a male. you might have to wait for him/her two grow a little more|`|wLgGD63raa	You can sex a gecko at six weeks old, so you will definitely be able to by now.

And yes, I'd report the place - it sounds like an animal hoarder and not a legitimate humane society.  Legitimate places keep close track on their foster homes and foster programs.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Get your dog.<br>  <br>  Then report it.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	Get the dog first then I would tell the Human Society about the woman she is obviously a hoarder.

YhYSZlroaa	Nah he's just jealous<br>  My dog does the exact same thing whenever my parents hug, or he isn't being givin  attention when others are talking. I think it is funny|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Dogs actually do not display jealous, jealous is a human characteristic. <br>  <br>  Your dog is showing signs of dominance and possessive behaviour. <br>  <br>  Is it normal? Well yes it can be. What to do about it? Well I suggest seeing a professional behaviorist. This type of behaviour needs to be fixed before it gets even worse.|`|pyqgEbmsaa	He isn't jealous or protective.. he is possessing you.. Bad idea to allow that to continue.. Someone is going to get bit.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	My guess is he predates hubby and as far as he's concerned your hubby is the beta male.  You need to see a trainer to teach you both how to demote him from alpha male.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs to be the alpha male in the house or things could get out of hand.<br>  <br>  By the way, tail wagging don't always mean happy.

The dog isn't jealous, it is dominant and needs training.  He does it because you allow it and have not taught him that it's unacceptable.  You need to work with a trainer because the behavior is not OK and your husband could be hurt.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	This behavior is commonly misunderstood.<br>  When he sees you two so close, he is concerned that you might fight, so he tries to separate you to keep the peace.  He does it wagging his tail, because he is telling you to stay friendly and happy.  If he could just get the two of you to run around chasing him, everybody would have a good time.<br>  I'm not sure how to convince him that everything's fine...|`|Hjny2ducaa	It's called dominance over you and no respect for your husband and sorry but your dog does not sound like a sweetheart|`|uAzToWC7aa	he has a doggy crush on you! awwwww!!!!!!!!!

If you feed your dogs twice each day, take them out 20 minutes or so after they've eaten and wait for them to poop, repeat this until they understand that outside is the place to go. If you feed them once each day, it may be better for you to take them out in the morning and play with them till they poop, and again 20 min or so after they eat. It's important to keep this routine even after they're trained when possible.|`|ivIQl6Awaa	they shouldn't care about the bark chips.  we have them and the dogs don't seem to care where they go.

pzqeLN8eaa	i personally think $2.6 is WAYY too much. i know houses & pricing pretty well, and they house is certainly not looking like its worth that much. its small(1000+ s.f.) and an older style home. but whatever, i mean, if they like it and have the money, why not?  haha the horse stuff looks cool! it would be fun to keep your horse there, nice big arena, looks like a couple barns...pretty nice overall, i just think its way overpriced, and esp in this housing market & economy. maybe theres some special hidden feature. lol idk.<br>  <br>  *edit* oh! i didn't see it had 2 arena's, indoor & outdoor. thats really cool! still tho, i don't think it'll sell for that price.... lol.<br>  *edit again* umm.. i think it would be hard to determine what a fair board fee would be from just looking at there photos. theres only 1 picture of the barn, so its hard to see all its has to offer...|`|FoUOqSh5aa	My Lord!!! 2 million??? thats ridiculous for that little place....|`|1tX7KwHsaa	I would not consider that place! 2.6 mil for a house that looks to be out of date and a barn that may be out of date as well.

YnWwcUPTaa	The lack of control and unwillingness to do anything about it just like some parents who let there kids run amok and either think it is cute or shrug their shoulder with that helpless look..<br>  <br>  My dogs aren't leashed as we have five acres fenced with invisible fence. But when in public they are leashed and under control, and like my previous dog also muzzled in public, I try to have them obedience trained and socialize them at eight or nine weeks as soon as I get them home, I did not have that option with the rescue as he was four years old when we got him and had a host of problems although we did take him to class and worked with him so over the four years there was improvement even the vet could see that.  Some people thought it cruel to muzzle or asked why and I said to protect your dog.<br>  <br>  It's not so much that the dog or kids annoy me as it is not the kids or dogs fault but the parents/owners fault.<br>  <br>  And people that don't pick up after their dog.|`|1WV1BL6gaa	I'm annoyed by people who don't clean up after their dogs of course! People who let their dogs wander 20 feet into yards to pee also get on my nerves--to me that's trespassing, and just rude. <br>  <br>  After those two items, the thing I REALLY hate, are owners who tell me that my dogs (who are wagging their tails and walking on completely loose leashes) are dominating me because they don't walk behind me. Seriously! I wish folks would mind their own business; my dogs and I have mutual respect and a healthy relationship (not to mention a loose-leash walk that my training-classmates would kill for), we really don't need intrusive "advice" from people who watch the Dog Whisperer and are therefore experts on dogs.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Well, I may sound a little bit biased here, but I'm a PROUD Pit Bull mix owner, and it annoys me sooooo much when people are automatically prejudiced against your dog, even if THEY are the ones doing something wrong. Now, don't get me wrong, my dog is a total angel, but it drives me absolutely crazy when the neighbors dogs or people who are out with their dogs who AREN'T on leashes (when mine always, always, always is!) make comments about staying away from my dog. Uhm, hello?! If, by chance, anything DID happen, it wouldn't be my fault anyway! I'm the one following the law of walking my dog on a leash! It's not my problem or my dog's problem if you decide that you don't feel like it and your dog attacks mine!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Dogs that are out of control and barking and they want to walk right up to your dog.  Or dogs off-leash that come running up to your dogs.<br>  <br>  The worst I saw was someone's dog who was unsecured in the back of a passing truck. The dog jumped out to get to my dogs.  It could have been hurt and I had to deal with a possible dog fight.<br>  <br>  I also get annoyed with people with bad fences and gates or allow their dogs to run loose in their yards and come out after my dogs.  And then they say, "Oh he's friendly" despite raised hackles and growling.  Right.|`|uXAV4wP0aa	I hate it when people yell at their dogs for no reason. My neighbors literally scream at their dogs when they want them to do something. Actually, maybe I just don't like my neighbors!<br>  <br>  I also don't like when someone has a really aggressive dog and when they see their dog being aggressive they say, "oh, it's just because she's old" or some other lame excuse. No, it's because she isn't trained properly. <br>  <br>  As with everyone else, I don't like it when people don't pick up the poo. The city even provides free poo bags all around my town!|`|4SQx8smEaa	The people up the hill from me let their dog run free with out a leash.<br>  A) I have to worry the dog is going to get hit by a car<br>  B) I have to worry about the dog possibly coming over to me and my dog and getting in a spat.<br>  C) They let the dog crap in their neighbors yard<br>  <br>  And of course irresponsible owners and animal abusers really anger me!!|`|ivIQl6Awaa	My dog is a little agressive on her leash.  she growls at some dogs (not most though) and barks sometimes.  I keep her in control, and by my side.  When we approach oncoming dogs, the other owners always let their dogs run up all crazy to her.  Usually it's fine, but once and a while they start growling and barking, and the other owner always looks at me funny like it's my fault.  My dog is totally in control...it's your fault!!!<br>  Oh...and people who wlk their dogs in strollers...WTF??|`|RdSNb1Xraa	Its gotta be the people who dont pick up the poop!! it frustrates me soooo much.<br>  <br>  Oh and the people who come charging up to you thinking your dog is friendly and will play with their dog. <br>  I need a big sign "My dog is not friendly, My dog will bite your dog (its ankles at least)"<br>  <br>  Grr|`|dWed21jUaa	They're not on a leash.

They either ignore the problem or ignore an incident when it happens or blame it on the innocent dog. Some people cannot accept that there are dogs that don't like other dogs, period. They don't understand the safety issues involved in bringing an aggressive animal into a situation that will set it off. <br>  <br>  I observe people who have dogs that have no business having them. I see people walk dogs that are a terrible match for them. Just the other day I saw an older woman, probably 55 or 60 years of age walking a PUPPY Parsons Russell Terrier. It's possible the dog will outlive her and  even more likely that it will want exercise when she can't even hobble to the door. While the woman looked fairly healthy, there's no guarantee she's going to be able to keep up with this breed so it can live a long, healthy life. <br>  <br>  When I go to the dog park, the biggest thing I see is people with what they think is a breed, some so-called "designer dog" that they cannot manage or think is an actually breed. <br>  The other big thing I HEAR at the dog park is stories of people buying their dogs at pet stores. None of them like to hear that their dog is from a puppy miller and then I hear them say well my other dog is a purebred schnoodle. PUHLEEZE.<br>  <br>  The worst and simplest offense is people who will not spay or neuter their pets. I also cannot stand people who do not pick up their dog poo.|`|kRO55DHyaa	Owners that walk on the road using  a retractable leash on their dogs.

I don't agree with picking rabbits up unless it is needed, but I would try shooing or picking up and putting him directly into his litterpan afterwards and then pretend to ignore him and not let him on the couch. Do not shout or hit him as he wont accosiate the telling off with the pooing, however if you make him accosiate that when he does that he goes into the litterpan and gets no attention because of it he may just start to catch on.<br>  I've heard there is some sort of spray that you can use to deter pets from going places or going to the toliet, so maybe if you ask your vet or local pet store?<br>  Good Luck :)<br>  Raych|`|rjWlOAnEaa	lol, that's a funny story.<br>  Let him eat the poop.|`|SimAO1IUaa	omg i just got 2 baby rabbits and i was on the couch with them today and they peed like 3 times on the couch ew and they poop so much your lucky to have your rabbits litter box trained|`|FbpGQKubaa	Don't let him on the couch.~|`|nd30LQhlaa	because rabbits are like cats they only use the bathroom in one spot.Try getting a litter box for it =]

And yes, you can train my cat when ever you want. <br>  <br>  i might point and laugh when i see my cat doing it, it would be awkward. i think i just want to train my cat to use the toilet like mr.jinx from meet the parents. <br>  <br>  that would be cool too.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	well, it all sounds great but my husband is trained to clean the cat box.... and my little babies are too special to be cleaning their litter.... its a husbands job....lol... just kidding....  (but hubby really does do the cat box and I appreciate it)<br>  <br>  But...... it would definitely be of value to have cats clean their own litter box.... it would save about 10 minutes a day...... or every other day I guess, depends on your schedule for regular cleaning.....   well, I am not really grossed out because I dont do it but I know its nasty.... so yes, it would definitely help a persons day not having to scoop Shite.... <br>  <br>  Yes, it would be worth it..... depends on how much you would charge though.... and how much weirder my cats are going to be after they spend time with you.... i dont want them becoming these little snobs just because they now have abilities that compare to humans.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Yes, I have considered toilet training my cat for this purpose.  The reason I have not is because I also have a house bunny (runs around freely 80% of the time) and he is very curious so I have to close the toilet seat.  If I don't he might jump in and drown knowing how crazy my little buns is.|`|UVnr7wrmaa	It would be a GREAT thing of value and would save me running around going, "EW! EW! EW!" for an hour and then having to clean it up for another hour. And I would definitely be less grossed out because I wouldn't have to do a thing. <br>  <br>  It'd totally be worth it. I'm all for it. When can you see my kitty?|`|NGmRMqe6aa	I have never bought a cat in my life they are all rescues. Now if you could train a man to clean the cat box I might be interested.|`|wWdMcbvGaa	I think it would be frickin awesome, but my cats poop outside so it wouldnt be of any value to me.<br>  you should try it though|`|70kh6VSoaa	that's what America needs is another reason to sit they're fat *** on the couch and eat cheese puffs.|`|QczEdd5qaa	The cat?<br>  <br>  Yeah it might be valuable<br>  <br>  I wouldn't waist a lot of money just because im lazy, though|`|6T3NcrB0aa	Well I'm sure you have seen other cats being toilet trained.  Its not really very difficult at all.  It takes patience on your part.  And while it seems like less fuss, at first its actually more work than you think.  We feel the rewards are worth it though.<br>  <br>  For us, we thought of training out cat Cougar for these reasons.  He is also a Bengal and only 8 months old.<br>  1.  its much cleaner for the cat and the house.  no trails of litter.<br>  2. does not smell or take any additional space.<br>  3. its cleaner for the environment<br>  4. its less expensive.  you could easily spend over 400$ a year on litter.<br>  <br>  <br>  So far he has been in training for about 2 months.  He is almost done.  You can check him out in the practical training section of the website below.|`|yVbguDvbaa	OMG I would line up for it in a second!!!  I love my cats but cleaning out the litter box always chokes me up, but if there was a way to not ever have to fool with it, that'd be great!|`|KrDin6i6aa	that would be the best thing that would happen, and i would save so much time and it would really worth it.|`|qIPtpjgwaa	WOW<br>  But no one in our house like the cats that's why i will not buy the cat...<br>  HAHAHAHAHA|`|Hzv5jiVLaa	ok listen,<br>  if you cant clean the cat box then you shouldnt get/have a cat<br>  simple as that|`|KwWdfFObaa	I think that would be hilarious! hahaha|`|l7rn9zE9aa	Wow, I'd have one less chore around the house now wouldn't I?
pyqgEbmsaa	Well since Yorkie Poos aren't a real breed, they are a mutt dog.. I would go with the real dog.. the Yorkshire Terrier.|`|tQN4lGKOaa	only you can decide that|`|PM23RDycaa	If you plan on going to a breeder - A Yorkie.

I92BlGL3aa	tell him no in a firm voice and put him back in his cage. when he doesn't bite u when u pet him, give a reward. parrots are smart birds, and will eventually learn. but u should be able to tell when he gets uncomfortable with ur petting, and know when a bite will come. all u have to do is pet him for a really short time, like a few seconds, and if he doesn't bite u, give him a treat. if he bites even once during the few seconds, put him back in his cage. keep repeating this untill u get a long enough petting time. hope i helped!!|`|wEiHz1Llaa	Yes this is correct- Say 'NO" in a FIRM voice- each time he is biting you- and touch his beak- so he "knows that Biting" is Not acceptable ! Do NOT hit him. Just "touch" his beak !!!! Put him in his cage- when he bites after you have said "No" in a firm voice (do not use any other works ) , take him out about 2-3 minutes later. To him - that's like 10 -15 minutes. Then take him back out- if he bites again- "NO" in a FIRM Voice, then "Touch" his beak, and repeat no, back in the cage he goes ! a couple more minutes ! I know for a FACT- he NEVER will bite you again- after about 2 hours of this repeatedly No, and back in his cage !! He is Smart- and do understand- so be Patient- it is so Worth it !!!<br>  <br>  We have just trained our Bunny @ 13 weeks Not 2 Bite his Brother, who is 3 weeks Younger- by doing this exact method. It took just almost an hour- He no longer bites him !!  A Firm no, can go a Long way !!<br>  <br>              Good Luck.............Chewy and HipHop|`|DLdhD9Qaaa	Well, it is not the bird's fault. Read its body language of bitting and back off, don't train him to be a bitting bird, however to deter him from bitting, do not pull away when the bird bites, instead, push him back(gently though) he will be surprised and shocked. Do this everytime he bites and I bet won't do it again.If the bird bites while perch on your hand wiggle and turn your wrist few degrees until the bird get unbalance and let go your hand. Be consistent and the bitting should cease. Hope that will help!!|`|UXfvkl9gaa	quakers have HUGE egos if you didnt notice and its realy hard to get them to stop my quaker is hand raised so i dont have no problem with him,but if hes bitting just blow on him.if hes knew he will do this because he is new.good luck!|`|MFgT6fg2aa	simple, but painful.  everytime he bites calmly but sharply say no and put him back in his cage. This will tell him its bad to bite
nZg00MQOaa	hi,<br>  <br>  to know what type of dog will suit you, you can use this dog finder match up <a href="http://dogtime.com/matchup/start" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/matchup/start</a><br>  the goal here is to help you figure out what type of dog best suits your personality and lifestyle. The results of the match up will suggest certain breeds.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|WJUxHXsAaa	if you like cuddly dogs then one like shaggy dog. if you like small ones i prefer a chuawa. if you like athletic then get a golden retriever. i hope oo helped.|`|RQWyYV6Laa	A toy dog that way you can split it in half if you break up and you wouldn't have caused any distress to an innocent dog.|`|ALAmdtZVaa	For sure check out the shelter. If your looking for a pure breed, the SPCA usually has them. Those animals truly need homes. Mutts tend to be more interesting and beautiful!|`|isF1nhVfaa	A dog is a big commitment, like a child. So a three week relationship probably isn't the best place to bring in a new dog. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, living together for a few months, and have recently gotten a hamster. Start small. Things can go sour very fast, and why take that out on a helpless pet?<br>  <br>  BUT if you have confidence in your relationship, then by all means, go for it. I wish nothing but the best for you.<br>  <br>  Local shelters are always the best place to go. There are many lovely and deserving animals there!|`|RwQmN7Reaa	I think that English and French bulldogs are absolutely lovely breeds, they don't get to large and they are quite friendly and love to snuggle. They wouldn't so much enjoy running as much as a walk and because of their shortened nasal passages they can't breathe as easily on long walks or runs. But in general they make a good pet for a small yard and they love snuggling with their owners.|`|AA11501528	Maltese is a super sweet toy breed so are the malti- mixes.  Just be careful of the "breeders" that mix the breeds to make a buck.  They don't have the health of your new baby at heart.  Poodles are great too, lots of energy and no shedding!!  Papillons are great active dogs, they don't get really big so for an active home they are awesome!|`|RdSNb1Xraa	I really dont think you should be getting a dog when you have only been going out a few weeks.<br>  Try your local shelter, most shelters let you take a dog home for a trial basis and they will help you find the perfect dog for you in regard to space, grooming, temperament ect<br>  <br>  plus they are usually toilet trained!!|`|KJnNxlz2aa	NONE !     You just met the guy and already moved in with him? What where you thinking. A pet is a big commitment, wait until you 2 have been together at least 6 months then talk about getting a dog. Animals are not something you get on a whim to be re-homed when you 2 break up. You say you want a toy breed and yet you want it to go running with you? Toy breeds are not running companions, if you want a running dog get any type that gets at least 30 lbs. or more. When you 2 have been together at least 6 month and decide to look for a dog check out your local Humane Society.|`|I68m0kCraa	You do realize that a dog, on average is a 14 year commitment?<br>  Here's an alternative to puppy sized wedding ring...<br>  If you REALLY want a dog, try fostering.  If you are in a big city, you can foster dogs for guide dog centers and other specialized places or for smaller non-city rescue shelters.|`|rqOIqO7Raa	Any small breed would work well, I would not recommend a toy breed though, because it will not be able to run with you. What about a Sheltie? Sounded to me like you wanted to run with it!|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Get a mutt dog from the pound or shelter. They are not only nice dogs but they need a home, too.|`|98ZLBUSBaa	13" Beagle, <br>  Very loving, Great/Cheap Alarm System, Gets along well with other animals.<br>  I have one right now.|`|80S8U7Edaa	Pomeranians are the BEST!

Right now things are good between you but if things go all wrong & you split up who gets the dog?  Besides it is better to have two dogs than just one.  A play partner would very good for years to come.

hp157lNmaa	dogs will be dogs. sure they need some intervention at times but always seem to work things out themselves... the problem is the owners that treat their dog as if it is a human being. let them run, let them play, let them be DOGS! <br>  <br>  i totally understand what you're feeling. i have a german shepherd pup that just wants to play with other dogs... he is very active and other owners think he's trying to attack so they shield their dog but it only makes things worse.<br>  <br>  ugh! i cannot stand these prissy dog owners at the park.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	She needs obedience training as she doesn't know that what she is doing is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  It also has to do with other people's perception.  Those breeds have a bad rep because brain-dead human trash train them to fight and that is the only image some people have of them.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	I dont! I have chihuahuas and my boy is meaner than a pitt lol! I think it depends on the way they are raised! So blame the owners not the breed. Just never hit or let anyone one beat a dog it will make it mean! Good luck training!|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	I someone was going to hit my dog I think I would crack their skull. She is my baby, as long as your dog is truely not hurting anyone then you should not worry instead as soon as she starts playing explain how she is to the owners and makes sure it is ok. also you should read a training book and try to correct the behavior if she is doing anything wrong. But never let anyone lay there hand on your dog unless she is hurting another dog. Also always make sure you are watching her and managing her so nothing happens.|`|4SQx8smEaa	GRRR that makes me mad...no one has any right raising their hand to your dog....<br>  People feed into the media, that is the only reason why people think they are so nasty and mean.<br>  They refuse to be educated about the breed.<br>  <br>  Dangerous owners create dangerous dog....Chihuahua to a Great Dane and all in between can become aggressive if raised to be.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Sorry, but if your dog nipped mine at the dog park, I'd have an issue with it and want you to remove your dog.  It's aggressive behavior and not OK.  Your dog needs training and is asking for a dog fight bigger than she can handle.|`|WPYRSSlQaa	u need Cesar milan|`|5WgtYPv9aa	People seem to think that pits are mean but it's a stereo type it's just being itself they r known for being mean because of breeders and fighters people just don't no them as anything else.
IYd6bw7Gaa	There are several types of dwarf hamsters and there are are Syrians.  Basically any large breed of hamster is a Syrian.  The names you often see at pet stores are nicknames based on fur and color patterns.  I believe this would fall under Teddy Bear.  However, it is the same temperment as the Golden, Fancy, etc.<br>  <br>  A site I really like for hamster info is www.hamsterific.com|`|rEFMUCnZaa	Hay that looks like my hamster! Your hamster and my hamster are just Syrian Hamsters, there are many other names but if your hamster is big then it is a Syrian but if it is tiny and nippy sometimes then it is a dwarf hamster.|`|uobx1Gb5aa	That is a syrian hamster. pet stores call them "teddy bear hamsters" because they think that'd sell better than "syrian"|`|ZzUQ8Rn2aa	It's a female long-haired syrain (a.k.a. girl teddy bear)|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Syrian def! Look at the ears and nose. Ha ha ha<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	It's kind on hard to tell because of the lighting in pic. Might be a golden hamster.|`|Dxrnvvjbaa	Hmm, looks like a Teddy Bear! I love those!

mGN7wQ2Taa	i have been to the sac reptile expo, and it is not worth it. the last two times i have been there they sold nothing but bearded dragons and corn snakes.  you may find what you are looking for but it will most likely be  a bad quality specimen. i have never been to the anaheim expo, but i have heard good things.
tI0rkxeuaa	Bloody hell!!  Please don't tell me that's what American Bullies look like in the US.  Bletch!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Here in Australia, when you can find them as the government is trying to ban the breed not the ******* that use them for fighting, they look like the B&W pic in that video.<br>  <br>  The others just looked like Staffies.|`|CEENX0sDaa	how can you not like goldens!<br>  <br>  btw check out these funny dog videos on my channel<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/smjx216" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/smjx216</a>|`|WPYRSSlQaa	funny video|`|PM23RDycaa	The real deal APBT any day. My uncle has long since stopped breeding but when I asked him what he thought of all these bred down steroid looking dogs he had more than a few colorful things to say about them.
yLiOgVEYaa	it's normal kitty behavior, but the best thing to do is recognize and reward for his good behavior. when he's being bad, ignore him and show him you won't play with him. you can get him any kind of kitty treats, i like the ones that are good for the teeth. hope i helped and good luck!|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	Have you had him neutered?  Sometimes this will help.  But I once had a male cat who was very aggressive and generally a total butthead and he never changed.  It was just his unique personality, unfortunately.  We treated him well, but he didn't seem to appreciate it.  We had him 8 years.   Maybe your cat will become nicer when he is older, say in a couple of years.  Hope so.|`|ArKEBzYpaa	your cat is trying to be dominate you might calm them down with extra petting or put something like a pillow or cat bed up on a dresser or something higher{that they can climb to} it will make them feel Superior.  as for treats my baby's love Greenies and the cat milk at the grocery store|`|hDYkDRvYaa	1 thing to do is to give him space, i have a pretty mean cat too.  really really mean...im not joking(but he's cute,) <br>  tips:<br>  the best thing to do is give him space and interact with him slowly see what he does and doesn't like.<br>  ex: i know that my cat loves being pet on the head..&. hates being pet on his back...that results in scratches;D!!<br>  <br>  also try getting level with ur cat, size can intimidate him. be patient if your still and quite your cat will gain confidence with u. <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. u can always tell hows he's feeling by how much hes waving his tail.<br>  lots of wiggling means "give me some space!!"|`|OauZKhKVaa	Try giving him more treats! It's always worked for me. A lot of cats are just stand-offish all the time, though.
1Qh9i9cWaa	For a small tank I would recommend guppies and your smaller tetra species (Neons, Cardinals, Rummynose etc), perhaps a pair of corydoras and/or a whiptail catfish. They're an attractive, unusual species thats very active and friendly that wont grow too large. Dont go over the top with too many fish though - they dont like waste chemicals (ie ammonium, nitrite and nitrate)<br>  <br>  Bettas are excellent in smaller tanks as they dont need heating/ filtration/aeration (Well they dont need heating over here, but that depends on your climate!) Also remember that guppies and tetras can go without heating, but it is definitely not recommended as they hate temperature fluctuations and over time you'll find they are lethargic and every now and then you will often find one dead after a particularly cold morning. <br>  <br>  Other fish to consider are other livebearers - mollies, platies and swordtails<br>  <br>  Plants: Water weed, Anubias, Java Fern, Java Moss, Underwater clover ( rare and not occasionally seen), amazon sword plant, hygrophila, dwarf lily, anacharis...<br>  <br>  Note: Don't stuff all of this in your tank! :)|`|ntyeMPgOaa	Get a bigger tank.  the bigger, the more easy to care for and the more fun and cool fish you can have.  If your aren't tight on money, get into marine fish.  It is so freaking awesome.|`|LQcsiZlFaa	Plant : anacharis<br>  Fish: Neon tetra|`|pcvcMePXaa	well you could go with 2 dwarf gourmais and 6 neon tetras always looks nice and you could throw some shrimp in there|`|AtLdnZd5aa	breed ghost shrimp to feed the fish in a much larger tank
8cikAYp3aa	Look at Big Horn.  <a href="http://www.horsesaddleshop.com/draft-cordura-saddle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsesaddleshop.com/draft-cor...</a>  they make a draft  Draft-cross tree  which should work for a  horse that doesnt fit in a full QH tree.. As for the 19 inch seat... thats a custom order unless your measuring  differently then  most folks.  17 1/2 is pretty commonly the largest seat...Big horns last like nothing else.. my endurance model.. is 15 years old now and still looks brand new. Sad thing though the company stoped making saddles 10/2008.. so whats out there is all there is now.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I wonder if you are using seat size to try to find a saddle to properly fit your horse.  Fitting a horse has nothing to do with seat size, a 19" seat would be for a VERY large person.  A slim adult rider would use a 15 inch seat, no matter what horse, generally speaking.  As an example, I need a 17" western saddle to fit my 200 pound old woman who has had two kids butt. The seat size goes with the riders size.  Other issues, such as draft tree, QH tree (and there are several sizes of this) or arabian tree, are to fit the horse.<br>  <br>  No flames to me, please, I know that I am heavy, I was trying to "out" myself in an attempt to help the poster.|`|QPELJ5UKaa	hey.<br>  A lot of people are selling western saddles on horse council bc form. You could look there. A lot of QH horse owners have a wider tree. Also e-bay may help.  If you come up blank try your local tack store they may be able to order one in or have a second hand one. Other places to look are magazines, bulletins, post wanted ads as well. Good luck.|`|9LH3Dz5Laa	i have a 16hd QH who is HUGE he is built like a Percheron but is full QH and i have to have a draft horse size saddle for him, with a 17" seat so it looks better even though i ride in a 15" seat<br>  i found it on localhorse.com but you could place a wanted ad on craigslist or horsetopia too|`|sbB0TpGXaa	19 inch?  That is huge in a western saddle since they are measured differently and are 2 inches shorter than an english saddle.  The wider tree can be found in a draft horse saddle.  You can get one from country supply or from Tack South.  But where you are going to find a 19 inch saddle I do not know.
1hMgZZrmaa	I have a flame point siamese. They're really pretty, they have orange tabby markings where the brown usually is on a siamese, and my cat is cross-eyed like siamese cats =]<br>  <br>  My flame point was in a litter of stray kittens, and we adopted him about 7 years ago.|`|5LoWcL6Laa	serval cats...very expensive but freakin awesome!!...or just a free cat in need of saving...I have had my two for six years...saved one from a 7-11 and found one with a broken leg that we saved off the highway and I wouldn't trade them for any 1000 dollar cat because their personality and loyalty make them so beautiful to me....save from a shelter...don't buy.  Cat breeders tend to have lots of medical issues with the animals and you know expensive cats will find homes...save one of the less fortunate and get them fixed...there are so many beautiful cats in need of a home at the shelters!|`|m0a7Ox1maa	The best kind of cat is MY cat, the cutest cat is MY cat<br>  <br>  Moggy for the win!!!|`|KnwsvnTjaa	Rescue cats are the best!!|`|UVnr7wrmaa	I love persians! <br>  <br>  I have a 2 year old Russian Blue Tomcat called Bluey and he is sooooo cute! He's blue all over, but looks black. And he has one white spot under his chin, and when you scratch him he goes into a ball and purs. And when he's happy he dribbles like tears. It's sooo cute. And the best thing is, he's not vicious. If you started hurting him he'd let you do it, even if it hurt him. And he never bites, which is a bonus. I love my kitty :]|`|NGmRMqe6aa	The best kind of cat MINE, . The cutest MINE. The one I like best MINE. Get my drift?|`|QL56syElaa	Yes I LOVE black cats... I own 2!..But there not the cutest..I also have a white cat.I think white cats are cutest!|`|P3pZ4bY3aa	A Black and White Maine Coon
1Qh9i9cWaa	I've never seen this on my betta, but it sounds like something I say on my molly. I treated the tank he was in with RidIch, and it was gone in 24 hours. I did a repeat dosage though, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  It definitely sounds like a fungus, on the face it could be a mouth fungus, but ich can be any were on the body. A general fungus med should do the trick. I usually use a strong ich med though. <br>  <br>  Definitely empty his bowl, no flooring, as many Meds can stain his "toys". Boil your rocks and ceramic ornaments if the bowl has any.  Don't use any soaps or other harsh chemicals unless you have a neutralizer. If you can get your hands on some thiosulfate, this is what I use as a bleach neutralizer. You just basically want to clean all his things so he won't reinfect himself.<br>  <br>  Also, try upping his temp to 80-82 degrees and adding some aquarium salt. Both will help make the water less hospitable for virus,bacteria and parasites and help him to fight off whatever is ailing him. In fact, heat and salt treatments, when properly used, have been known to treat ich w/out meds.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	If hes in a bowl, hes dying. There is no reason for any fish to ever be in a bowl. Its extremely cruel.<br>  <br>  It sounds like some type of fungus, but you wont be curing that in a bowl.<br>  <br>  lmao at people who dont like my answer.|`|AA11708471	put any fish in a bowl and it's dying <br>  <br>  bettas need atleast 5 gallons filtered and heated|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Your betta needs a larger tank. He needs at least 2.5 gallons and a heater|`|AtLdnZd5aa	yes take him to dr. flush
fZCfJWpOaa	First of all, congratulations on your new pet, kudos for adopting an adult dog, and a nod for you seeing this problem quickly after getting your new pet.  ^.^ <br>  <br>  Dogs use a pack mentality.  The dog is probably friendly to you because they consider you and your wife to be part of his new pack.  I don't know what his history was before he got to you, but whoever had him before let him act aggressively towards people not in the "pack".  This is very dangerous, not only for your neighbors but also your family (with your example with your wife).  Someone could get hurt if it goes on or isn't corrected.  The barking can escalate to something worse.  But don't worry!  It can be solved and corrected!<br>  <br>  I would get a trainer who has experience with dog aggression as soon as possible, this week if you can.  Now is the time to start to train your new addition.  An experienced dog trainer will be able to tell you what type of classes are appropriate for you both (individual, group, socialization, etc).  You may have to go to individual classes at first until the trainer feels the dog is ready for groups.  <br>  <br>  I had to deal with a similar situation with our rescue dog, and now I can trust him around others.  Looking back, there was no way I could have solved the problems without the trainer's advice and guidance.  Please do not go to pet store trainers, like Petsmart.  I worked there for several years and their training program is mediocre at best, and they don't have the training for dog aggression.  It will cost you a bit to go, but you'll feel so much better about your new pet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	hmm... look into obedience class, and take him to the vet as well. but he should grow out of it :/ depends on the age...|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	you dont know this dogs history...BABY TALK works wonders and you seriously need to get him trained.....go to the library or look online for training tips....you will have problems if you dont and it isnt the fault of the dog it is the owners who never trained him when he was younger so you have to do it...all dogs need to be trained...they love it.....|`|RvddYKqjaa	He's got so much new stuff to get used to.

I had a neighbor that had a dog tied up on a chain and it was bored and all it did was bark bark bark I have dogs and I dont like them to bark and they dont lol I guess that if your neighbor wont recpect you|`|tPGxPDvBaa	There are noise ordinances for every place I know of. Call & write complaints to the AC & police.  There is no reason besides laziness on the part of your neighbor as to why she cannot keep dog in for a certain length of time or to  quiet dog when it is outdoors. You can make any dog stop barking & dog doesn't need to be outside for lengthy periods of time. She simply doesn't care.<br>  <br>  You might try a white noise machine or run a fan or something to help muffle noise plus sound deafening drapes.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	While I understand your problem. Have you ever blocked it out?<br>  Right now you're so angry and frustrated from having no escape that you're getting angrier and more anxiety ridden and focusing only on the problem..<br>  <br>  Block it out of your mind. Concentrate on something pleasant. Turn soothing music on, cover your head with your blankets, use ear plugs and snooze. It can be done if you use your will power.<br>  <br>  Eventho the problem is the dog, you're making it worse and not thinking of things that you could do to remedy the problem from your end.<br>  <br>  The dog barks because it's bored.

So it's not like it's outside, all day barking?<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I'd tell you the same thing.  I let my dog out several times during the day.  Sometimes, yes he will bark, and yes, I will go try to curb that but there's no way I could make him NEVER bark during the day.  And there is no way you could ever convince me to try to make him.  I have a dog so it will bark when somethings out of order.  And so long as he's not out there barking every second ... it's not fair for anyone to complain.<br>  <br>  Now if the dog is outside banking it's head off all day, that's one thing, but a few barks here and there, yea, I understand how annoying that would be but you just can't expect someone to keep their dog indoors all day and to make sure it never barks when it's out.  That's being unreasonable.|`|nZg00MQOaa	Most often, barking results from boredom, fear, or frustration.<br>  <br>  If you don't hear him do it, but you hear about it from neighbors, it's likely your dog barks out of boredom when you're not around. In short, he enjoys barking--it's a way to occupy himself when he's left alone.<br>  <br>  Fear barking, on the other hand, is a stress response. It's caused by something unknown to the dog, such as a sudden noise or another dog's bark. Fear barking can also result from sights and sounds a dog finds disconcerting, like skateboards or sirens. In these cases, dogs bark to send a clear message to whatever's scaring them: Stay away!<br>  <br>  A third type is frustration barking. This occurs when the dog is denied access to something he desperately wants, such as a favorite toy, a piece of steak, or the terrier on the other side of the fence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a treatment <a href="http://dogtime.com/barking.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/barking.html</a>|`|ivIQl6Awaa	Most cities have a by-law about barking.  Try calling the city, and ask about it.  By-law where I live totally deals with barking dogs as a public disturbance, not the police.  It is totally her fault - like yours, dogs don't "just bark"  they bark cause they are bored.  Good luck!|`|EZLuVfKoaa	Squirt the dog with a hose,if that don't work squirt your neighbor with the hose.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Be honest with your neighbor about the problem and share this very useful website, <a href="http://dogtime.com/barking.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/barking.html</a>|`|HmPivTTcaa	Dogs owners are RESPONSIBLE for ensuring their pets do NOT create a nuisance by barking - there is no excuses. Your neighbour can use things like pig's ears, Kong toys, other toys, excercise and bones to keep the dog quiet. If necessary, a citronella collar can be used to train the dog not to bark.<br>  <br>  You have done the right thing by confronting your neighbour. Suggest these things to her and explain that this simply MUST STOP. If the dog continues to bark, call either your local Council or Animal Control (depending on which country you live in). <br>  <br>  You should not have to tolerate the dog's barking, regardless of whether you are sleeping or not - it is the owner's responsibility to ensure the dog is not a nuisance. Good luck my friend.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	Wow I can't believe your neighbor is being so rude about it, yes true dogs bark but she needs to be able to control her dogs barking at least to some degree if she's going to be living in a place where she has neighbors. Does the dog bark strictly just during the day time. I guess for one I have never heard that they can only enforce that rule during the day time but anyways, even if you're not home at night if the dog is still barking I think you should report it during the night time too. Eventually your rude neighbor and the police will get sick of hearing complaints and maybe they will finally do something about it. I am so sorry about your circumstances and I also am a dog lover but completely agree that just because you sleep differently that other people you shouldn't have to suffer because your neighbor can't control her dog.|`|et1bE7c2aa	This is gonna take a lot to accomplish.  We had a similar situation, we called in an estimate to sound proof the bedroom windows and bedroom, then took it to the neighbor's, in the mean time, we called in the help of someone to tape the sound of the dog barking on several occasions throughout the day. After taking the evidence to the neighbor, she refused to help, So we are taking her to small claims court but don,t know the out come yet.  Definite last resort.
5vI7VQXIaa	No it does not go away on its own it needs to be treated by a vet, and it is contagious to other dogs. You may notice it more when she get excited or when she just wakes up. If you haven't heard it much than it may not be kennel cough but the vet much make that decision. If it is for sure then get it treated asap or your dog can develop further problems.Most vet that vaccinate for it will cover treatment for free. And even though your dog gets vaccinated for it he can still get it from just stepping outside since it is like the human flu, and strains change all the time.|`|0ef3O2m6aa	Yes, they can get a "mild case'  it is just a doggy cold.  The problem comes in when a secondary bacterial infection sets in and causes pnemonia.  Supportive care is all you can do for a dog with KC unless there is an infection present, then antibiotics are warranted.  KC is a virus and needs to run its course.  usually a self limiting virus BUT can be lethal to young pups and geriatric dogs, they tend to develop pnemonia with it.<br>  <br>  If she is fine then leave her be but if she continues to cough take her to the vet.  Also, if she is going to doggy daycare I would definatley keep her UTD on bordetella vacc so she doesn't risk getting sick in the future.|`|lmSffrNuaa	Most cases of kennel cough go away on their own, but some doctors will prescribe antibiotics in hopes of killing the Bordetella organism. You can also give the infected dog vet-approved cough suppressants to provide comfort while he battles the illness. Your veterinarian may prescribe a combination of antibiotics and cough suppressants for optimal comfort and recovery time.<br>  <br>  Here's more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/kennel-cough-in-dogs-vin.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/kennel-cough-in-dogs-...</a>|`|q7GBzr6yaa	No Go to the vet|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Yes kennel cough can go away on its own. However it is not wise to allow it leave on its own. <br>  <br>  You need to see a vet to make sure it is kennel cough and to make sure your dog gets the best care while they are not feeling their best.|`|RdSNb1Xraa	Ive never had any problems with kennel cough, so dont really know if it "goes away on its own"<br>  I would suggest that you take your dog to the vet, just for a checkup, just to be safe<br>  you probably should have taken her when you first noticed it, <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|RvddYKqjaa	I've heard of dogs getting this after being around some other dogs. I really thought it was something a vet had to treat. If she hasn't coughed once today, I don't think I would worry about it. If it comes back, then call your vet and ask if you should bring her in.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Take her to the vet
RvddYKqjaa	Brush your clothing before you put it in the washer. You should try to get as much off as you can. As far as I know, detergent has nothing to do with it. They are all just soap. Just curious if you are putting too many things in your washer at once.  Generally the air doesn't cling like that after washing, but I shake the clothing well first.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Detergents are for cleaning not removing hair. Shaking your clothes before & maybe add a liquid fabric softener to wash.  It might help to remove hairs in the dryer better than the sheets. Most of the hair on my clothes comes out during the dryer not the washer.|`|1ae6d8e46250220b7c0acad60842c7c4aa	yea theres this stuff called natures miracle, and they have laundry detergent. it works great, you can buy it at petco.|`|GaL66jbQaa	nope remember to clean your lint trap often that helps.  lint brushing your clothes is the best bet.
RdSNb1Xraa	Some people will argue that it "interferes" with the dogs masculinity, however i will say that those people are idiots.<br>  If your dog is not a stud dog, and up to breed standard then please neuter him asap<br>  there is also studies that show that unneutered dogs have a MUCH higher rate of testicular (sp?) cancer the older they get|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	I wouldn't think so, but too young can be a problem it has to be a couple months old before it can be done.  <br>  <br>  I'm getting my german shepherd fixed when he's about 1 1/2 years old. The testosterone is good for his growth, he wont be full grown until he's 2 but 1 1/2 should be old enough. But I've got to have maximum control on him while he gets older. <br>  <br>  If your getting a dog from a shelter, most of the time they are already fixed or require getting fixed when they are adopted out. <br>  <br>  Not fixing your dog can lead to a higher chance of getting cancer.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	As long as they are healthy! Any age is fine!|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Not really, no. It can actually be quite beneficial at any age, as far as things like aggressiveness, testicular cancer, and marking are concerned. The main thing you have to worry about is how well the dog will do under anesthesia. Generally speaking, most dogs will be just fine, unless they are sickly or very old. Most vets offer pre-anesthesia bloodwork, which can usually be done as soon as a week before the actual procedure, and this usually tests their liver, heart, kidneys, etc. The bloodwork more often than not can tell you whether or not your doggie is "fit" for a neuter or not. But, all in all, it is much better for your dog that he be neutered. Good luck!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	No.  The only time it's a problem is if the dog is not healthy enough for surgery or anesthesia.|`|0LxgeSJnaa	no<br>  <br>  sooner the better<br>  <br>  but it really doesnt matter|`|ivIQl6Awaa	it is never too late.|`|GX40df3yaa	The earlier you get it done, the more likely they wont mark their territory.

qOiv8d3Laa	There are many misconceptions about cats and milk.<br>  <br>  SOME cats are lactose intolerant, just as some humans are.  It doesn't mean that milk will kill the cat, only that they have a difficult time digesting the milk sugars (lactose).  But MOST cats are not lactose intolerant.<br>  <br>  IF your cat is lactose intolerant, clinical symptoms typically appear within 30 minutes but may take up to 1-2 hours depending on other foods and activities and can vary in severity or which symptoms appear most predominently (symptoms of nausea, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence).  Notice NONE of them include DEATH!<br>  <br>  My cats drink milk ALL the time and have NO problems with it.  However IF your cat IS lactose intolerant, you can deal with this just as in humans (see Wikipedia article below).  There is lactose-free milk available in the food stores.  CHEESE is great for cats, and they love it... but be sure it's AGED cheese.  The Aging process converts the lactose and eliminates the intolerance problem (i.e. aged cheddar cheese).<br>  <br>  So, please, don't freak out if your cat drank milk.  Just keep an eye on him for the symptoms and deal with it accordingly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|cj31x3UMaa	might give her diarrhea - hard to digest.

XurYYreBaa	Wow, it sounds like you've already earned Ophelia's trust.  Every rat is different but it often takes a couple weeks before they relax & feel @ home with a new person.  The fact that she doesn't poop on you anymore means she's no longer nervous when you handle her.  Now she'll only do this if she can't help it.<br>  Ophelia should learn her name before long & will come when you call *if* she feels like it.  Rats are kinda like cats in this regard.<br>  Some rats sneeze a lot in a new environment.  Since you've lived with other rodents you probably know that cedar & pine beddings are bad.<br>  Rats are very clean & groom themselves several times a day.  They also groom each other & Ophelia might groom you too.<br>  Yes, we let our rats climb on us, ride our shoulders, go shirt-diving & some of them like to climb onto my head.  No "accidents" up there so far.  We also take 1 or 2 rats with us to the pet store or other places where animals are welcome.

Rw7gi86Naa	They all are domestic shorthair. Tabby, tuxedo and calico are not breeds; they are words used to describe the color and pattern.<br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|OQSdjIcoaa	Adorable cats :D|`|AA10954497	How cute!

The ones that trot along behind you but aren't grabbing your pant leg while you walk are usually the middle of the road pups.  I'll avoid pups that are shy, avoid pups that are chewing my feet and then spend a little time with the middle of the road guys.  <br>  <br>  Something I've found is that puppies who fetch naturally, are easier to train in like ... every area.  And at 8 weeks, you can take a soft toy throw it just a couple of inches (like still close enough for you to reach) in front of a pup and see if it fetches or not.  A well balanced puppy will bring the toy back to you so you'll play with it some more.  If the pup runs off with the toy, he's independent, if the pup comes to you instead of chasing, it's low on drive.<br>  <br>  That's sorta how I pick pups anyway.

Dominance can be assertained by watching them eat and play. The dominant pup will try to mount his siblings and push them out of the way at the food bowl. When interacting with you, he may also be mouthy and may bark at you if you ignore him. Avoid that pup. Also avoid the pup that shows no interest in saying hello. It may never pay attention to you later in life.<br>  <br>  Test number two involves picking a puppy up in your arms and cradling him on his back. This is uncomfortable and it is natural for a pup to try to right itself. The ones to choose are either the ones who struggle and then relax, or remian relaxed the entire time. Avoid the ones that panic; the pups that try to bite, scream, or never stop struggling. This dog may never be able to calm itself.<br>  <br>  Test three involves dropping a ring of keys on a hard surface. The ones that are surprised but the imediatly investigate are the ones to look at. The ones too spooked to check the keys out are the dogs that may panic at any loud noise later in life and should be avoided.<br>  <br>  The last test is touch sensitivity; the most important one for small kids. Gently pinch the skin between the pups toes (don't use your fingernails) gently but steadily apply pressure untill the pup jerks away. The proper reaction is to pull away, but immediatly relax and forgive you. Avoid the ones that scream and try to bite. Pups that can take a good deal of pressure are a plus as it will take a bit for your kids to hurt them.<br>  <br>  Submission is not always the same as fear. The pup that always defers to authority is not always a bad thing. Its the pup that cowers and moves away with its tail between its legs that you need to beware of. This behavior is used in submissive displays, but the pup that always does this at the slightest aproach has a fear problem and should be avoided.<br>  <br>  Also check out both parents. If one seems to be acting in a way that does not seem right, avoid that breeders pups.<br>  <br>  Breed can also be a big factor in your dogs behavior with kids. Generaly the bigger the dog, the better. Avoid the toy breeds and terriers. Very few of these dogs are good with kids. While labs and other retrievers will always be suggested, these are touch-insensitive dogs who like to say hello by tackling you. They may never intentionally hurt a child, but the temptation to get rowdy with you kids is often too much for them.

They are all different.<br>  Mine likes green leafy things, and carrots and apples, and that's it.  He especially likes cilantro, too.<br>  The grass you give me?--> I buy a mini bale of Timothy Hay for my little furry friend.  Don't get alfalfa.  That is not fed regularly.<br>  Then each day, he has a bowl of dried guinea pig food, a large handful of Timothy Hay (they can eat as much of that as they want)<br>  and a large bottle of water. (it depends--my piggie likes water, some don' t drink as much), and of course, he gets two bunches of treats (the fresh green stuff or fruits) a day. <br>  Now, each piggie is different, but that is a general idea of the feeding.<br>  when you say grass, I hope you mean Timothy Hay.

1XLZdOcQaa	Barking is actually normal and natural to all dogs. Dogs would bark a lot if they feel fear, frustration, boredom or loneliness.<br>  <br>  Here's where you can learn a lot about dobermans. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/skv.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/skv.html</a><br>  <br>  Here's a link about dog Barking <br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s35.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s35.html</a>|`|AA12273993	It depends what you mean by heaps. All dogs bark, some bark at anything some bark for a reason. All the dobermans I have had have always bark for a reason, alerting to the presence of something. Although I assume there are many dobes that are either bored, obsessive or untrained that will bark at everything.|`|91bc8f7af8a2e6f4965f513a93ab0ad5aa	Yes they can bark heaps. They are bred to guard their family, home and be a companion. They will bark whenever they think something is amiss, unless you teach them the difference between whats appropriate and whats not. Many people make the mistake of getting a dog bred for that purpose and then expect them not to bark at things that other breeds would ignore.

Not domesticated, they don't run up to you and greet you when they see you. Wagging their tails. They are grown to be eaten. Simple as that. We have no remorse because they aren't human beings.

XurYYreBaa	A 10 gallon tank would be much too small for so many rats.  <br>  If the male is still with the females, separate him before the pups are born or the females could become pregnant again which isn't good for the moms or the babies.  Also it's possible for the male to hurt the babies.  If he's lonely he should have another male for company & when the pups are 5 weeks old you can introduce his sons to him.<br>  If the females get along well they can stay together, but not in a 10 gallon tank.  The average rat litter is about 8 babies but it's possible that both your girls could have more than 20 pups *each*.<br>  For extra warmth, give your rats extra bedding & nesting material.  Also, put a couple cardboard boxes in their tank.  Empty tissue boxes will do & the babies will probably be born in one of the boxes.<br>  Keep your girls as stress free as possible & make sure they have lots of good food & fresh water.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	In the wild they do themselves just fine. They do not need your help.|`|ahS4TuSEaa	It is VERY important that BOTH mothers understand that there will be room and food for their babies. If you leave them in the same aquarium, the mother will kill her own babies for fear that there will not be enough room or food.  Put cotton and kleenex around both moms to keep her and the babies warm.<br>  <br>  You need two large boxes (3 feet x 3 feet) for your 2 moms.  I would keep the 2 litters apart until the babies have fur and are walking around.  At that point, you can bring all the rats together.|`|mVhiJIw0aa	you should get towels and when your rats are in labor set them on them, when they give birth have a towel ready to dry off, and warm up the babies, have your house warm the day of birth keep it in separate rooms, and when all of the new rats come out dry off your two girl rats then take them to a vet or if you know anyone who is a vet have them be over when the big day is. im no vet but i hope this will help you.|`|W8AuurXuaa	I dont think you need to do anything they reproduce just fine on their own.. but i would sperate them because you gonna have like  5 million rats pretty soon

He wasn't fat, just big.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	If he doesn't sit around all day and night he might be ok. But lazy cats are unhealthy and wont be around as long!|`|SnanuNKiaa	Not at all. My Calico is 14 pounds and very healthy. its just a side effect of nuetering. if a vet doesn't see anything wrong with it then i wouldn't worry.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Yes, cats can suffer from diabetes as well as thyroid problems, but just because you have a large cat, doesn't mean he's suffering from either of those diseases.  I have a male cat that weighs 20 lbs. and another that weighs 19 lbs.  And, they are NOT fat.  They are just large cats.  Now, if your cat is simply fat, that's another issue all together.  But if he looks and feels healthy, then he's probably fine.  If he looked out of proportion or appeared too fat, I'm sure the vet would have recommended that you put him on a reduced calorie diet since obesity is as harmful to our pets as it is to us.  Sounds like you're cat is just right.|`|AA10859773	It can be normal.  I have a 19 pound cat, and she's only a pound or two overweight.

If he's medium or long-haired, you'll have to feel him up.<br>  <br>  Or just call your vet or even go back for a checkup.  Ask them outright how they feel about his weight.<br>  <br>  Or how about posting a pic?  <br>  <br>  If it turns out you need diet advice, see my blog:  <a href="http://runeamok.multiply.com/journal/item/24/WEIGHT_LOSS_FOR_CATS" rel="nofollow">http://runeamok.multiply.com/journal/ite...</a>|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I have 4 of them!

I would suggest doing some in depth research on your cat's breed. I have a "heavy" cat of my own and she is perfectly healthy. Yes, there is such thing as feline diabetes and thyroid conditions and those would be good to check out but as long as he's active, happy, and eating/drinking correctly he should be fine. As I always recommend, it never hurts to check with a vet about your worries with your animals.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	If he actually fat? Or just a big cat? I have three 19 pounders that don't have an ounce of fat on them. They are just large built cats. <br>  <br>  Cats are all different, just like humans and other animals.

And any dog can be well behaved if the owner does what they need to.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	They are great dogs. A very loving, loyal, intelligant breed. But they also are energetic and need to be trained.
q7GBzr6yaa	Make your own! The sell paterns at joannes or even some wal mart stores! You can buy one pattern and make tons in different patterns and home make necklaces with beads! Homemade doggie treats! Human nail polish, baby hair bows if it has long hair!|`|mpb07ADUaa	I think spoiling a dog really just comes down to feeding them a high quality diet, providing necessary attention, exercise and training, as well as needed veterinary care - considering that too many dogs go through life living at the end of a chain, eating cheap grocery-store bought kibble and being denied veterinary care, etc.  <br>  <br>  My dogs are quite spoiled, but I don't buy them furniture, studded collars or perfume... I do admit that I am going to buy my short-haired dogs each a sweater, but I think what your sister is doing is rather overboard and, well, just ridiculous. I honestly would not call that "spoiling".<br>  <br>  Anyways, to "cheaply", or, inexpensively spoil your dog, have your sister take her for a car ride, take her to a local park or spend some time at a dog-friendly public place for your dog to enjoy new sights, sounds and meet some nice people. Dogs do not care about how much you spend on them, dogs do not care about accessories or styled beds, they're more focused on their loved ones and exploring the world around them.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Oh, so when you say "spoil the dog" you really mean "please yourself."<br>  <br>  Because spoiling a dog involves lot of playtime, walks and things like that.  Not playing dress up.<br>  <br>  Really, if you want something to dress up, put the dog on a leash, walk it to the store and buy a doll.|`|yUkFvtudaa	I don't think they really care about the material things...although when mine get a new shirt or jacket (it's cold here) they get excited.  Lots and lots of love is spoiling.  But now that I think about it, they always check my bags when I get home from shopping...hmmm. :)|`|MGihRO3baa	nail polish, clothes? I don't think the dog really benefitting from that. I'd consider a dog spoiled if he gets lots of love and attention, gets lots of walks, and has plenty of toys to play with.<br>  <br>  :)|`|nBehRANyaa	Your sister needs a doll.<br>  <br>  My definition of spoiling a dog?  Lots of walks, lots of playtime, and lots of fun training.|`|5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	Read how pet food is made. . .the truth and then get him some good food.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Just love your dog.  Here are the ways you may show to him how much you love him/her:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://xrl.us/beg8a5" rel="nofollow">http://xrl.us/beg8a5</a>|`|p3ENMmilaa	Give your dog lots of love!!!! Thats what will really spoil him! But also you can get fabric and stuffing and just sew random shapes and stuff them. My dog always tears his toys apart in a matter of minutes but this way its cheap to keep replacing them!|`|O6SBsgO8aa	That is not spoiling the dog.  She is spoiling herself with all that stuff.  The dog could care less as long as it is fed, watered and loved,  that is all they need (other than exercize)|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	easy way:bake a small batch of home made dog-biscuits every week,note,which one was the dogs favourite?<br>  just buy some flour,a few eggs,may add peanut butter or almond butter?may add a week later a banana,honey?<br>  dogs also like molasses!<br>  we baked dog biscuits with flour,water,and cod liver(sold in a can) it was so stinky-like cod fish.The dogs loved it!<br>  bake cookies on a sheet at 350c|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	the essentials for a dog are okay if you can afford them. spoiling a dog does not always cost money. Playing with the dog is probably more exciting for your dog, tell your sister to get some squeaky toys and start teaching your dog to fetch.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	The way i see a spoiled dog is not by how much accessories you buy the pooch. A dog could care less about that stuff. The best way to spoil a dog is to let it sleep in your bed. Let it sleep and hang out with you on the furniture. You feed it the best food on the market without any by-products. You keep the dog properly groomed and clean and nails kept short. You take the dog everywhere with you that will allow dogs in public places. You provide proper Veterinary care. And most importantly you shower your dog with love and kisses every chance you get. A happy dog is a healthy one.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Your sister is an idiot. Like someone said get her a doll!<br>  We spoil our dogs with huge bones every afternoon, play tug-o-war with them and maybe run around and play with them for a good hour to 2hours. (cant really do much due to one having an injury at the moment and the other one just doesnt want to play!) but as for nail polish, PERFUME??? studded collars?. Your sisters a joke!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Spoiling doesn't always mean spending money.  It means treating your dog with kindness, proper vet care, exercise, training and lots of love.|`|1JsZbgyFaa	Lots of LOVE!
rqOIqO7Raa	1st you must be able to prove you are responsible enough to care for a dog and not get bored with it after it grows. 2nd, you have to prove that financially you will be able to participate in vet bills,food,toys..etc. <br>  <br>  I think most parents don't want to get their kids a dog because they know you well enough to know that once its not so new, you will have no interest in it and they will end up taking care of it. You just have to prove rather then persuade!|`|p3ENMmilaa	What worked with my parents was showing them that I was really responsible and I would be able to care for on my own. You could see if they'd go for letting you foster a dog for a while to prove this then you could get a puppy of your own. Or just take them to the pet store and make them hold and play with the puppies there, maybe you'll get lucky and one of your parents will fall in love with one of them and let you take it home!|`|eZKF2Q7taa	lawlz im 12 yrs. old 4 rlz. and i tried to persuade them but they say no 2. But if ur lucky enough like me ur parents frend mite find a stray dog and can give it to you but you have to REELY BEG for the stray. And Also if your'e willing 2 , maybe you can make a deal with your parents...|`|PM23RDycaa	There is no way. And you don't get a dog to spoil it. That is the reason why there are so many people will ill behaved dogs mostly small dogs that are barker, biters etc.<br>  <br>  Your parents have laid down the law NO DOGS. Your sister needs to stop bothering them about it. Its annoying and lacks maturity. Her reason for wanting a dog show she's not ready for a dog yet anyways.<br>  <br>  ADD: They bought one dog for the family and that is enough in their eyes. your sister will just have to wait til she's an adult.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Listen, if you have to convince your parents to get you another dog, then you are obviously not old enough to care for the dog yourself, pay all the expenses for the dog, give the dog the necessary medical care he needs, pay for all his food and medications or flea and tick preventative, or afford any other emergency expenses the dog may encounter during his life time.  This would all be the responsibility of your parents so if they do not want this additional expense, you will just have to wait until you are on your own and can afford to purchase, and care for your own pet.  Sorry, but you just can't get everything you want in life.|`|HGLdQgpEaa	It took me a bunch of years to convince them, I will be getting a Sibe puppy soon. <br>  First of all to persuade them I had to show I was responsible, I would put my lil baby to sleep when they were away and take care of her. I also had to get my grades high enough so that they would approve. Talk to your parents about it, show that you are responsible enough to have one. You could also if you have a friend who owns a dog go practice and show how you are responsible by walking, bathing, grooming and caring for it. My friend has two dogs and we would walk them often which also convinced my parents. Find a way to talk to them and how if you get a dog you would wash the dishes, etc something lilke that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Remember keep trying if it doesn't work the first time!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I grew up in a home where we had family pets...not one that I called "mine."  (Especially considering most kids/young teens have NO source of income...which is essential for owning a dog.)<br>  <br>  And you don't get a dog to "spoil" it.  All you have then is an untrained, out of control, unhappy animal.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	They probably already see the torture your sister puts your dog thru and thought 'Hell no she aint gettin her own! Poor dog'. Tell her to go help out at a shelter. She'll have a ton of dogs to hangout with all day everyday. Maybe teach her the REAL way to spoil a dog|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Let her move into her own home when she can be resposible to own a dog to love! Care for feed and not "spoil" Herself
TEG6O7sDaa	It won't harm him anymore than it would humans. This is fine for you to do, although he may stay VERY finicky for the rest of his life because you baby him. They're like kids, get you to do what they want and then expect it to be that way forever!!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Shouldn't, I do this all the time because I mix in his Oxyfresh dental additive and give it to him.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	My nan does that with her dog and the vet told her it was absolutely fine. So i dont think theres anything wrong with it. As long as the water is going into the bottle cold as apposed to hot which would melt the plastic|`|rqOIqO7Raa	No, that's fine. Sounds like you need to invest in a automatic watering dish! I have 2 and LOVE THEM!! Water stays clean and only uses a little at a time in the dish then it fills it when it empties.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	It's totally fine! I get lazy like that too! especially since my dog drools so much, I have to do that about 55 times a day!|`|q7GBzr6yaa	No thats fine! Most food/water bowls are plastic!|`|I68m0kCraa	We keep a 4L plastic milk jug full of water in the closet next to the water dish for just this reason.  We fill the jug with water as it is easier to transport that the water dish.  When the dish needs to be topped up, we fill it with water from the jug.  When the jug is empty, it's about time to wash the water dish.  This system has worked wonders for us for the past 5 years.|`|hFPVS5NSaa	DUHHH YESSSS
AtiNu3Ovaa	Yes, a puggle is a cross breed, but you can still collect information on them, as pugs and beagles are both unique breeds. <br>  <br>  Pugs are prone to skin problems, bacteria tends to grow in the wrinkles in their faces. If you haven't yet brought your puppy to the vet for a checkup, please do so, I've seen a LOT of demodex in pugs lately. Ask your vets opinion on what would be best to clean the facial folds, and how often to do so. Also, because of their smooshed in facial stucture, they tend to snort and gurgle when they breath. Nothing to be concerned about, as long as he is not actually having problems breathing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just some things to look out for, as pugs can be problematic. Ask your vet about pet insurance. If you start it at a young age, its much cheaper in the long run!|`|oGVWdnHraa	They are baby echidnas....so they will develop spikes, and if it is female, it will have a pouch.....but they have no nipples!!|`|YsMbKwTwaa	They are a mutt
0Gyrecxxaa	Personally, I think it's a good thing and I encourage anyone who's "cat owned" to participate in forums such as you describe. There is another, Catster, that I'm familiar with and the people there are a wealth of information about your favorite little friends. It's good to surround yourself with people who share this love of animals because you never know when they'll have critical information that you need in the unfortunate event you have a cat-astrophe on your hands...ya know? I know, I know...the pun sucked...I sowwy, I couldn't resist.|`|TkbaEic0aa	i have two catster accounts for my two cats, LuLu & Cutie pie.. plus i have them on my facebook account as catbook... and i dun care wut ppl think of me.. they're my kids !!<br>  it jus that you want the world to know how much you love them thats all :D|`|qOiv8d3Laa	Not me...

My dog has a dogster account.  You're a crazy cat person if you have five hundred million cats running around and crapping all over.|`|MjUQQyU6aa	yes! if Your cat can log on and reply to his/her msgs, go for it. other than that you are a crazy car/dog person.|`|4SQx8smEaa	They have ones for dogs as well...<br>  Yes it is a little bit silly...but for some people their animals are all they have.
FmzfGNL5aa	Decor is always fun for fish. They don't get bored, and they feel safer with something to hide behind. What kind of fish are they?|`|tShDXmgbaa	Decorations just give the fish some things to explore in out and around and makes your tank look much fuller and prettier rather than just having a tank with all fish and no decor.|`|pcvcMePXaa	yes this is true the fish will feel more secure and will be happier with it|`|oBB0zC5Zaa	It depends on what type of fish. I always put plants in mine just because they look cool and the fish love them. Also if you have more than one fish they generally claim their part of the tank. So it's best for you to provide them with plants, rocks, and other decor for them to hide in or claim their space. I also use a deep sea diver treasure chest and it blows bubbles when it opens up. It's really COOL! It's not really beneficial to their health but it keeps them happy.<br>  Good luck with the fish keeping!
lzcglDnMaa	Check out Craigslist.com. Good website for finding animals. Otherwise, check your local animal shelter. They should have kittens in all ages.|`|uaYDfH2Qaa	Try some animal shelters - lots of kittys waiting for a new home :}|`|uobx1Gb5aa	Why would you get a kitten at 3weeks?... it should still be with its mom for at LEAST 6weeks- best to get one thats 8 weeks old tho.<br>  try the humane society they come dewormed wiht shots and witha  spray/neuter certificate !
8OjOmZWAaa	House geckos usually cannot be handle. Im not saying that its going to bite you but it will run out from your hand. they just prefer leaving them alone in their cage. just give them insects like small crickets. also mealworms will do.
d2Obe0aJaa	The Official FFA jacket, is a Blue Corduroy jacket, with the Official FFA writing on it. I would get on FFA's head website to order one|`|rTSwouqXaa	Are you talking about a Carhart? If so I love them the more they are worn and washed the better they look. You can find them at any western wear store. They only have a few styles.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	They are made in several stores you can get one from a farm store.  The best is made by Carhartt but polar fleece and Walls makes pretty good ones as well.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	My Brother and Daughter and Son has one of these coats.They ordered them through there school.

fg1gFuP4aa	A dogs first trip to the groomer can be very scary.  The feeling afterwards might be a little weird to her and it may cause her to lick.  She may also have skin irritations due to the clippers.. or if she was heavily matted, de-matting (if not done correctly) can irritate the skin.<br>  So it could be in your best interest to take her to the vat to get her checked out. I don't think she would be pregnant as the dogs aren't usually put in the same cage at the pet groomer.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I'm sure they did a shaving of the privates & she probably isn't used to the feeling.  It is common for dogs esp. in the beginning or first couple of days to lick there a bit more often til they become accustomed to the feeling.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	Your dog could have sensitive skin and using a clipper blade on the stomach area (especially if the blade is hot) could irritate the area, causing her to lick..  Put some aloe vera on the area, it will cool it down and stop the burning which is causing her to lick.
TF6mlZC6aa	Hey,<br>  I have my horse in Bothell, WA and I am a hunter jumper as well.  <br>  <br>  with everything its about 600.00 (boarding included) but without boarding its about 250-300 dollars. I pay 475.00 a month for full care.<br>  <br>  but you always have to be prepared for any emergency vet bills that can occur and those can cost you up to a thousand on the cheap end.|`|pzqeLN8eaa	i can honestly tell you it is WAYY cheaper to keep your horse at home, if possible. boarding costs a lot more money. as for annual cost, think, about $125 a month(more or less), for normal shoes, less for a barefoot horse, obviously, then theres feed bills.vet bills, if anything happens. you'd need tack, unless you already have that. it may be expensive, but i cannot tell you how much having horses can help your soul. lol. because i have horses, i have stayed away from drinking & drugs, i'm not "boy crazy" haha and i'd rather be at home w/ my horses than out on a shopping spree, although those probably end up costing the same. haha|`|znQ9Hjhiaa	im in the same predicament. **sigh**<br>  <br>  Unfortunatley, since i can only see horses once a week, my dog is suffering...... me making him jump, jumps..... and trotting and lunging O.O the poor thing !!!<br>  <br>  anywho, i would suggest leasing first. Its like jumping into a pool when yuu cant swim. Learn how to look after a horse. Learn the ins and outs, plus it doesnt cost as much. :} depends with the owners.<br>  <br>  =] anyway, good luck<br>  <br>  xxx.paris|`|haJVIhFCaa	Hi Erin.<br>  <br>  I currently and "finally" got my own horse: a mare!!<br>  It took me years to achieve this dream. <br>  When I was a kid my parents, even though my father loved horses, didn't want to get me one, for similar reasons your parents wont.<br>  I don't know how old are you but I  think that, at least in my case, this animal was more than just a pet, it was a passion. Not having my own horse in my childhood was hard 'cause I had to use this passion in other things not as enjoyable as owning a horse.<br>  On the other hand, if you're going to live in the country, taking care of him/her wont cost that much.<br>  The average price for boarding, depending on the area, goes from $200 to $400. That includes labor ( other people feeding the animal ).<br>  So I would tell your parents that getting into this "hobby"/ passion would really be a great way of developing a skill, responsibility, relating to same minded people and having a blast. Is that sooo negative?? I don't think so!!<br>  Hope it helped.<br>  Take care.

Its sad but thats reality.|`|WPYRSSlQaa	yes if they feel like it is not going to make it they will kill it and eat it|`|ecjImz3Daa	no not all dogs do that the reason y a dog might eat its puppy if it was sick they can smell that.|`|CjuRY40zaa	i've never heard of this?!!

You can't just deny her care.|`|fpuPRNlWaa	The vet can answer your inquiries better. Take her to the vet and get his opinion, then ask for the easiest & cheapest medication.<br>  If you still cannot afford it, then give specific details with your question and attach a picture of your puppy so somebody can give you a better & detailed answer as well.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	If you would like a fair honest answer, then providing more details about your dog may get you some better answers. what is the breed of your dog, do you have a Photo to show , etc. you can also look up the breed of your dog and find out the correct measurements for her size|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Why do you have a dog if you can not afford one????<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all whats the breed?

hQQuqyYcaa	I would recommend checking out the local animal shelter for a rabbit first. Most of the time, you can get a pretty good deal on a neutered/spayed young rabbit (especially a few weeks after Easter). I got my 6 month old, mini lop, neutered male for $25. If I would have gotten him from a pet store, I wouldn't have know what gender he was, how big he could have gotten, and I would have had to pay $170+ to get him neutered.<br>  <br>  Essentials-<br>  Cage (no wire bottom)...the larger the better<br>  Timothy Hay (alfalfa for 6 months and younger)...rabbits need a constant supply<br>  Timothy Hay-based pellets...Kaytee Timothy Complete or Oxbow Bunny Basics T is good...this should make up only a small amount of the rabbit's diet<br>  Greens/veggies-approx 1cup per day<br>  Bedding-carefresh works best...absolutely no pine or cedar<br>  Food bowl-ceramic is best...make sure it's heavy enough not to be tipped<br>  Water bottle-better than water bowl...keeps water cleaner<br>  TOYS!-must keep that bunny busy....wood chews, sisal balls, cat rolling balls with a bell inside, wiffle ball....just no stuffed animals<br>  Exercise Pen-great for allowing exercise and at the same time keep the rabbit in a safe, enclosed area.<br>  <br>  Most important= Vet who KNOWS rabbits. Make sure you have the number and hours at hand in case of an emergency.<br>  <br>  Cage size...The one I have for my minilop, who is about 5-6lbs is 4ft long and about 2ft deep. It's a Marchiorro cage, has 2 doors, easy to clean, plastic bottom with high sides to prevent him from kicking out bedding...I have 3 Marchiorros, actually. Had 3 rabbits at one time, but due to space restraints and the others getting old and passing away, I'm down to one. <br>  <br>  Perfect rabbit? There are really no specific breeds. Some dwarfs can be a bit nippy and skittish, but I have had a few that were as sweet as can be. It's best to see which rabbit comes up to you. Are they looking for attention? Are they willing to allow you to pet it?<br>  <br>  I love answering bunny questions, so if you have any other questions, please let me know :)|`|AA10129150	Rabbits can cost $20-$100 to purchase, it depends on if the rabbit has been fixed, or had a vet checkup. Having your rabbit fixed is very important to having it live a long healthy life. The cage should be the biggest one you can fit in the area you have. We used an x-pen, but you can purchase rabbit cages from most pet stores. It would probably cost $50-$100 some come with water and food containers. Rabbits also need access to veggies daily, and access to hay all the time. Rabbit.org is a good resource for the kind of veggies, hey and pellets. Rabbits also need as much out of cage time as you can give them, they need to be socialized, and the ability to run around. The average cost per month was about $20 for food but some months it was more because we purchased more food. Also you might want to look into litter box training, so you only have to clean out a littler, I'm not sure how much we spent on litter because we used the same litter, Yesterday's News, for the cat boxes as well. You do have to be careful if you have other animals like cats, because the dust from some cat litters can be dangerous to rabbits.|`|1zn2yKjJaa	Okay just make sure you know what you have to do to take care of your new pet before you get it. You will need to clean the cage out weekly, if not more. You should interact with it everyday, and keep fresh food and water available for it. <br>  Things to buy would be cage, house, food dishes, water dipenser, food and obviuosly cage.<br>  This would be a good starter kit for you. Comes with everything.<br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/12285/Super-Pet-My-First-Home-Complete-Kit-for-Rabbits.aspx?CoreCat=SmallAnimal_Prod3" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/12285/Super...</a><br>  <br>  And bunnies cost about $20, so with the cage and everything your looking at $100 to start off. If your going to be resposible with your pet you should take it to the vet also, wich is another $30. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|B40UxRCPaa	hello! i bought a rabbit on the weekend and i would totally recommend getting one! barney (my californian lop rabbit) is amazingly soft and cuddly and really friendly. unlike a lot of rabbits he does not hide when you open his cage to get him or when you let him out.<br>  <br>  we have been told by several people that whilst you dont want the rabbit to be too cramped - if the cage is too big it will freak them out as they get scared very easily.<br>  <br>  for food we have been feeding barney pellets, hay and vegetables. he also has occasional treats such as fruit. green vegetables are good - although avoid lettuce. it is made mainly of water and cause diarhoerra.<br>  <br>  the bed can be made of hay and the rabbit will also eat this. sawdust should go in the area where you are wanting him to go toilet. don't mix the two or the rabbit will eat the toilet mix.<br>  <br>  a cage is good, but the rabbit will need to be let out for a run around every day. physical exercise is important. if the area is blocked off then the rabbit should be fine - or you can buy leads for the rabbit. you move with the rabbit, dont try to walk the rabbit.<br>  <br>  well thats all i can think of. enjoy your new pet! =]|`|GHfuLXubaa	You got some good advice in your first answer. We had a rabbit that one of my daughter's friends had to give up, and he was entertaining but alot of work. You can also consider litter training a rabbit like a cat, which works well if you want him/her to have the run of the house, assuming you have no other pets. We raised our rabbit with our kittens and let him have free range of our first floor and he was alot happier and much more sociable than being cooped up in a cage. <br>  Also rabbits can run as much as $100.00 in metropolitan areas. A good choice would be a lop..they are adorable.  Good luck, have fun and give it lots of love and attention!|`|TMuOtVNBaa	I bought a rabbit when I was 13 and I wasn't a big fan.. They smell really bad even if you clean there cage everyday...
AoSeHXeQaa	I work with a small,  no-kill shelter in Southern CA.<br>  <br>  They are getting a LOT of discarded dogs, because of the recession and people losing their homes.<br>  <br>  If you would be interested in donating food to them, please email me, and I will give you their information.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	You could definitely advertise it on Craigslist, and screen your responses for people who really sound like they need it for their dogs. Also try local shelters or humane societies, since they usually know of needy families with pets, or can at least use it for shelter dogs. Good luck!!!|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Your local animal shelter, or see if there are any families in your 'hood that are having hard times and ask if giving them food for their pet(s)would help them.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	You could donate it to a local shelter....shelters are always in need of dog food..and you would be helping dogs who lost their homes due to owners who could not afford it.|`|9ycJ261daa	check with local animal shelters they may have a list or know of a place.

70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You can have him shaved,just wear a sweater on him.Spring is coming anyway.And then,comb him every day or two so he doesn't get tangled,and have him groomed every 6 weeks.|`|uIvb5eqoaa	dog fur is very different than people hair.  You have to brush the matts, or probably pull them out, depending on how dead they are, when the fur is dry.  Now that you wet the fur, there is no way to get them out.  You have to shave or cut them off.  Very few people keep their lhaso's fur long unless if they are showing them.  Otherwise, take it to a groomer, realize you will be paying a good chunk of money to get rid of the mats, and have them give your dog a puppy cut.  <br>  A lot of people seem to think groomers have tools or soaps that make it painless to get rid of mats and tangles in their dogs, so it is ok to let their dogs coat get in terrible shape and then bring them in.  This is incredibly painful for your dog.  The groomer basically pulls out the fur that they can't brush out, which also hurts.  Pretty much every groomer is in a time crunch so they pull hard and fast.  Why do you think your dog hates going to the groomer?  It's not the water.  It's because you pay your groomer to repair months of damage in about an hours time.  Not something that can be done gently. <br>  <br>  This is preventable by keeping up on the coat so your groomer only has to bathe and blow out your dog's coat, which doesn't hurt at all.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Of course the easiest thing is to cut out the mats.<br>  But you might not want to.<br>  I've had poodles for years, so have the same issue.<br>  I have had very good results using a slicker brush (the kind with fine bent wire bristles) and hair detangler.   I use the kind humans use.  Children's spray-on detangler is pretty good.  Also "hair serum," the stuff sold to smooth and shine human hair, is very good, on wet or dry fur.|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	You do NOT wet matted fur, that only makes it worse!<br>  <br>  You will either have to cut the mats out individually and get him on a regimen of regular grooming to keep them from recurring, or pay to take him to a grooming salon and have them de-mat him (they have a de-matting tool that they can use *if the matting is not too severe*).|`|qBJLuCO0aa	try weting him than using conditioner to brush it through...|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Getting it wet will only make it worse! When his fur is all dry, gently comb them out, making sure you hold the fur between the mat and his skin, so you don't pull too much. Spray on conditioners work well, too, as well as spray on Mink Oil or Emu Oil. They usually will make the fur a little bit more slippery, allowing the mat to be combed out quicker. If you have the money, you can take him to a groomer to get the mats out, and then keep up his daily brushing to keep them out. If not, and if you don't mind him looking "silly" for a bit, you can cut them out yourself, being careful, again, not to cut his skin. You can either snip them out right where they start, leaving the areas where you removed them looking shorter than the others, or slip the scissors (the pointier the better) into the mat, with the points facing you, and cut that way (in the direction that the fur grows). Then comb through and repeat until the mat is completely removed. Sometimes I will also use thinning shears on my cats and dogs to remove mats, since they only take off a tiny bit off fur at a time, ans cut a few times right on top of the mat with them, then comb, then cut, and so on. Hope this helps!!! Good luck!!!|`|I68m0kCraa	If you have already tried special dog dematting brushes that don't work, try using a regular human "rat-tail comb" (seen here <a href="http://www.cachebeauty.com/images/Comare/comb_501.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://www.cachebeauty.com/images/Comare...</a> to gently feather away the top and bottom layers that are not part of the mat.  Then, starting at the bottom of the mat, patiently work the comb through tiny sections of fur.  You can use the tail end of the comb to 'stab' through the mat and try to break it up a bit.  I have found this comb to be the best so far on both my dogs and my brother's cat.<br>  Good luck!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You should let a groomer do it.  If you want to try it yourself, you can try a conditioner and a de-matting tool.  Work in small sections and only 15 minutes a day.  Their skin will become sore if you do it for a lengthy amount of time - then he will come to hate being groomed.  <br>  <br>  If it's really bad, they may have to be cut out.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	get a bottle of mane and tail detangler, its actually for horses but i would use it for anything i use it in my hair cause it just as good as name brand stuff but a quarter of the price...its in a yellow and white bottle. you can get it at a feed store or some drugstores or walmart might carry it|`|k6flESfNaa	oh god! you wet matted fur!??! now you HAVE to shave your dog, or cut the matted peices out so he'll look like a leopard lol|`|rqOIqO7Raa	I have a lhasa too, get yourself a de-matter and some spray on conditioner, go slow take your time and they will come out.|`|dZCsMyjXaa	you'll have to have him shaved. Get him a coat and limit his time outdoors.|`|9sGBIx2Aaa	If nothing works you might have to cut that area|`|DYfiOrD2aa	Depending on the size of the tangle and how badly tangled it is, you can use a women's hair product called "Silk Therapy" by Biosilk.  Rub a little between your fingers and then rub it into the tangle.  You can then very gently start combing it out.  Start at the very tip/end of the tangle.  You will have to have lots of patience to do this, as will your puppy!  But it works every time.  Otherwise, you may have to start cutting at it little by little.|`|qTh8ZLY7aa	If you groomed him regularly you wouldnt have this problem. If they are really bad you might need to shave him, or just cut the knots out. Otherwise just persist with a comb, but this can be very painful for the dog.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well if you can't get them out by combing his hair, and if they are really bad, you are going to have to cut them out.  You can always put a sweater or coat on your dog when he goes outside, but you need to remove them before they get worse.  Excessive matting is very painful to your dog so take him to a groomer and have him properly groomed then start him on a daily grooming routine with you.
Ik6WOcw3aa	About 3 months. 4 months max.<br>  <br>  Buy the larger tank now. You dont buy and plan to upgrade, because the upgrade never happens.
TkJn9gO0aa	In reptile husbandry, you aim to construct a temperature gradient(thermal gradient).......this means that you have a hot side and a cold side of the tank, and the temps will rise and fall between those two sides depending on which direction is being moved toward.<br>  <br>  A cold side of around 75-78 F and a hot side of 84-87 F is what you should strive for to insure that proper digestion temps and relief temps are available.

I5pUxwPbaa	it's normal cat behavior, mine is the same.  many cats have limits as to how much petting they will endure, and it depends on their mood at the moment.  dont worry, she does'nt dislike you|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	She wants attention she tends to get a little worked up over it and gets carried away with the bites. She has also learned the bites wake you up & she gets the reaction she wants. If she gets too out of control she needs to be placed outside your bedroom with the door shut. She does need to learn that bites will get her a time out. She will get it pretty fast.|`|AA10954497	It wants your attention and affection, my cat does this too if i ignore him.|`|PmT0Bx21aa	shes "grooming" you, when she licks you shes trying to clean your "fur" and when she chews your hair shes trying to "scratch that itch for you" or shes trying to get that "flea" off you. shes using her motherly instincts and you're her "baby" and vice verca. and when you pull your arm away she gets offended and its like shes saying "what? you don't appreciate my grooming? fine!"|`|SBEnrRZPaa	It is normal. Sometimes cats get overstimulated, especially if you are petting them and bite or lash out. Don't take it personally.

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Just go to Lowes and pick up a couple bags of kid's play sand.  Only costs about 1-2.00 per bag.  You won't need that much really, you don't want the sand bed deeper then 1 inch.  You could also use pool filter sand, not sure on the price of that though.  There'll be too much pollution-sewage, gasoline, oil, fertilizer, etc. in the sand from Lake Michigan.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	no way. if you put that nasty polluted crap in a tank for tropical fish they would most likely die|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Please don't do this .Even if you have to buy clean sand a bag at a time.

However, reports Jill A. Richardson, DVM, of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), gastrointestinal upset *has* been seen in dogs and cats who have accidentally eaten one of these packets. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite.<br>  <br>  There can be additional harmful effects, particularly if the packet was used for medication. "Silica acts as a dessicant and can absorb qualities of a medicine when it's in a medicine bottle," explains Richardson. "So, for example, if your dog ate a silica gel pack that came out of your heart medication, the silica could absorb the qualities of the heart medication and cause similar adverse effects." Companion animal caretakers should be extra careful to keep these packets out of their pet's reach."|`|uH7vdwalaa	Call your local emergency vet.

I've never had a corgi before, and so I dodn't really know what to expect from him, but he's been quite the dog and he's still just a puppy! He rarely barks, is housebroken, learning commands and just teh happiest puppy in the world.  He loves going to the dog park to play with the other dogs, but always seems to think he is bigger than he really is.  He loves to fetch and hop in anyone's lap as well as get tons of belly rubs! He does very well on his own and sleeps in his kennel during the night.  WHen I am gone during the day I put him in the bathroom and he does just fine with a ton of toys, things to chew on, and a KONG filled with peanut butter.  So yeah, he's the coolest dog ever!

AA10977460	i have 3 little dogs under 5 pounds. I give them milk pretty often. They love it and it has never made them sick.|`|096e860e43223453c5e7f5e27b547ff2aa	Dogs are lactose intolerant like some people and the reaction is the same as a persons, bloat, diarhea, gas and feeling consipated even tho it has the runs. What are you doing with a bowl of milk anyway, cats are the same, you just dont notice with cats coz they will go somewhere else to be sick. If you want to give your animals milk, get the lactose free pet variety, you can get it in the petfood aisle in your local supermarket.|`|5c70d9b6fa348e2e2b146577122be5fdaa	I don't think it will hurt her.

Milk is good for dog it has calcium which it good for all pets and humans. Lets just hope she's not lactose intolerance|`|bCDpoXcjaa	I gave my puppy milk all the time and she loved it and no problems. I don't think milk could hurt a dog. It might possibly give her the runs or something like that but no permanent damage.|`|fpzCfyMeaa	I agree with Golden, she will probably have diarrhea, but it won't hurt her.<br>  <br>  Baking chocolate, on the other hand will. It only takes an ounce, of the stuff.<br>  Milk chocolate isn't as bad, but it sure isn't good for her either.<br>  Also stay away from grapes, raisins, onions, plants, (except untreated lawn grass, sometimes they need this)...|`|hJdnhUJGaa	Milk really isn't going to hurt your dog. It might give her diaherria, though.<br>  <br>  When animals are young (and people, for that matter), they drink a lot of milk. But as they grow older, they begin to lose the lactose enzymes that help them to digest lactose products, such as milk or anything containing dairy. That's why animals get diaherria from drinking milk. Someone might think they're doing their kitty good by giving them milk, but in reality, they're going to give them the runs, lol. I know all of this because I'm lactose intolerant myself.<br>  <br>  But anyways, your pooch should be just fine!!|`|phvYf9RKaa	There's no reason it should hurt her. :) If you're worried, just keep an eye on her. Your vet won't mind a call to help reassure you. :)|`|LPEO6AsCaa	It may give her the runs.  Thats about it.  Its not toxic to dogs.|`|JFSWHVw8aa	It will probably get the runs.  That is what happened to my Pom.  I ended up taking her to the vet so she wouldn't become dehydrated(not to mention what a mess that does to a poms butt)  They gave me some meds for her.  They said dogs don't have the enzymes needed to break down milk like cats do.
47cb72348217a23e95b20db38d9cb65faa	Lobsters are scavengers by nature, so pretty much any organic matter which sinks is suitable.  Since lobsters like to hide, are largely nocturnal, and can grow quite large, though, you're going to wind up with a giant tank which--to the casual observer--has nothing in it.  Your payoff?  Mixing saltwater, checking specific gravity and PH, changing carbon filters to overcome the stench of rotting flesh (you'll have the best luck with feeding the lobster dead fish and marine plants).  Ya might wanna rethink this thing!|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	They have an assortment of pet lobsters out these days, even blue ones.  But you need a fairly big tank if you are getting a big one, and it has to be kept cool so you might need a chiller for the tank.  And they are salt water too.  You feed it meaty fish food--they sell frozen fish foods like clams and mussels and squid and shrimp in the tropical fish stores.  You might want to try crayfish (there are lots of types, even minatures) or algae shrimp (come in a variety of colors) to keep as pets.|`|AA11212862	lobsters are scavengers|`|KPol3AaTaa	If you need help eating your pet lobster, visit <a href="http://www.lobsterhelp.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lobsterhelp.com</a>|`|a6864aab0948801fcb84385b7f380bdaaa	lobster's eat the stuff on the bottom of the sea floor(poop).|`|sCfrexliaa	WHAT DO LOBSTERS EAT?!?!<br>  Lobsters usually move around and hunt for food at night. It was once thought that lobsters were scavengers and ate primarily dead things. However, researchers have discovered that lobsters catch mainly fresh food (except for bait) which includes fish, crabs, clams, mussels, sea urchins, and sometimes even other lobsters! There are, however, many fish that eat baby lobsters. <br>  <br>  Pet lobsters are available at your local pet store, as well as supplying food and aquariums for your lobster.<br>  <br>  I HOPE YOU AND YOUR LOBSTER WILL LIVE A HAPPY AND LONG RELATIONSHIP AND LIFE.

3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	If you don't like the smell of ferrets, I would suggest not getting one. I consider it only somewhat offensive only for the first few days after they are given a bath. It's best to only bathe them once a month to cut down on the smell since their scent glands go into overdrive for close to a week after they receive a bath. The best way to cut down on the smell is to wash all cloth bedding once a week and to dump and wash out the litter boxes twice a day. No matter what you do though, you will still smell them even if they are descented. The reason for this is that the source of most of the smell is the natural oils that they produce.<br>  <br>  Just go ahead and buy yourself a wire cage. Both wood and glass cages just aren't worth the time it would take to build it yourself. Wood will pick up any musk and urine smells very quickly and you won't be able to remove them no matter how hard you try. In the case of aquariums or Plexiglas enclosures, they don't have nearly enough ventilation for a ferret and drilling the holes into the glass to give enough ventilation will weaken the cage and significantly shorten the amount of time until you will have to build a new one. You can easily find a wire cage through classified ads, your local ferret shelter, or on craigslist for less than $100 which would be about the amount you would spend on supplies for a home built cage. <br>  <br>  Also, if you plan on having the ferret inside the cage for more than 40% of the time that your home, please get another pet. Ferrets are much like cats and dogs in that they crave interaction with the other people or animals around them. In fact, your average ferret rescue will not adopt out animals to people who cannot promise to give their pet at least an hour a day with one on one playtime and at least 4 hours a day outside of their cage. <br>  <br>  I made the mistake of listening to the pet store associate that I got my first pair of ferrets from who said that ferrets were just fine with minimal interaction. In return, I got a pair of ferrets who were aggressive and fat due to lack of exercise and poor socialization. I was pretty young when this happened and it took me close to 8 years to start appreciating ferrets again. I'm in the process of becoming a foster parent for one of my local ferret shelters and I'm just sharing the information that they gave me. <br>  <br>  As for food, either a good ferret food such as EVO Ferret or a grain free cat food is ideal if you want to feed dry food. My foster program gets donations of Totally Ferret but I plan on feeding Evo Cat (has almost an identical ingredient list as their ferret food and comes in larger bags) with raw meat as the occasional treat. I will have to pay most of the food bill but since it's such an ideal food, the foster program will be compensating me for part of the cost. Wellness dry cat foods are also a good alternative for ferrets as long as you stay away from their fish flavors. The reason that cat foods have been considered a horrible, cheap alternative for ferrets is because a lot of ferret parents were feeding cat foods from the grocery store rather than well researched foods that list specified animal protein sources. I would personally stay away from most of the holistic cat foods such as Solid Gold though. Most of these foods add a lot of unnecessary ingredients and use meats with a high water content so they can claim that their foods have a larger amount of animal protein then they really do.<br>  <br>  Another very important thing is ferret proofing. Here is a very good description of things you should look out for: <a href="http://www.ferretcentral.org/faq/part2.html#ferretproofing." rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretcentral.org/faq/part2.h...</a> Take a good look at the rest of the faq's on this site. It helped me out a lot when I was making my decision on if I was going to have ferrets again.|`|AicQ9LdEaa	If you get your ferret at a local pet store they are normally descented at birth.  Other than that, they use the bathroom a lot and consequently you will be changing the bedding quite frequently.  Another thing a lot of people don't know about them is that they will ONLY go to the bathroom in a corner if you occupy 3 of the 4 corners of the cage it will always use the bathroom in the one remaining corner, cutting down on the actual area that you have to clean.  I don't recommend a wooden cage because they can and will chew plus you want something much more well ventilated than that.|`|XTxKqzmwaa	I work at a pet store that sells ferrets, they are so much fun!  You should not build that cage for it because it will need more air, we sell starter cages complete with bedding food and hammocks around $150.  Most pet stores have their ferrets desented already, so you will just need to give it a bath every 2 weeks or so to keep it from smelling bad.  They can be litter trained, just keep the box in the corner of the cage, that is where they like to go. They are very social so if you can get 2, it will be better for them.  Ferrets also need shots (rabies and so forth) ask the pet stores most of the big ones (petco or petsmart) will have a low cost vaccination day!!  when they are out of the cage make sure you watch them, they like to steal things and hide them from you (car keys) and they will crawl into spaces like the dryer vent.  I hope this helps you!|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	I always thought I would want a ferret, but let me tell you that they are a force to be reckoned with. Make sure you spend some time with one, before you really decide you want one. They are such incredible little critters, and your life really has to be ready and steady to dedicate to them. <br>  The best place to get answers about ferrets, is to join a ferret community/group. There are good ones on Yahoo,Flickr, and else where. Forums are excellent places to look at, just type in say odor solutions in the search bar on the forums, and you'll most likely find your questions and answers there. <br>  Good Luck!|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	First of all, descenting doesn't do anything in reducing smell--only altering takes care of that :) (gets rid of the hormone induced musk and greasiness).<br>  You can wash them every 3-4 months, if needed, but generally you're right--they don't really need it more than twice a year (unless they get into something particularly foul).<br>  For the cage wire or metal bars are the best; ferrets like to back up into corners to poo, and if it is wood it might keep the poo in, but the wood will also hold on to the stains and odor.  And solid plastic floors are best, too :)  Stay away from the wire grid floors (since it's hard on any animal's feet).<br>  As for info: you can join online forums.  These are the best, since you are conversing with other ferret owners (not just getting info that is listed on a site).  They are great critters to have if you are the right owner.  But, they are expensive to care for (vets are a chronic condition *g*).  They do need a lot of stimulation and a lot of interaction with you.  Pairs, at the least, are best.  Ferret proofing is important.  Also, on my profile page, there is my ferret blog, and if you go to it, there's lists of other blogs (some have more info on ferret-care taking than mine).  Those might help you :)<br>  <br>  As for toilet placing, I have the FN142.  The bottom level holds the litterbox, food and water.  I also layered the bottom floor with newspaper, as my two kits are recalcitrant about using the litterbox.  Upstairs is their play and sleeping area.  That arrangement works best for my guys :)  It'll take time to figure out what your ferrets prefer.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I've had several ferrets, and have a lot of advice. #1 Get a video camera! They are so funny! #2 Clean their cage out every day. They can be litterbox trained, but ask a vet because I think some kinds of litter are dangerous for them. #3 Do not feed them cat food- people will suggest it because it's cheaper, but it isn't good for them. #4 Keep the food and water on a seperate floor of the cage from their litter. They will mix them up. They are also messy with food and water. #5 Check for holes in your walls or open electrical outlets. We once lost one in the wall for a week that way! #6 Watch them diligently when they are out of their cage. If there is trouble they will find it. #7 Don't build the cage out of wood. They will eat it and it is very unhealthy. You can buy one for $1-200, and it will be safe. Don't leave them outside in wind or even slight cold. They are not very tolerant of heat/cold. Lots more info on internet or email me.
xUNwC1B8aa	You sound like you are doing just fine. And a BIG thank you for cycling your tank!  You are doing the right thing from the start!  As for Nitrates.  After a water change they will be low somtimes go to 0 but even the best set tanks and the oldest tanks will still have some levels of Nitrates after a short time.  <br>  <br>  Nitrates are produced from the waste that your animals and other living things in your tank naturally as they eat and expel waste into the water.  The very easiest as well as the #1 best way to care for this normal water contaminate is to do as others have said.  A 10-25% water change about once a week or about once every two weeks if your tank is set and showing no signs of stress will be enough for any size tank.  <br>  <br>  Before a water change normal readings will be in the 10 to 20 rang and 40 is considered stressful and the starting of dangerous to your life in your tank.<br>  <br>  As you may know already... Never do a 100% water change and only do more than a 25% in extreme cases as unknown Ammonia or Nitrite spikes or any other types of problems that might make you want to "redo" your water. 50% is the most you ever want to do at one time or it will be like going back to before you cycled in the first place.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you,<br>  Rusty aka Abilifys|`|77ab032d2000a70209292db611429bbcaa	the people so far are giving you a spot on answer, but as a small add to their statements, due watch the levels and only add one fish at a time IF the fish aren't in there already. the adding of fish to a fresh tank will cause a ammonia/nitrite rise over a course of a week to two, and too many fish at once may cause too much at once and then u end up with system shock. <br>  just heading you up as a fair warning.|`|svrFBaENaa	10ppm is safe. It starts getting dangerous once it goes above 30ppm.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Nitrate levels are safe until they reach above 40ppm. It's still recommended to do regular water changes, though. Keep on a schedule. Some people like to do a 10-25% water change per week, some like to do it once a month. I personally recommend once a week or once every two weeks to keep that tank clean and healthy for those cichlids.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	The nitrate level is safe enough for most fish. There are few fishes that cannot even tolerate that much.<br>  <br>  But if general 10ppm is well below the safe standard for nitrates. Usually I would only change the water if the nitrate level rises beyond 40ppm.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds

AA11970058	Corgis... where to begin.<br>  <br>  - They are very smart. They get bored easily. When bored, they sometimes get destructive and chew things. Crate training is the best way to prevent it. My dog stayed in his crate when left alone until he was about 3, when the chewing got better... but he still gets into trouble from time to time. Another way to prevent chewing is to leave your dog lots of "educational" toys, like a Buster Cube.(Yelling and screaming doesn't help, it just makes the dog upset and confused.)<br>  <br>  - They like to herd things, such as toys, other dogs and people. Careful not to step on him! If this behavior bothers you, have him sit and stay for a few seconds before moving again.<br>  <br>  - They are BIG barkers. My dog thinks it is his responsibility to loudly announce everything he hears to the entire building. This is a difficult behavior to get rid of because it is self-reinforcing (meaning that the dog is rewarded for it by the person or noise going away). I have had some success in getting him to substitute a quiet "woof" instead of a full bark.<br>  <br>  - All working breeds like having a job to do. If you don't have any sheep or cattle around, finding another job will please your corgi. My corgi's thing is fetch. Once trained to do it, he became obsessed and will gladly play fetch for hours, indoors or outdoors. Corgis are also heavily involved in dog sports like agility.<br>  <br>  - Like all dogs, corgis will reflect what behaviors you have taught them. Get a good training book such as "The Culture Clash," "How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves," any book by Ian Dunbar, etc. Also, signing up for a training class is a good idea. You'll learn basic principles that you can apply to any situation. The most important of these is CONSISTENCY and this will help you tremendously with your housebreaking process.<br>  <br>  - Finally, corgis love food. This is a plus for training, but not so good when they get into things. If your corgi gets into chocolate, for example, you can feed him a tablespoon of milk mixed with a tablespoon of peroxide. Repeat every 15 minutes until he throws up the chocolate. I've had to use this on my corgi and it saves a big vet bill.|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	lots of exercise,  try to enroll in puppy obedience classes.. that would be great.  also he should be crate trained,,,  that will help your housebreaking immensely
ZrxxCCEwaa	Lots of dogs eat cat poo. Most of the worms that infest cats do not infest dogs they are host specific but there are things in cats poo that can cause serious infections in other animals, including dogs and people. eg toxoplasmosis. Puppies carry lots of worms that they tend to get from their mothers, therefore worm your puppy every 3 months with an allwormer and dont let it eat cat poo. Cover the areas where the cat is toileting eg sandpits, gardens. Have fun with your puppy :)|`|b84334dc4c69c929f51e2aaa4f84ec25aa	yes if the cat has worms.

I understand that you are talking of a purebred animal, but cats are everywhere and a lot of the time are being given away. What is so important about having a purebred cat that it's worth more money than any other cat? All the cats I have owned I have gotten from farms and in my eyes, no one could have ever put a price on any of them. They were all great cats, just not purebred.

Hope I helped :)|`|35a01c488c521beb432dc52893dd0146aa	I'm not sure what you're referring to here.  But there are three main breeds with the word bulldog in it: the bulldog (also known as the English bulldog), the French bulldog, and the American bulldog.  To find a puppy of any of these, you first need to find a reputable breeder.  You can do this by searching the internet or asking local pet store staff to help you come up with a list.<br>  <br>  Don't buy a puppy from a pet store.  Often these puppies come from puppy mills or backyard breeders who do not screen the parents for health and temperament before breeding.  Puppies that come from pet stores are also harder to housetrain because they're already used to eliminating in their sleeping area.<br>  <br>  Please do some research before getting a dog of any kind, but especially a bulldog.  Bulldogs are prone to a multitude of health problems because of their unnaturally short nose and squat, bulky body.  They snore and wheeze because they have a hard time getting enough air through their short nose, and have terrible flatulence because of their poorly built body.  Mother bulldogs have to have their puppies delivered by c-section because their heads are too big to come out normally.|`|84e3d62c46f061200b723bb69a12492caa	I got my daughter the same thing, I got hers at limited too for about $10.

c86dbc2b36eaa731e183bf99872a73f2aa	I would recommend some obedience training. If you don't like the sounds of that. Consider crate training instead. Go to any large pet store and speak with one of the sales people about crate training. It's used a lot in obedience training, house training and bad habits that dogs have. When he acts up like that, make him get in the crate and let him be. Scold him too in a loud and stern voice. If you keep up with this method, eventually he will get the message. Hope this helps you out with your jumpy dog.|`|qXOzKHhDaa	Get one of these water bottles you can fill up and spray your plants with..everytime he jumps on you spray him with it....but only water please nothing else!!!!....if it does'nt work get him neutered..lol|`|15d5a340dc2c57de9ff8a0bfca6ad2ceaa	Nouderd. K....    Anyway, when he attempts to jump up on you knee him in the chest (gently - it won't hurt him) as you turn away from him with a calm (not yelling) simple correction. Ignore him until he stops acting anxious. Then give affection.|`|9rLIq970aa	teach him to stop jumping on you by putting your knee up in front of him every time he tries to jump on you. If that fails gently step on his back toes when he jumps up on you and he will soon get off. Only pay attention to him and reward him when he is not jumping on you. it will take a while for him to learn.|`|bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	Where do you live? There are clinics that offer free, or very low cost spay and neuter programs in almost every state.<br>  see here:<br>  <a href="http://www.petsandanimals.org/spayneuter_services.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsandanimals.org/spayneuter...</a><br>  <br>  Be sure to call ahead and ask if there are any eligibility requirements, or if they only spay or neuter cats, etc..<br>  <br>  Also, in dogs, "mounting" is a gesture of dominance. Neutering will only partially solve the problem, you may wish to do some simple obedience training. In the wild, dogs follow a pack leader who is dominant, not an "emotional leader". So you need to train your dog to be submissive, and to stop trying to assert itself.<br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/yobed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/yobed.html</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Donkey Hotei|`|cf85fc6dd024c60de9b5cb73ce4250eaaa	Neutering usually has little to do with jumping... unless.. well. ..he has jumping beans in his coin purse.

Hold the paws after the dog jumps.  Don't let go.  Wait for dog to get uncomfortable.<br>  2. Startle him/her with a shake can: take a tin can and partially fill with pennies.  Seal the can with tape...or whatever.  Shake vigruous (sp?) when the dog jumps on you, or throw can if dog jumps on someone else.<br>  3. Spray with water or a safe, unpleasant scent (I'm thinking of the citrinella (sp?) that is used in bark collars).<br>  4. Hold paws briefly, and toss dog back down to the ground.  I did this with my sister in law's 100 lb lab puppy.  The method seemed to do the trick for her big boy!<br>  5. Have a leash on the dog and correct dog when dog jumps.  I would recommend that you consult with a trainer about using a pinch collar or other training device (must be used properly!)<br>  6. Use a very strong, bark like "No" or "Off!"<br>  <br>  Good luck with the jumping!  Also, look into obedience school.|`|cd190425d5a834a57df068f0ce6ac5e9aa	The gentle knee in the chest has always worked for me, along with a stern NO. He is looking for attention and if you give him any after he jumps he is getting mixed signals.  Ignore him when he misbehaves.<br>  When he runs up to you, greet him and if he tries jumping, put your hand up facing his nose so he can't get close to your body.  If he doesn't jump, rub him good, good doggy, love him, and eventually he will catch on.<br>  Practice, and patience!

4c21766cd27a2c290be1bf8183e37399aa	you could go the crate training route, pulling water at a certain time every night, ice cubes instead of water, shut your door.......is it a puppy???<br>  <br>  Crate training is one of the most efficient and effective ways to train a puppy or dog.<br>  The single most important aspect of dog and puppy training is that you reward and praise your dog or puppy each and every time she does the right thing. For example: praise her when she chews her own toys instead of the couch or eliminates outside instead of in the house. The more time you spend with your puppy or dog, the quicker and easier it will be to train her. <br>  <br>  The key to house training is to establish a routine that increases the chances that your dog will eliminate in the right place in your presence, so that she can be praised and rewarded; and decreases the chances that your dog will eliminate in the wrong place so that she will not develop bad habits. <br>  <br>  It is important that you make provisions for your dog when you are not home. Until your dog is housetrained, she should not be allowed free run of your house. Otherwise, she will develop a habit of leaving piles and puddles anywhere and everywhere. Confine her to a small area such as a kitchen, bathroom or utility room that has water/stain resistant floors. Confinement is NOT crate training. <br>  <br>  What is Crate Training?<br>  Crate training can be an efficient and effective way to house train a dog. Dogs do not like to soil their resting/sleeping quarters if given adequate opportunity to eliminate elsewhere. Temporarily confining your dog to a small area strongly inhibits the tendency to urinate and defecate. However, there is still a far more important aspect of crate training. <br>  <br>  If your dog does not eliminate while she is confined, then she will need to eliminate when she is released, i.e., she eliminates when you are present to reward and praise her. <br>  <br>  Be sure to understand the difference between temporarily confining your dog to a crate and long term confinement when you are not home. The major purpose of confinement when your are not home is to restrict mistakes to a small protected area. The purpose of crate training is quite the opposite. Short term confinement to a crate is intended to inhibit your dog from eliminating when confined, so that she will want to eliminate when released from confinement and taken to an appropriate area. Crate training also helps teach your dog to have bladder and bowel control. Instead of going whenever she feels like it, she learns to hold it and go at convenient scheduled times. <br>  <br>  Crate training should not be abused, otherwise the problem will get drastically worse. The crate is not intended as a place to lock up the dog and forget her for extended periods of time. If your dog soils her crate because you left her there too long, the house training process will be set back several weeks, if not months. <br>  <br>  Your dog should only be confined to a crate when you are at home. Except at night, give your dog an opportunity to relieve herself every hour. Each time you let her out, put her on leash and immediately take her outside. Once outside, give her about three to five minutes to produce. If she does not eliminate within the allotted time period, simply return her to her crate. If she does perform, then immediately reward her with praise, food treats, affection, play, an extended walk and permission to run around and play in your house for a couple of hours. For young pups, after 45 minutes to an hour, take her to her toilet area again. Never give your dog free run of your home unless you know without a doubt that her bowels and bladder are empty. <br>  <br>  During this crate training procedure, keep a diary of when your dog eliminates. If you have her on a regular feeding schedule, she should soon adopt a corresponding elimination schedule. Once you know what time of day she usually needs to eliminate, you can begin taking her out only at those times instead of every hour. After she has eliminated, she can have free, but supervised, run of your house. About one hour before she needs to eliminate (as calculated by your diary) put her in her crate. This will prevent her from going earlier than you had planned. With your consistency and abundance of rewards and praise for eliminating outside, she will become more reliable about holding it until you take her out. Then the amount of time you confine her before her scheduled outing can be reduced, then eliminated. <br>  <br>  Mistakes and Accidents During Training<br>  If you ever find an accident in the house, just clean it up. Do not punish your dog. All this means is that you have given her unsupervised access to your house too soon. Until she can be trusted, don't give her unsupervised free run of your house. If mistakes and accidents occur, it is best to go back to the crate training. You need to more accurately predict when your dog needs to eliminate and she needs more time to develop bladder and bowel control.|`|AA11592942	lord I hate people that crate train.

You could start training your dog and say "Go potty" everytime you bring him out. When he goes, give him a treat.

I did this with my adult dog when I was raising him...I am now doing it with my puppy, and so far so good.

Maybe try a different type of food.  Try and find something with a real meat as one of the first two ingredients.  <br>  <br>  Wal-mart has a cheap, but very healthy brand called Maxximum, the first ingredient is lamb.  This seems to work better with dogs with digestive issues.  If that doesn't work, try and find something with rice too.|`|osrqpU2Taa	Hello, clear is nothing to worry about, or even a little blood ( vomiting can bust small blood vessels ) to know if a dog is seriously bleeding check that the gums are pink not white, but this is really pretty normal, specially if they are eating grass ( no one really knows why they do, just that they do eat grass ) etc...or could be allergy's ...yes, dogs, cats can & do get allergys, but this don't seem like anything serious, specially since you just had her to a vet & all was well..no worries ,Take Care :)|`|5VGEKbXzaa	Dogs eat grass normally to make themselves sick, so I agree that you ought to have a look at what you're feeding him.  What *does* concern me is the apparent lack of balance.  That is disturbing, and I don't think your vet has taken that into account.  If it was just the eating grass issue, I would say change the food, and leave it at that.  But the balance issue has not been addressed.  I have no answers for you on that one.  At just 2 y/o, balance should not be affected.  I would consult your vet again.  Perhaps they did not listen well enough to you, and just heard that he was eating grass.  Yes, that's common (for various reasons) but the balance thing is *not* common.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|40ea81577a1947faf05dac2e10da8b69aa	My dog did the same thing when I gave her a rawhide bone to chew on.  She chewed and swallowed all of it and for two days later was throwing up clear slime. Having something in their tummy that they can't digest, or that has ingredients that are not good for them can cause them to throw up or have a need to throw up - just like it would for us.|`|AA10796970	Dogs will eat grass if their stomach is upset because it will cause them to vomit.  It is a normal thing for dogs to do this once in a while.  Keep an eye on it and if it continues consistently take him back to the vet or to a different vet.|`|cCHYnaWpaa	I don't have any suggestion, but my MaltiPoo does the same thing. He gets motion sickness when he takes a ride in the car.  I've noticed when he's out in the yard he nibbles on grass too.  Sorry i couldn't help but hopefully it's something they'll get past.|`|e22cee87eff66d063e198a28eed1dbdeaa	is there anything near him he might be eating (plants, mulch) that could make him sick?  he could be lonely and bored and eating anything he sees for entertainment.  also try feeding him a better quality food that is well balanced and not full of worthless calories.<br>  PLEASE check out this web site...<br>  <a href="http://www.dogsdeservebetter.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsdeservebetter.com/home.ht...</a>
Phr8KhqDaa	shave them in the summer if it is hot where you live and make sure you have plenty of room, remember they were bred to work in cold climates so they need to play and "work" and they get hot easily|`|AA11788274	i have 2 huskeys and they are gorgeous.. u have to show them who's boss or they will become stubborn... once u show them who is boss and they learn that, they will become very very friendly and sometimes protective.... i sometimes have play fights with my girlfriend and they will actually snap at me if i go to hit her and they do the same with her... thay are really active and if u dont give them plenty of exercise prepair to loose gardens, and anything that can be chewed... so good luck with the new ball of joy... hope u enjoy the breed as much as i do..|`|0GdIZWUWaa	Husky's are a GREAT breed. Good with kids, quiet, great temperment BUT they MUST have good solid training or they can be quite the handful. #1 You are on the right track...Do your research.  There are literally hundreds of great sites.  Search for 'Sibes' or Huskies.  #2 Start early!  They can be potty trained in 1 week flat if you do it right.  #3 Make sure you don't get him/her until they are at least 8 weeks old.  If it's a reputable breeder this is when they come available.  They MUST have this training from mom or you will have trouble with mouthing.  #4 They LOVE to chew so invest in lots of toys.  Don't buy expensive one's as they will chew threw them but buy a lot.  ALWAYS offer chew bones.  #5 Crate train.  This is a MUST.  Husky are mischeivous if left alone.  They are VERY smart and can get into just about anything including through closed doors!  Mine knows his "bed" and goes in whether I tell him to or not when he wants to rest or is tired of my boys roughhousing.  #6 Be sure never to let them loose.  Huskies love to run and won't know to watch for cars.  #7 I could go on and on just HAVE FUN AND GIVE HIM LOTS OF LOVE!  These are the most loving dogs ever!  AND When in doubt hire a professional trainer. :o)  Oh, did I mention that they SHED...A LOT!  So be prepared.  Don't shave them!  Their hair keeps them cool as well as warm.  Just use an undercoat brush and you'll be all set.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you are adopting please have trained professionally as you never know what may have happened to him/her before coming to the pound.|`|35699f9a9773bb4b7294599c1d03de1daa	Hi Karen, congratulations on your new addition :)<br>  With out sounding sarcastic "which i don’t mine to be" but i think the best thing you could have done before getting your new dog would have been to read up as much as could on that bread,<br>  that way you would have had a better idea of its needs, Still its never to late to start reading!<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your new baby;)|`|KpoRN01Faa	The most intelligent thing to do before you bring your dog home is to take him for a walk about one hour. The reason is this: Wherever you brought your dog from could have been in not so nice of place; therefore, by letting him take a breather will most likely make him feel less stressed or terrified to adapt to another environment. I have trained dogs and I feel this is always beneficial to any new dog going into a different environment.|`|LSpc8figaa	One of the highly recommended ways to train a husky is crate training. I have done it with all of mine... I've had about 14 over the years. (We bred our huskies). If you train them right and do it early enough they are wonderful, well behaved dogs! Good luck! And give him LOTS OF LOVE! :-)|`|xic2daEiaa	I own two huskies. They are really active dogs. they are not guard dogs and are very friendly. they love to play and get wet. Make sure you have plenty of water for him/her and train immediately so you are in charge. <br>  Good luck with your new baby!
9yBC4UK5aa	hola...<br>  <br>  pues para empezar me da mucho gusto que seas una persona responsable y te interese que este enbuenas condiciones por lo mismo tratare de ser claro...<br>  <br>  1.- el alimento lo puedes conseguir en las tiendas de mascotas o de peces. este tipo de peces Acepta todo tipo de alimento, incluidos los comerciales, aunque para que el pez pueda desarrollar todo su esplendor, es muy aconsejable la utilización de alimentos vivos, como artemia, grindal, larvas de mosquito, etc. En caso de no poder disponer de alimento vivo, siempre es recomendable dar una alimentación variada, incluyendo guisante cocido (sin piel) una o dos veces a la semana que ayuda a prevenir la oclusión intestinal, tan común entre los bettas, variando las marcas y teniendo siempre en cuenta que es un animal carnívoro. <br>  <br>  <br>  2.- tu puedes colocar en el fondo lo que te mas te guste solo toma encuenta estas limitantes, no deve de ser nada metalico, ya que el metal suelta residuos toxicos para el pez, no debe de ser material calcareo, si son piedritas de colores fijate bien que sean especial para acuario y que sean de calidad, ya que no deben de deprender color y antes que nada debes de lavarla muy bien.<br>  <br>  3.- las plantas que te recomiendo por su rapido crecimiento adaptacion y facil mantenimiento son:<br>  <br>   Sagittaria subulata - sagitaria.<br>   Egeria densa - elodea.<br>   Lemna minor - lenteja de agua.<br>  <br>  4.- se deben de realizar cambios de agua parciales del 20% a maximo 30% cada 15 dias, total la verdad lo puedes hacer cada a?o esto dependiendo de  la calidad de los filtros que decidas colocar.<br>  <br>  5.- las sustancias que se deven de utilizar a manera de prevencion son:<br>  <br>  azul de metileno.<br>  anticloro.<br>  verde de malaquita.<br>  acriflavina.<br>  <br>  las dos primeras son para acondicionar el agua y prevenir enfermedades pero tambien puedes colocar las otras dos para prevenir hongos y bacterias...<br>  <br>  6.- creo que ya la respndi y lo pudes colocar en cualquier recipiente limpio sin reciduos de javon o cualquier otro material toxico, con agua del mismo acuario, recuerda que el acuario y sus adornos, bombas, y demas accesorios "jamas deben de ser lavados con jabon, solo con agua".<br>  <br>  mira para mas dudas pongo a tus ordenes mi correo:<br>  <br>  danny_tiger82@yahoo.com.mx<br>  <br>  suerte...|`|Imw7KkMraa	1) la comida viva les encanta pero también ensucia mucho el agua.<br>  2)no importa si pones grava o piedritas...lo importante es poner una roca con orificio en medio ya que necesitan un lugar en donde esconderse.<br>  3)coloca plantas artificiales, les gustan igual que las naturales y ensucian menos el agua.<br>  4) cambia el agua en su totalidad.|`|AA12246142	Yo también tengo un beta, y no te preocupes tanto, ya que no son peces de "alto mantenimiento" si los comparas con otras especies.<br>  Te recomiendo piedrecitas para su pecerita, ya que la que es tipo arena ensucia más rápido el agua. <br>  Con plantas artificiales es suficiente, el chiste es que tenga un escondite, porque a estos peces les gusta esconderse de vez en cuando, o cuando menos eso he notado.<br>  No necesitan aire, el agua debe ser purificada, usa azul de metileno; te recomiendo anticloro, aunque al respecto el veterinario encargado de una tienda de mascotas te puede decir mejor.<br>  Ponle una lámpara para pecera, esto les gusta, porque así le marcas las horas del "dia" y de la "noche".<br>  Son peces aguantadores. Nada más checa que no le salgan como puntitos blancos porque esos son hongos, y les hacen mal (es como una enfermedad).<br>  Suerte|`|AyNxAHNSaa	1yo le doy a mi peces beta artemias pregunta por ellas en cualquier mercado que vendan peces o en cualquier acuario.<br>  2yo te sugiero que le pongas solo piedras es mas seguro.<br>  3para el agua compra anticloro cuesta como 9.00 pesos es muy barato.<br>  5en cualquier recipiente limpio lo puedes tener pero te recomiendo que le pongas la misma agua sucia que tenia la pecera lo sacas,recuerda la pecera que vas a lavar no la laves con jabon les da enfermedad|`|c691f6e39a0fca0fceed5c2fe9358e8caa	Hola!!! <br>  <br>  1. La puedes consegiur en alguna tienda de animales y tambien si las condiciones del tiempo y la regionm donde vives puede ser q la consigas en tu propia casa, ya q el alimento vivo consiste en larvas e mosquito y artemia salina! La artemia salina venden los cultivos en las tienas de animales, y las larvas de mosquitos la puedes conseguir en tu hogar si pones en tu jardin un resipiente con agua de lluvia. En una semana o un poco mas tendras el resipiente lleno de larvas de mosquito y estas las recogers y las en juagaras con agua limpia y se las daras atu pez!! Le ayudara mucho! Si tratas de conseguirla viva y no puedes pues esta la opcion de comprar la q biene liofozilizada q la venden en unos frascos en las tiendas de animales, venden bloodworms, brine shrimp y mosquito larves!! A los mios le compro los bloodworms, y el brine shrimp q es como unos camaroncitos! Los potesitos deben decir feeze dried food!! Es muy buena!<br>  <br>  2.Podrias poner priedritas de colores en cristal pero te recomiendo q le pongas grava, ya q esta te ayudara a crear un campo de bacterias nesesarias para tu pez. Esta bacteria no es perjudicial!! Lo unico q te digo es q pongas lo q le pongas nunca dejes q se acumule sucio ni restos de comida en la grava o piedra!! Te traera problemas y enfermedades!<br>  <br>  3.Tienes la opcion de plantas naturales o artificiales! plantas naturales: musgo de java (existen otras pero no me acuerdo de sus nombres ahora mismo)! Artificiales: tienes una gran variedad de plantas artificiales para escoger, pueden ser plasticas o con las hojas en tela. si la pecera donde esta es grande pues podras ponerle en el fondo y ademas una  q sus hojas lleguen a la superficie!!<br>  <br>  4.Yo te recomiendo q siempre el cambio de agua sea total! (yo siempre lo hago asi y no se me han murto) Depende el tama?o de tu pecera, si es muy peque?ita pues debera ser de cada 3 o 4 dias. Si es de 1 galon o mas pues 1 vez ala semana!!!<br>  <br>  5. Deberas echarle unas gotas de anticloro y antiestress. Tambien puedes utilizar 1 vez de cada sierto tiemo azul de metileno(ademas de lo q te escribi anteriormente). Venden unas tabletas y unos liquidos para q no se enturbie el agua rapido pero eso queda a tu decernimiento si lo quieres comprar o no!! Como tu quieras!!!<br>  <br>  6.Deberas lavarla cada vez q hagas el cambio pero no con jabon!! Solo con agua y un pa?ito!! Lugo le agregas la grava, las plantitas y el agua y las gotas de anticloro y anti estress, espera un par de minutitos y introduce el pez!! <br>  <br>  Recuerda q la temperatura de estar entre los 25 a 28C.<br>  Mejor aun si esta en 27C.!!! La comida en pellets debe ser de alta alidad te recomiendo betta bit, bettamin y yo utilizo ahora la de la marca Hikari es muy buena!!! Te ayuda con el crecimiento y su color!!! A mi me gusta darle mas esta y a mis bettas les gusta mucho mas y se la comen mas rapido, ya q los pellets son peque?itos y mas importante aun son flotantes se mantienen en la superficie, haci se te hara mas facil recogerla de la supeficie cuando ya estos no quieran mas! Dale comida 2 veces al dia! Los mios como ya son grandes les doy 3 o 4 bolitas 2 veces al dia.<br>  <br>  Suerte con tu mascota y q te salga todo bien!!<br>  Si tienes mas duditas no dudes en hacer las preguntas, para eso estamos! y tambien si lo deseas te puedes comunicar conmigo a ksyandjon@hotmail.com y hare lo posible por contestar tus dudas!!<br>  <br>  Cuidate|`|fxHeiCO9aa	1)En cualquier tienda de animales especial mente donde vendan peces, a veces  en los mercados ambulantes( si vives en el DF)<br>  2) Piedras cristalinas de colores<br>  3)Cada semana agua total, ya que les gusta el agua sucia, no necesitan, bombas de aire.<br>  4)No<br>  5)Cada semana, cuando cambies el agua. En un vaso de agua, con un colador. Necesitan agua de garrafon.|`|jB8jVckbaa	Espero que te pueda ayudar me gustan muchos los peces en especial los bettas.Y descuida no necesitan muchos cuidados.<br>  R:<br>  1.-La comida viva la puedes conseguir casi en cualquier acuario que le surtan y te recomiendo que compres mucha artemia son camaronsitos muy peque?os que le aportan muchas proteinas a tus peces y ademas les encantan y si quieres reproducirlos les ayuda mucho para tener en buen estado los hijos.<br>  2.-te recomiendo grava(natural) o canicas se ve la pecerita muy bien no te recomiendo las piedritas de colores porque esa grava es pintada y c va despintando con el paso de el tiempo y puede afectar a tu pez.<br>  3.-Mira normalmente el pez betta no necesita de plantas ponle mejor unas artificiales amenos que este en una pecera de mayores dimenciones porque si c las pones en una pecera chica te arriesgas a que c ensucie rapido el agua.solo te recomiendo que pongas plantas naturales si lo piensas reproducir.<br>  4.-depende de la pecera en la que lo tengas el promedio es de una ves por semana<br>  5.-pues no es necesario pero te recomiendo un acondicionador llamado pentabioclare es muy bueno<br>  6.-es que depende nucho de la pecera pero si es de las normale de 40 litros te recomiendo que una ves por mes y pongas al pez en un recipiente limpio y con un poco de agua de la misma pecera antes de volver al pez ala pecera recuerda que tienes que aclimatarlo asi evitaras muchas enfermedades.<br>  espero que te aya ayudado y si tienes mas preguntas escribeme ami correo te ayudare con mucho gusto pues a eso me dedico. adios

This is untrue. Dr. I. Brisbin of the University of Georgia states: <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Positive press <br>  Although negative information about pit bulls is widespread and, when a negative news story occurs, highly publicized, there are also many positive stories. Some work in hospitals and care facilities as certified therapy dogs, many are well-loved family pets, and some have even saved people's lives. There are many incidences of pit bulls being productively employed by U.S. Customs , as police K9s.<br>  Often pit bulls have been reported to "adopt" other species of animals (such as kittens or squirrels), earning the breed the nickname "nanny dog". <br>  A rescued pit bull called Popsicle is a United States Customs dog, and is famous for sniffing out one of the biggest cocaine busts in history. <br>  In February, 2006, New Yorker magazine writer Malcolm Gladwell published an article surveying the research on pit bulls which concluded that legal attempts to ban the breed were both crude and unnecessary. <br>  In February 2007 a pit bull named "Chief" rescued his family of humans from a spitting cobra by dashing in front of the attacking snake and taking the deadly bite himself. Chief subdued the snake but died of the venom 30 minutes later. <br>  In April 2007, columnist John Canzano of The Oregonian newspaper wrote a favorable piece on Hollywood, the pit bull that formerly belonged to NBA player Qyntel Woods. Hollywood, renamed Stella, was adopted by a loving owner and reformed from a fighting dog to a lap dog.<br>  News reports of injuries and fatal attacks <br>  News media stories of pit bull attacks involving disfiguring injury to humans and other animals, the latter very often also fatally, ranging in size from smaller nonpitbull dogs to horses can be found globally. The pit bulls involved were not always loose and off the owner's property, but sometimes were inside the home of the owner, who, or a family member or visitor, was the victim of the aggression. Fatal pit bull attacks to children and adults have been reported by the English-language news media in the United States and United kingdom.<br>  <br>  Actress Jessica Alba has a pit bull named Jim Bowie.<br>  Actress Jessica Biel owns three pit bulls.<br>  Rapper Big Boi from hip-hop duo Outkast is a registered pit bull breeder. <br>  Actors Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson have a pit bull named Penny Lane. <br>  Actor Michael J. Fox owns a pit bull named Burnaby. <br>  Radio host Ira Glass has a pit bull. <br>  West Coast Chopper owner Jesse G. James owns three pit bulls; he named his 50's style burger stand after Cisco. <br>  Jin Joo Lee (Korean Singer) has two pitbulls.[citation needed] <br>  Good Charlotte twins Joel and Benji Madden own a Blue pit bull named Easy.[citation needed] <br>  Daddy is a "pack member" of Cesar Millan's Dog Psychology Center. Hip hop artist Redman, Daddy’s original owner, gave the four-month-old puppy to Cesar. <br>  TV cook Rachael Ray has two pit bulls. <br>  Actress Alicia Silverstone has a rescued pit bull. <br>  Comedian Jon Stewart has pit bulls.<br>  Author Andrew Vachss, a vocal opponent of pit bull fighting and breed-specific bans, has a pit bull named Honey.|`|c38b90ec83e7a1baff9489608e8bde1daa	Pits can be just about any color combinations including red-nosed.

It's all about training. Find a dog that is trainable, such as a lab, retriever, etc, and go from there. You either need to put money into training, or money into a fence.

Siamese cats may carry their kittens for 67 days.|`|UdTFJuPpaa	65 days. You calculate from the mid day of mating if they are mating over three days. It can vary about 4 or five days either side.

wbRjrV4baa	Hi, unless you can be certain that your snake has stopped growing its impossible to go by overall length, at 24inches it may be a fairly well grown male or a not so well grown female.<br>  If you had 2 the same or about the same size that were different sexes its easy to tell the difference as a male has a much longer tail than a female which is quite short.<br>  With just the one to look at unless you are experienced you would only be able to guess. The only way to be certain even for an expert is probing where a proper snake probe is inserted into the cloaca and the distance it can enter is examined. Unless someone trained in these matters shows you how to do this I wouldn't recommend trying as you can seriously injure your snake if you get it slightly wrong.<br>  Your best bet would be to get someone to probe the animal for you. You can get loads of advice on care, diet etc. at either of these websites or loads of others<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hognose.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hognose.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hognose.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hognose.co.uk</a>|`|wAsRqA4gaa	Take it to a reptile shop and have it sexed.......
GIgYmoeIaa	as long as they are of similar sizes, they will be fine, however if you want them to breed then you need to house them separately for most of the year, only putting them together at breeding time, this is because they become used to each other and this reduces the urgency to breed, if you do not want to breed them then they are fine together, but never leave them together during feeding, if one snake was to grab the back end of the mouse and one the front end you will end up with one fat snake. best of luck!|`|wbRjrV4baa	They seem to get along fine together, I even housed a hognose and a corn together for a couple of days when I managed to break a door on corns viv (put water bowl through closed door!) and there were no problems.<br>  <br>  Hardest bit will probably be getting a guaranteed sexed female.|`|Mu2OYvnsaa	Yep, they can live together.  Kingsnakes can't live with snakes smaller than them or near their size because they would eat their tank mates.  Many Pythons, Many Boa's, Hognoses, Milksnakes, etc... can tank share.  <br>  <br>  Please be careful about who you sell any babies to.  I have lots of rescues in my home, and many more are in rescues from people who thought a snake would be cool....you know the rest.<br>  <br>  I will say, you need an incubator, egg laying box, etc...  The Pro's separate them so the female can do her brumation (sort of like hibernation) alone.  Then she has some specific feeding requirements.  <br>  Roughly 18 inches is about the minimum breeding size for females, and she should be vet checked before breeding (after brumation) to ensure she doesn't have any health issues / size issues  / respiratory issues.  Egg count I believe is up to 25, although I think I read 30 or 40 somewhere along the line.   Average is 10-15ish.<br>  <br>  Sexing of hognose snakes is a little easier because the tail sizes differ, however probing is the only guaranteed way to tell.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nvxsw8Mhaa	as im sure u know most species of snakes (inculding hognose's) should only be house together during breeding season. for the rest of the year must be house seperately<br>  <br>  snakes in general are not a social species and being housed all year round with another snake can cause large amounts of stress that can lead to illness/fighting|`|cLhF7DM9aa	Most snakes are not territorial and usually get on fine together, you will need to make sure they are similar in size though or the larger may see the smaller as food. If in doubt introduce them slowly in a neutral environment and go from there.|`|XJ6WGeWIaa	Hognoses are so cute!<br>  <br>  I would ask the people at your local reptile shop; thats what I did with my geckos. They know what their doing!
2yggimaTaa	with hognoses the length of tail is a fairly reliable way to sex them. I mean to be absolutely certain you'd have to get it probed or popped as well, but its not usually necessary for hoggies. Every male and female hognose I have ever seen have followed the tail length rule including my own breeding pair. i cant say for sure what sex you have without a pic, but females are usually stockier and have a stubby tail. the length of your snake alone makes me suspect it may be a female, otherwise its a pretty old male.<br>  these are some pics of what the tail of each sex should look like:<br>  <br>  female: <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/stha/western-hognose.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/stha/western-ho...</a><br>  male: <a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_eOlSPrkNj8o/RnM8XsS6WTI/AAAAAAAAAJA/6uMmYpDynrc/s1600-h/hognose.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp1.blogger.com/_eOlSPrkNj8o/RnM8...</a><br>  <br>  this site thats has some more info and pics about sexing: <a href="http://www.herpo.com/colubrids/nasicus-tails.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpo.com/colubrids/nasicus-t...</a><br>  <br>  i hope that helps!|`|baky18RXaa	Tail Lengh is not the most accurate way of telling although about 70% of the time is is what it looks like but cant be 100% sure so to be 100% sure. Since the sex organs are held internally, sexing visually is difficult, but there are visible clues. Because of the presence of the hemipenes, these visual clues relate to the shape and lenght of the tail:<br>  <br>      * Male: tail thicker and longer than in females, and also tapers less evenly to the tip (thicker for a bit then suddenly thinning).<br>      * Females: tail thinner and shorter than in males, and tapers smoothly, evenly and more quickly.  Probing a snake involves inserting a thin metal rod (probe) into the vent or cloaca. The probe can be inserted further in males due to the presence of the spaces in which the hemipenes sit.This method is best left to the pros because inserting the probe incorrectly can badly injure the snake. popping In very young snakes, the hemipenes can often be visualized with a fairly simple maneuver called popping. It is recommended that you do not try this yourself either, though; if done incorrectly, the snake could be injured (or at best you might just get the sex wrong)|`|6j9EZXGWaa	 To be 100% positively sure, have your hognose probed by someone who has experience with the procedure. I know a person that had a king snake for a few years and, named it "Harry". One day, just for the heck of it, he took it to a reptile expo and had it probed. Now, his snake's name is "Harriet".. |`|8i90ov0Gaa	Tail length is not an accurate way to sex them. It needs to be probed to know for sure.|`|EJOqYvMZaa	so i'm led to believe but i have been known to be wrong

If you just allow the dog to mount her unsupervised he could easily hurt her, especially if she is a maiden b*tch and she could possibly turn on him.<br>  <br>  There is a great deal to learn about Stud Dog work so you would be well advised to do your research first before embarking on such a project.  For instance, would you know how to examine the female for a possible stricture and what would you do if the female refused to accept the dog.<br>  <br>  Your dog is too young to be used at Stud yet.  It would be better to wait until he is about 2 yrs old and fully mature.  The female should also be over 2 yrs old before you consider using your dog on her.<br>  <br>  You need to make sure the pedigrees of both the dogs tie up and that there is no history of hip dysplasia or cataracts on either side  which could be passed on to the next generation.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of information on the Internet re Stud Work so it would perhaps be best if you did a bit of swotting up to make sure of what is expected if you want to go into this type of work correctly.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Why? Why? <br>  Get your dog neutered. "he is supposed to be mated" tells me you have no idea what to do. And you should not mate your dog. <br>  There are enough unwanted puppies in the world, so unless your dog can do something really special like speak english, fly, or do complicated algebra you have no business putting your dog out to stud. Besides, how do you know that you wouldn't be mating your dog with his sister or mother? <br>  Not getting your dog neutered increases his chances for prostate cancer and also increases his need for wandering the neighborhood, and increases his aggression. <br>  Be a responsible pet owner and have your dog neutered.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Cough cough..

Prove both dogs in the show ring, get a breeding mentor in your breed who knows what they are doing, and do years of study and research.  Then you will know what to do, instead of asking on here.<br>  <br>  And also, no dog should breed prior to 2 years of age.
PFpHDBP1aa	hola: el alimento cat chow es mucho mejor que whiskas, aunque hay otros para especialidades de mascotas de otras marcas y otros precios, claro que de las mejores que hay a un precio accesible es la cat chow pues whiskas contiene mucho desperdicio animal (grasas) y mucho colorizante y saborizante artificial por eso suele gustarles mucho, el cat chow es mejor pues esta mas enrriquesido con vitaminas pero por lo general no les agrada mucho, ahora si tus gatitas sufren de sobre peso es por la esterilización pues siempre después de operarlas tienden a aumentar su peso, lo que puedes hacer por el momento es reducir su cantidad de alimento pero si tienes que buscar uno que contenga mas vitaminas pues tienes que compensar, recuerda que no las quieres engordar sino tener nutridas cuidalas mucho pues el sobre peso es causa de problemas a su corazón(pueden presentar falta de actividad, convulciones, vomito,entre otras cosas, pero lo peor es un paro cardiaco)cuidalas |`|EKpXwS70aa	 definitivamente Whiskas es mucho mejor...!!* a mi gato le encanta<br>  |`|E6GmAD8Yaa	Whiskas... <br>  =) <br>  |`|0DfRBJrHaa	wiskas absolutamente a mi gato<br>  le  encanta<br>  besos|`|HwSwDoxhaa	Hola! pues cuando yo tuve gatos el veterinario me recomendó darles cat chow, ya que whiskas aunque es más popular tiene menos nutrientes, más grasa, colorantes y saborizantes artificiales que no son precisamente benéficos.

nMrf70Z4aa	The sizing for Equifit is as follows:<br>  S/M for horses who are 15.3 hh or shorter<br>  M/L for horses who are 16 hh or taller<br>  XL for horses who are built with bigger bones or taller then 17 hh.<br>  <br>  I work with these boots all the time, you would most definitely need the XL boot if your horse really is that tall.  Being a warmblood he most likely has a thicker bone structure then a leggy TB.  Again, double check with the company to see if you can exchange them if they are the incorrect fit.|`|WaiL2mFCaa	The best thing to do is take one and ask the store if you can return it if it does not fit.I would think a M\L should fit but who knows.|`|GamaRe7gaa	well it dependss on what size feet he has, i have a 15.? walking horse cross and he uses a 1 front and a 0 back shoe. my advice would be trace his feet (Front and Rear) on some cardboard cut it out and see if you think the boot will fit on the foot
bPdqwkpPaa	Ruh-Roh, looks like you used a Backyard Breeder or Puppy Mill!  Be prepared for a long and bumpy road!  <a href="http://64.37.122.206/Info/questionstoaskabreeder.asp?menu=Info" rel="nofollow">http://64.37.122.206/Info/questionstoask...</a><br>  <br>  A responsible breeder does not sell this breed until 12 weeks old.  Your puppy has missed out on imperative interaction time with his mother and littermates.  Things that a puppy should have learned, like bite inhibition, self-control, and basic socialization may be lacking in this pup. <br>  <br>  The pup has obviously not been correctly socialized.  He's never been outside and was traumatized by it?  Eeeek.  <br>  <br>  The soft poop could be from the lower quality food, it could be simply because he's a puppy, or it could be because he's stressed from the move.  Keep an eye on it and consider upgrading to see if that helps.  Puppies from bad breeders tend to have GI problems and food sensitivities.  Euk Small Breed's 3rd ingredient is Corn - a huge allergen.  I assume you mean the puppy formula.  <br>  <br>  Once he's more settled, try upgrading foods.  Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Avo Derm, Canidae, Evo, California Natural, are all high quality foods that the pup may thrive on.  <br>  <br>  Slowly acclimate him to the outside.  Don't overdo it.  If he's hesitant, then 30 seconds may be long enough.  The next day, 45 seconds.  <br>  <br>  And be careful, puppy pads can lead to potty training difficulties later on in life.  <br>  <br>  GL!|`|ZHlktWk6aa	OK, question, Did you change his food or is this what he is used to?<br>   I assume you have had him vet checked and shots started? Checked for worms? If not do that as soon as possible. You really don't want to take him out in the yard until he has some shots.<br>   My little shih tzu was only 5 weeks old when I got her(yes from a byb) but i bought her anyway because she would have died if left there. She has done great once I got her over the kennel cough that almost killed her.<br>  Using wee pads is ok but may make outside potty training take a bit longer. I think you will be ok, just go slowly when introducing him to new situations.<br>  Shih tzu do have respritory problems and are prone to slipped disks. But they are great little dogs. ENJOY!!<br>   <br>   |`|2pLTOHaSaa	Congrats on your new baby! I am a proud owner of a 8 mos. old female Shih Tzu. Your puppy is very young and he has to get use to going for walks especially on a leash. Going on a walk seems new to him and over time, he will get use to it. Good Luck!

D5FIEpaaaa	You need to give more information about your current situation. How old are you? How active are you? Do you own or rent? House or apartment? Are you home a lot or do you work all day? Do you have other pets already? Do you have family / roommates living with you? What kinds of activities are you planning on doing with your dog? etc etc etc<br>  <br>  If space is an issue that will narrow your choices down quite a bit. Ditto with wanting an energetic dog vs. a couch potato. If you are into jogging, hunting, camping, or just vegging on the couch all day, that should also play into your decision. Do you have time to walk the dog train the dog, etc? Will others be helping to care for the dog? (If so, they need to be a part of the decision too.) Also, some breeds of dogs require owners with a bit more experience than other breeds. Some are easier to train than others. And if you get a puppy, you will need a LOT of patience and a LOT of time to devote to house training and training in general.<br>  <br>  May I suggest looking at the akc website at <a href="http://www.akc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org</a> so you can get more info about different breeds...

Blue merle looks like splashes of black against a gray or powder blue background. Red merle looks like red or brown splashes against a buff or silver background. Any of these colors can come with white and/or copper-colored trim. Dogs that have only one color of trim are called bi or bi-colored (i.e., a red and white dog is a red bi). Dogs that have both trim colors are called tri or tri-colored (i.e., a black dog with copper and white is a black tri).<br>  My favorite is the Black tri! mine has only a little white on her tummy and she is mostly black all over with copper only on her legs and beautiful black marking on her face which is copper she is Gorgeous! <br>  <br>  The eyes of the Australian Shepherd are perhaps one of his most commented on features because of the variety of colors. They may be any color or combination of colors from glassy blue, amber, hazel, to all shades of brown. <br>  <br>  <br>  you said you want a playful dog well you can buy her all kinds of toys from the petstore and she will love and have so much fun becasue these dogs love their toys more then most dogs and this breed is more playful then any other small dog.<br>  this breed is very smart and easy to train and my dog was the smartest and best in her dog school which there were other very smart dogs in her class.<br>  now if you get a puppy it will be like babysiting all day long because she is like a baby and if she has accidents in your house you can't be mad you just have to accept that she will go in the house when she is a puppy but she will learn quick that only outside is okay so just take your puppy out like every 10-15 min and she will learn quick that you want her to only go outside and not in the house. you will also need a crate is you get a puppy and you need to keep the crate next to you while you sleep at night becasue your puppy will bond with you if she can be near you durning the night becasue she can smell your scent but the best way to bond with your puppy and get respect is to walk her everyday!<br>  if you go to the store for 10 min and you have no one to babysit your puppy then you need to keep your puppy in a crate so she doesn't hurt herself from walking around your house all alone. just remember a puppy is a baby and you need to be there with her. maybe you should rescue a dog that is in a shelter? a shelter dog will be much easier to live with then a puppy.<br>  <br>  you should get this dog b/c a mini aussie is so sweet and very smart and she has a tough mean soundning park that will sound cool if someone knocks on your door lol. I like the Black tri color b/c many people think my dog is a rott puppy b/c of her colors black and copper and she has only a little small heart shape of white on her tummy, so if you can finnd a black tri with no white on her face then everyone will think you have a rott puppy lol and people are so surprised when I tell them she is a mini australian shepherd! <br>  <br>  Don't forget you need to brush your dogs teeth 3x a week and take the dog to the vet 2x a year to get a teeth cleaning from the vet Doctor.<br>  You also need to brush your dog everyday if she has long hair and you need to trim her nails which most vets do for $15 every month or you can do it yourself.also small dogs need to go to a pro dog groomer once a month for the rest of their life.<br>  you need to give her flea and tick drops EVERY month! and Heartworm gaurd.<br>  <br>  if you get a puppy she will have accidents all over your house because she is a baby puppy and won't know right from wrong so you will be busy cleaning more often.<br>  You will want to buy a crate to keep her in while you go up to the store for 15 min so she doesn't harm herself because no one is watching her.<br>  You have to pick up her "doggie no no" when she is outside and put it in a bag and when she goes in the house.<br>  <br>  You need top of the line dog food every month which is very expansive.<br>  You have to plan on setting aside thousands of dollars incase something happens to your puppy and she needs to go to the vet for a emergency.<br>  <br>  Whoever you buy your puppy or dog from make sure they are NOT a BACKYARD Breeer <br>  or a PUPPYMILL! <br>  <br>  Owning a dog is very expansive...and if you get a puppy you are babysiting all day and all night long.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and research your breed of choice and buy many books and read everything you can learn about the dog you want so you know what to expect the dog to be like.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.namascusa.com/puppies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.namascusa.com/puppies.htm</a>|`|DJYNiZGQaa	either a golden retriever or a labrador retriever. they are both very loving and good with just about anyone or anything. they are intelligent, playful, and easy to train.|`|GltLU7Jgaa	get a lab...they are great dogs to be around!|`|be17d48912e7620496fdc4da99b5fbb3aa	Boxer.

I asked my vet if his heart & lungs were ok.( my other dog had heart meds for same symptoms )<br>  The vet said he was ok, probably picked up Kennel Cough.<br>  2 days later my dog couldn`t get his breath I sat with him some of the night to hold & comfort him. Soon I realised he could not wait until morning.I phoned an emergency vet & took him along. She found fluid coming from his nose, it had to get out somewhere.This vet ordered an immediate Xray since she COULDN`T get a reading on his heart. Too much fluid.<br>  She put him on duretics to reduce the fluid. After a few days she was able to tell the state of his heart & medicate.<br>  Needless to say I permanantly changed to that vet.<br>  Of course, I know every case is different. I tell you what I found to be from the same symptoms because if you don`t get the right help soon enough, who knows what could happen.<br>  When I answer these questions,I`m left wondering how things went.<br>  Maybe you would consider letting me know?|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Sounds like kennel cough to me.  The pattern is always....3 coughs then a gag.|`|AA10148136	kennel cough but see a vet to much sure   got to get meds for this|`|zA0e7QWCaa	I think that it could be a variety of things. I had 5 dogs but only four now. But anyway one of them has allergies and coughs in the spring and in the fall. My other dog that passed away used to cough and cough like he had a bone of something hung in his throat. I knew that I had not given him any he continued to cough and got to where he laid around alot and when he walked around he seemed like he was out of breath. Long story shorten I finally gave in and took him to the vet and he was having heart failure. The vet said it was fluid building up around his heart. He gave him med's but he eventually passed away from this so please go get your pet check out.|`|IJdPFYPmaa	just like the previous person said, it could technically be kennel cough. it is highly contagious and very easily transmitted.  they dont actually need to come in contact wth another dog to catch it.  are heartworms a possibility?  one of the first signs of heartworms is coughing.  if he is on a preventative then i would go with kennel cough.  be prepared for a long course of antibiotics as it can be very persistent.  good luck and hope he feels better|`|UR6GQOe7aa	yeah it could be kennel cough, but more likely a hair ball, i have had cats for years, my male one coughs, it sounds like a dog bark, he also has never been sick after coughing, but they do it to unstick hair caught in the throat. if he is very persistent take him to the vets for a check. you can but special treats that they eat that can relive it a bit, doesn't always work though|`|dKfWQcP1aa	Memphis, this is exactly the story I was going to tell. It was a 5  year old Dobermann girl it happened to. The vet diagnosed kennel cough. I kept taking her back saying she wasn't any better, but he was young and arrogant (or ignorant) and the dog was dead within days. I should have sought a second opinion, but I don't think it would have  saved the dog's life.<br>  <br>  Kennel cough is airborne so your dog wouldn't need to have been in direct contact. As always, if in doubt get vet advice. (and don't be afraid to ask for second opinion)|`|7wfNpTemaa	Sounds like kennel cough, If your dog is young and healthy it shouldn't cause him to much distress but he could pass it on to other dogs. If they are puppies or elderly it can be very serious and could die. <br>  Best to have your dog vaccinated against it for the future.|`|z5W2cTFYaa	he does not have to be around any other dog just taking him out for a walk where other dogs have been is enough to get kennel cough it is very contagious and if you do not want to lose your dog get him to the vets as soon as possible|`|igJf9hv0aa	dogs can pick up kennel cough from areas that other dogs have been to - like lets say you walking ur dog and u pass an area where a dog has kennel cough, there are many many forms out there, my dog had kennel cough at one point too - got him some cough tabs at the vet and all was well again|`|JIkfrC71aa	Perhaps he is smoking to much!|`|Fm60ETakaa	i dont know but i bet the vet will take asap|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Some breeds are more at risk of DCM. (Dilated cardiomyopathy)<br>  <br>  My female Dobermans only system was a cough when she was excited. Shortly after the cough started when took her to see a canine cardiologist. Becca died of heart failure before we could even get the result of the scan back. We were informed after that it was DCM.|`|AA11097657	It sounds like kennel cough to me. Kennel cough is air born and also survives on grass so he won't have had to be in contact with other dogs to catch it.<br>  A good test for kennel cough is to put 2 fingers either side of his throat under the dogs chin to see if the glands are swollen. Squeeze gently and this will bring on a coughing fit if he has kennel cough.<br>  These are some of the symptoms of kennel cough.<br>  <br>  They cough when they first move around in the morning.<br>  <br>  All they bring up if anything is a bit of spit.<br>  <br>  Any pressure on the throat, like going on a lead causes a coughing fit.<br>  <br>  If your dog is elderly it could also be a sign of heart disease or lung worm if he is a young dog.

Yo soy de Guadalajara y tengo una perrita chihuahua de 1 a?o y tambien es muy inquieta. Hace poco la lleve de viaje a Pto. Vallarta que mas o menos se hace el mismo tiempo que tu haras de tu casa a Veracruz. Yo realmente no creo que sea conveniente llevarla dentro de su casita transportdora, puesto que creo que se sentira enjaulada y se estresara aun mas con el movimiento. Yo me la lleve adelante conmigo, al principio estaba como loca, pero le pregunte al Veterinario y me dijo que es simplemente emocion de ellos que con un rato que pase se les quita. Pero que no les pasa nada con el viaje. Eso sí!, asegurate de que haga sus necesidades antes de salir. procura por lo menos hacer dos paradas durante el viaje para que se desestrese y se desentuma. Veras que con esas sencillas cosas todo saldra bien.|`|CEMLodPIaa	hola,<br>  <br>  Mira lo mejor que puedes hacer es en primera llevarlo en un transportadora que tenga el suficientes espacio.

Metele un juguete donde se le pueda poner un premio de carnaza con un poco de pate, esto disminuira el stress del viaje.<br>  <br>  Y cuando ya hallas llegado al lugar, no lo saques de inmediato, espera unas horas para que no resienta el cambio de clima y pueda tener la clasica tos de la perreras o algun mal respiratorio consecuente. <br>  <br>  Por ultimo ofrecele algo como el strepen o el hidrolife que son multivitamicos en polvo para via oral, comumente utilizados para aves y animales de engorda, esto ayudara a desaparecer el stress que le dio el viajecito. <br>  <br>  Saludos, toma precauciones, el mayor problema lo representa los cambios de clima.|`|Zn9TYTAWaa	No habria razon de que se te enferme y menos por ese lapso de tiempo.<br>  <br>  lo que necesitas es ofrecerle agua de vez en cuando y nada mas, a mitad de viaje algo de comer, aunque no creo que quiera si se pone inquieto.<br>  <br>  Quedate tranqui, aparte si su casa transportadora es del tama?o adecuado para el animal, no va a ver ningun problema.<br>  <br>  Suerte!!<br>  ------    ------   ------ <br>  <br>  Mira el Video!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://negocioenmarcha.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://negocioenmarcha.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Mira el Video!

I don't want my dog looking like everyones elses!!!|`|Yq2MWKMeaa	I'm not sure there is a best breed of dogs.  I believe it's a perfect mix between the dog and the person.  Everyone has different tastes in dogs and in what they like in their temperaments.  We had two bird dogs when I was a kid and they were the best dogs to run and play with.  Then, we had a mixed little dog, and he was just the best one ever.  So cute and fun to play with.  Then, I used to have cats and said I'd never have a dog!  Then, I got a Chow.  I loved my Chow Chow when I had one ... he was absolutely the best ever.  Very protective and such a pretty dog.  I loved him the best.  Then I had a Yorkie ... such a wonderful little dog.  Absolutely the best little thing ... such a nice little temperament.  He was the best and I loved him the most.  Now, we have two little Pugs.  They are absolutely the best dogs I've ever had.  I love them the best and don't know what my day would be like without them!  So now, Pugs are absolutely the best breed I've ever had.  They're so playful and affectionate.  They love to be around me and they love to go wherever I go.  Very friendly little dogs.  I love to play with them and they love to play.  I absolutely love our Pugs!!|`|6HA6nm2uaa	In my opinion, I would have to go with either the Basset Hound or the Bichon Frise.<br>  <br>  The Basset Hound because I own two and they are great dogs!!!!

I have a 3 year old that likes to play rough with them and i have an 11 month old that loves to climb all over them.  They love to cuddle and love to go for walks, but they are not the best guard dog.<br>  <br>  The Bichon Frise because they are great with kids, they are small dogs and they DO NOT shed.  My grandparents own one and the only time she ever had a shedding problem was when she was shedding her "puppy fur".  She is a great riding, walking, and running dog.  She does not meat a stranger, which is good if you are not looking for a guard dog.|`|DfdSdmahaa	bullys.. they are the most mistreated and misunderstood breed out there.  through personal experience i find them to be one of the most gentle and loving breeds there is.|`|HWFKiK5Zaa	There's no such thing as a "best' breed of dog.

22198ecf0cd7f0033e957c7913565c92aa	It may not seem like it to you cause you don't speek dog, but they do have a language and a way of putting each other in check.<br>  <br>  I have a 56 pound Husky, male; a 35 pound Greyhound mix, female; and an 8 pound Chihuahua/Dachshund mix, female and they all play fabulously together.  The little one usually gets hurt and she just jumps up and bites the one who hurt her really hard.  What she is doing is saying "what you just did right there deserved me hurting you so you know that it was too hard."  Every time the bigger dog gets a hard bite, the big dog learns that he/she is being too rough and now knows the boundary of rough play.  The little one does hold her own though!  So, let the dogs play for longer.  As long as tails are wagging and there is lots of activity going on in the play, they're fine.  If you see the dogs tails down or not high and wagging, but stiff, mouths closed, leaning forward and high on toes, then there's cause to be worried, however don't mistake that for no wagging loose tail, still and staring leaning back or sitting, I like to call that the "stare down".  My medium dog and little dog do this before they start to play as a who makes the first move type thing.  <br>  <br>  Try not to overprotect your dog because he will become dependant upon you and may develope sepparation anxiety, besides, he's a husky, he'll grow fast and big, mine is 56 pounds.  So, don't worry about it, the dogs will keep each other in check and calm down.  And just let them play outside and be calm inside to keep the rough play to a minimum.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Cara|`|7iaDMqvlaa	Yes, actually.. they will calm down. I currently have two dogs, a one year old Dachshund Pomeranian mix(who's really small) named Lucy, and a brand new Labrador Shepherd mix(who's already bigger at three months) named Samantha. At first, Sam would always play too rough with Lucy, and would end up hurting her... but now Sam has learned that she needs to play nicer with Lucy in order to play at all. They worked it out on their own, and now Lucy never gets hurt. It took Sam about a month to discover Lucy's limits, but now she knows them perfectly. I think your best bet would be to just let them play. It will be sad at first, because your Husky will yelp here and there, but just remember they are learning! Also, maybe keep them separated until the Husky is at least 2 months old.|`|8tHWSQveaa	You are going to have to let them play together more than 2 times a day or you are going to have a very big problem on your hands when they get bigger. Their play to you may seem rough, but remember these are dogs they tend to play rougher than we do. Also, if you intend to keep them both you are going to have to let them establish their relationship with each other. One will establish dominance over the other and they will settle into their "pack" mentality. the most important thing for you to do is to make sure that both of them know at all times that you are the "pack leader" no matter which one of them is the Alpha dog you are ALWAYS the pack leader.<br>  <br>  I have 3 labs. 2 are males that we got about 2 weeks apart. They are brother's through and through but there is a very obvious alpha dog and the other one obviously isn't. They established their roles in their pack very early on, we never have any problems with them. It's the female that gives us the worst fits!<br>  <br>  let them play together and just keep an eye on them. As they grow up they will calm down.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9UplT75saa	he may seem like he's being to rough.  dog play is never as bad as it seems. they do like to rough house and it can seem really harsh.  just imagine a couple of guys playing football.  from the outside it seems a really harsh sport, but the guys enjoy it. at the same time look at it from his view.  you brough anther thing home and he's not getting attention like he was.  he's going to also teach the puppy that he's the top dog and the new puppy isn't the top dog.  best thing you can do is back off and only interfer when it gets to rough.  try getting the puppies intrested in a tug of war type toy.  he could also be happy to have a playmate and it might a take a week or two for them to establish the bounds.  in a few months the husky's going to outgrow the boxer mix probly inway... let the mix have his fun for now|`|M3xICUb6aa	You are the alpha, so you can dictate how they interact.  Your older puppy is probably showing the husky that he is ALPHA.  You need to assert yourself.  That way, both dogs will feel comfortable in the pack hierarchy, and not be competing for the top spot.<br>  <br>  When your lab mix is a bit too rough, hold him on his back for about 10 seconds.  This puts you in a dominant position, and should show your puppy that you are boss.|`|PQlbtVnLaa	In general, people interpret dog play to be much more aggressive than it actually is. Your puppies may indeed be actually aggressive with each other, but barking, growling, nipping and chasing are all normal. What isn't normal is if one dog in constantly pinning the other, not giving him a chance to retaliate or chasing him when the other puppy wants to get away.<br>  <br>  If the puppies are really being aggressive, take the aggressive puppy away when he starts getting too rough and put him in a crate or another room. The non-aggressive puppy should give him signs of his own accord to let the other puppy know he's being too rough (like yelping). Once the puppy yelps, the other one should stop.|`|m0ywE4tjaa	big puppy are so cuddly and fuzzy<br>  <br>  but litttle ones think they're big and they get all mean.
RmSQIc0Vaa	The mother may have abandoned the nest for many reasons, but not because your mom touched it.  Birds do not have an acute sense of smell, and the parents will not detect your mom's scent on the nest.  Wildlife biologists and bird banders handle nests, eggs and baby birds all the time - they are licensed to do so - and the parent birds never abandon their nests, eggs or babies because of this.  Actually, your mom did exactly the right thing, putting the nest back up.<br>  <br>  It, unfortunately, does not matter if the eggs are dead or not -  in the US, it is illegal to take the eggs from any native nigratory bird's nest.<br>  <br>  In the US, ALL native migratory birds - not just endangered species - are protected under federal law (Migratory Bird Treaty Act). It is illegal for anyone to possess a protected bird, its nest, its eggs or even its feathers unless they have the required federal and state licenses. It is also illegal to disturb an active nest. Penalties for violating this law include fines of up to $500 and/or up to 6 months in jail for each offense. <br>  <br>  It doesn't even matter if you did not mean to break the law: "A type of question that we commonly get involves well meaning people who want to rescue young or injured birds, secure feathers for artwork, or salvage eggs or nests for various purposes.<br>  <br>  Anyone desiring to possess migratory birds or their parts or products should be aware that all of these are covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16U.S.C. 703-712), which implements a series of international treaties designed to protect migratory birds.<br>  <br>  Some key provisions of the Act are worth keeping in mind:<br>  <br>  Wording of the Act makes it very clear that most actions that result in "taking" or possession of a protected species or its parts or products is a violation of the Act. Specifically, the Act states: <br>  "Unless and except as permitted by regulations, …it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means, or in any manner…to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, …possess, offer for sale, sell, …purchase, import…any migratory bird, any part, nest, or eggs of any such bird…" <br>  It is a "strict-liability" law, meaning that there is no requirement for law enforcement agencies to prove "intent" to violate the law. That is, if you are found in possession of a protected species or its parts or products, you are automatically in violation of the law. <br>  The provisions of the Act are nearly absolute; "...except as permitted by regulations ..." is the only exception. Some examples of permitted activities that do not violate the law are legal hunting of specific game birds, legitimate research activities, display in licensed zoological gardens, and bird banding under an appropriate permit. <br>  The Act covers the great majority (83%) of all native birds found in the U.S. Many of the species not covered by the Act are covered by the Endangered Species Act , other Federal laws, or state laws, many of which are as stringent as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . In the lower 48 states, all species except the house sparrow, feral pigeon, common starling, and non-migratory game birds like pheasants, gray partridge, and sage grouse, are protected. <br>  Penalties upon conviction can be severe. Even if a sympathetic jury finds that you meant no harm in trying to rear an abandoned nestling or in picking a hawk feather, legal defense costs are clearly not worth the risk. <br>  In summary: your best approach is to take a hands off approach...look but don't collect."  <a href="http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/about/faqs/birds/feathers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/about/faqs/bir...</a><br>  <br>  So, leave the nest and the eggs alone.  Not all eggs hatch, not all baby birds survive.  That is the way nature works.|`|ZOIiUtafaa	If it is just  a empty bird nest , with no eggs or babies in it just leave it. <br>  There are plenty of reasons why a bird could abandon a nest.  eg the nest was too small, bad position, too pokey, too warm /cold, there is a cat/dog nearby, it lost a fight over the nest but that bird didnt want it etc<br>  If there are eggs or babies in the nest keep a verry close eye on it incase the mother comes back.  If she doesent find out somwere that can legally take care of native birds.<br>  <br>  The main thing is just leave it be if its empty|`|4mk4sLsuaa	Most birds can't smell. Plain and simple. The mother probably left the nest for one of several reasons. I doub't she'll be back. But don't touch the nest, you never know.|`|QyKksrILaa	chances are the bird and family moved out like we do birds move house too <br>  if you do find the bird take it to your local vet. <br>  it doesnt cost anything coz its wildlife but dont panic im sure mumma bird just got fed up with a small nest

The dog is probably still a little shaken and tired as you would be to. If in doubt or the dog is not acting right I would call the vet again and ask some detailed questions. This is what you paid for. If he gets really lethargic and gums get paler then I would take to ER vet asap. Could have internal injury that first vet did not discover or sometimes these injures show up later. Could have a slow internal bleed. Good luck and keep him warm and cozy. Offer food and water in small amounts. |`|GIeGVJRmaa	I would say if your vet felt comfortable sending your dog home (unless he sent him home to die) the chances of him surviving are real good.  Allow him to be on the couch near you and maybe he will settle better.  Keeping him covered is a good idea.  I hope he does well. |`|QiP2Rajhaa	Try not have him move around that much right now.  he should survive if the vets let the dog go home.  make sure you know a number for 24 hour vet. just in case.|`|wX3RzHaRaa	Your vet works for you, don't be afraid to ask questions about your dog's health.

f1kRtbMAaa	At 5 weeks old you may not be able feel the testicles.They may not have dropped down into the sack yet or you may not feel them because at this age they are about pea sized.An experienced breeder or vet can feel them if they have descended into their proper position.Many vets will wait to neuter a pup until both testicles have dropped.This can take up to 6 months or longer.If one or more doesn't drop the pup<br>  still can be neutered but then it is more like spay since<br>  they have<br>  to go inside and find it.|`|gwUMipsUaa	That's because they won't drop until he's 5 months old or so.  No vet will neuter him until that time.<br>  <br>  It would be good to do research about puppies before getting them.<br>  <br>  A puppy should still be with his mama until 8 weeks old.|`|JpdVidqxaa	He is too young yet for them to have dropped.  You won't be able to neuter him for another 6 months anyway.|`|EOYVileUaa	I hope he is still with his mom and littermates!<br>  <br>  They haven't dropped yet, are you 5?|`|k6flESfNaa	why do you have a 5 week old puppy!? and duh he has some but they havent dropped yet!|`|4higWvgaaa	Wow, stupid question!

lPdCTyOAaa	Craigslist is the best.  I got my kittens from someone on Craigslist and they have a fantastic home.  Clean litter, plenty of food, regular vaccinations, the whole nine.  Just use good sense when you let someone take them, and don't let them go with anyone that doesn't feel right.  Just because someone has come to your home doesn't make you obligated to give them the cats if you don't want them to have your kittens.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Post an ad on Craigslist, charge a small adoption fee to make sure they don't end up as snake food. Be sure to screen potential owners. Don't send the kittens off to somebody who can't properly take care of them!<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can also send them to your local pound or humane society, but there are always high numbers of cats and it can sometimes be tricky to get such organizations to take more in. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10356572	thanks for keeping the mom.. BUT remember she once belonged to somebody and they might want her back.. aditionaly the kittens are NOT yours to get rid of.. as such you need to phone your local shelter and report finding them in case anyone has reported missing them..<br>  then take the kittens to the shelter so they can screen potential adopters if the original owner does not claim them<br>  <br>  here is a link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/How-To-Get-Rid-Of-An-Unwanted-Pet.86812" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/How-To-Get-...</a>|`|1rFYElOnaa	I would consider taking them to an adoption center where they will receive medical attention, food and water, and a chance to be adopted by a loving family. I'm a little skeptical of Craigslist because you never know who you might end up selling the cats too (e.g. someone who won't take care of them properly, someone who will abuse the cats) Also, ask you're friends and neighbors if they or anyone they know might want a kitten, Christmas time is coming up and I'm sure people are looking for cute kittens to give as a gift! Good luck! |`|ciXSjbCiaa	I agree, you can try to sell them but make sure you charge a reasonable amount for them so that you can reduce the probability that they will be abused. I would also definitely screen the potential owners - make sure you do your research and that they will be put into loving homes. Or you could also ask friends, family, etc that you know well that may be interested. Good luck:)|`|FjPpWVCnaa	sell them??? who sells kitten?? u DONT give them away put add in papper FREE KITTENS!!|`|ZhoRPVekaa	Sell them or bring them to an animal shelter, they will find homes for them. |`|685JlYsBaa	go give them to a place that take care of pets, u can get money for it, like a pets mart
pyqgEbmsaa	You cannot tell what your 8 week old puppy is going to be like.. He was not registered for good reason, he cannot be registered cause his parents weren't both registered.. For whatever reason, your dog's mother was not worthy of spending the time and effort to get registered.. HE is not worthy to be a stud dog.. No one would ever breed to an unreg'd dog no matter what you try to tell them about him. A dog that is not registered is considered a mutt.. <br>  <br>  His health and temperament at 8 weeks of age are going to seem good.. He is a puppy ... He is a dog that should be neutered.. Not registered, not eligible for registration.. and you cannot even be positive of his background with out registration. Get him neutered.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Wow, he is 8 weeks old and has good health and temperament.  I would say that describes about 100 trillion puppies.  He is not even registered.  Why wasn't his mother registered if she came from CH lines?  Makes no sense to me.  With all of the purebred Boxers that are in Boxer rescue, why would you even have this on your mind?  If you think you are going to make money on this, think again.  Nobody with a nice b**ch would even want to use him for a stud.  If you are thinking that you want one of his pups,  just purchase another pup.  As being the owner of a stud dog, you do not have to take care of a pregnant b**ch, a litter, take care of their medical needs, pay for an unexpected C-Section, find proper homes for all the pups, ect.  I think you are looking to make a few $'s down the line.  Sorry, it just won't happen.  Have him neutered.  You can't get testicular cancer if you have no testicles.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Nope. You need to show him, have him win champion titles, pass all the health checks and have 100% perfect health. <br>  <br>  <br>  And even then you shouldn't do it. There are way to many homeless dogs already. Wayyyy too many. Seriously. And neutering your dog will make him live longer. He will also no longer be at risk for prostate cancer.|`|Bw18seFqaa	"CH bloodlines" doesnt mean anything.  Pretty much ALL registered purebreds have "CH bloodlines"..  that just means there is a CH dog somewhere in the pedigree.<br>  <br>  Considering that the mom isnt registered..  that means your pup is not registered either.  No one with a decent female will consider your dog for stud..  they will be seeking a registered CH titled dog that has passed OFA, CERF, BAER, Optigen, and PennHip exams, as well as a brucellosis test.<br>  <br>  It doesnt even matter if you have his health and temperment tested.  Without registration papers.. he's ineligible for show, any pups are ineligible for registration, and his pedigree cannot be researched for health, temperment issues and faults.<br>  <br>  <br>  He may be beuatiful..  but that's not a reason to breed.. there are LOTS of beautiful dogs in shelters and rescues already, including purebred boxers.|`|KXzUgTE0aa	Your dog should be neutered.<br>  There is way too many dogs being euthanized because of backyard breeders.<br>  You SHOULD be looking into getting him fixed. Leave the breeding to proffesionals. <br>  period. |`|paaozogGaa	no, I have a better idea!<br>  Get him neutered! <br>  YAY!!!<br>  No, but seriously please there are so many homeless pups and dogs that we just don't need any more!|`|VxKH7KHmaa	To Stud...or not to stud? <br>  Heres a great link that will answer all of your questions...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogstuff.info/to_breed_or_not.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstuff.info/to_breed_or_not...</a>|`|JpdVidqxaa	First of all if your dog is not registered then it is really is the same as a mutt, from the AKCs standpoint.  Only show dogs that have met the breed standard, have their championships, have passed all their health clearances, and have good temperament, should be used as a stud since they would be improving the breed. Also would you breed with?  Why would someone with a quality dog want to breed with your dog?  All you would find would be someone in the neighborhood and if your dog is not registered, then the pups can't be registered so they cannot be sold.|`|kRO55DHyaa	How do you plan to stud your dog without registration?  I think that it's not a good idea.  The fact that your dog came from "champion lines" doesn't mean a thing.  I don't know anyone with champion dogs that would allow one of their dogs to breed indiscriminately (as in being breed to an unregistered, unproven dog), so the champions can not be very recent.  You definitely need to have him fixed-your dog has nothing to offer a prospective *****.|`|lhbpBnBAaa	I'm suspicious of the fact that the mother is from champion blood lines but is not registered. Because his mother is not registered, he can't be registered, and therefore, he can't compete in showing to win his CH title. There are thousands of dogs out there, only the best of the best should be bred. Owning an intact dog is a huge responsibility; it also puts your dog at risk for severe medical issues.|`|sWWR2R0Baa	Well...when considering this option...think of the health and overall happiness of the dog.<br>  <br>  Not being neutered could lead to bad behaviors, such as mounting and male aggression. The dog is more likely to pick up certain cancers as well. An un-altered male will be much more likely to wander off in search of a female.<br>  <br>  I guess this depends, also, on how high the demand for a stud would be in your area.<br>  <br>  Did you pay for a pet only? My breeder made me sign a spay/neuter contract when I got my Husky.|`|aI3eq3onaa	He may come from champion lines, but unless he proves himself as a champion, not may people will want to use him.<br>  Consider showing him, and see how he does, check with a breed club to help you get started and go from there.<br>  <br>  add: misread..if mother isn't registered, then your dog will not be able to be registered and showed.|`|Wbxekzy8aa	It might be difficult to sell the pups if they are not registered.  Or at least to get top $ for them.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	No, I would not use this dog at stud.  If the mother is not registered, then the puppy also can't be registered with the AKC.  To prove a dog is worhty of breeding, it needs to be put into the conformation ring, and shown to a championship.  You can't do this with an unregistered dog.<br>  <br>  If you want to truly consider becoming a responsible and reputable breeder, you need to spend years researching and understanding your breed, then find a breeder who has lines you really like and acquire your first potential show dog from that breeder.  Then that good show breeder will be there for you along the way and will mentor you in your goals to become a good breeder.<br>  <br>  Anything less than what I described in the second paragraph is merely backyard breeding, as would it be if you breed a dog without proper paperwork.  If it doesn't have AKC, UKC or CKC (Canadian Kennel Club) registration, have it altered at the appropriate age and enjoy your pet.|`|nwcsRZjnaa	he is not registered because his mother is not and any health problems need to be checked out i wouldn't use him as stud 
5PG9H1ozaa	Dear Cassandra,Congrats to you on owning the noble Boxer and taking the effort to ? what's good in the canine diet. I too own Boxers and find them to be everything you could ask for in a pet.I'll tell you what I've told my "customers" for years....Iams Smart puppy food for the 1st 2 years. This augmented with a chewable puppy vitamin will give your pet 100% essential nutri.Now I also practice what I preach and have pretty healthy pets who live at least 50% longer than breed expectations. Now Cassandra, don't fall for the so called "experts" who will have believe that unless you feed the upper tier foods, Wellness,Nutro Ultra,Blue Buffalo, Solid Gold etc,you are killing your pets.I did a casual 2 year study on various points of interest,nutri. value,elimination,available and usefull additives. None were any better than Iams. The big difference was price.Even with the added cost of a chewable vit., Iams still came in 25-40% lower than the top rated brand.Oh, did I mention I have access to a full lab? And beet pulp is a good additive. Not only as a carb for energy and growth but it showed that in elimination,stoole, it acted like a magnet taking with it heavy metals like lead and other toxins found in soil,toys etc.,some as bad as mercury.Cassandra, after the pup is fully developed,2 years, I switch over to Iams adult or depending on market cost Nutro Max,another good product for the $$.Well I hope this was of some help and if any other ?'s arise,feel free to email me and in the interim,give your pet a hug and pat for me.PS..Euckanuba & Iams are made by same company.|`|rlG5nrjdaa	eww, dont feed him that, its full of additives and fillers which are not good at all. <br>  i would suggerst something like innova lg breed pup<br>  wellness, artemis 6 mix, <br>  heres what you should look for when chooseing a food<br>  <br>  <br>  When looking at the ingredients list of your dog or cat foods, carefully inspect the first six ingredients.  At least three of the first five ingredients should be animal protein.  The others should not be corn, soy, or wheat based.  The next five ingredients should contain more protein sources and only natural foods (preferably fresh and not dried), vegetables, fruits, whole grains and health essential oils.<br>   here are just some good dog foods to put him on <br>      *  Artemis<br>      * Natura<br>      * VeRus<br>      * Regal<br>      * Merrick<br>      * Whole Life<br>      * Zuke's<br>      * Dogswell<br>      * Redbarn<br>      * Evangers<br>  hopes this helps<br>  <br>  |`|UOkxvhY7aa	Go to dogfoodanalysis.com<br>  <br>  Look at the highest rated (6 stars, 5 stars) foods.

Wellness Large Breed Puppy, Innova Large Breed Puppy, Canidae, Solid Gold, Blue Buffalo, Merrick, Chicken Soup (the brand of dog food, not actual chicken soup) are all great choices.|`|7rCVptKBaa	It should be fine, but you may want to ask the vet.  He should have been in for shots, worming, etc. at 8 weeks old.  The vet needs to start him on a vaccination schedule.  And will tell you when to start heartworm pills.  
AA10182638	Yes, there is an estrogen injection that will alter a female dogs' cycle.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, this injection is normally between $1,500- $2,000 a piece, and it is not guaranteed to be effective.  Also, most veterinarians will not even administer or offer this shot, because it has been known to cause terrible reactions in dogs.  If you do not want your dog to go into heat, I would recommend getting her spayed.<br>  <br>  To the other posters:  Please do not answer a question if you are not educated in the subject.

You really need to see a vet.  Especially since it is her first pregnancy.  Puppies get stuck coming out sometimes, and even inside the dog.  Which can kill her and the unborn pup.  It is important to know what you are doing.  He can sonogram her, to see how many are due.  It shouldn't be long, since you feel them in there and her stomach is large.  Be careful when you touch her stomach.  You are going to need a whelping box (no blankets-pups get caught and suffocate).  Newspapers.  A whelping warming light.  It is a special light to warm the puppies, without burning them etc.  The vet needs to tell you how to stimulate a puppy that is having trouble, and how to clear it airways.  So call one, and get that mom in.  ;)|`|z37Aiucdaa	You should visit the vet with your dog as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  The vet will be able to tell you when to expect the puppies and give you advice on caring for the dog and her newborns.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AA10568801	get both of ur dog fixed!!! but its kinda to late to get the female fixed now since its pregnant. after u give away the puppies get her fixed. u know a lot of dogs are euthanized or become stray dogs cuz they cant find a home|`|VMLegJUSaa	<a href="http://www.howtodothings.com/pets-animals/how-to-care-for-your-pregnant-dog" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtodothings.com/pets-animal...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mytopdogs.com/pregnant-dog.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mytopdogs.com/pregnant-dog.sh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.2ndchance.info/pregnantdog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.2ndchance.info/pregnantdog.ht...</a>|`|feAcOKzMaa	Congrates...:)))))   take the pet to a vet....|`|k4i4UIlfaa	Just like human females, your dog has a pregnancy schedule, and a uterine calendar that can pinpoint which pregnancy stage she is in according to her body's symptoms.<br>  <br>  In a dog's first pregnancy stage, for example, when she is in the first two weeks of since copulation, the dog's nipples start to enlarge. When you notice this phenomenon your dog should see a veterinarian, to determine if there is a pregnancy and if so what pregnancy stage she is in. <br>  <br>  The veterinarian will be able to tell if puppies have been conceived just by feeling the dog's stomach. Just as with human pregnancy tests, the dog's pregnancy or lack of it can be verified through a blood test. Of course, the pregnancy stage for a canine is shorter than that of humans because dogs give birth only sixty three to sixty five days after conception. <br>  <br>  Each pregnancy stage for a dog, therefore, is only about 21 days long as compared with a woman's pregnancy trimester of three months. In the dogs sixth week of pregnancy her need for nutrition will increase as will her appetite. At this point she is truly eating for several little ones including herself, and should be fed more food accordingly. Her food consumption will increase approximately 50 percent over what she normally consumes. It is very important that her diet be balanced. For this you should take the advice of your veterinarian. <br>  <br>  A dog that is going to have a litter of many puppies will have a visibly enlarged tummy, although there are some dogs - especially those giving birth to just a few - whose abdomen won't enlarge noticeably. For these dogs, the pregnancy stage where they are showing is about one week long. Dogs who deliver a great number of puppies tend to deliver them prematurely. <br>  <br>  In general, your dog can deliver her own puppies without the intervention of a veterinarian. There are exceptions to this, of course, and it's important to be able to know what these exceptions are and when they are occurring. <br>  <br>  You should call the vet if your dog has been carrying the puppies for more than 65 days, or has been having contractions for more than two hours without delivering any puppies. If your dog has given birth to a puppy or puppies but not all, and now three hours have elapsed since the last birth, call the vet. This is especially crucial if you see your dog pushing and putting in a lot of effort. If your dog is very tired and her contractions are so slight that they don't bring on delivery you should call the vet. <br>  <br>  Once your dog has advanced to the stage of pregnancy where she has given birth you'll need to step in to give some care to the newborns. It's important that the babies have heat. A puppy crib is ideal, somewhere away from any circulating air. As puppies are still being delivered those that have been born can be pushed towards their mom for warmth and comfort.<br>  <br>  
ra1wD2xkaa	Ma si è normale, tranquilla.. i criceti sono dei gran lavoratori, sono sempre lì a pulirsi il pelo e ad arruffare, manipolare e scarmigliare tutto quello che hanno a portata di zampa per ricrearsi sempre nuovi nidi: segatura, scottex, stoffa, cotone, non c'è niente che li ferma... sono sempre lì che sistemano e ricreano, sono dei grandissimi artigiani :D  io penso che cerchi di farselo fuori proprio perchè a loro piace tantissimo crearsi un loro nido personale e lavorarselo pezzo per pezzo, quindi è proprio nel loro istinto quest'irrefrenabile voglia di fare a pezzetti e cotonare tutti i materiali che hanno nella gabbietta per farsi una cuccia più confortevole.. tu continua a mettergli a disposizione cotone, scottex e altri materiali così... magari mettiglielo la sera e aspetta la notte.. la mattina vedrai che bel batuffoletto caldo di nido che si sarà ricreato per farci la nanna!!! :)|`|hN0PCfPnaa	Credo che per prima cosa dovresti togliere la scottex dal fondo perché se la mangia non va bene. Quando un criceto dorme ha un' enorme abbassamento di pressione e di conseguenza tanto freddo, se nonostante la stoffa la casetta è troppo grande lui non riesce a scaldarsi come vorrebbe. Ti consiglio di mettere dell' altra stoffa all' interno della casa, anche se ti sembra soffocante o addirittura troppa perché lui possa passare, ti assicuro che comincerà a dormirci|`|Tr6RV4Hgaa	innanzitutto ti consiglio di nn usare nè lo scotex nè la segatura xkè se lo  mangiano e potrebbero morire usa invece la lettiera x i gatti ke xrò nn deve essere molto polverosa,e poi al posto della stoffa mettigli la lana sintetica ke trovi in un negozio di animali o l'ovatta ke cn questo freddo questi 2 prodotti sarebbero ideali x loro.Cmq è normale ke si faccia un altra casa xkè la casetta la scegli tu ma loro possono scegliersi un altro posto dove magari si sentono + sicuri e poi nn ti proccupare vedrai cambierà spesso la tana anke il mio lo fa ed è normale la notte fa un kasino dato ke è un animale notturno ecco xkè la mattina trovi tt sottosopra......spero di averti dato qualke consiglio utile...|`|lRZ1uqlOaa	awwwwwwwwwwwww che domanda divertente!!! è la piu divertente che ho letto fino ad ora... mi immagino il criceto piccolo e stupido che cerca di farsi un nido awwwwwwwwww mi viene voglia di prenderlo e dargli da mangiare un pezzo di formaggio dalle mie mani ooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|1655173779d17626f099b58934bf9118aa	I criceti,come tutti gli altri animali (umani compresi) amano farsi i fatti propri e decidere il proprio futuro.<br>  Lascialo fare e vedrai che, con il tempo, sposterà diverse volte il nido da una parte all'altra della gabbia.<br>  Anzi, sarebbe carino se tu predisponessi diversi angoli "riparati", in cui possa spostare la sua residenza secondo i vari momenti della giornata.|`|s5P4JHSbaa	E' normale! Io ho avuto molti criceti, ne ho anke 1 attualmente, e si sn sempre comportati in questo modo!  Mi sono kiesta anke io il motivo, ma se lo fanno è perchè a loro piace così, non c'e motivo di preoccuparsi...Comunque la lettiera x gatti, la lana e l'ovatta non vanno assolutamente bn x i criceti!! Riskiano di impigliarsi le zampe o cn l'ovatta soffocare... Lo scotex va benissimo se nn è nè profumato nè colorato...Ciao!|`|z5TJaSiMaa	Ai criceti piace farsi e rifarsi il nido mille volte come piace a loro... Il mio consiglio è di mettere del cotone al posto della stoffa... O magari con la stoffa... I criceti adorano metterlo nelle guance e poi sfilarlo pian piano e dargli la forma che preferiscono in modo da essere comodi...|`|OEfv2tH9aa	Il criceto si crea un altro nido perchè..a lui piace fare e rifare il nido..in base alle sue esigenze del momento....<br>  ti consiglio di aggiungere del cotone...vedrai come si diverte...ed anche dei fili di lana..giocherà come un matto vedrai..|`|qDDc7iflaa	Penso che nella casetta ad un certo momento abbia troppo caldo... allora crea qualcosa fuori di più fresco... Dovresti provare a mettergli un pò di cotone... Così vedrai che la trasportare dentro e fuori dalla casetta a suo piacimento ed in più lo tiene caldo...|`|ulL6DxYvaa	io lo so,  allora i criceti si creano il loro nido perche non si fidano del nido artificiale, si creano il nido da soli per essere piu sicuri, cosi se magari avranno dei figli, saranno sicuri del loro nido|`|WKwEaS8Aaa	ai criceti piace rifarsi il nido,cm piace a loro...si vede k nn era di suo gadimento!lascialo fare...|`|JZllqdeLaa	crede di essere un uccello e saper volare?
d8207601b2ce4a51ac30fe679ae340f2aa	i think the best pet is a puppy or dog. because dogs or puppies are very playful they are alwyas there to comfort you and you can always get excerise by walking them and spending time with them. I think dogs and puppies are the best pets because theyre always there for you and always comfort you and everything|`|AA10188961	A boxer!! They are the best family dog ever!|`|Uagg9UsFaa	Dogs can be the easiest to love, and they become a part of the family right away and they live for quite a while, but they can be really difficult to take care of and they need constant attention.<br>  Cats can be loved too, but they can be more moody and you can't always cuddle them.<br>  Rodents (hamsters, mice, gerbils, ferrets) can be nice and they stay in a cage and you can play with them when you want to, you have to clean their cages and stuff. They are also nocturnal, so they sleep when your awake and if you wake them up, they can be a little bit grumpy.<br>  Fish are really easy to take care of, but you can't cuddle them.<br>  Reptiles (snakes, lizards, etc.) can be nice too, they are pretty easy to take care of, but a lot of people are either afraid of them, or else grossed out by what they eat.<br>  Rabbits are my personal favorite because they are pretty easy to take care of ad they aren't too big, but big enough to cuddle.<br>  Birds are pretty easy to take care of too, but they aren't so cuddly, but you can talk to them. LOL<br>  That's all I can think of right now.|`|Y0KAku0vaa	A dog or a guinea pig|`|PACvY028aa	All pets are sooo adorable. I say that cats would be the best family pet. I say this because they love to cuddle up with you and they love it when you play with them.  Dogs are humongous and the hair is awful. Also dogs DROOL!!! Cats only let off a little bit of hair! They are alot easier to take care of than dogs. and its not as pricey as dogs. I love bunnies but their cages smell really bad. I had a bird but they have a short life span. CATS ARE AWESOME!!|`|rjtVWCPEaa	dogs! f cats|`|27jGBsOkaa	well it depends on what type of family you have........<br>  dogs are great for larger families with lots of time to spend with the animal; they must be able to either take it on vacation or afford a kennel<br>  cats are great for smaller families who don't have all of their time to be spending on an animal which is okay because cats are very independent and require little exercise<br>  rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, ferrets are great for either small or large families with either much time to spend with their pets or only a little because they are much smaller it is easier to take them on vacation and to the vets they don't require much attention so they are great for any family|`|1LScbGa1aa	i want an elephant. sorry thats not answering your question. haha<br>  but i think the best family pet is a cat. a ragdoll kitty. look them up on google. absolutely ADORABLE! i have a ragdoll cat and i love him! they are so laid back, super fluffy and the nicest cats in the whole world.<br>  i really recommend you get one(:|`|3oA010Npaa	a dog.. make sure its small though<br>  <br>  like a carren teriier or something like that. here are some pictures of some if u like my idea!! hehe<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cairnterriersecrets.com/cairn-terrier.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cairnterriersecrets.com/cairn-ter...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/media/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/Cairn-Terrier-fb-67461308.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/media/cm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.i-love-dogs.com/dog-breeds/images/Cairn-Terrier.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-love-dogs.com/dog-breeds/im...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cairnterrierblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cairn-terrier-dog-food-inagine.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cairnterrierblog.com/wp-conte...</a><br>  <br>  there u are. hoped this helps|`|s7VCRYofaa	I think dogs are a great loyal pet for a family.

A cockatiel is a small bird with grey feathers and a yellow head. They are really friendly birds, and they bond easily with their owners. They can also learn to sing songs and whistle. I have two cockatiels, and they are like my best friends. If you like birds, I suggest getting a cockatiel. The males are more livelier than the females, but all cockatiels are really sweet.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i saw people have golden retrieve dogs before. it seems to be pretty good a pet.|`|pIMXHktGaa	dogs. there cute and friendly.|`|2ZOOcAr5aa	Dogs!!!|`|1dfd90ec99e7ca43256c4d9f2f92f46caa	dogs- theyre loyal|`|NENNHNVPaa	First you need to look at your family situation.  <br>  <br>  Where do you live?  <br>  <br>  Would there be space for a dog? Dogs, while loyal need to be able to have more exercise than other pets.  Is there someone in the family who could walk it regularly?  If you live in a city, whomever walks the dog will need to be willing to clean up after it.  Some dogs aren't good with small children.<br>  <br>  Is your home life better suited toward cats?  They don't require walking and are not as loud as dogs may be.   (meaning they don't bark)  However, with a cat you have to have someone willing to clean the litter pan.  Cats tend to be a one person animal and will show preference for one family member.<br>  <br>  What about smaller animals?  Rodents can be fun to have around, but they may bite those they don't like.   Reptiles are an interesting pet, but they aren't exactly the pet you "love" to cuddle with.<br>  <br>  Fish are quiet and soothing.  However, I don't think of them as "pets".  I find them more of a relaxing tool, good to have for the color and the soothing effect they tend to have.<br>  <br>  Really, think about your family (how many members and their ages) and your home life.  The type of pet to get will come to you once you take all this into consideration.|`|K2QwEM4raa	I have lots of pets and they are all great for the right family, but I think that the best of all pets for most families is the DOG. They are loyal,smart,loving,cuddly and love you no matter what you look like.|`|BznAZIeJaa	depens what u like like if u like scary like a scorpions or a tarnatula a rose hair one are the best if u want a dog there alos fun but yeah depends wutn u like or ur family|`|OH3oIPgqaa	I would think a dog, especially if you live out in the country.

Not fixing your cat before you bring it home can lead to a lot of other household problems you may not want to deal with, and making sure your cat has basic shots could prevent extremely costly vet bills later.    If you have a Petsmart or a Humane Society near your home you should look into getting a cat from there. They will "give" you a kitten if they have any for a mandatory adoption fee. I'm not sure what the HS charges, but Petsmart is about $135. The animal will have all its shots AND be fixed already, saving you a trip to the vet, who will most likely charge you a lot more to do what has already been done by the associations that run through Petsmart and the HS.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Keep checking Craigslist.

Make sure you meet a dog before you adopt it.  <br>  <br>  There are quite a few Pomeranians in shelters.  Like many have stated above, I recommend you use petfinder.com.  Although it is a website, it is just a searchable database of shelter dogs that you can meet and adopt.  You can also check craigslist.org and see if anyone is getting rid of their dog.<br>  <br>  If you choose to buy one, do not buy from a pet store, as animals from pet stores usually have major health problems.  If you buy from a breeder, they should be able to show you the genetic tests they've had done on both the mother and father.

What YOU get in return is a life-long, wildly loving relationship with your pet.  And you want that don't you?  (Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Advice for new dog:Providing good dog nutrition means you need to feed your dog regularly with enough healthy food for his (or her) breed type.<br>  <br>  All dogs are different and have different nutritional needs. However, all dogs' diet should include a combination of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. If it does, then your dog's needs for growth and tissue repair will be met.<br>  <br>  Since dogs have different needs at various stages of their lives in terms of nutrition, just be prepared to feed your dog accordingly. Smart-shoppers get their All Natural, Premium Dog Food at Only Natural Pet Store<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5 steps:Puppy Feeding<br>  Ensure your puppy's dietary needs are met by introducing them to 'solid' food as they are being weaned. Any new foods should be brought in gradually so as not to upset the young stomach. Special puppy canned and dry food is available. Note: Puppies will need to be fed a few times a day until six months old, then twice a day until they are twelve months old. After that, you may only need to feed your dog once a day.Water, Water, Water!<br>  There's no comprmise here... make sure your dog always has fresh, clean drinking water each and every day.Quality Dog Food<br>  Dry dog food of a good quality (and/or properly prepared homemade dog food) is often considered the best food for dogs. [Note: Fresh meat alone will not provide adequate dog nutrition.] Leftover vegetables and meat scraps can be added to dry food for variation in texture.<br>  <br>  Crunch Is Good<br>  Make sure your dog gets hard dog biscuits (and in some cases, raw bones) included in his diet. Feeding your dog only soft food, will lead to plaque build-up on his teeth.A 'Plump' Dog is Not Necessarily Healthy<br>  Do not feed your dog excess amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Also avoid feeding your dog scraps directly from the dinner table. This can lead to overweight canines!<br>  <br>  <br>  you should buy:<br>  The New Drinkwell Platinum improves on the widely-popular Original Drinkwell Pet Fountain, and adds many new features. Like the original, the circulating water attracts pets, encouraging them to drink more water, which in turn reduces the risk of diseases like urinary tract infections and kidney disease. It has a falling stream, like the original, but this design reduces "braiding", which in turn keeps the stream from splashing outside of the bowl while still providing the benefits of aeration. The new spout is 8" from the floor, providing easier access for those pets that want to drink straight from the stream. The new pre-filter keeps debris like hair and food particles from entering the chamber where the pump pushes water back up into the tower. This reduces cleaning maintenance, and wear and tear on the pump. . . The Drinkwell Fountain is designed, approved, and recommended by veterinarians, particularly for pets prone to urinary tract disorders. This fountain will save trips to the vet by giving your pet this innovative constant access to running water."<br>  <br>  Your dog's health depends on an all-important nutrient: water.

But what about our canine friends? Is it enough to just feed them properly and give them 'occasional' walks?<br>  <br>  A dog needs plenty of exercise... and generally the bigger the dog, the more exercise he or she will need. If you are not prepared to exercise your dog on a daily basis then perhaps you should think about getting another kind of pet.<br>  <br>  Not only is regular exercise good for your dog's health, but it also gives him the opportunity to be with you! Afterall, dogs crave company and like to be with their 'pack' as much as possible.<br>     <br>  <br>  Studies (as well as experience) have shown that dogs who are getting adequate exercise are healthier and happier. They are also more social when they are in public places. When dogs are given regular exercise, they are more calm at home and are less restless when left alone.<br>  <br>  However, just like feeding, choosing the right amount of exercise for your dog should depend on several factors: age, size, and type of breed.<br>  Age: Puppies require daily exercise for proper muscle development. Their high energy levels need to be released in some form of constructive activity, and giving them their daily exercise is the best way to do it. Not being able to release their pen

ozwLZwXeaa	My roommate has an 8 year old called Gus.  He adopted Gus from a family who said Gus had a fight with a porcupine and lost one eye.  Gus has been a part of the family since.  As soon as Gus realized that he had a good home and relaxed a bit he started loving on everyone in sight. The cutest one is a toy stuffed Penguin that was the first toy bought for him and he will find and bring to anyone, so we will throw it and the chase is on. He will play this way as long as we throw it.  When his little  legs get tired he will  lay down with his chin on the toy.        The other is his way to let us know he wants out for his potty walk.  He goes up to the patio door and will lay with his nose against the glass.  Some one will say potty and Gus is up and dancing around.  In all my years of being around pets and having many of my own, Gus is the most adorable one yet.  One thing to is he loves to snuggle under the covers and sleep on his back with the tiny legs up in the air. Thanks for asking.|`|bttrB0Rfaa	She hates the vacuum  can't be in the same room with one & will bite you for bringing the monster out!|`|AA11226842	Never owned one but one is the bases for my favorite kid's song.

Then they get all excited.|`|0uEjq386aa	I adopted a standard Dachshund back in August, and I had been wanting one for a very long time. When I asked the owners if the little, longhaired blk/tan doxie had any issues, as I had heard they sometimes had, they said absoloutly none whatsoever. I didn't beleive them when I brought the sweety home, but sure enough, he is the best dog my family has ever had. Dachshunds are not vicious dogs, not at all. My dog was easily house trained, leash trained, and also trained not to chew on house hold items. He was trained everything a dog should know in just a few short months. He loves everyone he meets, and is completely comfortable with all of my house hold pets and animals outside. And we have everything. Birds, dogs, cats, snakes, goats, pigs, you name it! Now I must say that Dachshunds are not big fans of small children as they have little tolerance for their nagging, screaming and hair pulling. But also if brought home and raised with small children from puppydom, they are generally just fine. P.S. My dog is now only 9 months old.|`|yEUo24Znaa	When it is treat time, my hubby will say assume the position and my 3 will line up and sit pretty.

Hilarious little dogs!|`|QnCR3cYiaa	Well mine loves to eat grass and sticks. Hehe. I have to carefully watch him to make sure he doesn't cause then he'll get sick. This is because the bone structure of the dachshund makes it so since it's so low to the ground, it gets confused with certain things with food. Weird, I know, but the problem with dachshunds (also pugs, bulldogs, Korkies, and a few other low to the ground breeds) is they lack a certain brain chemical that tells them what isn't food. That's why they're pretty hard to dog food train. Hehe....well not all are but it's just the type of breed really....it comes naturally.    Hope this helps.

D1beU6MPaa	I have a ten-year-old Great Pyrenees that did the same thing. They did the blood-work and found that he has lymphoma. They told me to cook some white rice and boil some chicken. Mix the two together and nothing else for flavor, My son sat down with him on the floor and held the bowl for him. He did eat this. You may want to try this for him. But I guarantee you that if he has lost 30 pounds in a month, there is something wrong. Your vet needs to do more tests, he has missed something. I would very much like to know what you find out. If you are not satisfied with what your vet has told you, go to another one. Trust me, there is a reason for this. Dogs don't just quit eating because they don't like their food. My vet told me that my Pyrenees is the oldest one she has ever seen. I used to have five of them, and none of them lived this long.

px4wDwvgaa	Try taking 5-6 doggie treats with you and kinda egg him on if that makes any sense. Pull his/her leash alittle and let him/her know who's boss but don't yank on it. This will let the dog know you want him/her to go with you. Make sure you don't leave too much leash dangling...keep him right next to you at all times so then he understands the behavior you expect from him/her. ok good luck and oh yeah only reward him/her for doing the correct thing not for sitting when you want him/her to walk. and try calling his/her name from a few steps infront of him/her and if he/her comes to you give him/her treat ok GOOD LUCK!!|`|AA12128656	he's a baby. all this stuff is normal.  what's your actual question?|`|qbP5uAuJaa	You should try a choke chain leash.

If you weighed yourself on the scale and were 178, and then picked up the dog, and stepped on the same scale and it said 219, then 219-178 = 41 pounds.  Sorry, your sister is right.

The fact that it's two pounds heavy doesn't affect the subtraction.      Look at it this way:  With your dog the scale said 219 -- if it's two pounds heavy that means it's actually 217.    Without the dog, the scale said 178.  Subtract the 2 pounds and that's 176.      Subtract 176 from 217 and you get 41.

You're a good kid for wanting to do what's best for him.|`|AA12128656	hi, i'm glad that you care enough about him to try to find him a good home, but the internet is not a good place to give your dog away....    is there a local bulletin board that you can put a picture of him on?|`|3wJGXfkKaa	You poor thing you shouldn't have to give up your dog.  What does your mom think?  Why don't you see if a shelter near you can help you find a suitable home you can keep him and let him stay with you while they try to find somewhere if that's really what you want to do.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	return him to his breeder|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Sarah, people need to know where you are located.    I hate to tell you, though, that a 9yo terrier has only a few years to live.  Maybe some kind soul will take him in.    My hubby doesn't like dogs, either.  Everybody is miserable when dogs are in the house.  I had to give mine away, too.  So we have a cat.  Just one.  But she's pretty cuddly.  And my husband likes her.    TX Mom|`|6wSmZrrsaa	IF you put this paragraph on craigslist, I'm sure some one would adpot him. Do you think there is any way you can tell your dad that you don't like the way he treats the dog. Tell him you've had the dog for this many years and he is giving the dog stress. Tell him you love the dog and you don't want him to leave.     If you were to post this paragraph along with a cute picture of him and you together I'm sure some one on craigslist will take him. there though make sure you are not dealing with a snake owner
lhOd2hvXaa	What you're looking for is called a coupler or a brace coupler.  Most ag stores (Farm & Fleet or Big R or the like) should carry them as should Petsmart or Petco and the like.    If not, here are a few sources:  http://www.upco.com/cgi-bin/Upcol.storef...  http://www.jbpet.com/Black-Coupler,1142....    Good Luck!|`|AA12128656	yes- it looks like a Y with two snaps and a O ring to fasten the leash to. they're handy!|`|FewhKlx9aa	Yes they sell them at Petco and Petsmart..|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Yes, it's called a brace coupler.  They come in different lengths for different sized dogs.  Essentially it's a chain with two snaps on it to fasten on the two dogs' collars, and then a ring in the center for your leash to attach to.    I've only seen them a dog shows; don't know if they're available at pet shops.  But you could order one from one of the on-line supply places, like jbpets.com or ryanpets.com|`|18uFvmFDaa	my neighbor has something like this  http://www.2dogleash.com/  try petco or petsmart they have just about everything!|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Couplers...|`|S5Lz35myaa	Yes - they are called "couplers".  It is a small lenght of leather with a clasp on each end and a small ring in the center.  You hook each clasp to the dog's collars, then attach the leash to the center ring.    Good quality pet supplies stores should sell them, or J&J Dog Supplies sell them on line.|`|H66RHumIaa	I don't think so... Try going to Petco and asking them... or any pet store chain...|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Yes, something like this?    http://www.amazon.com/Sporn-Double-Dog-L...    http://www.doolittlespetproducts.com/do....
ur5wDhkMaa	Rehome the fish ASAP, the smell is their cr@p, as Elizabeth, the tank is not remotely close enough for one.    Short term get as much surface agitation as you can to aid gas exchange to get some oxygen in there.    These fish start calling home 1000litres plus|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is too small to keep pacu. Going without water changes in an overstocked tank will make the water reek.|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	hey, first of all, i'd give your tank a 25% water change no matter what anyone says, it smells because of the nitrates spiking, I have just been through this with my ten gallon, but you just need to ride it through...|`|MFZr5yhAaa	Do the water change.  Pacu's are HUGE freakin' fish. Take them to any petstore that'll take them off your hands.    "The Red Belly Pacu fish looks very similar and is sometimes sold to customers as the Red Belly Piranha. However, they only look like piranha as juveniles. The red belly pacu will grow rather quickly and may reach 12 - 24 inches (30 - 61 cm) if properly taken care of. Given their potential adult size you will need an enormous tank to keep one at home, at least 250 gallons (940 liters). You will also need an extremely efficient aquarium filter to filter the tank water."    Do research before you buy fish. Pacus do not fit in most home aquariums. Do you realize how big they get? They can be as large as a garbage can lid. Yea.
lhOd2hvXaa	You should call your veterinarian and follow their advice.  Since the dog reportedly lost consciousness for a short while, it's likely they will want to see her today (not tomorrow).    Good Luck, I hope she's OK!|`|bm6NX6nTaa	Take her to the vet TODAY! Just in case, since chihuahuas are so small they should be watched carefully.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Did she fall onto hardwood or carpet..She could of been stunned or still could of been asleep..See how she is and if she is acting normally she'll be okay,but you always must keep your eye on them and if your walking away take her down.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Umm...no, you should have been on the way to the vet with her as soon as you realized she was UNCONSCIOUS!!    wow...seriously folks...|`|qbP5uAuJaa	See if she can walk properly and is listening okay. If she has a limp, looks confused, and won't listen to the simplest commands, you should probably get her checked out today not tomorrow.|`|R5XtTuHfaa	Check her coordination by waving a milk bone in front of her face.  If she goes for it, she's probably OK
