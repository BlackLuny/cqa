bTTouJIPaa	planes aerodynamics go up, cars aerodynamics go down, pretty simple|`|LbEGDUX0aa	As far as I can tell, the biggest difference is that you don't want your racecar to leave the ground and you don't want your airplane to hit the ground. Other than that, they are very similar. Some cars can float, but most don't because they weren't designed to be boats.|`|lObEjUh1aa	some cars do have "wings" that operate on the same principal (the Bernoulli principle) as the wings of an airplane -- only the aerodynamic cross section is inverted, so it generates negative lift -- the wing presses the car into the ground rather than lifting it.<br>  <br>  you see this in 2 places on a formula 1 style race car; the front fenders and the rear spoiler are both designed to produce aerodynamic downforce (inverted lift) as air flows over them.<br>  <br>  as the speed of the airflow over the car increases, so does the downforce generated.  if the cross section of these components were flipped over (bottom-side up), they would indeed generate positive lift and pick the vehicle up off the ground (after which it would immediately crash, because unlike an aircraft, a race car has no mechanism to stabilize itself in flight).<br>  <br>  a plane assumes flight when the aerodynamic lift exceeds the weight of the plane.  a race car's aerodynamic downforce can also exceed its weight -- when this happens, it is technically feasible for the car to drive upside down.  there are formula race cars that can generate enough downforce (at 170+ mph) to completely offset the weight of the car; given the proper driving surface they could literally drive inverted.  of course, actually performing such a stunt would require you to reach the required speed upright, then drive onto an inverted road surface.  also, once inverted, the car would have to maintain speed in order to stick to the road; slowing would reduce the lift pinning the car to the inverted road, and might allow the car to fall.  lastly, the weight of the car would be pulling it away from the inverted surface, reducing the pressure between the tire contact patches and the road surface (and consequently reducing traction).  this traction loss might make it impossible to maintain speed and (as mentioned before) cause the car to lose lift and fall off the inverted road.|`|nCkPSOjEaa	wingspan and lift vs weight<br>  <br>  ( a car has no wingspan, and this doesnt lift much )

Sometimes the nuts the company sends with the muffler (aftermarket) aren't that great. That was the case with my Tecnigas aftermarket pipe, where the nuts on the silencer always vibrated loose, regardless of how much I tightened them. Picked up some nuts from a hardware store with washers and haven't had a problem since. <br>  <br>  As well, be careful not to over tighten the nuts, as it can damage the bolt, which may be pretty expensive to replace (if it is part of the pipe, silencer, etc.).

LOL your problably going to jail! |`|eGzTkTp5aa	Man. Guess what. I was in an almost similar experience once. I hope my experience would make you feel better. Often times, people make their biggest mistake after they make a small mistake or accident which everybody makes. Like you said it, in your case the only mistake you made was taking your dads car without his permission (which to me seems to be not an issue, since he's going to know anyway, unless you return from school before both mom and dad), but hitting the other car was no mistake, its only an accident, it could happen to anybody. Just yesterday, I got a $440 ticket for accidently crossing the line next to a disabled parking spot while parking my car, in my defense I couldn't see.<br>  <br>  I accidentally hit a very nice expensive car next to me once in a parking lot, and my immediate response was to leave the place as soon as possible, as there was no damage at all to my car. Nobody was around. I was worried how much I would have to pay more if I report the issue or leave a note on the owners car. I didn't want to pay more money again as the insurance premium goes high for every reported accident, which makes you less safer driver each time. I was so against doing the right thing. But, I realized as I was driving away, what if somebody did that to me next time, I will be mad and feel terrible. SO I decided to return back, leave a note on the car with my phone number and apologies and I reported the incident to my insurance company first. Guess what, it turns out that the insurance company would take care of expenses free of charge as long as the damage is less than $1000 dollars so I ended up paying nothing.( You may never know, your dad's insurance may do the same) Even more interesting was that, I later found out that very same day Police was investigating that car I hit by mistake as the real owners were selling drugs on college campuses and trafficking, but they had no evidence to support help build the case and this incident helped the police to track it down because I reported this accident as the criminals took it to a workshop my insurance company reported. The cops later captured them, when they came to pick their car up and found the drugs. Reporting the issue also eliminated me as a suspect when later the police came to my home as I did the right thing. Besides, the cops told me, had I left the scene as I have originally tried to, the cameras in the parking lot would have taken pictures of my car leaving anyway and they would have eventually tracked me down and given me a ticket, the cops appreciated and the insurance company appreciated my behavior and thanked me. Coming now to think of it, I feel terribly good for doing the right thing and have decided to be honest from now on. I hope this helps.|`|h3WtnrRTaa	Is there any damage to the neighbours car (even just a scratch or dent)?  If there is, you have to tell them you hit it. <br>  Do you have a job?

77e6c94fab8905f50f23a8a7e5cf5f40aa	What this means is the car suffered enough damage that the insurance company deemed it as a total loss. A 3rd party purchased the car from the insurance company and rebuilt it. however as the insurance company have listed the car as being totaled, they title must be listed as salvaged. Now the damage could mean that it was in an accident, or that it was flooded, or that it had caught on fire. the only way to find out if to have a car fax completed on it. most times and if it is done correctly, salvaged cars can be every bit as good of a car as a used clean title car. However the resale value of the car will never be as high as if it where not salvaged. |`|AA10720479	Salvage or rebuilt title just means that the vehicle has been in a substantial accident(according to insurance company), and has been rebuilt. Some states have restrictions on these cars so check with yours before you buy one.

Once the vehicle has been rebuilt or certified by the state it can than recieve a rebuilt title.  A salvage title usually means the vehicle can not be regsitered with plates or legally driven.  As well as a salvage title or rebuilt title means a dramatic price loss when considering vehicle value.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	it means that it,s not safe for the roads and all it,s good for is parts. if it,s not too bad then some times you can buy them, fix them up and get the title changed. just like buying a house that,s been condemned. once you fix it up so it,s liveable then the condemned sign can come down as soon as the house is inspected. just like a car.|`|p4kanZIraa	have yo ever heard of a salvage yard????? or junk yard so basically its a car used for parts or just a piece of junk really|`|UZig5xBAaa	Yes in all states the car is not allow (or not supposed to be allowed) to be driven on any street, road or highway until the car is repaired to it's original state (if it is repairable) then it has to be inspected and pass,the title will than say Re-built Salvage. The insurance companies are the people who put a title in salvage status with the DOT of the state that the car is registered in.

The Ninja 250 is an extremely popular bike because it revs high and is light, making it faster than the Ninja 500 on the track. As far as three years in the saddle goes, I was a beginner for a few decades. Actually, by the time I learned to ride well I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. Take a shortcut and get yourself enrolled at a track to discover the art. There are many good ones from which to choose -- Keith Code's is maybe the best known -- and they offer all manner of progams across the country during summer months. You can even lock yourself into a course now, and have something to look forward to come spring.<br>  <br>  As far as dragging a knee, that is too often a badge of honor among a certain crowd at the track that is young and undeterred by crashes. If you value your health and that of your machine, then don't sweat it. If it happens, great, but don't go looking for it until you learn how to choose your lines, entry speeds, and when to roll on as you exit. Some, including myself, have done it accidentally: I didn't think about it because I had high-speed motorcycle to attend to at the time, and afterward I was unhappy at the scuff mark on my knee.<br>  <br>  So, take your time and go at your own pace, always. You've got your whole life to enjoy this sport, so make sure it's a long one.|`|NO5HJHHHaa	I say don't upgrade for one reason, you've had your bike for three years and havn't felt the need to upgrade so why upgrade just because some idiot who bought his first bike thinks he wants to educate you on something.<br>  <br>  Personally I disagree with people who say to get a 250 for a first bike because I think many people will get comfortable and want something bigger soon and they will wind up losing money trading up.<br>  <br>  You've been happy with your bike for three years and it's served your needs who cares what anyone else thinks or says. If you want something bigger get something but don't get something bigger just to impress others.|`|fPXX7BSlaa	I don't know much about bikes, but I do know that a 250 is quite small. I wouldn't start with anything less than a 600 myself. I certainly wouldn't get a 600 and start telling people how to ride either. If you want to get a bigger bike....get one! Why not? Don't do it to impress others. And don't do it if you're not comfortable getting a larger bike.

AA10720479	Yes if it's windy enough. Had a twin commander 520 that lifted off the ground in a windstorm, quite a scary thing too see. Never thought that plane would ever do that. We made sure it was tied down after that.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	As a general rule, no.<br>  <br>  The plane must always be moving with respect to the air around it, because this is required so that the wings can generate the lift that supports the airplane in the air.<br>  <br>  In general, this also means that the plane must be moving in relation to the ground.  However, if the plane is flying at a speed that is exactly equal to the wind speed over the ground, and it is flying in exactly the opposite direction of the wind, it will remain stationary over the ground as it flies.  It is still moving with respect to the air around the plane, but in comparison with the ground it is motionless.<br>  <br>  This situation is rare because airplanes usually don't fly exactly into the wind and the wind speed is rarely high enough to match the speed of the airplane through the air.<br>  <br>  For example, a typical small plane might be flying north at 120 knots.  In order for it to stay motionless with respect to the ground, it would have to be flying in a wind that is blowing exactly south at 120 knots.  Winds of 120 knots are rare at the altitudes that small planes usually fly.<br>  <br>  The same is true for a large airliner.  A larger airliner flies through the air at perhaps 480 knots; in order to remain motionless over the ground, it would have to fly directly into a 480-knot wind, and winds of that speed are unknown even at the high altitudes that airliners fly.|`|2zQ6b14Vaa	Cpt yoman is right.  Although highly unlikely for a passenger plane it is possible.  Say you have a 120 knot headwind and the planes airspeed is 120 then the groundspeed (motion relative to earth) would be 0.  It would take a strong wind and the pilots would have to purposely slow the plane to it's lower limits to pull it off.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	strangely enough yes. if the head wind matches the speed of the plane then the plane will have the lift to stay in the air but unable to move forward. This has happened especially in the days of prop airliners that took on the jet stream.|`|7ZCDwvghaa	If the wind blowing against the plane is a direct headwind with the same speed as the planes forward speed than the ground speed would be 0, therefore would appear motionless. 
hvNuBjIEaa	In California there are no curbs when the speed exceeds 45 mph.  Usually there's a clear recovery zone for errant vehicles to correct themselves and get back to the highway.  A curb could be worse for these errant vehicles.|`|AA10720479	Most of the time curbs are for channeling water in towns, cities, ect.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Can you imagine the cost of 220 miles of  curbing x 4 curbs. Plus the need for emergency exits or else slowing to a crawl and climbing the curb.|`|0KmJwYunaa	Costs money.   The major highways run for vast distances crossing many different municipalities, try getting everyone along the way to cough up for curbs.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	You don't really need them. If you hit a curb going 65mph, its bye bye for you.|`|vnF9GipDaa	Safety, you hit a curb doing 65, you will go flying. |`|I0Pg5xKmaa	speed limits on highways are higher, that's why they have guard rails, normally if the highway dept thinks its neccessary.<br>  <br>  could you imagine hitting a curb at 55+ mph? that could be more dangerous than if you just ran off the road.... |`|mX6aJSSYaa	Because at that speed hitting a curb WILL blow out a tire, bend a rim, and cause an accident.
2tuy86Jtaa	Which one is worse:<br>  <br>  1. They laugh at you because they think you're scared to do a wheelie.<br>  <br>  2. They laugh at you for being a try hard and fell of your bike from trying to do a wheelie and you damaged your bike and hurt yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to them, they're kids and you're not, tell them to get a life, at least you have a bike and that makes you cooler than them and they know it.|`|AA10690406	Just tell them you don't want to tear your bike up...Or just act like you can't hear them with your helmet on... And if they still call you a pussy than dude they're not you're friend... But if you do any kind of stunt it should be like "not" just said, by your terms, when you decide and never because someone just told you to because that's when most people screw-up and crash...|`|8ViTflu6aa	No, it's not uncool.  If you don't feel comfortable doing a wheelie, then don't do one.  Your friends may give you a bad time for a while, but if they are truly friends you will not lose their respect.  If someone calls you a pussy, I recommend that you tell them "Hey a**hole, you are what you eat."|`|4zWmHGbFaa	Who cares about cool when it's your life at risk, not theirs.  You are wise not to give into peer pressure.  If this is the way you have to earn their respect, find some new friends.|`|RZmJ8SKVaa	You have legitimately used the term WTF!<br>  <br>  I have seen people goaded on, crashed, and put on YouTube!  You think it is embarrassing to not do a stunt, you should see how embarrassing it is when your "friends" video you, and put it on the Internet!<br>  <br>  Me, I can hold a wheelie on my bike through all the gears, but I already know I can, so I don't have to!  It doesn't hurt to learn more advanced riding skills, in a controlled environment.  I pulled a wheelie once to keep my front wheel out of a car-swallowing pothole, and the pothole took out my back tire, so maybe it saved me from a bad wreck, instead of a tow to the bike shop.<br>  <br>  No, you are not a pussy, and it is better to err on the precautious side on a bike.  I don't want you to be one of the fallen, so take it easy.|`|bBJxa8Nmaa	Don't be doing any stunts until you have plenty of experience. One of my nephews tried some jumps that he was not able to handle and now he has a mangled leg. He let his friends talk him into it.<br>  Always ride according to the flow of traffic and keep plenty of space around you. There is a time and place for everything.<br>  There are a couple stretches of road that I don't have any trouble opening up my HD and going more than 100 MPH. In town, it's a differant story.|`|AA10720479	My cousin did a wheely, and now he's in the ICU. I sure wouldn't want to be scraped off the middle of the road. I wish more people were like you. I grew out of the whole "look what I can do" mentallity when I was 9. I love riding, and I have no desire to do anything crazy.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	I've been riding for more than 40 years. Being dead, or leaving pieces of your body on the pavement are things that are uncool. <br>  <br>  Being cool is grinning at your idiotic friends and riding off into the sunset without doing the stupid things they suggest.|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	   I bet none of your friends that are trying to get you to do a wheelie have a motorcycle.  That should tell you something.  A wheelie will cause your repair expenses to rise, even if you do not wreck.<br>    Play it safe, broken bones are no fun.  Most motorcycle wrecks involve being under the influence and/or excessive speed, just like automobile wrecks.  |`|gkrNPM5Daa	Tell them to get on their bike and do a wheelie. What if they tell you to stick a needle in your arm and get high or you're not cool. I play with death occasionally, but it's on my terms, my choice. Not about to come up dead just so some azzholes can have some entertainment.|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	Listen to me. You are not a dumbass if you use caution when you ride your motorcycle. You are showing maturity. Memorize these words just in case you want to do those wheelies and be real cool for your stupid friemds.

EVHr4VpCaa	Yes you can.  You can fly solo in gliders at 14 and in airplanes at 16.  However you may not take your practical test for your private pilot certificate in airplanes until your 17th birthday.  <br>  <br>  See Part 61 of the Federal Aviation Regulations for the specifics.|`|AA10720479	Yes, You can start.Good luck|`|VQiEWPYHaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  There is no minimum age for receiving flight instruction.|`|6b67548da9d1a58e2a0266faba9eac8aaa	Yup.  You can even get a sailplane (glider) license now.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	Yes, you can. My son is 14 and he is already starting. I started when I was 15
AA10613104	You need a tune up most likely.  New fuel filter, air filter, spark plugs, wires, cap and rotor.  Its a maintenece thing that should be done every few years, and should cost about 150-200 dollars at a shop, or for about 60 if you do it yourself.  Sounds like its starving for gas when you slow down, and stalling.  Start with the fuel filter and see if that does it, but for maintence, do the whole tune up.|`|AA10720479	I had a cadillac that did this also. The problem was the torq converter in the transmission.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	    I believe you've got a vacuum problem.  If it was your fuel filter you<br>    would also be having problems at higher speeds which you don't.<br>  <br>      Look over all of those connections and check the hoses for any<br>      cracks that may have split open from dry rot.<br>  <br>       Just my opinion here.
ZTMjXz1saa	There is no set age usually.  Some companies, in the USA, might not want to hire pilots younger than 21 or 23 though because they don't want to have to hold up your Captain upgrade just because of your age (you have to be 23 years old to have an ATP which is required to be an airline captain).  Of course, there are exceptions to everything.  I knew airline pilots who were hired right out of high school at 18 years old.  Granted, I wouldn't recommend it because that would mean they're skipping college (big mistake).<br>  <br>  I'd say the average age for new hires at a regional airline is somewhere in the mid 20s.  For a major airline, somewhere in the 30s.<br>  <br>  PS There's no such thing as a secured job in this business.|`|AA10720479	Most airlines require pilots to be 21.|`|USO2fLzBaa	Well you can start at 18 but most airlines want you to have at least 4 years of college and 1500 hr of flight time so do that first and the age you get that done is when you will most likely find a pilot job |`|fZjgIE9Baa	There really is no set age, as long as you have enough flight experience/hours. The more you have, the easier you will get a job. 
AA10720479	I have the 4cyl turbo, and it blows the doors off my friends  6 cyl. I upgraded the turbo to a big 16g, and put over sized stainless valves in, and what difference that made.

Bend, tease and maneuver the bikes at your pace. Then you will know for yourself. and do not make a judgement on someone else call, after all, it is you who has to spend time with it.<br>  As for looks, both are in a class of there own, and that too on the leading band. While R15 is a sporty razor sharp in your face design, Thunderbird has a more composed and mature look. Sit on them and you will know which is more sexier. In my terms, the bike which is more comfortable for you, will also make you look good on it.|`|u9DKVWR8aa	Royal Enfield has its own legacy and style and is designed for long run travel. 346 cc engine.Top speed-- 113.4    power 20.07 ps average ( 36 kmpl )<br>  whereas yamaha r15 is very stylish and a VERY LESS COMMON BIKE due to more price.

GKgmyEfnaa	The Toyota Hilux is a brilliant vehicle - tried hard to kill it, but it's very reliable, tough and well-made.  The engine (i have a turbo diesel) is excellent with plenty of bottom end pull.  Decent payload area as well.  I personally think most Fords are rubbish and would avoid the Ranger.  I know there will be a torrent of Ford fanboys who scream at me, but each of the three Fords I have had were junk.  The Toyota is a bit boring, but can't fault it otherwise.|`|WqJcnShxaa	I think a good old ford ranger would be the best choice, they are basic, cheap to buy, reliable and get the job done.

Il y a du vrai lÃ -dedans. Cela dit, pour rÃ©aliser un "jumbo jet", il n'y a pas de miracle : c'est forcÃ©ment volumineux. Le 747 est-il si Ã©lÃ©gant que ?a ? Imposant certes, mais dans l'absolu moins racÃ© que le 777 (par ailleurs trÃ¨s agrÃ©able en cabine d'un point de vue esthÃ©tique, avec une bonne impression d'espace et de luminositÃ©, mÃªme en classe touriste). Et le futur "Dreamliner" semble bien dessinÃ© lui aussi, mais ce sont lÃ  deux avions de la classe infÃ©rieure question taille. L'A380 va en imposer aussi, clairement. <br>  <br>  Pour en revenir Ã  l'esthÃ©tique, aucun avion n'Ã©clipsera le Concorde qui, en raisonnant froidement, n'Ã©tait finalement pas un bon avion : mÃ©caniquement vulnÃ©rable (le grand public l'a su seulement aprÃ¨s le drame de Gonesse...) et dÃ©sastreux Ã©conomiquement. En clair, les imp?ts du bon peuple ont financÃ© les dÃ©placements supersoniques de la jet set.

They actually make more if you finance, the bank will give them a small cut of the interest. <br>  <br>  Its common knowledge among decent salespeople that you do not know what you can get until you ask for it. The same is true for customers. You don't what they will sell it for until you make an offer. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that your tax, title, tags and fees will probably be another $400-800 depending on what that tax rate is and how much the dealerships processing fee is.

9lLGVU7Gaa	Get a lawyer to fight it out. It will cost you less in the long run anyways. I have never heard of a ticket being thrown out because of an incorrect time.

This process may take up to a year but it's a goof price to pay for not having a speeding ticket on your record.
JMJsCU1vaa	it USED to be entrapment...today it's business as usual, because there are so many excuses they can fall back on now that justifies them violating the very constitution they took an oath to uphold and defend, it's not funny... You used to have the right to come and go as you free pleased without being detained, provided you haven't given clear evidence that you committed a crime, or are conspiring to do so..... not anymore, now all they have to do is say they stopped you in the name of the war on drugs, or the war on terror, and they get a free pass to violate your rights, they also are getting into the habit of asking if there is anything in the vehicle they need to know about, this is a trick question and they analyze your answer and your mannerisms when answering... then they ask if they can search your vehicle, everyone usually says yes because they figure why not, they have nothing to hide, but they relinquish their rights when they do this, then the guilty people also allow them to search as they are in hopes that whatever they are carrying isn't found...<br>  The problem is they are violating everyoneâ€™s rights, figuring that if they do this to 100% of the stops, that there is a percentage that is going to yield a felony bust/confiscation.<br>  This is not how Police work is supposed to be, as if there isn't enough crime to deal with thatâ€™s IN YOUR FACE, they have to try to make a crime out of something...<br>  As for a cop asking me if there is anything in MY car that he needs to know about? Hell No, and when they ask me if there is a gun in the car I also answer NO, even though there is,...Legally... but the couple of times I told them I did have a gun, it created drama, and lengthy detainment, and I have a permit to carry, so I'm not saying yes anymore... <br>  My permit is my right to have it, and thatâ€™s all I need, screw you for asking me if I have one...it's none of your business...|`|IPuL2U14aa	It's not anymore. There are positive and negatives about this. I'm stuck in between. Yes it does cause a bit of a hazard when they do that but it's no different then an actual police cruiser. Think of all those crazy reckless teens that go way over the speed limit..until they see a cop, keeps them from thinking, "hey there aren't any reds and blues around, lets make driving dangerous for everyone on the road." Plus it is a good way to catch drug dealers. I do the same as you when someone gets on my bumper, give them a little brake check, in all reality they can pull you over because it could cause a huge accident if the driver isn't paying attention. More then likely they'll give you a warning, unless you are under 18, then they have to give you a ticket.

REiunI0Faa	Because the turbo is likely a very mild application, which means it won't be under intense pressure even under heavy acceleration. The turbo is simply not working hard enough to emit a loud enough noise for you to hear in your sound-deadened Volvo.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	It is low pressure turbo.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	the sound is still there but amongst the road and wind noise, not to mention the noise of the higher revving engine at higher speeds, the radio, other traffic, the sound is essentially drowned out by the rest. i think not being able to hear the turbo is a good thing. my own opinion.  i wish the turbos on my S4 were quieter.|`|V3b5UaXsaa	DJ has the closest answer. Volvo's aren't really looked at as sports cars so the engineers weren't trying to make them loud, they were more for the late 20- mid 30's something market. they were trying to make them quiet but still fun, if that makes sense. I know in my S40 I removed the airbox and there was a lot of foam glued to the top and bottom of it,(sound dampening) so I removed it and now I get a better sound.|`|AA11148059	Correct it is a low pressure turbo, a very mild application.

pFw7tJcNaa	Heya,<br>  <br>  First off good choice in vehicle. Secondly, it's literaly impossible to pinpoint a monthly payment on a vehicle simply because it's a "go-there-get-treated" roundabout. <br>  <br>  In other words, there are many factors that come into play. For example how much are you putting down will effect the overall finance amount. Also your credit standings, great credit can qualify you for infiniti's 0.0% APR that ends this month. Poor credit, no credit could make things a little rougher for you on APR without a strong co-signer. But then again, if you know one of the salesmen on the floor personally or you just rub someone the right way and give a good amount down on the car, they will be more than willing to negotiate a figure that you can work with monthly.<br>  <br>  I recently just bought an '09 G37 journey coupe sport with pretty much all packages and options. I gave the dealer a $480 monthly payment limit, and 'smoothened' the workload on him down with a $8k downpayment. Needless to say I got my $480 a month. You just have to go to wherever your buying the car from (carmax, dealer etc) and find out what it is they can do for you when you set the parameters.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Probably about $550 or so a month.  Get pre-approved for financing from your bank or something before hitting that dealer(stealership I mean).

Also there is a website you can go to and get a manual or to an Auto Zone or other parts store. I have an excellent library of every vehicle I have ever owned. Well worth the money and has easy to follow step by step instructions.|`|LYa3eGSxaa	to add to that chiltons manuel is the better choice of instruction there are also transmission lines to disconnect inbetween taking hoses off and unbolting the radiator dont bend those lines they are metal and hard to replace

While you may be lucky and not be asked, you should look at either using another discount option, or at least have a back up plan, if they ask for proof of employment and you say "darn, I forget my employee card!". <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you find a discount code that you actually qualify for to use instead, or as back up.   There are hundreds of membership programs and professional associations that offer car rental discount codes to their members.  You can find a list of car rental discount codes for 8 major car rental companies, at <a href="http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/discount-codes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/disc...</a>  (Remember... If asked, you would still have to show proof of membership for the membership program or professional association).<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps!
gnonlDpiaa	Since your already hauling 2 freezers, toss some dry ice in each of them and make your trip. It should only take 4 hours to make your trip, and the dry ice won't melt and make a huge mess. Far cheaper than an inverter or generator. 1 or 2 pounds in each freezer should do the trick.<br>  <br>  The freezers are insulated and if the meat is already frozen, should stay cool the whole trip with out any further help in average temps. (60-70F) I used to sell meat door to door and the freezer on the back of the truck would just get plugged in at night and go all day holding ice.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	If you are only going 200 miles just pack them with dry ice.|`|dcZcPtIoaa	very carefully, smartly  and expeditiously!<br>  <br>  I need 10 points!|`|AA11862004	Definatley use dry ice.

oJr0Suzwaa	In order to increase acceleration you would need to either increase the power of your motor or change the gear ratio in the transmission to allow for increased torque for faster acceleration in a lower gear.<br>  <br>  Your best bet for the cheapest bang for your buck is a bolt-on component like a super-charger or turbo-charger.  The super-charger would be purely bolt-on.  The turbo-charger would likely require additional modifications because of the increased heat that is caused by it.  Without the additional modifications, a turbo charger would likely burn out other parts of your engine.<br>  <br>  A tune-up changes the transmission fluid so that the shifting is as quick and responsive as it can be. Over time, the fluid get worn-out and is not capable of exerting the same force to change gears, and thus needs to be changed.  If left in too long, your automatic transmission would be unable to shift at all on worn-out transmission fluid.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	There are some transmission fluid helpers for older transmissions that do a good job.|`|00sn8G9paa	It sounds more like it is fuel starved.

I wouldn't mess around with a chip, just upgrade to a 350 fuel system or swap the EFI to a carb setup for $400 or so.  Most chips just make your engine run leaner for more top end power, but they sacrifice low end power and ruin your engine.|`|56l26dvCaa	T Bone I guess ya switched the ECM along with the mtr right and all the wiring too?

GpQZR0qZaa	You have a 4 cyl Sonata, I assume. I have had one or two of my customers complain of the shudder at 38-42 mph. There is a TSB for this. 08-AT-004 calls for reprogramming the ECU to try to fix this issue. What you are feeling is the transmission is going in to overdrive/lock-up at very low RPMs and it's causing the engine to be overloaded. Similar to when you have a manual transmission and you shift into a higher gear at a low speed. Take it to the dealer and let them reprogram the ECU. It may help. As far as the brakes go, it is not normal for them to squeak. Muddy conditions, however, do cause brakes to squeak.|`|EjTikPNcaa	If it only happens specifically at 40 mph and you feel it in the steering wheel, then it is most likely your tires.  Either out of balance, out of round or a bent rim.  If there is nothing visually obvious, take it back to the dealer and have them do a 'road force balance' on all four.  This is different than a regular balancing in that they spin the tire on the rim to find the best weight balance, instead of just adding wheel weights.<br>  <br>  Do your brakes squeak while braking or does the squeak go away when you brake?<br>  <br>  For noise while braking, most often it is time for pad replacement.  They should have checked the brakes as part of the inspection before selling you the car though.  30k is decent mileage for pads on a used car.  You never know how the previous owners drove it.<br>  <br>  For noise that stops when braking, you are hearing the pads scraping the rust off the rotors.  Especially in wet conditions, rust forms almost immediately on OE rotors.  It is common and generally not a portent of danger or brake failure.<br>  <br>  Hyundai recommends 4-wheel brake service every 15,000 miles as preventive maintenance.|`|G0i9793Xaa	Do you have any shifting problems? It's doesn't sound like a tranny problem. More like a wheel balance is needed or a tie end rod may have gone bad. Cars around 30k should have their suspension look it as a precaution<br>  It is possible for the brakes to accumulate dust causing them to squeak or they have become worn. If you do alot of city driving your brakes and certain parts of the suspension can get worn pretty quickly. Again, all cars need the "wear and tear" components to be inspected around 30k.  <br>  It dosen't sound as if anything major is going wrong. Just things that need to be looked anyway. Your car's manual will give you more info as to what needs to be checked out.|`|vnCqJHS7aa	It sounds as though you are safe, as to whether your transmission is faulty. It actually sounds as if it is the wheel alignment, wheel balance, or your tyre has a flat-spot (that happens, when a car has been left standing for a period of time; sometimes it will come out, sometimes not) in it. Regarding the vibrating noise - I had a similar problem with my car (Hyundai Elantra). Transpired that a nail had lodged in the tyre. Try running your hand around the tyres and see if you find anything.<br>  <br>  As regards your brakes - if your pads have not worn out, then it could be that the rotors/pads have grease on them. It is possible to buy  a cleaner, which should sort that out. If you go that way, read the destructions (instructions) carefully, as some can damage paintwork, etc.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|hQQoFG5kaa	i had vibrating problems with my hyundai it turned out to be i needed new tires the wights were gone. as for brakes since it is new it couldn't be your brake pads, i know that my brakes squeak every once and a while when there wet but it goes away. your car should be still covered on warranty you should as the mechanic.

AA10256422	Always look at the milage, it is a good place to start. Most well riden bikes will have 6000 miles a year puty on them. So if it is two years old and average milage bike will have around 12,000 miles. Less then that is a good thing. More than that is not bad, just means it has been used more. <br>  <br>  Always ask to see maintinace records. Has it had the oil changed? Sometimes simple maintinance can make all the difference in the condition of the bike. <br>  <br>  Also the age of the current owner can be a factor. Not to that all youger riders a tuff on sport bikes, but there is something to be said for an experienced rider selling a bike and a young rider selling there problem to you.<br>  <br>  Lastly, take a close look at the body work, has it been dropped? What condition are the tires in. All things that should be looked over before handing over your hard earned dollars.

Both are great cars and reliable. The GSR or Type-R teg will be faster than a stock del sol, but a sol with a gsr swap would be a little quicker than a gsr teg because of the weight difference.

pZvJpuJTaa	Insurance carriers are obligated to offer 'actual cash value' for your vehicle, unfortunately not to replace it.  They search for like, kind, quality vehicles that have sold, usually within a 50 mile radius of your residence. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel the offer is correct, you need to supply comparable ads.  Do some research of sold vehicles, like yours, that have sold recently for a higher price.  Then present it to the adjuster. <br>  <br>  If you cannot locate any, normal policies have an appraisal clause that you can request.|`|NtFWoBHsaa	Write, "replace it" across the check and send it back to them.<br>  <br>  PS  That trick worked for me-- but it was a classic car (280SE 3.5 Convertible) so maybe that made the difference.

OmcBziKVaa	A new throttle body would be most effective if you get a new plenum as well. That said, a new throttle body generally isn't needed on a stock or nearly stock motor. If you put new intake and exhaust components on, you will get a more significant effect.|`|3WL9AgwGaa	Throttle body is not going to effect the overall performance by much, but if you get a good one it will definitely improve your throttle response.|`|mo8YBvC4aa	throttle body barely gives you anymore horsepower...do some serious mods like full exhaust (headers back) and an s/c then you will def see a difference|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Barely noticeable.

What is important to you? Track performance (evo wins)? Fit and finish (STI wins)? Reliability (STI by a hair)? Luxury (STI again)? Style (hmmm you have to answer yourself I think)?<br>  <br>  Better is just a very subjective question in this case and you need to consider your own personal needs before it can be answered.  They are both great cars, I prefer the STI.<br>  <br>  One thing I'd like to note is that in car and drivers track tests of these cars the standard WRX is actually faster than the STI on the track. The EVO beat them both. I think it's clear that the STI is going "up market". It's becoming much nicer to be in and live with, but it's comfort comes at the expense of performance.|`|WDVa1R0xaa	Both are the best cars in their price range, with no competition. Both perform pretty much the same. Ive been in both, I wouldnt mind either one. Actually if I could, I would buy both. I like the interior of the STI more than the evo. The evo's interior is very plain, and when you are inside it looks like an ordinary plain car. I like the STi's cluster and the blue color scheme on the seats. I think in the end it comes down to which one you prefer more. I would pick the STi only because Im a subaru guy and i already have a WRX. Either way it's a win-win situation, you cant go wrong with either.<br>  <br>  They both respond very well to mods. The evo is cheaper to mod than the STi. Subaru parts are also a bit more expensive than mitsubishi.<br>  <br>  Subaru, though, may be more reliable than mitsubishi in the long run, but either way like i said, it is a win-win decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|TAVJ8PsDaa	STI is way better. Both cars are almost identical on the track and the STI wins more often than not. For the street the STI's ride better and the power band is not as harsh as the Evo's. Bottom line is the STI is better appointed more reliable and better looking. The only downside to the STI is working on the thing its a pain in the *** but well worth it. The performance parts for an EVO are a little cheaper too, but hey get a better car (STI) that will last longer than an EVO and why on earth would you want a car from a company who has teetered on being bankrupt more than a few times in the last ten years?|`|r45sJTQGaa	Owned a wrx sti, would def go 4 d evo!!!

SuZbBnycaa	In California you must bring the car in to the DMV or AAA Auto Club for a physical inspection. They are looking for the VIN#, emission and safety lables, odometer, old registration and model. <br>  You should have the title to turn in so CA can replace it with a CA title and CA registration. You should do this within 20 days of operating the car to avoid penalties.<br>  You will be given plates and CA registration that day. The CA title will come in the mail in about 6 weeks.<br>  The form REG 343 will ask you how much you paid for the car and did you pay tax in the other state. If it's a gift, then you still need to know what the KBB value is. <br>  You don't need an appointment at the AAA but you need to be a member.
m9LWRoMVaa	Yes...You can. In Victoria anyway.  Check your states LAMS list.<br>  <br>  I did the one day course...about $230 here and they supply the bike and the Permit. This IS your permit to practise! There is also a pre-learners course for about $70 which introduces you to the bike and braking, clutch control e.t.c. <br>  <br>  If you are new to riding then i would suggest a bike with less fairing or something cheaper...They are fairly expensive (a zx2 brand new will be cheaper on road!)  and will cost a lot to fix if damaged. Spend less on the first bike and get some decent gear :-)  (I have a spada that i have done about 10000kms on, just bought an rvf for the next 12mths on restrictions...)<br>  <br>  The spada has been a great bike to learn on as i had very little experience when i got my learners, now that i am more comfortable with the bike i feel i can move up a step. Faster bikes are great but  ppl either scare themselves out of riding or end up dead.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)
EjTikPNcaa	Disc brake system: your caliper could be seized.  Could also be a wheel bearing.  Pretty easy to tell.  Jack up the side that is locking up and take the tire off.  If you can see the caliper piston extended all the way out, the caliper is seized.  Not much you can do besides replacing the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  Drum brake system: your shoes could be melded or rusted to the drum.  Could also be a wheel bearing.  This is harder to tell because all the parts you need to see are inside the drum - it usually takes some adjustments inside the backing plate to get the pads in the right position.  You have to remove the tire and the drum to get to the shoes and hardware.<br>  <br>  If the bearing is seized, you will see and feel a wobble when rocking or spinning the tire while it's still on the axle.<br>  <br>  On either system, it could also be the emergency brake locking into place.  Try pulling up and releasing it a few times, see if something gives.  Otherwise, you're looking at a few different possibilities.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Some brake parts inside the brake drum had broken, and when you go in reverse, it jams up.|`|AA11282699	Brakes can lock up when they get worn down to bare metal.

SuZbBnycaa	I only know California rules: Two choices are available to you if you want to own and title a car in your name.<br>  <br>  NON OP or  NON USE<br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO KEEP A CAR WITH NO INSURANCE, you must tell the DMV, so they won't suspend your registration. Reinstating a suspended registration is a small but unnecessary cost and takes about 10 business days.<br>  <br>  Put the car in Non Op if you're not going to drive the car for a year or MORE. Fill out form REG 102 Certificate of Non Op. Your registration is canceled and every year they send you an invitation to put the car back on the road. Registration must be current before you can non op a car. When you put it back on the road, you'll only pay the current year fees dues (whereas non use pays every year. That's why it doesn't make sense to "Non Use" for more that a year)<br>  <br>  Put the car in NON USE if you're not going to drive the car for LESS than a year. Fill out form REG 5090 Affidavit of NON USE. Your registration is NOT canceled. You continue to pay registration, but you get NO tags. <br>  <br>  In each case, you are promising that you won't drive or park the car on public roads (even in front of your house) Proof of Insurance is not required for either choice. <br>  You can still sell a car that is in Non op or non use status. But the buyer will have to transport by flatbed.|`|S4soZUFCaa	Yes, you can own the car bunky|`|HAYlmwdtaa	you can have the car insured in someone else's name however you must remember that the insurance covers only the person insuring it.  unless the insurer uses full liability, at which time you will be covered.  if you opt not to get insurance and driving it you run the risk of having your car impounded and seeing some fines.  also you'll mess up your insurance record and driving record should you get into a jam without insurance.

XKYJk6Tcaa	There are two common firing orders used for the small block Ford engine series. Below are diagrams of both. You CAN run either firing order, depending on which camshaft is in your engine - the crankshaft will support either one... Often, aftermarket camshafts have been swapped in place, which can be set-up to either either sequence.<br>  <br>  Note that the cylinders are numbered differently than "Brand X" cars, and that the firing order goes counterclockwise on the distributor cap.<br>  <br>  The 15426378 firing order was used on "stock" 221/260/289/302 engines from 1962 thru the late 80's.

You don't need a V8 engine for driving in snow.  You definitely don't need the SRT8.  Find one with the 6 cylinder engine and 4wd and you will be fine in the snow.  <br>  <br>  I have a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee LTD with the 4.0L Straight 6 engine and its excellent in the snow, mud, rain, pretty much anything you throw at it.  <br>  <br>  The V8 engines are notorious for causing transmission problems due to the higher amount of torque they put out.  Chrysler didn't do their homework and build a transmission that would handle the engines.  So stick with an older model with the straight 6 engine, or a newer model with the V6 and you'll be fine.  Stay away from the V8's also because they are gas hogs.
dQUISy3Haa	The wheel and tire size you can fit on your car depends on the overall tire and wheel diameter that will fit into the opening. To get the size you want, are you willing to modify the suspension? Check with a good tire store, and they can give you options that fit your car and budget. The largest stock wheel and tire combo for the 300M was 18" wheels with 50 series tires front and 19" wheels with 50 series tire rear (300M special). Try tirerack.com|`|d1dd02060cdb51c9ddd303817ecbf6eaaa	Yes it's called plus sizing. You use a 22" tire with the same outside diameter as your stock tire. Your local tire store will show you what I mean.|`|AA11427813	The short answer to your question is "yes"  if the new 22"  wheel  bolt pattern is correct for your car.<br>  <br>    However, if you choose a wheel of greater diameter, you will need to give attention to your tire ratio.  The engine computer is fine tuned to a specific wheel/tire circumference during manufacture.  If you install a wheel/tire combination of greater circumference, the engine computer of the car will be out-of-tune effecting the performance of the engine.  The  problem is that original electronic computer of your car is not adjustable. <br>  <br>   Nevertheless, you could spend the money to purchase a high performance computer & fuel injection system which could be tuned to your choice of wheel circumference.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GyMY62tAaa	Your a retard

UKNmZsU5aa	Well I would actually have the dealer do stuff like that.<br>  Plus, I don't think that an alternator and starter would need replacing on a 06 or 08 Volvo. <br>  But the timing belt, water pump and that will have to be done at a dealer or mechanic.<br>  Fuel pump you can do yourself, thermostat, if you know where it is, you can try. <br>  Brakes, ehh.... if you know, you can do it yourself.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Volvos (particularly the newer ones) are very difficult to work on.

Many independent shops will not touch Volvos for that very reason.<br>  <br>  You may be able to replace alternator, thermostat, and brakes are fairly easy, but water pump, timing belt, starter and most everything else is a true pain.

pFw7tJcNaa	Heya,<br>  <br>  It sounds more like an electrical wiring problem. A tune-up will perhaps put the situation into perspective but won't necessary give you the fix you are looking for. The problem will still return after a period of time. It's not a common problem between the connections, however it has happened before.<br>  <br>  Something to consider before/after your tune-up as a much more longer effect would be maybe upgrading your infiniti?

The logic that they apply, is that a number of people will not bother.<br>  <br>  The manufacturer MAY also place conditions on the cash-back, that will make it impossible to redeem.|`|miNNL3aoaa	The cash back usually comes from the manufacturer, not the dealer.|`|AA12119772	They make interest off the FULL ammount if you have to finance the purchase.

Obviously if you have a wallet large enough to support a new M3 or M5 then thats a different matter.
7BHIyMFmaa	The G35 will win easily. The G35 has nearly a 100 HP advantage, torque output is pretty close. The G35 is geared shorter. The Camaro is a little lighter (believe it or not) but is has taller gearing. The G35 will beat it in the 1/4 mile by about full second. Provided both drivers are competent. But even if the G35 driver isn't the greatest, it should still win.|`|AA10339249	G35 easily. The older Camaro was still trying to pull itself out of the mpg wars of the 80s. Even though horsepower wars were warming up at the time, they weren't up to what they are now.  As someone already mentioned, the new Camaro V6 has at least 300 hp (I thought it was 305) and would be a closer contender. It might still be a close race, though.

vSAQqGa8aa	Sounds about right. I remember I took both at the age of 17, but I believe my mom wanted me to take the driving classes just because. But you do need that drivers ed course.

3W43J3rWaa	First. Idling: your car is equipped with idling valve, which you will find on the top of the engine and is T looking valve with two wire connection on it, it also have hose connected to the each side of the valve, check this valve. Problem could be also near the battery where is located overload protection rele (one with the fuse on it). Replace the rele<br>  Second: Tranny should not shift hard!!! It could be simple problem like bad motor or tranny mount or bad flex plate between tranny and drive shaft, but if it is non of those than you do have internal problem inside the valve body (on the bottom of the tranny inside the oil pan) in that case you would need expert to take valve body out and clean it, wurse case scenario is that your clutches inside the tranny are too damaged, which mean tranny rebuild or use one. Good luck|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	with automatic transmissions the problem could be fixed by the electronicson the transmission being needing a calibration. the belts could need tighting inside the transmission. the transmission has small internal ports that may be blocked not allowing the correct flow of transmission fluid. or the gears could be damaged so they do not mesh correctly not shifting properly. the transmissions internal clutches maybe going too.<br>  <br>  if the car does not up shift it will have to rev higher to go the same speed.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It's idle, not idol first of all but yes, a high idle will make it feel the like the transmission slams into gear.  Find out why the engine idle speed is fast.  <br>  <br>  Also check the hardy disc ( also called flex disc ).  It's the big rubber dampener that sits between the transmission and the driveshaft.  It can develop play over time and when it does, it will make the shifts feel more abrupt.|`|miNNL3aoaa	Even with a high idle you shouldn't get a knock or clunk on shifting. Check your tranny fluid level and top off if it's low.<br>  <br>  If it's not, you could try getting a fluid flush - it might give you a lot more miles, or it might kill your tranny dead within a few hundred miles (in some cases flushing a neglected transmission can do more harm than good).<br>  <br>  Your high idle is another problem - that car has fuel injection, so it's probably a bad sensor someplace, or a bad idle valve (if that car has one). That would be worth checking out if you have the time and money - or if you have time and no money try finding a Mercedes owner forum and reading old posts and maybe asking for guidance - the amount of knowledge on automotive forums is tremendous, and if you find a friendly group they can help you diagnose your own problems.
oPsYyNosaa	That could be the answer,also have someone check the crank shaft sensor.A mechanic can use a computer to scan your car to find what is wrong with it,also saving you money by buying the wrong parts.|`|7qfoi1Yeaa	do you run the car below a   quarter of a tank of gas often? even so your guys are probaley right about the fuel pump and they are expensive to have replaced i had to have to of them replaced in my vehicles within the last two years and both ran about 650,00 to replace   good luck|`|JCNEP903aa	call your local parts store for pricing.

If the claim is over $1,000 it will remain on your record for 3 years and it's a chargeable insurance claim. You might want to call your insurance company and ask them (they'll find out anyway). The good news is that the increase will not happen until your policy goes through renewal. Unfortunately accidents at a young age are the worst to get them!!

qGpD9ntNaa	split rims are rims with a split through one side they have a ring that goes around the outside of the rim and holds the tire to the rim. when the tire is aired up the pressure holds everything together. They are where used mainly farm equipment and trucks with large tires so they could be mounted and demounted easier.  The problem is that there is a lot of pressure on this ring so when you demount the tire you are supposed to have the wheel inside a cage so that the ring doesn't fly loose and break your neck.|`|gsjjiRGFaa	split rims were once common and used on trucks and tractors. their purpose was to easier facilitate the removal/replacement of larger tire/wheel packages. the tires were mounted/dismounted using long  pry bars, or "spoons".on the front side of the wheel was a bevel or notch. this was the catch for the large snap ring which was held fast by the air pressure in the tire. <br>  when the wheel assembly became damaged, or the ring was improperly installed, there were instances of it flying loose, severing the limbs or heads of the unfortunate. there is a steel cage, similar to the roll cage in a top fuel dragster, designed to contain most of this impact. <br>  this once-common type of wheel is no longer in use on a wide-spread basis, even though multi-piece wheels are still being produced. on occasion, you may spot splits on older trucks and tractors. to step into a shop now and see someone taking wheels apart to install tires is a rarity for sure. having been in the shop for over 15 yrs, i've only done this on lawn and garden-type wheels, if their design allowed.

But, be careful, because if you strike too hard you will cause damage, and not hard enough will not cause it to pop loose.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	try heating the knuckle with a propane torch if there is nothing that will be damaged by the heating like grease or rubber seals. it will cause it to expand while the tie rod doesn't. hopefully you can get to expand enough to dislodge it.|`|OF64jyPSaa	pickle fork or turn castle nut over with flat surface even with end of threads and hammer the heck out of it|`|crhJLuw5aa	It's SUPPOSED to be tight like that. The tool that mpeeples is talking about is called a "pickle fork". They make one for tie rod ends and they make a larger one for ball joints. It costs about $20; you can get it at any auto parts store. It works like a charm; you shouldn't have to use any heat on it at all.|`|miNNL3aoaa	It might just be corrosion. Try heating the nut with a torch, then try to turn it off with a breaker bar.<br>  <br>  You can get a good cheap breaker bar at harbor freight tools, or AutoZone has loaners.<br>  <br>  I also have a $49 Harbor Freight impact wrench. It's not as good as an air impact wrench, but it's a great tool for the cost.<br>  <br>  If you really have trouble, get a nut splinter to break the nut off.
5Af6j1qsaa	Are you talking about your navigation unit?  Maps take up space on mediums such as hard drives, cd-rom's, etc.  If the car is expected to hold the maps of cities and roads from all over the nation, it will require alot of space.  A regular cd-rom can't hold all of that data.  What the navigation system does is use double-sided DVD discs to store the maps.<br>  <br>  The unit in your trunk holds your navi's DVD.  This DVD holds all of your maps.  And no, you cannot swap in a DVD there...the navi unit is made to only read navi discs.<br>  <br>  If you want to watch DVD's on your navi's screen, you will need to buy an aftermarket dvd player and connect it to the navi monitor and the car's radio or auxiliary speakers.  You will also need some sort of unit to go between the dvd player and navi, like Dom's nav2tv.  (If the accord's navi system is similar to the Acura TSX's navi system, though, there might be a $15 hack which will allow you to avoid using the nav2tv.)
9LqGOdYhaa	lol i have a 2007 red v6 mustang... stock it has 210hp... i wana make mine faster too... so i just put a cold air intake which increased hp by approx 10hp... and i also just purchased a dual exhaust kit.. i just need to change my bumper to the GT bumper, then you get shorty headers to double the sound and performance of your car =] there.. you now have about 260 in your car.. lol or u can put a turbo or supercharger into it but you prolly dont wana spend like a few thousand bucks and i dont blame ya... i wouldnt either... i ran my car stock everything at the track and i did a 14.9 which is not bad for a stock v6...  i have yet to race it with the cold air intake and the dual exhaust with the headers... but thats my advice on making your v6 faster =] good luck and enjoy~|`|hPKstf3paa	A cold air intake helps.

AA11264416	well because if the top speed on a car was 85 then that means the engine RPMs would be red lining, that would cause the engine to wear a lot faster, not last as long and also kill your gas mileage on the interstate or highway, so you make the top speeds at least 100 mph now so the engine can be at lower RPMs and more or less cruise down the interstate or highway|`|hvNuBjIEaa	When manufacturers assemble cars, they really have no idea if the would-be driver is a speed maniac or not.|`|4s31OKf5aa	To make cars cruise economically they have to gear it so that they can sustain 70 on a motorway easily. After you have reached this speed the engine still has lots of resources to go faster. So really rather than it be a case of making the cars have the potential to top a tonne, it's a case of them not restricting the vehicles. On a low powered car at 100mph you are over reving the engine anyway so it's people that make them go faster than what they are designed for.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I've never seen a speed as high as 85 mph. The highest I heard about is in Texas and they're testing it in Utah at 80 mph.  Where is it 85?<br>  <br>  Cars need to go faster then the speed limit, so people won't have to have the gas pedal on the floor when going interstate speed. And  people also like to speed. And people like cars with high performance and fast speeds and acceleration. A car that is limited to the speed limit won't have that.|`|50CYDsayaa	Myself and others have discussed this soooo much.<br>  I agree you should simply be able to cap older cars and on newer cars make it impossible for them to do over say 85mph.<br>  <br>  As for the guy who said it would make the car be red lining it... come one you thuink that all the technology these days that they cant stop a car from doing that if it was restricted to 85mph!!!<br>  <br>  I hate and i mean go crazy when ever i see one but i went to birmingham the other day and all it was was speed cameras! and it diod make me use the pseed limit ( i do anyway but sometimes i go 4-5 mph over) i reckon if you just place them everywhere, then people would simply obey but reduct points... for example at the moment its 3poitns and ï¿¡60 fine, i reckon it should be changed to 1point ï¿¡15 fine and there should be new category for speeding and you can get an additional 15 points on top the normal 12 your allowed (maybe that can be reduced to 6 as majority of points are speeding anyways)<br>  This means  of course more people will get tickets as there everywhere but wont be too much of a impact!..or is this just crazy|`|FY7NjgGnaa	also for saftey purposes<br>  <a href="http://vaughanwylie.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/mercedes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://vaughanwylie.com/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>  thats what happens when you hit a light pole at 100+<br>  <a href="http://www.crainium.net/jdjArchives/Autobahn_crash_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.crainium.net/jdjArchives/Auto...</a><br>  hitting a tree at 120+|`|HDBDl37Zaa	If the government passed a law stating that all car manufacturers in the US cannot make cars that exeed 85 mph, this would inhibit the freedoms and rights of American citizens.|`|D8PDx4PZaa	How else would cops be able to charge for speeding tickets?

12zRozB7aa	Most states use a point system, either adding or subtracting and when you get to a certain point, they may be suspended or taking away totally. As for insurance, its going up up up!!|`|31Ttgqlbaa	If this was just a minor speeding ticket (no reckless driving charge), then your license might be ok. It depends on how many points you have on your license. If the accident was your fault and someone else's car was damages (but no injures), in my state it's 3 points on your license. If someone was injured, it's 4 points. For the speeding ticket, you could lose 3 or 4 points for that and reckless driving is 6 points. If you get 12 points in a year, that's when they might suspense your license. But it might be more stricter for teenagers. So, it's possible you might lose your license depending on the laws in your state. If you don't think you deserve the ticket, I would fight it if the roads were dry and traffic was light.

They may both be burned out.<br>  This happens more than most people think!<br>  Next, check for a blown out brake light fuse. If the fuse is blown, you should look (check) for a damaged brake light wire that may have caused the fuse to blow!

You probably should let a mechanic fix that.|`|miNNL3aoaa	Probably bad bulbs or a bad switch. If not, then you have a short in your wiring.<br>  <br>  Try a new bulb in one of the lights. If it works, great; replace them all. If not, you're only out $6, have a spare set of bulbs, and can go to the mechanic to have him test the circuit between the brake light switch (on the brake pedal) and the lights, and the switch itself.<br>  <br>  I'd suspect fuses would result in other stuff not working as well, but before you go to the mechanic, grab your owner's manual, or look at the fuse box door diagram, figure out which fuse is for the brake lights, and inspect it. If it's blown, replace it.<br>  <br>  If it IS a fuse, and after replacement it blows again, you have a short somewhere (which would be why fuses keep blowing) that needs to be traced and fixed.

crhJLuw5aa	The '99 Nissan engine is NOT an "interference engine", which means; when the timing belt breaks, the valves are not SUPPOSED to be able to hit the pistons, whereby damaging the valves (or pistons). If the car was running at high enough RPM's, it's possible that they could hit, but STILL quite unlikely.<br>  <br>  $3000 is a VERY high estimate for a valve job anyway. I could understand this price if one or more pistons were damaged. The most likely scenario is that all that needs to be done is replacing the belt; this should cost about $400-$600. If valves were bent (which as I said IS doubtful), then you WILL need a valve job, which should add another $600-$800 to the cost. The $3000 figure is in the case of the MOST unlikely scenario, one or more pistons damaged, in which case the engine needs to be rebuilt.

The parts for the job you will need are very expensive - you will probably need a new head (top of the engine), possibly a whole new long block (entire engine). <br>  <br>  Usually the tech school will charge for parts, but not labor. And the parts will be shop cost - with no markup. This will save you a ton on this job, and give the kids in class a great chance to learn. Just be ready to ride the bus for a while.<br>  <br>  And changing that belt would have cost you about $400, tops (maybe $250-300 if you found a cheap shop) - I know this is probably a bad time and you don't need any harsh words - but pay attention to your maintenance schedule in the future.

f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	No one has that information. Motor vehicle registration is a responsibility of the State, and States don't ask what your occupation is when you register a vehicle. The only way one can find this out is if you somehow got hold of a list of all the registered owners of vehicles in a State and you called up all the owners and asked them if they're a student. Either that or get hold of the registrars list of a particular school, call up all the students on the list and ask if they own a car. You would then have to repeat this for every school in the U.S. (read: impossible task).

As far as fuel mileage goes, it's a big block car, so don't expect 18MPG. As far as safety, the car is forty  years old, so you aren't driving a fiberglass break away car with 5 mile per hour bumpers and air bags.

wra8Q7O3aa	Yes you can, Road race Motorsports has a turbo kit for manual for 4,500. If you have the CVT version, you can call up Road race Motorsports to see what they can do to get you a CVT turbo kit version but should be the same price. But CVT transmission has its LIMITS. If your going to be building a... example, 350 whp monster. Then just wait until you get a different car. The CVT version is only good for daily driven and its NOT a race car. Overseas has already gotten 240-250 whp the most until the CVT transmission started going limp mode all the time.<br>  <br>  If you just want a few more ponies here and there than you can just get the Injen CAI and Works Mail-in ECU Re-flash which gives you 20 at the wheels guaranteed. For best exhaust the Injen SES header-back is probably the best one and gives you 10 whp(dyno). The follow up was the Magnaflow cat back which is much quieter.<br>  <br>  But like I said, if your going to turbo and have the CVT its NOT worth it if your going to building a HP/TQ monster. Its better to stick with bolt-ons for reliability, save more gas(besides using premium gas), and much cheaper and less time consuming.

If I were you, I would just find a Car Audio shop and get a quote from them for how much it would cost to get one installed. The thing with Auxiliary jacks is that it is a clean connection, whereas an FM transmitter goes through the radio, enduring static, interference, and decreased quality of sound.

dyIyJqauaa	Vicki G likes to make it sound like all US states have the same rules as her state.  Unfortunately They don't.   Sounds as if the new buyer has not yet registered the car in his name.    Some states (not all) require you to send them a form notifying them of the sale.  Since your state is apparently one that does not require this ( my state doesn't require it either)   You should have kept a copy of the  title showing the date and time of the sale, the mileage on the car along with the buyers name and address, showing you signed off on it.

iULDIyhdaa	That's Pretty sad that you only have one feedback, well anyway I think they were the most popular in 2000 and 2004 when everyone was Driving them big @ss Hummers, Cadillac Escalades,Lincoln navigators and other big suvs. And now there Prettymuch dead now, go to the freeways all you see is cars or smalls suvs, like the honda crv or the toyota rev-4. You would see some big suvs, but not like that used to in 2000 or 2006. hopes is helps, and hopes anyone answers? by|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	I have a 1999 GMC Yukon 4x4 .  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Factory speakers still sound like someone professionally installed them after 10 years.  Still running in tip top shape.  I think they are great suv's.  It gets good interstate mileage, but poor mileage in the city. At 4$ a gallon i filled it up at 85$. Now at 1.75$ i can fill it up for around 43$.  Not to bad.
dyIyJqauaa	You can but you shouldn't.  If something happens, your Mom will be a whole heap of trouble.  Don't even think of doing such a thing|`|8GDBr2U9aa	No. You have to be old enough (usually 21) and have a valid driver's license AND be on the rental contract as an additional driver in order to drive a rental car. A temporary permit is not a valid license.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	No. Rental cars have named drivers on the rental agreement. If your name is not on it, don't drive it.|`|bUDOZFDAaa	no
AA12119772	Buyer beware.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	You didn't say if it is a brand new car or a used one. New car I would call the dealership you bought the car at and be nice but demand a new air bag be installed asap. I don't think legally they can sell a car without a standard air bag. Check the invoice tag from the window to see if it says standard airbags or what.|`|iuwkvcq4aa	is it so post to have one?<br>  <br>  <br>  but yes that is fraud if it is removed , THATS YOUR LIFE IN DANGER<br>  <br>  <br>  used car dealers take them off and black market the airbags ,|`|hOnmrQKNaa	Put a balloon in front of you when driving!
G9IbZQnhaa	its very fine car in mahindra, it's very nice pick up. it's looks realy good no one like.|`|s1DDVCWiaa	it just mix of innevo and scorpio.then it look like innevo design.engine performance ok.back sheet space ok.boot space less|`|1q8KGffEaa	it is awesome
4pZ2Gwooaa	You need to submit all your documents in the RTO office for registering it to your name. It will hardly take two working days.|`|G9IbZQnhaa	u just transfer ur name.
AA10961538	it means the weight the vechicle can carry the heat it can take and how much air pressure it can take-----you have to measure the rim and get the tire size---- if you have a 14 inch rim it won't take a 16 inch tire
J6Tdrd8Xaa	Cheery little question...|`|wpgRMjgraa	There were a total of 247,780 casualties of all severities, 4 per cent lower than in 2006.  2,946 people were killed, 7 per cent lower than in 2006, 27,774 were seriously injured (down 3 per cent on 2006) and 217,060 were slightly injured (down 4 per cent on 2006). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/casualtiesgbar/roadcasualtiesgreatbritain20071" rel="nofollow">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/dat...</a>
pSpnjRsDaa	Of course you can fight it. Doesn't mean you will win though. It all depends on how the cop wrote the ticket, how old you are, your driving record, etc...   Good luck.|`|VWILDaYPaa	u know they can inforce if u go 1 mile over. u can argue but the most that i belive is gunna happen is they lower it|`|uaYDfH2Qaa	You can try, but probably won't win your case - you need to have a reason you were exceeding the speed limit (in court)  - believe it or not, in some states and some areas, anything over the limit is a fineable offense..your only hope is that the radar the officer used was faulty or something like that..better to pay the fine or go to traffic school if possible than to fight it|`|SWv7QWzKaa	Depends how long you were doing the 70. <br>  What were the road conditions at the time? Overall stopping distances for an emergency stop at 70 is the equivalent length of 24 cars. At 60 it is 18 car lengths. That's assuming you are on the ball and can spot the developing hazard in enough time to move your right foot from gas pedal to brake pedal. <br>  <br>  Keep your distance from the car in front and remember that on wet roads the stopping distance will be doubled and on icy roads could be up to ten times longer.|`|wdVWuR2Saa	speeding is speeding and regardless of what you hear there is no "speeding grace period". whether its one mph over or 20. There probably isn't much you can do. I'm sure the cop got you on radar and camera, and those things don't lie. The best way I can tell you to get out of it is not to do it in the first place.|`|GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you donâ€™t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|Udq1S1mQaa	5 miles over? really? geez that cop must have been in a bad mood.<br>  <br>  you should go to court and try to fight it. the court date and time should be on the citation. there is a chance that the officer who issued your citation will not be able to show up. if this happens, most times the judge will just dismiss the ticket if your argument is good. some cops schedule court dates (on your citation) on days they know they will be free so what you can do is call to reschedule the court date. if you do this, you may end up choosing a date the the officer is busy and therefore can not show up in court.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  ive never done this..and never got a citation (knocks on wood)<br>  on the other hand, my bf has had many hahaha
crhJLuw5aa	Neither of these methods will work on an engine that was seized due to bearing failure. The ONLY way to unlock this engine is to remove the oil pan & disconnect the piston rods one at a time until you unlock the one thats spun on the crankshaft. If that doesn't work, then one of the MAIN bearings has spun; you'll have to take the main bearing caps off one at a time until you can spin the engine. <br>  <br>  Either way, your engine is going to have to come out & be rebuilt.<br>  If it spun a rod bearing, no matter HOW minor the spin was, the crankshaft will ABSOLUTELY have to be reground AND the rod will have to be reconditioned. If it spun a main bearing, the crank needs to be reground AND the block needs to be align-bored. After you check the prices for the necessary work, check on the price of a rebuilt short block. You're going to find that it'll be cheaper to buy a rebuilt short block than to try & repair YOURS.|`|k55p1pKraa	I will have to agree with Joe on this one his answer is the best that your going to get for ant one.Let me just say this , if you wont the engine freed up then pull the spark plugs out so you will bre able to turn the engine easy, now take a socket that will fit the bolt on the front of the  crankshaft a long with a breaker bar wrench, find you a piece of pipe about 4 foot long for a cheater pipe, you don't need to use anuthing to free the piston because there not freezen  up,  it one of the rod bearings or a broken rob bearing , but uyou will be able to un freeze the engine with that 4 foot pipe.|`|OF64jyPSaa	pull engine replace with one from wrecker (one from accident/write off at least you know it was ru nning)
AA10286987	Its the "Shift Up" light found on the manual trans equiped economy based civic's ( HX or VX I don't remember ). It works with the specific ECU to determine when its the best time to up shift depending on engine load, rpms and vehicle speed to get the best gas mileage possible. Hope this helped.
LX0vjwXPaa	the 3000GT had a 220hp V6 in it.<br>  <br>  The Nissan 300zx had multiple years, but I believe it also had 220hp in it's N/A form.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Horsepower has to move the weight of the car Mitsubishi were very heavy cars. either way you'll find out older cars will be expensive to keep running.|`|DAM5yaMoaa	yea I had an N/A Z yea like it was stated before 222 HP and 300HP if your lucky on a TT (thats if you account for the age of the car.<br>  <br>  yes the Z is better I have 2 TT's  great cars|`|bSTK2Wd2aa	the 3000GT VR-4 had 320 hp<br>  <br>  The 300ZX Twin Turbo had 300<br>  <br>  Personally i would pick the Z as the better car
36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	I ran the info through Kelly Blue Book and it shows the retail price for my area to be around $27000. The accident might be why they have it priced so low. I would suggest taking it to a body shop and have them look it over. Personally even though it's a good, no great deal, I could not be satisfied knowing it had been wrecked. But you have to decide for yourself if that is something you can accept. But I would definitely go over it with a fine tooth comb before buying. Check the under carriage is it welded or spliced together. Look at the paint from all different angles, does the color look off in spots?
dyIyJqauaa	I think you are being told the truth by your insurance company.  They won't "total" your paint job even though you have been paying extra for it.  The extra you have paid is to repair you paint job, not "total" it.  Do as another poster here has suggested, buy the van back from the insurance company and do with it as you wish. Your  Insurance company doesn't want your van anyway because they have to then go through the trouble to sell it to a salvage yard or a restorer|`|56l26dvCaa	Mike for a 20 yr old vehicle I'd say you have gotten a decent offer. If ya wanna sweeten the deal for you ask / tell the insurance Co Ok but you keep the VW Vanagon|`|bUDOZFDAaa	an insurance company ripping you off, i can tbelieve it. here in the states they only have to pay up to the replcaement cost or the repair costs which ever is less|`|MprOeoI4aa	DEAMN'T MAN THIS IS A DIFFICULT CASE, I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO A SUPERVISOR IN YOUR INSURANCE AND TELL HIM EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID HERE , HE MIGHT HELP YOU, TELL HIM YOU HAVE A LAWYER AND UNLESS YOU RECEIVE A POSITIVE ANSWER IN THREE DAYS YOU WILL SUE THEM,
fWKO8vNQaa	The suzuki access.
XJSWRHdiaa	"Yearroundrider" (the first answer) has got all of it right. As a begginer i wouldnt start with a 250. I would recommend the crf230 over the ttr230.<br>  If you plan on doing some big jumps then a suppose a crf 150r would be alright, but its very high maintanence and wont be as good on trail rides. So yea the crf 230 is the one to go with. I have one and its great for trail riding and its never let me down.|`|JJsJaQjxaa	If you're just starting, then either of these bikes will be perfect for a while until you're ready to move up to a more serious off road machine. The linear power from both of these engines will not surprise you in awkward moments when riding in technical terrain (which is exactly what a new rider is going to need). These bikes will handle most of your criteria well enough, except for maybe the jumping part. If we're talking little jumps here, like say, 1-5 feet off the ground you should be okay, but big jumps, forget it. These bikes weigh as much as my KX and don't have nearly as beefy suspension as it does.|`|9p3Ep4bfaa	I started out in the dirt, and I had 5 or 6 bikes before I got up to a 250... so you'll probably be fine.  You might want to start out with a used bike, then trade up after a year or so depending on your level of talent and interest.
