20090306160754AA39b2g	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Rear end collision question?	Okay - so I rear ended a vehicle this afternoon - it was minor, at least for me. No injury, only scratches on my front bumpers. His rear's a little bit messed up but I wouldnt say major.      So we pulled over and exchange information - I of course did not take the blame and suggested judgment of a police officer. They got my information but hesitated to provide me any information about them... they became extremely hesitant when I asked to see their driver's license - and took off as I walked towards my car.      I reported it to the police.      How do you think the traffic would judge this case? I know that almost always the fault is on the car behind, but this is not always the case I drove within the speed limit and reasonably distantly from other cars... it could have been their fault stopping too fast: it was really congested and happened too quick - but their lack of cooperation obviously would not be a good thing to show.

20090306213302AAExqMT	Cars & Transportation;Safety	If a car bumps into a bicyclist at a stop sign (after the car has stopped), who's at fault?	Several days ago, my mom had an accident with a bicyclist.  After she approached a stop sign in a residential area, she stopped and waited for several pedestrians to cross the street, then she proceeded (about to make a right turn).  However, before she could make the turn, out of nowhere, a man on his bicycle (from her right side) came and collided with the front-right side of my mom's car.  After exchanging information, (name/phone #) my mom suggested to contact the police, but the man insisted that he was "fine" and was able to ride away on his bike.  Several days later, he contacted her saying that he's now injured.  First off, the man was on the opposite side of the street (going against traffic) and he failed to stop/slow down at the stop sign, so I'd like to know, who's at fault here?

20090227061253AA93mEv	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Faster car is a safer car?	More and more lately, I encountered situations where someone in a merging lane beside me just speeds up and cuts in front of me however narrow the gap is and just misses the front of my car by inches. I have to slam on the brakes to avoid a collision.   I am not rude and always give plenty of room for cars to merge into my lane but I am talking about selfish drivers from way behind who decides to come at very high speed when there is basically one car length between me and the end of the merge lane.   I think the only solution is to get a faster and more powerful car where I can shut that gap before these guys even come close. I am no street racer but I am coming to the conclusion that more power gives you more control and thus more safety. My friend has a Corvette and he merely touches the gas pedal and nobody can cut in front of him. Sound sad that the daily commute is turning into an arms race. Might seems to make right nowadays.   What’s your opinion?

20090307103813AAp4Ffr	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Jeep	1985 Grand Wagoner died, but now starts?	I stopped for food half way home at 8:30 PM. When I went to start the 1985 Grand wagoner she hesitated as usual, but never turned over. The battery needed a strong jump from the truck and the vehicle turned over. We did smell gas and I was told I flooded the carburetor and being desperate I drained the battery. Two days later, I noticed I was two points on the dial to empty on the fuel gauge. I had to drive a steep incline to get on the freeway and the vehicle started to lose power but maintained a low rpm till I was going down hill and died. I put in 3 gallons of gas and it didn't turn over. It was towed home and when I got back from work that night it turned right over with no hesitation. Are these two incidents related to an issue besides me?   Usually when I hit 60-65 mph on an incline she pops and slips under the front firewall.        Was it air in the fuel line?      Fuel Pump going out?      Carburetor clogged?      Faulty distributer?      Fuel Filter problem?

Very nice car....140,000kms on it. He said it was the 350 L98 and I believe that because on the back of the car it says 5.7 tune port injection, and the tach with yellow at 5000 and red at 5500 which I heard that means its a 350. Now, he started it up and it was pretty quiet! He didn't remember the exact set of flowmaster's it had on, but he said it had the word thunder in it. He also has ceramic headers installed. Other than that, stock.       Heres the video:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAWhnW2g7...

I am just afraid that if I take it to Honda to have the oil changed (forgot to mention they rotate tires for an additional $15 on top of the $30 for the oil change) they are going to try to hit me up for a bunch of random fees.        Also, my car just hit 10k miles.  What are some rules of thumb that I should follow (i.e. rotate tires, air filter, brakes, etc)?

20090307144122AArZVBM	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How much do you think we should get after getting rear ended?	My siblings and are were involved in a rear end accident where it was the other drivers fault. We reported to the other insurance about the pain and aches and the chiropractor estimated 2 months of treatment for us three. The insurance company tried to offer us $300 but I told them to just talk to the doctor because I have no idea what the bill is. How should I go about this? Are they obligated to cover the medical bills? Will pain and suffering play a role in this case? I have no idea for this is my first car accident.
