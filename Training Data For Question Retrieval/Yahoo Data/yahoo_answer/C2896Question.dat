Where did all the countries in on the "hoax" meet to hatch the plan?  How did they "fake" all the data? Provide a link that says, and proves that there is a WORLD WIDE "hoax", and I,ll shut up. I don't want links to baseless claims , or political rants against Al Gore. Show me how the ice sheets breaking off was caused by this conspiracy.  How did they "fake" satellite data and photos?   Where is the proof that there is a world wide "hoax" ,and how all the countries in the world are in on it?  Wouldn't that be the LARGEST secret agreement ever reached by all the world's countries?  How did it happen?

I have watched most of his doc's for many years and I attribute my love and concern for the environment and the natural world to him.  One of the first doc's I remember was :Life in the freezer", which I think was a four part series.  Just to hear the excitement in his voice you can tell he has genuine passion and zeal for what he does. I would love to invite him for dinner as I am sure he could tell some great stories.?  Does anyone else feel the same?
