E é por isso que somos a na??o mais apaixonada pela nossa bandeira. <br>  <br>  Há 57 anos os estádios brasileiros s?o freqüentados por torcidas organizadas. A Charanga do Flamengo, fundada por Jaime de Carvalho em 1942, foi a primeira torcida organizada do Brasil. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ra?a Rubro-Negra<br>  <br>  Nas paredes do Maracan?, em 1976, cartazes foram espalhados com as seguintes palavras: "Vem ai o MAIOR MOVIMENTO DE TORCIDAS DO BRASIL". <br>  <br>  Por Aproximadamente seis meses a divulga??o foi feita desta maneira, mas a história da maior fac??o rubro-negra, havia come?ado antes quando um desentendimento na Flamor - por causa de Ricardo que foi fundador - causou o desligamento de Cláudio César, Aguinho, e outros. Ainda juntaram-se, a eles, Edu e Jo?ozinho da Torcida Jovem. Eles, resolveram fundar uma torcida completamente diferente de tudo até ent?o visto nas arquibancadas. A idéia era de fazer uma torcida "entrar em campo" deixando a camisa 12 de lado (um simples reserva que participa como "quebra-galho" do time) para tornar-se o primeiro jogador do time! <br>  <br>  O nome da torcida foi muito discutido - mas de nada consenso - até que Cláudio, nosso 1o presidente, sugeriu o nome mágico, que é a raz?o de ser do C.R.Flamengo, que faz a camisa jogar, transforma derrotas eminentes em vitórias consagradoras, que para ser o número 1 da equipe é preciso possuir a característica mais importante de qualquer time rubro-*****, a RA?A RUBRO-NEGRA, fórmula que faz o Flamengo seguir a risca o primeiro verso do hino escrito por Paulo de Magalh?es(1920), "Flamengo tua glória é lutar!" <br>  <br>  A torcida tinha o nome escolhido, mas ainda n?o tinha o modelo da camisa definido. Ela nascia diferente, e a camisa n?o poderia ser a mesmice das outras fac??es rubro-negras, elas tinham os modelos copiados do manto sagrado, e era preciso inovar...<br>  <br>  A camisa teria o tom predominante em vermelho, com a manga, gola e escudo, ******. A m?o - punho cerrado - seria o símbolo de luta, resistência e vontade. Eles assim definiram porque o rubro é a cor do cora??o, vontade, Ra?a e estaria sendo vista por todos, o cora??o das arquibancadas, o primeiro jogador do Flamengo estaria em destaque, devidamente uniformizado, esperando apenas que este cora??o tivesse o tamanho do Maracan?. Tendo Ra?a como nome, n?o foi difícil resolver o problema do símbolo. A idéia inicial seria duas m?os arrebentando uma corrente (alus?o à liberdade, muito ligada ao movimento *****) mas alguns dos nossos fundadores acreditaram que seria uma discrimina??o com as outras ra?as, afinal nascemos Flamengo, símbolo do Brasil (fus?o de todas as ra?as) e n?o poderia haver preconceito...só com portugueses mas é outra história... <br>  <br>  Por todos estes motivos, o DOI - CODI resolveu interrogar nossos fundadores. Uma organiza??o que se chama "Ra?a", tem camisa vermelha, o símbolo é um punho cerrado e tem por lema o "Maior Movimento de Torcidas do Brasil", e canta "óh meu Meng?o...", que era uma adapta??o de um canto de guerra da UNE, realmente poderia causar desconfian?a... O punho cerrado saindo do mapa do Brasil, como símbolo da fac??o, surgiu anos mais tarde, por causa das grandes caravanas promovidas pela Ra?a. <br>  <br>  Em 24 de abril de 1977, contra os "portugueses", nascia a maior torcida organizada do C.R.Flamengo. O Marketing no esporte, hoje t?o em moda, já era usado pelo pessoal da Ra?a em 1977, como Cláudio nos conta: "Foi uma época que era moda fundar uma torcida. às vezes em um jogo só, ou no 1o jogo das fac??es, estas terem 500 integrantes, no 2o jogo 350, no 3o jogo 200 e até chegar a 50 integrantes como a FLA-12, que nasceu na mesma época que a Ra?a". Ele continua, "Com a Ra?a foi muito diferente. Muito antes da torcida ser fundada, seis meses antes, já colocávamos vários cartazes pelo Maracan?, íamos às rádios - inclusive o lema de O MAIOR MOVIMENTO DE TORCIDAS DO BRASIL surgiu na Rádio Nacinal - para divulgar a futura torcida". Cláudio concluiu: "No dia da estréia da Ra?a nós tinhamos confeccionado 300 camisas, mas apenas 50 foram postas à venda, no jogo seguinte outras 50 e assim as pessoas viam que a Ra?a estava crescendo". <br>  <br>  Quando a torcida nasceu, os integrantes assistiam aos jogos sentados - como todas as torcidas brasileiras - mas, para provar, realmente, que esta torcida queria inovar e "jogar" com o time, com o decorrer do ano de 1977, esta história foi mudando porque havia momentos dos jogos que a Ra?a levantava até o momento das garrafadas que obrigavam à sentarem novamente. Mas em um jogo - que ninguém sabe precisar qual - os associados resolveram assistir o jogo em pé, mesmo tomando garrafada na cabe?a, mudando a história das arquibancadas. Por muitos jogos foram encontradas resistências, mas com tempo ao ouvirem "é, é ,é, a nossa Ra?a só assiste o jogo em pé!", as pessoas levantavam-se automaticamente e empurravam o Meng?o para mais uma vitória. Fomos a primeira torcida organizada do Brasil a acompanhar os jogos em pé, porque quem joga, o faz de pé, sentado é reserva (o camisa 12 citado acima), come?ando ent?o a diferen?a... e a Ra?a nasceu para ser a número 1! <br>  <br>  A Ra?a nasceu junto ao melhor momento da história do Flamengo, como o campeonato carioca de 1978 decidido contra os "portugueses" com gol de Rondinelli aos 43m do 2o, com o Tricampeonato de 1979 - nesse ano foram feitos dois campeonatos cariocas e o Meng?o ganhou os dois -, com o memorável título Brasileiro de 1980, em que a Ra?a levou mais de cem ?nibus para o Mineir?o na final contra o Atlético-MG, e o título no Maracan?. <br>  <br>  Nós poderíamos contar as monumentais festas realizadas pela torcida, mas para comprovarmos nossa fidelidade, da vontade de querer jogar com o time, falaremos das grandes viagens. Avi?o, ?nibus, a pé, e outros mais exóticos meios de transportes já foram utilizados por nossos integrantes, tudo para estarmos presentes e fazermos a "Nossa Parte", porque somos o primeiro jogador, e o Flamengo, precisa de sua gente para levá-lo à vitórias históricas. Ao recordar as grandes caravanas, é preciso esclarecer dois pontos: <br>  <br>  O primeiro que a Ra?a viajava por conta própria e apenas em duas caravanas - a final do Campeonato Brasileiro em 1980 contra o Atlético-MG e o jogo da Libertadores em 1984 contra o Grêmio, no Pacaembú - o Flamengo pagou, e com o dinheiro arrecadado, a Ra?a construiu sua sala 351-B (hoje desativada pela Suderj) no Maracan?. <br>  <br>  O segundo é a lenda contada pelos corínthianos e imprensa, de que 70.000 mil alvi-****** estiveram no Maracan? na semi-final do Brasileiro de 1977.Como disse César: "Nem se toda a frota urbana de S?o Paulo à época, fosse usada". é evidente que muita gente veio mas a grande maioria era composta por cariocas, principalmente rubro-******, que resolveram dar uma for?a para o time paulista devido a rivalidade entre Fla x Flu. Por conta deste episódio, em 1978 no jogo Flamengo x Corínthians, a Ra?a fez uma faixa alvi-negra, colocada na divis?o das duas torcidas, com os seguintes dizeres: "a maior torcida de S?o Paulo saúda a maior torcida do Brasil". Uma goza??o típica rubro-negra como foi a Fla-Madrid, ou a história para se eleger "O Mais Querido do Brasil", em que os portugueses compraram quase toda a água Salutaris patrocinadora do evento, vendida exclusivamente a eles, e o Jornal do Brasil, também patrocinador, que sumiu das bancas em que os donos eram portugueses. No dia da vota??o os rubro-******, disfar?ados de portugueses, entraram na sede da água Salutaris e sumiram com os votos lusitanos - devidamente jogados no po?o do elevador - e colocaram os votos rubro-****** nos lugar. No dia seguinte, o Flamengo foi eleito o clube "Mais Querido do Brasil" sem que a col?nia entendesse nada até que a descoberta fosse feita e o choro fosse livre. <br>  <br>  A faixa da Ra?a Rubro-Negra já esteve presente em todas os países da América do Sul, Estados Unidos, Fran?a, Inglaterra, Espanha, Jap?o e, pasmém, até no Iraque! <br>  <br>  Todas as nossas odisséias foram comprovadas pela imprensa que já as divulgou fartamente. N?o somos uma torcida privilegiada financeiramente, mas temos energia, luta, criatividade, e Ra?a, porque aonde estiver o Flamengo, a sua Ra?a Rubro-Negra, estará incentivando-o, levando-o sempre à frente... como dissemos acima, a Terra está pequena, e agora, só esperamos a ida do Meng?o à Lua, porque certamente estaremos lá... afinal somos o jogador número 1 e n?o podemos desfalcar o time. <br>  <br>  Em 1981, Roberto "Branco" foi eleito presidente da Ra?a e liderou por quatro anos dando prosseguimento ao trabalho de fazer a torcida ainda mais forte e organizada. Em 1990, Evandro "Boc?o" assumiu a Ra?a e com ele à frente, a torcida passou a ter uma sede no centro da cidade. Em 1993, Paulo Apparício, foi eleito presidente da torcida dando continuidade ao trabalho dos outros presidentes. Hoje a Ra?a desenvolve o projeto "Nossa sede é nossa sede", esperando em breve termos um espa?o condizente com o tamanho da Ra?a, porque a nossa sede, que é própria, está pequena. <br>  <br>  Enfim, a História de uma Ra?a está relatada, com apenas verdades, sem demagogias ou lendas, porque a mentira é a ilus?o dos derrotados e a imprensa - quase todos os dias - mostra a realidade como ela é. E tudo que for encontrado nesta HOME PAGE, é a realidade, doa a quem doer! Mas, nós, integrantes do Maior Movimento de Torcidas do Brasil, n?o podemos nos acomodar, porque no Flamengo a glória é lutar, e ficar na Ra?a, é cantar e empurrar o Meng?o às vitórias consagradoras, e nos emocionarmos sempre com mais um gol do Flamengo. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Torcida Jovem do Flamengo <br>  <br>  Torcida Jovem do Flamengo foi fundada em 06/12/1967, por dissidentes da Charanga Rubro-Negra (a 1a torcida organizada do Brasil). Nos dois primeiros anos de existência, a torcida utilizou o nome Poder Jovem , inspirado no movimento ***** norte-americano Black Power. Sobre a nossa Torcida Jovem, nós somos a 1a Torcida Jovem do Brasil, sua história, e sua origem, dá para fazer um livro, tamanha a riqueza de acontecimentos e personagens que nestes trinta e dois anos nos elevaram ao patamar de torcida organizada mais respeitada do país, n?o é a toa que somos reconhecidos como a torcida organizada mais temida do Brasil. <br>  <br>  Sempre fomos uma torcida ousada, pioneira, ou seja, mais avan?ada que as demais. Tudo que é novidade parte de nós, uma torcida singular e unida, e que por isso desperta inveja em muita gente. N?o somos a maior, mas sem modéstia, a melhor. <br>  <br>  Entre nós a democracia impera, todos s?o ouvidos e participam das decis?es e destinos, torcida aonde n?o existem "chefes", "donos" e sim, lideran?a. Quanto mais difíceis os obstáculos e as batalhas, mais nos destacamos. Por isso, se você ainda n?o faz parte desse exército jovem, junte-se a nós e desperte o guerreiro que existe dentro de você! Venha para a Torcida Jovem do Flamengo a mais temida e respeitada torcida organizada do Brasil! Somos uma institui??o séria, com uma história rica em glórias e lutas em prol da raz?o de nossa existência, o Flamengo. Aliás, o nosso lema resume tudo: "Nada do Flamengo, tudo pelo Flamengo!"<br>  <br>  Fonte: Antigos sites da Ra?a Rubro-Negra e da Torcida Jovem do Flamengo <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  FLA Mangua?a<br>  <br>  Somos um grupo de amigos, apaixonados pelo Flamengo, que desde o ano de 1995, ano de comemora??o do 1o centenário do clube, passamos a frequentar os estádios conciliando o nosso amor pelo Flamengo com a inebriedade etílica. Talvez ver o Flamengo fazer um gol seja mais inebriante do que qualquer bebida alcoólica, mas um de nossos propósitos principais é "mangua?ar" e ir torcer pro Flamengo.<br>  <br>  Nossa linha de conduta repudia todo e qualquer tipo de violência, tanto dentro, quanto fora dos estádios e primamos pela irreverência e o bom-humor. Quando o Flamengo está em campo, somente apoiamos a equipe e somos veementemente contra as vaias, sejam elas direcionadas para um jogador específico ou para a equipe e jamais nos retiramos do estádio, como muitos torcedores costumam fazer quando a equipe está perdendo,<br>  antes do apito final do árbitro da partida.<br>  <br>  Desde o come?o de nossas atividades, pagamos nossos ingressos para assistir o Flamengo jogar e sempre custeamos nossas faixas, bandeiras e demais despesas. Essa postura visa manter a nossa integridade e independência. Além disso, desde o ano de 2003, a Fla Mangua?a tornou-se uma Associa??o Civil sem Fins Lucrativos, conforme a legisla??o em vigor e registrada em cartório, para que assim possamos gerenciar melhor nossas receitas e despesas e ampliarmos os nossos objetivos.<br>  <br>  Todos os torcedores do Flamengo que amam o nosso clube e costumam incentivar a equipe acima de tudo, est?o convidados a juntarem-se a nós. Venha fazer parte de nossa vida associativa e irreverência e seja mais um "Manguaceiro", a ajudar o nosso clube continuar sendo o maior do mundo. <br>  <br>  Para mais informa??es acesse o nosso site.

Para n?o dizer desesperadora. Afinal, apesar de serem dois dos times mais tradicionais do país, os rivais entram em campo sob forte amea?a de rebaixamento à Serie B do Campeonato Brasileiro, e disputam um verdadeiro clássico da sobrevivência no estádio tricolor. <br>  Considerando o Brasileir?o, a Ta?a Brasil, a Ta?a Roberto Gomes Pedrosa e a Copa do Brasil, os dois somam 15 conquistas nacionais, e têm no retrospecto uma disputa de título, em 1994, que acabou com a vitória alviverde. Os rivais também disputaram as quartas-de-final da Copa Libertadores em 1999 e as semifinais em 2000, também com superioridade verde, mas, neste dia 25 de outubro de 2006, estar?o duelando com objetivos bem mais modestos. <br>  <br>  Faltando apenas oito rodadas para o fim da competi??o, o Corinthians, mandante do jogo, está apenas na 15a coloca??o com 35 pontos, só dois a mais que a Ponte Preta (primeiro time da zona de rebaixamento). O Palmeiras, com 37 pontos, é o 14o, e também continua assombrado pelo fantasma da Série B. <br>  <br>  A situa??o dos rivais fica mais dramática levando em considera??o que a Ponte joga em casa contra o Botafogo. O Fluminense, que tem os mesmos 35 pontos do Corinthians, é outro que atua em casa, contra o Grêmio, aspirante ao título. <br>  <br>  As campanhas ruins já condenaram quatro técnicos (Ademar Braga e Geninho no Corinthians; Emerson Le?o e Tite no Palmeiras) e fizeram com que ambas as equipes adotassem uma greve de silêncio contra a imprensa na última semana. <br>  <br>  No Parque S?o Jorge, apenas o técnico Le?o fala. No Parque Antártica, depois de uma represália geral por supostos “maus tratos” da imprensa ao atacante Neto Baiano, os jogadores voltaram a conceder entrevistas, exce??o feita ao animal Edmundo, que mandou avisar que só fala novamente com a mídia em 2007. <br>  <br>  O clássico marcará o reencontro de Le?o com seus ex-comandados. Quando comandava o Palmeiras, nas primeiras rodadas do campeonato, o treinador criou polêmica ao dizer que o time era “nota cinco” e que n?o poderia exigir muito dos atletas. <br>  <br>  Já Magr?o, que depois de vestir a camisa verde afirmou que jamais atuaria pelo rival, n?o poderá ajudar o Corinthians. O jogador foi punido pelo STJD pela expuls?o contra o Santos e terá de cumprir suspens?o. Amoroso é duvida e Gustavo Nery passou por cirurgia no ombro e só volta em 2007. <br>  <br>  Pelos lados do Alviverde, a ordem é provar ao ex-comandante que a nota do elenco n?o é t?o modesta quanto ele imagina. “Ele falou isso, mas essa é a opini?o dele. Nesse jogo nós temos que ser nota dez, mas n?o pelo Le?o, mas por nós, pois precisamos da vitória para melhorar nossa situa??o”, avisou o zagueiro Nen. <br>  <br>  Questionado sobre qual nota daria para o atual time de Le?o, Nen contemporizou: “O Corinthians é um grande time e o Palmeiras tem que respeitar. N?o tememos, mas respeitamos”, frisou o atleta, que admitiu ter pela frente uma partida que poderá definir a sobrevivência dos clubes na elite nacional. “Quem perder terá que enfrentar uma press?o muito grande e um abalo psicológico que pode prejudicar”, alertou. <br>  <br>  A opini?o do experiente defensor foi compartilhada por um dos mais jovens jogadores do elenco alviverde: Wendel. Sem chances de trabalhar com Le?o, o atleta n?o fez parte do grupo rotulado de “nota cinco”, mas também entrará em campo com gás extra para mostrar todo o seu potencial. <br>  <br>  “Se for para ter uma nota tem que ser dez, pois nosso grupo tem jogadores de qualidade, que confiam um no outro”, analisou. “Cada jogador tem que mostrar o seu potencial e se esfor?ar ao máximo para sair de vez de perto da zona perigosa do campeonato”.. <br>  <br>  O técnico Marcelo Vilar, que terá pela primeira vez a chance de encontrar-se com Le?o, que o chamara de 'pato novo', contará com as voltas de Michael e Enílton. Sem Juninho Paulista, o treinador optou pela entrada do chileno Valdívia na arma??o das jogadas. <br>  <br>  Questionado sobre as rusgas com Le?o, Vilar se irritou: “Cada pessoa tem direito de falar o que quiser. N?o tive o prazer de conhecer o Le?o e nunca foi feita uma crítica a ele, e sim colocado um fato de momento”, respondeu, explicando as acusa??es sobre o mau estado físico do elenco palmeirense na época em que Le?o estava no clube. “N?o tenho nada contra o Le?o e estou focado apenas em fazer um bom jogo”, refor?ou. <br>  <br>  Sobre a importancia da partida, foi direto: 'Precisamos da vitória a qualquer custo e quero meus atletas cientes de que, por ser um clássico, ter?o um jogo difícil pela frente, mas sem essa história de vida ou morte”, frisou. “Precisamos lembrar do que fizemos contra Grêmio, Atlético-PR e S?o Paulo e ficar ligados o tempo todo para sair com uma vitória”.|`|3e2c063cdd6f54139d0088a1beae9ff0aa	o futebol paulista em geral estar em decadencia|`|141e69dffeb6cfe1591d7a6ef654b813aa	saberemos hoje á noite|`|9aad6cb1d71d99242f834163f1eaa0d3aa	Empate.|`|ace3a21b7b110929dc79ab14dfc4a285aa	Os dois,podem dar as m?os.<br>  <br>  L|`|cc5228b4c6e1b23ce2fdc66b35348487aa	Hoje tiraremos essa duvida, ok?

Atraídos por interesses, gostos e objetivos semelhantes, é comum vermos na nossa volta grupos específicos de pessoas, tanto para o bem comum como para se opor às minorias ou as supostas amea?as aos mesmos. é aí que entramos numa avalia??o sobre a existência das torcidas organizadas.<br>  <br>  Nascidas nas últimas duas, três décadas, as torcidas organizadas tentaram criar um conceito de comunidade aos torcedores dum mesmo clube. A idéia inicial era interessante, já que de maneira organizada, essa articula??o permite uma padroniza??o dos gritos de guerra das torcidas, das músicas, das bandeiras e das vestimentas dos torcedores. Esse colorido é sim benéfico ao futebol. Lembro sempre das bandeironas das grandes torcidas paulistas, dos len?os acenados pelos palmeirenses ou dos sem número de gritos de guerra dos corintianos. Isso realmente enriquece o futebol.<br>  <br>  O problema é que embora essas denomina??es cresceram, sua estrutura organizacional ficou amadora demais para organizar e fiscalizar seus membros. Isso ficou evidente quando membros de tais torcidas passaram a ter atitudes de vandalismo e violência contra as pessoas comuns ou contra as torcidas rivais. Inúmeras mortes foram contabilizadas desde ent?o.<br>  <br>  Os clubes n?o souberam tratar tais organizadas. Ao imaginar que tais torcidas realmente representavam a opini?o da maioria dos torcedores, come?aram a abrir espa?o para elas, dando voz ativa em decis?es, abrindo inúmeros descontos para aquisi??o de ingressos, acesso livre aos vestiários e aos centros de treinamento, entre outras regalias.<br>  <br>  A verdade é que as torcidas organizadas, mesmo sem cometer nenhum ato de violência ou crime, fazem mais mal que bem aos clubes. Muitos torcedores passam a vestir a camisa da torcida organizada ao invés da de seu clube do cora??o, fazendo o clube perder receita aí. Há uma hostiliza??o disfar?ada entre torcidas de um mesmo time, que faz surgir, vez por outra, brigas entre torcedores do mesmo time. O clube também perde ao conceder ingressos gratuitos a esse tipo de torcedores, uma vez que eles s?o justamente os que deveriam representar os maiores compradores de ingressos. Sem falar no fato de que torcidas organizadas geralmente afastam o torcedor comum do estádio.<br>  <br>  No futebol moderno, deve-se ter um controle forte sobre os torcedores vindos de tais torcidas, já que elas passaram a abrigar pessoas desocupadas, que n?o raro costumam infrigir a lei e a ordem, quando n?o cometem crimes maiores. N?o se pode esperar que a dire??o de tais torcidas fiscalize de maneira eficiente, uma vez que n?o consegue ter um controle de quantos membros efetivos tem. Quando falo efetivos, inclui-se aí aqueles que apenas têm a camisa da torcida, mas n?o é membro cadastrado ou aquele conhecido ou colega do camarada inscrito que se infiltra no meio da organizada.<br>  <br>  O problema das torcidas organizadas partem-se ent?o em duas frentes: a primeira, devido à impunidade, a segunda, devido à conivência dos clubes. Para tal, organiza??o é a solu??o. O monitoramento dos estádios com cameras n?o é suficiente. é necessário punir as viola??es de conduta sempre. Os clubes também têm que pensar seriamente em administrar suas próprias torcidas. Isso é uma medida que pode ajudar a alavancar as receitas dos clubes.<br>  <br>  O vínculo dos clubes com o torcedor comum ainda é muito amador para realmente se tornar um gerador de receita e esse é um dos caminhos a ser desenvolvido.<br>  <br>  Hoje, do jeito que está, as torcidas organizadas s?o um mal comum a todos os clubes grandes, e, infelizmente, a todos os cidad?os brasileiros.|`|2980d1a04ca2ceb5ac775b87cbf4715aaa	ISSO QUE ESTá Aí N?O é TORCIDA ! é UM GRUPO DE V?NDALOS DISFAR?ADOS EM TORCIDAS ORGANIZADAS !|`|c18f1e64ba7bd0b108f038ad5eb530e9aa	sim, causa muita violência e impede o torcedor comum de ir ao estadio... pois n?o s?o torcidas organizadas e sim gangs uniformizadas|`|f395a9cd1b628e04501bf5b027ffd07caa	N?o.... o nome já fala organizada seria para melhorar os comportamentos das pessoas dentro dos estádios torcerem com anima??o feitas por charanga estarem organizados e vestidos com as cores dos seu times mais infelizmente pela falta de educa??o de alguns torcedores que acham ter mais direitos que outros só porque est?o uniformizados tudo isso virou bagun?a, também culpo os responsáveis pelas torcidas por n?o punirem esses marginais colocando-os para fora e entregando os mesmo a policia, e também a justi?a brasileira que n?o pune com rigor esses vandalos que existem no nosso pais.|`|f807cf5c8a9d7495e8375da879b98a88aa	NAO !!!!!!!<br>  O QUE DEVE ACABAR SAO AS QUADRILHAS FORMADAS EM PARTIDOS POLITICOS!!!!!|`|fda46ecdbb699d524680feb10a653720aa	Eu acho que só algumas como a Gavi?es, a Camisa 12, a Independente......|`|18b3beacaa005283ff1138a1d56dc4f1aa	Gostaria que acabassem as torcidas organizadas sim.<br>  é uma pena, mas a violência nos estádios se deve grande parte a alguns membros de torcidas organizadas que, por incrível que possa parecer, têm mais amor a elas que ao próprio time.

Digo isso porque já fiz parte de uma organizada e os chefes n?o tem controle sobre os associados na hora de uma briga ou bandalheira já que dificilmente se sabe quem come?ou ou quem é responsável pela anarquia, e no mais, você n?o vai ficar mais rico ou mais pobre porque seu time ganhou ou perdeu!, a n?o ser que você seja um "cartola" de time de futebol.|`|f4885e32988aa656368cfd03e8982ae2aa	N?o, s?o alguns que acabam com o jogo de familia ? todos esses que acabam com o jogo deveriam sim ser banidos dos estádios.

a75fb1c90163db314f59109fa9ffac90aa	Per essere più precisi sembra che la Juventus sia stata la prima squadra ad aver optato per maglie non aderenti al corpo (che si usavano ormai moltissimi anni fa). I primi a chiamarli GOBBI furono i loro amati cugini Torinisti durante il primo derby che la Juve e il Toro giocarono nell'era delle nuove magliette che, appunto, si gonfiavano formando una gobba sul dorso non appena i giocatori correvano. Una curiosità, per chi non lo sapesse, è che le striscie bianconore sono arrivate in casa Juve a casa di uno stock sbagliato. Quelle maglie a striscie erano infatti destinate al newcastle e delle maglie rosa che avevano ordinato non se ne ebbe notizia. Fu così che cominciarono ad adottare il bianconero.|`|ef9cb7811d1db49d6048b82e08f48959aa	moggi gobbi cambia poco|`|9b4952ad4bb0f8294f666338e759fcd5aa	concordo con nessuno e la storia della maglietta|`|164a29b972a5cc8ab920a6bb21e4689faa	perchè sono tutti figli di andreotti|`|1fe322c70ee9ad199cf9abc592a65c09aa	lo dicono xk anzicchè guardare le loro squadre devono criticare le altre cm la mitica juve...ma tanto nn importa...l'amore x la propria squadra nn si perderà mai...x nessun motivo...SEMPRE FORZA JUVE!!!ORA PIù K MAI!!!!!!!!|`|4fcc80455ae07aabd43be67d44831572aa	vengono chiamati gobbi perchè la prima maglietta che indossavano quando veniva indossata stava gonfia, per difetto, sulla schiena e sembrava proprio una gobba.|`|5b8e7ef540055e0e2a3e8e83e3b41be3aa	50 anni fa i giocatori della juve indossavano maglie troppo grandi e  <br>  quando correvano, specie contro vento, si gonfiavano formando <br>  una specie di gobba dietro...siccome correvano tanto furono chiamati gobbi juventini...VIVA LA JUVE.|`|0659eddb852f2f9f052b37cdc7053e19aa	Taluni affermano esserne la causa una certa via dei Gobbi o un quartiere chiamato popolarmente Gobbi dove, in un campo di stenta e spelacchiata erba, si allenava la Juve negli anni Venti, prima che la famiglia Agnelli la rilevasse facendone un gioiello di famiglia. Altri vogliono che il piemontese goeba oltre che gobba stia ad indicare, nella parlata locale, la zebra. La maglia zebrata fu adottata dalla Juventus nel 1903: anteriormente a quella data era rosa e siccome lavaggio dopo lavaggio il rosa scoloriva,  i soci del club, studenti del liceo Massimo d'Azeglio di Torino, chiesero a un loro compagno inglese che abitualmente trascorreva in patria le vacanze estive, di ritornarne con una dotazione di maglie dai colori più resistenti. Egli scelse quelle del Notts County, squadra della sua città, a strisce verticali bianche e nere. Altra versione è quella legata al grande Torino pre Superga: siccome surclassava senza sosta la Juventus, piegandola a suon di gol nei confronti diretti, si cominciò a dire che a forza di inchinarsi davanti alla prevalenza granata i giocatori juventini avevano messo su la gobba.|`|3c41705418498269ba6540af53ce0887aa	Beh ma mi sembra ovvio no?<br>  A forza di guarda le altre squadre dall'alto verso il basso siamo diventati gobbi...<br>  FORZA GGGGIUVVVVEEEENTTTUUUSSSSS :-)|`|7e5951b4607a511a739d2fe378a6f1c9aa	C'è anche un'altra interpretazione data dagli anti-juventini:la gobba è venuta a furia di stare inchinati di fronte agli Agnelli|`|94aa264e563135cdca4c9df97bf36ec0aa	nn lo so, sn troppo giovane...cmq ttt ha 1 sua storia!|`|b651b3acd6b0c2cdca2aab77db07f4d1aa	Davvero non lo sai?

f1Hhl3Beaa	Yes I think we do, and I think it's great that a US-based team is interested in a sport that has been neglected over there, allowing lesser series to become the main aspiration for some talented drivers. The fact that F1 is diversifying by moving into new areas of the world should be a sign that you don't have to be a Euro-phile to be in Formula One. These guys seem to be doing this the old-school way, being racing fans themselves and finding the money to do so, rather like the great Frank Williams and this says to me that this isn't just a marketing exercise (although it will help significantly in America, as will getting Indy and Canada back!!) <br>  <br>  The only problem I have seen so far is Peter Windsor's praise for one Danica Patrick, who is so average in her own series, that her being in F1 could be a Yuji Ide, Deletraz or even Taki Inoue moment in total ineptitude for the world of F1. I suppose they have to test her first and that will show them what to do, but looking into I have seen that she barely even qualifies for a Superlicence! I know dispensation has been made in the past for the likes of Raikkonen and Button, but they have since become stars of the F1 world, and were dominating their own Junior series, but Patrick has won one race in IndyCar, in a depleted field, with a good strategy from her team... Not enough at all (I know I rant a lot about her but she really infuriates me the way she seems to think she's a good driver.)<br>  <br>  Good on the USF1 boys for actually pubically showing an interest in F1 and setting it up in the US, but don't go near Danica... go for Marco or Graham Rahal or anyone but her!!!|`|FPJSoxYwaa	I agree with everyone else, they will be crap at F1 but it will be good to see more cars on the grid.  I predict they will have to change their name after they are forced to accept the reality that there currently aren't any American drivers good enough to compete in F1 and have to replace their starting drivers with some european ones.|`|pLoCn8dWaa	If they're any good, why not? But if they're just going to be another Super Aguri, achieve precious little and just disappear mid-season, I don't see the point in it.<br>  <br>  But at least it will give Force India someone to compete against again :P|`|MK129BdDaa	yes i think its great. F1 needs another team as well as boosting its popularity in America.<br>  <br>  However, i am slightly worried about the name. we already have Force India, it will start looking like A1 if teams like this start entering.|`|AA11469249	I think F1 needs all the help it can get.|`|0eys8EDqaa	USF1 will b there in 2010...ITS OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED|`|0wTOMifKaa	I guess they would just be replacing Honda|`|KTxxd700aa	Looks like I'm a bit late :P<br>  An idiots opinion.<br>  Great location, a US team could be the catalyst to getting North American races back on the calender and revitalise US popularity of the sport. Peter Windsor ain't my favourite big wig (Dave Richards, stop playing with Aston Martin and get a job) but as others have said, a new team is a good team.<br>  Id love to see a Ford/ GM/ Chevy sponsor, I know an engine is pushing it too far but who knows? If they develop to a mid field team quickish, they may just get perky.<br>  Drivers, a Yank would be great, Marco Andretti would be good, family history and an eager young racer.<br>  An old head would be good, Barrichello to go over 300 races?<br>  An out of the dark test driver hmmm Will Power! Well known in America and underrated.|`|c37428f3fbea3315c20ba2ba639993b2aa	the more teams ( and cars ) the better...<br>  <br>  however, after having said that... im not sure if Mr. Windsor is the right man to lead an All American Team...first of all,  hes not even an american, hes british...<br>  <br>  im not sure if he and his partner understand what it is that they are trying to do...<br>  <br>  build an F1 race car from the ground up ? base  the team in america ? <br>  <br>  he also mentioned that all F1 technology came from the US ? is this guy for real ?<br>  <br>  the US has a rich motorsport heritage...but their pathway is very different from F1...|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	Good Luck to them. I just hope they can be more competitive then some of the also rans that are out there now.|`|CHdQqxM4aa	No to be honest i liked having only 20 cars in the field althought it will probs be 20 cars in 2010 as it will be replacing honda<br>  <br>  but its good to be going back to north america<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the article says the cars will be built in America<br>  good luck with building a car that can go round corners then coz they will need it|`|aTZF7ey7aa	yes of course we do, it will be better competition to the other teams as so many close down we need to replace them|`|3Db7KL0naa	.<br>  <br>  I am surprised that Peter Windsor - an Englishman - has bothered to pursue his "Team USA" idea....especially since I have it from a very unlikely source that there may very well be a "Team Christmas Islands" soon. <br>  <br>  It is well documented that recently Christmas Island established it's very own Post Office. <br>  <br>  Additionally, Christmas Island is not only renowned internationally for its unique stamps, but can also boast a unique red crab migration - it doesn't take a genius to understand that adding an F1 team to the list of things-to-see is a natural progression. <br>  <br>  How can Team USA hope to compete? Danica? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: A bit of left English as they would say, Snook  ;)x<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: 30,000 Bleedin' points!! Frock me Rosbif...are u gonna take over the world now? How humble I feel in my frocked up condition....I think I've got about .02% of that (justifiably).<br>  <br>  Good on ya mate *APPLAUSE* <br>  <br>  .|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	The more the merrier. There hasn't been enough opportunity to laugh at F1 since the Super Aguri boys went bankrupt, so getting in new guys who have set themselves up for a fall would be a brilliant opportunity. <br>  <br>  Messrs Windsor and Anderson need to look at what happened to Carl Haas when he tried to conquer F1...lots of talk, not much walk. They would be better off taking a more humble approach.<br>  <br>  As to the name, well what is this, A1GP??? Come up with something better, guys. While we're at it, they have to get over the need for an American driver...if they were good enough, they would be in F1 already - from a purely marketing point of view every team would love to have either a Japanese, an Indian or an American who was actually good enough to justify their place.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  And that's 30000 points! Glad I was able to do it with an answer for someone I "know".

4maLlESdaa	A lot of used kayaks come up on craigslist depending on where you live. Asking prices vary a lot, so try to do your homework. Look up manufacturer's prices and take 50-75% off of that for a used boat in working condition. Another site is paddling.net, though their classifieds aren't usually as extensive. Also look up local clubs and kayak shops. Many shops sell off their demo and rental fleet in the off season. You may be able to find deals there, plus you can actually try out the boats.    The term "touring kayak" is very broad covering both little recreational kayaks as well as 18-foot long sea kayaks, obviously the latter is more expensive. In addition, old-school whitewater kayaks can work ok on lakes and are cheap ($100-150) and abundant. They are a little more squirrelly (tippier and don't go straight) than recreational boats so they would take some getting used to. Ideally, you'll be able to try out several kayaks so you can figure out what you want before you buy.|`|wqgBi10Gaa	ebay is an ok source too.    I found google shopping to be better though.    Try freecycle as well if there's one in your area.

nBUDjyhgaa	What's your point?The cat wasn't hurt, obviously.I've personaly seen cats leap greater distances of their own accordwith no adverse affects.<br>  Looks to me like the cat simply landed on the sofa & sat down.And besides, who are we to judge someone on how they play with their own pets?Give it a rest,and mind your own business.I thought it was kinda cool.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	It looks like the cat survived.  Therefore, the perpetrators shall only receive ten lashes each with my barbed wire whip when I catch them.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I don't see what hunting has to do with it. Did you post this question in all the other sections too? Did you ask the Vegans and the gays and the food and drink section what they thought of it? To me, personally, It is sad, but I could really care less.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	That really just pisses me off, I want to punch all of them in the face multiple times. To get it taken off, just flag it for animal abuse, being as they set up obstacles knowing the possibility the animal could hit it.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	lol, what's wrong with it, the cat didn't seem scared or hurt right?<br>  if it was, it would've ran off right? the cat just stayed there calmly, maybe even liked it?|`|kQSSz2X2aa	What does this video have to do with hunting? These jerks abused a cat in their home. Hunting has absolutely nothing to do with this.|`|AA11694178	It is sick at best and may well violate animal cruelty laws.  I hope they get caught and have to pay the price for their little prank.|`|ppXNnOzoaa	What's cruel?  They dropped a cat onto a soft couch.  As far as the "obstacles" they moved the chairs out of the way because they were afraid the cat may hit them.  And when they talk about killing the cat, obviously they were kidding.  If they really wanted to kill the cat they would have whipped it at the hardwood floor or something. But they diddn't, they dropped it 5 feet onto a soft couch.  I love animals, and I don't condone cruelty, but come on, the cat was not harmed, maybe a little p'd off and maybe it wasn't the most appropriate thing to do, but certainly not "abuse".  I Also agree...what DOES this have to do with hunters or fisherman?|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I HATE CATS, AND AM AN AVID HUNTER AND FISHERMAN. THIS IS A VIDEO OF SPOILED ROTTEN JERKS WHO NEED TO BE PUSHED OFF THAT SAME BALCONY.<br>  <br>  THE VID MAKES ME A BIT ANGRY, BUT THE FACT THAT YOU POSTED IT IN THE HUNTING SECTION ONLY LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU THINK HUNTERS AND FISHERMAN ARE ANIMALS. <br>  <br>  I HUNT.

r5AMG8g7aa	It is not personal preference, it is not style, it is and always has been about training under the best, most knowledgeable instructor. Once you get that you will make progress. Until then you will have to many opinions. opinions about what works will get you hurt. Reality does not care what you believe, what works, works. It does not matter if we believe it or not. Just find the best instructor you can find and train. Stop with the opinions of what you think you are good at. that too can get you into trouble.|`|ut6ZBZ5Haa	You just study about Kalari payattu.

x7NtYD8Aaa	I agree with you 100%. Back in the day if Yzerman would of played with Gretzky or Orr he would have DOMINATED. He played in modern day hockey which is much, much harder than old time hockey. He was tough, a inspirational leader, and a great player. And most importantly he has class. For instance, last year when Detroit won the cup did you see Yzerman? No. He didn't want to take away the spotlight from any of those guys. What a guy. How can you not love him<br>  LONG LIVE STEVIE Y!|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	I wouldn't have figured this was such a difficult question.<br>  <br>  Yzerman isn't in contention, sorry folks but, come on, get real.<br>  <br>  Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux are so far and away above and beyond anyone else that has ever played the game that they are the only two acceptible answers.<br>  <br>  Bobby Orr tends to get a lot of sentimental votes, which is ok, he's #3 and it's not too terrible to see his name come up here a fair bit.<br>  <br>  Anyone else being included in this answer just displays a wealth of ignorance about the topic really. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Wayne was the geatest ever at using his team mates and making them better, Mario was the greatest individual talent in the history of the game. If it was 1 on 1 give me Mario, if it's a chess match, give me Gretzky.<br>  <br>  Gretzky has more assists than Yzerman had points, he owns pretty much every record in the NHL record book and the only reason Mario doesn't is because he missed most of his prime with crippling injuries. Even with those crippling injuries, he dominated the game the way only Gretzky and Orr ever did before him.|`|QSShHlRiaa	Bobby orr. Or Mr. hockey Gordie Howe:<br>  Pshh Ovechkin and Crosby may be good now<br>  with the butterfly style in high demand. but in old <br>  time hockey he would never be good enough.<br>  you cant even compare crosby to a player like <br>  bobby orr/ gordie howe. <br>  sidney crosby and ovenchkin are the most overrated players in hockey history.|`|pSiwm8rmaa	Steve Yzerman lead the Wings to their 3rd Stanley Cup? That would actually have him playing for the Wings in the 1942-43 season.

He had put up more points than anyone when he retired from the NHL.  He was tough as nails and would knock around the other team.  He was league MVP seven times (six Hart Trophy wins in the NHL, one Davidson Trophy win in the WHA).  He was a six-time champion (4 Stanley Cups, 2 Avco World Trophies in the WHA).  He was the first player awarded the Lester B. Patrick award and was the first to be given an NHL Lifetime Achievement Award (during which Wayne Gretzky called Gordie Howe the greatest to ever play).<br>  <br>  Paul N: The fact that you didn't even mention Gordie Howe in your analysis shows your ignorance.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Tie between Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Wayne Gretzky.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Trombass- I have Howe behind Gretzky, Orr and Lemieux  as well.

zU9KQYmHaa	Yes, if you were used to one-down, and three or four up.  The neutral position is between first and second, with first being a down stomp from neutral, and second being a toe upward from neutral.  3rd, 4th, and so on are upward from second, and you stomp down to shift back through them again.  Unless you are getting an older Italian bike with right foot shift, you should do fine.  The gears may feel a little different, maybe softer or more delicate.  Some dirt bikes require a lot more force to shift than a modern street bike.  BE careful, and have fun!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Ask in the motorcycle section, this is for bicycles.|`|q5fZFJGtaa	It is about he same to me on my moutain bike and my road bike.|`|Txg9giQfaa	Like TaterTodd said, the concept is the same.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like the difference between a car and truck.  You're going to shift the same way, but the gearing will be a little different - once you get the feel for the nuances of your bike you'll be fine.

111d0d381459e08da7b8b55a15530e36aa	the assitant ref did NOT make a mistake. THe offside was real. Frei would not have been offside if the other player had possesion of the ball. However, he didnt, he only deflected the ball and never retained it, therefore Frei WAS offsides and the main ref made a very unfair call just like most of the reffing in this tournament.|`|AA11447638	why are u so angry?|`|AA11266377	there wasn't offside but a flag was called and the ref should have stop the game cuz the korean players saw the flag and they stopped...i'm sick of those refs|`|AA10083508	THE REF IS A FREAKIN IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA10383650	The referee, Elizondo from ARG should've called the 2nd goal off.

But NO! then the Korean play thought that it was offside and stop running, but at that time, the referee say it was a goal! How ridiculous it was!|`|f538c3c1b4291d4c9afabe71e12440bcaa	I watched a whole game and it wasn't fair for Korea at all. It was going good for Swizerland and everyone could see that.<br>  And there's a new rule about offside at FIFA homepage as I know. And it has the rule that it's offside in the situation like the one the Kor vs Sui had.<br>  Even if it wasn't an offside, Korean team stopped from defending them cause they thought the game would stop for an offside like the sub-referee  hold up the flag.<br>  So Sui scored a goal while the team was confused and stopped defending.<br>  It's not fair at all.<br>  Plus the referee didn't blew the whistle or give yellow card while they used 'handle' infringement.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kind of thoughts the foreigners have about this match, but Koreans are all angry and sad about it.<br>  <br>  Did you see Lee Chun-soo crying after losing?<br>  It was so sad.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  AND YOU KNOW WHAT?<br>  AT GERMANY STADIUM - WHICH HELD THE GAME,<br>  ONE OF THE SWISS CHEER GROUP<br>  THREW PLASTIC CUP TO KOREAN WOMAN ON PURPOSE,<br>  AND THE WOMAN'S CHEEK GOT A BIG SCRATCH AND A CUT.<br>  THE WOMAN'S FRIENDS AND WOMAN ALL CRIED AND THE WOMAN WENT TO HOSPITAL.

AA11102603	Practice dribbling the ball through your legs behind your back with our right hand.  It's a simple but very deceptive basic move. <br>  <br>  Once you perfect it, you will find that most defenders will anticipate that you are dribbling behind your back to get the ball in your left hand behind both legs, but your new move, between the legs is much quicker and more deadly once you perfect it. <br>  <br>  To practice it, just stand up and bounce the ball between your legs behind your back standing up to catch it on the dribble with your left, over and over until you feel comfortable fits walking and then running with your new move.  (If your left side is your strong side reverse this).  You will also want to work on your weak side with dribbling and shooting.  A player that can score and dribble with either hand is tough to stop.  Shooting is all muscle memory, hand and eye coordination and depth perception.  With shooting perfect your shooting in close first and gradually move away from the basket (Make three shots in a row before you practice moving back)<br>  <br>  Shooting tip: Learn to perfect your shooting off the backboard by using the square on the backboard.  Top side left from the right side and top side right for shooting from the left side (Try it and you'll be surprised how many times you can hit a basket once you find the proper spot on the backboard).  <br>  <br>  Remember, to perfect a trick at anything you must perfect the fundamentals.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA12302573	My all-time favourite trick is to take the ball with your right hand only, and swing it behind thier head (if they are playing 'proper' defense).  I also like to bounce it off the backboard about 10 times then tip it in.   other than that, a straight up game of basketball woops the pants off a game of street ball every time.|`|82c07d133cfb89c1b0fef128a7a4cd2daa	Two tricks/talents<br>  <br>  1. learn to dribble with both hands, it creates the ability to drive, and that is the most sought out ability currently<br>  <br>  2. go at about the wing of the 3 line.  act like your goin to go down to the corner of the 3, do a behind the back dribble and u have a wide open lane to the hoop|`|AA10450948	no

oAjbBLDpaa	Well in the ring and on TV yes it is mid-carders.<br>  <br>  But outside the ring, the main-eventers are spending so much of their time promoting their companies in so many ways. Mid-carders don't get that because they are not as well known.<br>  <br>  Not to mention people like John Cena who are usually doing promos are in action on house shows very often.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I agree. I think mid carders have to work harder because they are not in the main event picture and they have to try to prove themselves in each and every match. If they do not work hard and produce great matches every single time how will they impress the audience and make it into the main event title picture? Main eventers have already proven themselves to the audience. They can have a really crappy match and the fans wouldn't really care as long as there is a pretty decent rivalry and storyline going on.|`|ixOE0onnaa	it might be.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Obviously Mid Carders.<br>  There's Always a Good 20 Minute Wrestling Match Around Midway Through a Broadcast.<br>  The Main Event is Always a 5 Minute DQ or CO. <br>  IF there's Actually a Match for the Main Event - It Seems to be a Promo Nowadays.<br>  <br>  But Cena is The WORST Example You Could've Chosen for Representing the Main Eventers.<br>  Cena is THE Hardest Worker in Wrestling No Matter the Spot on the Card.<br>  He Simply Puts Everyone Else to Shame with His Work Ethic & His Schedule.<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* - Ok , You're Gonna Put that on ONE Match?<br>  One Squash Match?<br>  How Many 20 , 30 , Even a 60 Minute Matche(s) has Cena Had?<br>  Plenty.<br>  Cena is a Mic Guy , Not a Wrestling Guy.<br>  None of the Main Event Guys Work any Incredible Matches (Except for PPV's) Either , Not Just Cena.<br>  But When it Comes to "Working Hard" like You Asked for , You Simply Will Not Outwork Cena. <br>  It's Not Gonna Happen...<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* - Ok , Injuries - Right...<br>  A Completely Torn Pectoralis Muscle & a Herniated Disc in the Neck Aren't Serious Injuries?<br>  Granted , They're Not a Broken Back or Torn Quad/Hamstring , But No One , Not Even HBK or HHH Could Have Come Back From Either of Those withing 3 Months (Both Times) like Cena Did...|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Eric Bischoff thought that people watch WCW cause of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Sting, Lex Lugger, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall e.t.c.<br>  but when mid carders like Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Jushin Liger, Rey Mysterio left the company, WCW lost its backbone.<br>  <br>  Mid Carders are the real backbone of any organization.|`|xsDgVz2Laa	I agree with 2 live and die wwe for life.<br>  <br>  Mid carders work hard...And that John Cena is the worst pick to say he doesn't work hard.  He's not quite in the same ballpark as The Rock or Stone Cold, but in THIS era, he's probably one of the better Faces on the mic, works hard to promote the company wherever he goes.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the Mid carders need to work hard.  And the other reason why Mid'ers work so hard is because they are forced too.  They need to shine...need to look good, and need to work on their skills.  The main eventers are doing sooo many shows, and are crossing shows and occasionally end up on 2 shows durring the week or even sometimes 3 on rare occasion.<br>  This week Cena was on raw, and will be going to SD as well...<br>  This may be the reason why a less than 5 min match with Chavo...Also to sell the over the top Cena over Chavo.<br>  <br>  You do have to realize too that the promo is part of the show.  You can say the same about Randy Orton....he talked all thru the beginning about his mcmahon hatred and battle and fight, but in the end...HHH chased all three, belted rhodes and dibiase....but did he get his hands on Orton?  No...But Orton works hard too.  Just because they dont do a 20 minute battle...does not mean they don't work hard.  <br>  Look back at the shows that the rock and Austin did.  Sometimes they too were over in a matter of minutes.  DQ or whatever.  We just choose to not see it because they had ATTITUDE....or whatever.  It's part of the story line build up.  Mid carders don't have much story line.<br>  <br>  You have to look at it in that light as well.  Even Taker has had his share of 5 minute or less matches.  Squash matches....DQ's....etc.<br>  <br>  It's just the way it goes.  When they are ready to do it....IE: Cena to fight Edge (most likely...) when it comes to a point where it's a no DQ match and no interference and the both can come out and do a REAL match...it will probably be a 20 min match as well...going back and forth...both battling for their lives...  This is all story line man...<br>  <br>  They don't need a 20 minute match of beating each other down.  That doesn't create a story.  Thats why mid carders just come in fight and go home.|`|qwdh7N6saa	Kofi Kingston|`|DIBKP0i8aa	definetly Midcarders!|`|BftuXp1Iaa	Kingston rocks|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Mid Carders|`|InX5Pfl5aa	The indies work harder then anyone in TNA or WWE as they show true skill in the ring...|`|NZKramllaa	Mid-Carders, they hold the show together While, the Main-Eventers make it more Recognizable and Promote It, but Main-Eventers also work their @sses off too during Matches and Wrestles just as hard as the Mid-Carders.<br>  <br>  btw.. I mean no offense, John Cena really isn't the Best example, He almost Wrestles on the Daily Basis,last night wasn't just his Promo it was also Edge and Vickies. He is known for his Hard-Work. I think you mean Edge how often does he do 20 minute Promos and Never Wrestles.

Cena blows|`|dfe28e8f509a4286a039a9d684b69955aa	whether you like it or not. Right now Cena is the biggest draw on Raw. Doesn't make it right that he's still champ, but it's the only reason Vince has right now.  Lest we forget Edge's run as champ, which wasn't exactly the success that Vince hoped it would be. Orton's too much of a punk to hold the title. Kinda kills the whole "bringing credibility back to the belt" thing. Michaels, although a big draw in his own right, isn't capable of holding the belt full time right now due to his many injuries. HHH is still rehabbing so the obvious answer is to keep the belt on Cena just that little bit longer. There's no one else on Raw right now that could fill that spot. Not even Umaga....unless Vince brings Lashley onto Raw, can you see that happening any time soon? On a personal note I think Cena has done phenomonally well holding the belt thus far, he's never backed down from a challenge and right now? The matches he's been having with Michaels are totally Match of the Year candidates. <br>  <br>  What's the point in rioting, you think Vince is going to be bothered about your opinions? He's made it perfectly clear on more than one occasion that he doesn't think that highly of the Internet Wrestling Community, I believe the words "lazy bums" and the phrase "who wouldn't know one end of a wrestling ring if their life depended on it" spring instantly to mind.  You're instantly on a hiding to nothing if you're a member of the IWC. Sorry to say it but Cena's gonna be champ for a little longer yet.

General Manager Larry Harris revealed the new look at the Bucks Training Center in conjunction with the 2006 NBA Draft. The new look took effect immediately and will be in place for the 2006-07 season and beyond, appearing on all uniforms, warm-ups and other official apparel and gear. <br>  <br>  Other than the basic color scheme changing, it appears the basic uniform (jersey) design will remain the same.<br>  <br>  The new colors can be seen here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/NewLogo_060628.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/NewLogo_06...</a><br>  <br>  “We listened very closely to fan feedback and talked with our players. We also consulted internally with key management, the NBA’s creative staff, and the league licensees to arrive at this, our new identity,” Bucks General Manager Larry Harris said. “We’re thrilled with the outcome. Forest green has been a staple of our color scheme throughout team history, and we were able to couple that with two other recognizable colors from the past – a striking version of red and the silver from our previous logo.”|`|AA10948839	there already unveiled

CdlSbr0aaa	i doubt the 49ers would draft another qb in the first round after the whole alex smith thing. they need more help on the o-line and defense. they could get a good pass rusher at 10. there are some good prospects in the second to third round range. like rhett bomar and nate davis. they are pretty good and if they can get one of them in the later rounds it would be better. sanchez only has one full year of playing time. bomar and davis have been starters for a couple years now. i think they should go for defense or o-line thats a bigger need.|`|34SBpjXSaa	amiguito cuando me embies una pregunta no me la mandes en ingles ya que no se te cuidas|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that Sanchez might end up going 1st to the Lions.

He was also the second coach to start an African American in College, and the first to do so in the NFL.|`|olhhsIuKaa	I believe Walter Camp invented the basic rules of the game.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Paul Brown<br>  <br>  His son Mike owns the Bengals.
7cjn2u9uaa	Sorry, I am not sure what your question is
VkFDAQ46aa	Thats an excellent point. i think simply because there are too many cry babies worried about what their children might see. so instead of supervising what they watch, they simply call the wwe and complain. and the rest of us have to suffer for it.|`|EzazmdpZaa	I really don't know, but I think its coming to an end. Look at the past two Raws. They've had as much action as the Attitude Era.|`|AA12274351	Parental Guidance.<br>  <br>  Those 18-49 year olds watch with their children.|`|2569693fcb1ad34247c096f0e4bd3ffaaa	u r exactly right the PG thing sucks but they signed a contract keeping it PG for like the next few years|`|QlcGYKs4aa	its stupid i know, but its so it makes it more family friendly so the little kiddies can talk their parents into letting them watch it. this is a slap in the face to the attitude era. stone cold and the rock working so hard and now they pull some crap like this.|`|TH5tQ9asaa	I basically think that on tv, they show alot of children on there with their mums or dads and they want to keep this happening for money. Plus i also think it may be due to the superstars having children and would like to watch them.|`|PeZnLjkzaa	Because there are women and some little kids, like my lil cuz, 8 yrs old, who love to watch the boys wrestle. You guy are mostly in it for the divas.|`|KCS862Qaaa	lower rating= more viewers.|`|pp4RjAkOaa	i think its so that the main stream media would like wrestling again like it used to and maybe get more sponsors|`|xsDgVz2Laa	I think it is a combination of things....the demographic of VIEWERS is probably male 18-49?  but where do you back that number up from...and 18-49 is QUITE a big age range.  Anyway cut to the chase here...we may understand viewers are at the age range they are...<br>  But the other part of it is SALESSSS.....At shows or elsewhere.<br>  Action figures....shirts...Rey Mysterio Masks....John Cena head bands and dog tags and spinner (anythings....belts buckles...rings....whatever)...what's the demographic of the sales?<br>  Under 18.<br>  <br>  Shirts maybe both...kids and adults ...But the toys, the figures, playsets, masks, gear and such, all sales are MOSTLY from the kids.<br>  <br>  If kids can't watch (PG-13 rating...) their sales of products will go down, due to parents saying their kids shouldn't watch, therefore shouldn't buy those products either.<br>  <br>  Do we like it?  those above 13, probably not...and miss the attitude era...<br>  But those that are under 13 love it.  My son does...my wife wouldn't let him watch it when it was PG-13...Even tho i let him watch on occasion prior to PG.  He's 6 currently...and has a playset and a bunch of action figures....Rey mysterio suit/mask/gloves etc.<br>  <br>  soo....would I buy them for myself?  Not really...|`|qt7QcmtPaa	I know right.

I laugh so much during the Hornswoggle Little Boogeyman act. It breaks up the aggravation of seeing Vince McMahon.Maybe just maybe since he lost the belt his a** will be back in his office and he will start being the Chairman.|`|Cp17bXtmaa	Yeah, they have flexibility moves and they're good in high-flying like Jeff Hardy :)|`|a0cc9418beeb37ebc26e51371d8a606eaa	hell no its better watching wwe divas damn there fine|`|3mEE8OZNaa	oh yes,naked Mexican midget wrestling.I often attend these fabulous extravaganzas in my hometown of Tijuana, Mex.|`|4MYO9jQmaa	ill noooooooooooo i like watching grown men.|`|b7afeb0c70ceef389625b6f0ecbfc845aa	I love watching Hornswoaggle and Little Boogeyman<br>  <br>  They need to get more and have a Royal Rumble over the second rope match|`|nUNtj97iaa	They're good in small doses.|`|z3DPfSAhaa	yer i love them|`|40936f22187c78c71bbc81f9b9b1ca25aa	They are pretty good.|`|e59daf5c835a19f0e09282d3bd82caecaa	They are so fun to watch. It's like a nice break from watching the big guys duke it out. Those guys are fast for their size.

M9Hh6MPpaa	practice dribbling the ball around cones-- set up cones in a line and zig zag around them while dribbling.  <br>  <br>  throw the ball at the wall so it bounces once, catch it then throw it with the other hand.  do this like 20--30 times.<br>  <br>  And this last one is a theory I'm working on for when I coach school association football, but I'll share it with you.  Find and watch videos of Team handball, find a player whose style you like and watch more videos of that player.  according to my theory you will begin to think about handball like that player in and out of the court.

The colleges get big money from the bowl games. Just like they do the prime time regular season games. The rankings are a joke. It's nothing more than a set up so the colleges, networks and the advertisers can make their money.  I may be wrong but I think football is the only sport that does not have a playoff.

It is not on any news. IF you watch the video, when he went to leave he was going the wrong way all a act i believe. then when he approached the limo he took his sweet time opening the door. then getting in the limo very slow. I do believe it was all a act planned to fool everyone. I think they had something in there to close the door while he got out.<br>   But no fooling me it just didn't make since watching the video. It was weird the way it all went in the video.  You can find the video at wwe site. And i have seached the internet no news anywhere about it.I told my husband after watching it didn't add up. You can tell on the video. Watch it let me know what you think. Most of all not on the news any where. If he was dead it would be all over the news.|`|BBfEJF6waa	i dont know for sure i mean, I didnt see it on the news or anything and its kinda hard to belive knowing that wrestling is so fake that maybe this is too? im kinda sure he is dead but u'd think that it would be on the Headlines not just on the Web knowing its WWE and thats kind of a big deal to alot of people....... how i saw it wuz that 1 of my friends said he saw that on the web... lolz (i dont care anyway.. DEAD or Alive)|`|x115EQDTaa	well, what do you think,(i think he's tuly dead becouse of this)|`|BXZW8mpnaa	Yes, That asshole is DEAD!!|`|VMPYcrMcaa	i think he is dead and that it was a stunt gone wrong|`|XtlC0op8aa	i don't think that he is. i think that if he was really dead it would be all over the news instead of jsut wwe.com. ya know what i mean. he probably got in his limo, got out the other door, they had a rope or something attached to the door, as soon as he was out of the way, BOOM! he'll be back|`|ZmDwif1uaa	well i really dont think he is dead i mean y would it only be on wwe.com and when the car blew up dont ya think that people would have been screaming i mean i really dont think so he might play it for a while|`|eoi5T1nWaa	haha..its obvious its just a storyline... he was acting all weird like that was the last look around ECW and the superstars.. and after the explosion,there was nobody around. the camera man stood back for the explosion. There were only 2 firemen,  no cops and the fans were jeering in the so called 2mins silence (no matter how i hate him i wouldnt do that wen he's dead. the fact is HE IS NOT DEAD|`|kGNY567raa	I think he's not it wouldn't all add up.

ed0dd5c578ae47124c7c80e8644eba2daa	Ninguna por que ahora corre en NASCAR y hace mucho o nunca a ganado|`|x3oVB0oOaa	A sus 29 a?os Juan Carlos Montoya es ya todo un veterano de la Fórmula 1.  Comenzó su andadura automovilística en el Karting en 1981, donde ganaría el Campeonato Nacional en la categoría infantil tres a?os después. En los siguientes a?os, continuó acumulando victorias a nivel local y nacional hasta proclamarse vencedor de los campeonatos del mundo junior, en 1990 y 1991. Un a?o después, el piloto seguía demostrando su talento corriendo en las series estadounidenses Barber y Copa Fórmula Renault, obteniendo cuatro victorias y logrando cinco poles.A los 17 a?os, ganó el campeonato de Karting Sudam 125 y logró la tercera posición en el campeonato Barber Saab de Estados Unidos. Su siguiente triunfo le esperaría en Europa, concretamente en Inglaterra, <br>  <br>  En 1998 ganó el campeonato de F3000 con el equipo Supernova y estableció un récord de puntos totales en la temporada. Más tarde, Frank Williams organizó un cambio entre él y Alex Zanardi por el que Montoya se iba al campeonato CART, al equipo Chip Ganassi, y el italiano llegaba a la Fórmula 1 como compa?ero de Ralf Schumacher. En Estados Unidos, el colombiano deja su huella ganando el título en su primera temporada. Sumó siete victorias y siete poles y se convirtió en el campeón más joven en la historia de este deporte. <br>  <br>  <br>  El triunfo más importante del a?o 2000 lo alcanzó con las 500 millas de Indianápolis, <br>  .<br>  <br>  <br>  En la campa?a 2003, el piloto peleó por el título hasta la penúltima carrera del Campeonato, el GP de Estados Unidos. Montoya a?adió dos nuevos triunfos a su palmarés y afrontaba su última campa?a como piloto de Williams tras haberse comprometido ya con McLaren-Mercedes para el 2005. Esta última temporada de Montoya con la escudería Grove no fue buena ni para el piloto ni para su equipo. El FW26 fue un coche complicado de pilotar a lo que se a?adía la baja de Ralf Schumacher durante gran parte de la temporada como consecuencia de un grave accidente en Indianápolis. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  La reciente victoria en el Gran Premio de Inglaterra, quinta en su palmarés, ha llegado en un momento perfecto para enderezar un a?o muy complicado en el que Montoya tendrá que seguir superándose si quiere llegar a ser campeón del mundo esta temporada. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Títulos <br>  Subcampeón en 1997 de Fórmula 3000 <br>  Campeón en 1998 de Fórmula 3000 <br>  Mejor Novato y Campeón de Fórmula Cart en 2000 <br>  Récords en Fórmula Cart <br>  siete pole positions <br>  Siete carreras ganadas <br>  Mayor número de vueltas lideradas

S1Cwexaiaa	to be a top face you have to cut a lot or promo's, Taker never cut a lot of promo's even in his american badass days, he works better in his current status in the WWE he just needs a world title around his waist to make him all the more better|`|KIOR56r6aa	But he is more legendary than all of them.|`|36B9Cl29aa	I agree I always wanted him to but its never happened.|`|xEAYCmqHaa	Dont let Undertaker's gimmick fool you, the real man underneath the hat Mark Calloway (I think I misspelled it) doesnt want to be number 1, or to hold a bunch of championships. He wants what he exactly has, a legendary status and a great show giver while the younger guys get title shots. You see, Taker had his moments.. he still has his streak he is trying to help keep WWE alive by letting his fellow superstars share the glory....<br>  <br>  Too bad Cena and HHH always hog the titles|`|gr6bcnztaa	The Undertaker isnt about that<br>  Usually the Number 1 Face is someone the crowd can relate to no offence to Undertaker but he doesnt bring that to the table when it come to the wrestling business|`|B4oZJkc4aa	i don't know how to explain, but i root for Undertaker when he gets title matches, but once he finally wins and is defending the title, his matches seem dull to me.

AJEDjzC1aa	Yeah, if both return and they add some more threats on Defense they can become a serious threat next season, but the loser of the Super Bowl  doesn't fair well the season after|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Same as this year except no SB run.|`|Jp2415Whaa	Warner is key.  Even if we lose Boldin, we'd have Breaston.  Shape up the D a little, shape up the running game a little, shape up the Offensive Line a little and Cards can easily win their weak division again.  That being said, I think they can even get to the championship again, but there they will face some decent team.  I honestly think this team can do decent under Ken Whisenhunt.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	THEY WILL HAVE MOMENTUM FROM THIS SEASON,SO THEY SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Whoa slow down.  Usually the team that loses the bowl doesn't even make the playoffs the next year.        I.e. this years patriots  Last years Bears  The previous year's seahawks  and the one before thats Panthers.      That being said their deivision is so weak that they potentially could win it agian easily.  I just don't see them winning more than 9 games next year.|`|cFnE659Qaa	they wont make it to the superbowl again next season but i think that they are gonna be a much better team from now on as long as they make a few good signings in the off-season.    at the very least, i reckon they could be a much harder team to get a win from unlike the cardinals of the past|`|aR64sqyBaa	I think Kurt Warner returning will definitely be a key part of how well the Cards will do.  Tack on a new running back or two to balance out the offense a little bit and they should do well in a relatively weak division.      Another big part will be if Todd Haley stays with the Cards, or if is indeed in talks with the Chiefs to take over as Head Coach there.

6E16tR6xaa	Smackdown will recieve:  Batista  Rey  JBL  Kane  Mark Henry  Finlay    Raw will recieve:  Triple H  Big Show  Swagger  Kozlov    I'm personally hoping they retire ECW.|`|RQBolYlXaa	john cena should be drafted to ecw and become a jobber cos he sucks|`|J1qHRS07aa	I hope randy orton will get traded back to the Marine Corps.|`|XuX4lavPaa	Smackdown gets:   Orton, Jericho, Dolph Ziggler    Raw gets:   MVP, Edge, Big Show, Finlay|`|DjuMbOJUaa	Edge, MVP, Finlay, Matt Hardy, John Cena and probably a lot of the newer guys|`|3g08yf94aa	they should throw edge, orton, jericho, beth phoenix,michelle mcool and rosa mendes to ecw or fire them cuz they all suck|`|vPpiHZSSaa	To raw: Undertaker, MVP, Maryse, vladamir Kozlov  To SD: Candice Michelle, JBL, Kofi Kingston, CM Punk  To ECW: Brian kendrick, Carlito, vickie guerrero,    Note: Just predictions!|`|7a5QayBtaa	i think some should stay. im used to where they are now. if mickie james go to smackdown im raising hell unless she the first diva to hold the divas and womans championship. maryse and natalya should stay where they are at. kofi kingston should stay where he is at.|`|3icTrKLLaa	I hope they cancel the draft....it's run its course.|`|Fc3MLDzmaa	Triple H raw  Miz and Morrison|`|AA11482019	To Raw    Triple H  MVP   John Morrison  Edge    To Smackdown    John Cena  Jack Swagger  CM Punk  JBL    To ECW    Shelton Benjamin  Kane|`|w173betxaa	i hope kizarny goes to ecw   randy orton goes to smackdown  mickie james goes to smackdown  shelton benjamin goes to smackdown  cm punk goes to smackdwon to get the other 3 titles
wd9EPcGWaa	Im glad.  It feels like he is back were he belongs|`|e5b4a22cbe6271d858c17e5d4b535dd7aa	Except for the fact that he isn't playing anything like how he played back in the day. He is batting around .250 or so with less that 20 hr's a year. The guy needs to retire. The Mariners aren't any better with him.
XQoH9ZI5aa	First off........you probably shouldn't show that 2nd youtube video.....a pretty dirty hit from behind by him.     Secondly, he's still an average Joe player until he actually does anything in the NHL but scouts seem to like him........Caputi has all of the physical tools to develop into a power forward at the NHL level. At 6'2, 184 lbs, Caputi's game is based upon paying a price physically. He scores a lot of his goals from in front of the net, and is more than willing to muck it up in the corners. One area where Caputi must improve is his skating, where his initial stride is not as quick as it needs to be.       Best of luck to him!     Favourite Flyers Prospect? James van Riemsdyk.     Favourite prospect to not yet play a game? James van Riemsdyk      One day soon he will be making mincemeat out of Caputi (LOL). Seriously, I hope (am guessing) he makes his NHL debut in the play-offs this year.....or shortly before.|`|AA12162118	I wasnt impressed he has a little bit of spirit but is small and really not even that tough definitely not talented. Hope he works out for you though.|`|64LZW2y8aa	I have so much prospects in Montreal.    Favorite Prospects on Montreal:  Max Pacioretty, Ben Maxwell, PK Subban, Gregory Stewart, Yannick Weber, Mathieu Carle, Ryan McDonagh.    Favorite player to not play NHL game:  In the OHL right now, 1st Overall Draft Pick this year, guaranteed, John Tavares!|`|ys3DHzDuaa	LoL!  Aaaahhh, the excitement that surrounds a rookie's first game and their  1 fans! ;)    My favorite team's best prospect would be Lukas Kaspar.  I can make a good argument for Logan Couture as well, but i'll stick with Kaspar because he's further along in development.  The former first rounder has already had a taste of the NHL and has already scored his first goal!  He's back in the AHL though and he's continued to get on the scoresheet.    My favorite player who hasn't played an NHL game yet is Ryan McDonagh of the Canadiens.  Currently playing for the Badgers in the NCAA, he's continued to progress in his hockey development with huge strides.  He even played for team USA in the World Juniors!  The guy will be a top tier blueliner for the Habs in the future for years to come!    -EDIT- And your boy SCORES!!!|`|yRT5HjF0aa	I just read his wikipedia profile and it looks like your boy scored his first NHL goal on his first shift and also scored on his own net... Poor kid, I wish him the best in future though.|`|n1KfeNAiaa	With a name like Luca Caputi the name alone sounds cool. As for prospect wise the Avs don't look to promissing. I guess if I had to choose i'd say Nigel Williams. Since I live really close to Reading, PA there is a player on the Royals that you can give hoot about lol is Brock Hooton. The Royals stink but hes alright. Kate I gotta hand it to the Pens they've got a great farm system.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I can tell you are excited , Kate you misspelled uber . :p  Right now the Panthers have many good prospects . I would like to see more of Matthias for sure.   Bonus: Not sure . There have ben a few. But none are really coming to mind right this particular second .
sHzPnGXHaa	HAHAHA    i cant stop laughing|`|xIfvXy4waa	Yes, wow, you must be really smart to figure that one out. But, actually it's because there is a requirement that you HAVE to be a twin to play on the team, DUH!|`|RJghPceKaa	no, its something that has to do with geography that you are too stupid to understand|`|ehMPOlefaa	.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	I can't belive ppl actually answer these questions.No wonder you never go away.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Twin Cities...Minneaspolis - St. Paul|`|1OeNP92yaa	THE TWIN CITIES DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|4SKmjYrsaa	Twin Cities...thanks for th 2 pts ;)|`|6826faa24e7136054b7f73bfa7839087aa	Actually, no.  When the team started playing in 1961, the ballpark was in Bloomington, at what is now the Mall of America. Since the two major cities in Minnesota are Minneapolis and St. Paul, and those two town are well known as the "Twin Cities", coupled with the fact that the ballpark was not in either town, the nickname of Twins made sense.|`|91vuNupCaa	No, it's because of the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.|`|RSPZj5yeaa	Twin Cities also known as Minneapolis and the capital St Paul.   Kind of seperated by a river.   And how are they boring?   Because they play hard and dont pay zillions of dollars to over hyped free agents?
63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	You said it Jabroni!|`|9Us6XYg8aa	what is your point|`|AA10818931	the rock to be the mystery person at chamber|`|AYiVipawaa	i got that dvd|`|3icTrKLLaa	Normally i would get mad at somebody being an idiot in a question....but i can't be mad at something The Rock says.    They don't need to send wrestlers to acting school. They need to let the wrestlers speak for themselves more on the mic and not have them memorize as many lines. Then maybe they can find someone as good on the mic as The Rock.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	It's okay waste of points for you two easy ones for me.|`|3g08yf94aa	And Thats The Bottom Line Cause Stone Cold Said So!|`|5xIroQjMaa	Yeah, wrestling is really mising the Rock. They still haven't found anyone that can work the mic like he could. It'd be nice if they started sending wrestlers to acting school, not just wrestling school.

elnG0eDlaa	Andre Miller would be a good PG replacement, but if you're going with the best all-around player, I'd say Andre Iguodala, he's come alive since Brand went down.|`|o5XWImGsaa	is should be mo williams I hate cavs|`|khbLZQHIaa	Mo Williams.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	It should be Ray Allen!|`|ZdNSSm0waa	This coming from a sixers fan.....    I say Ray allen|`|e244f73e4196f993f5f933b295465ca5aa	I think either Mo Williams, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, or Vince Carter.  All of them are doing their share and being beneficial to their team.|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Mo Williams|`|NzS7yD32aa	Ray Allen|`|AJEDjzC1aa	Mo Williams or Ray Allen|`|B8RADy1Paa	mo williams   he has made the the cavs a lot better|`|LMayULw3aa	mo williams or ray allen|`|XXtYOAK7aa	I SAY DUHON|`|5cb37dafe71700436d00339ba33de2ddaa	JESUS SHUTTLESWORTH|`|UXHqV1xlaa	As a Celtics fan, I would love to see Rajon Rondo in the All-Star game. He is central to the success of the Green. When Rondo plays well, the Celtics are nearly unstoppable. He is as valuable to the C's as any of the big three, if not more! But with all that said, I have a feeling that Mo Williams will be in instead of Rondo or Ray Allen. Think about it this way, with the addition of either Rondo or Allen, there will be 3 Celtics compared to one Cavalier. Just my two cents...|`|HAb1kirYaa	I agree wit andre miller but dnt hink so... possibly lou williams or thad and if not then definitely mo williams
M9Hh6MPpaa	6:00 minutes or faster|`|Taf5yWUbaa	If you're pretty good you'll be around 6 minutes..Anything over 7 and under 9 is just fine.|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	Height and weight have very little to do with how fast you are capable of running.<br>  <br>  Body type, training, lung capacity, etc. are all far more important.  Also, your sex would be relevant.<br>  <br>  However, I would say that a 7th grade boy running a 6ish minute mile likely can develop into a good runner by high school.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Depends on a lot of things.<br>  <br>  If you actually train and run cross-country and the like, you could be in the 5:20 range (I was about 5:25-30 as a 12 year old in 7th grade, my friend was near 5 flat, but we both ran cross-country and track)<br>  <br>  If you don't run frequently, anything around 7 minutes would be respectable I guess...<br>  <br>  And if you are out of shape, then the sky is the limit!<br>  <br>  Your weight and height have much less to do with your mile time than your actual cardio condition. You may have someone weigh 50 pounds more and the same height, but if they have been training their butt off, they may beat you... its all relative and has to be accounted for on an individual basis.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|i0SyPs0iaa	ok kid..this is how i see it.<br>  i'm 17 about 5'8" and 155lbs<br>  i run the mile in like 6:50<br>  <br>  assuming you're pretty skinny you should be able to get within the high 5's to low 6's|`|3QtO3SpFaa	Anything under 5 minutes would be a good goal. But if you can't finish within 20 minutes, it's time to get off the couch.
zG1m1eXxaa	Err............ No, if I could buy more pairs of shoes than you or shave my legs better would you find that sexy?|`|KOsGtal8aa	very, very , very, VERY SEXY!!!!

Vp3RrTpeaa	Tony Parker because then I could stare at Eva Longoria.|`|WkpOrF64aa	Depends.<br>  <br>  If I want a guy to run my offense, spread the floor, and/or make sure everyone is in their proper place, I'd go with Billups.<br>  <br>  If I want speed, scoring, and/or dribble penetration, I'd go with Parker.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	definitely Chauncey Billups.. Tony Parker is a dirty player just like his spurs' teammates|`|NJtjJA8Baa	Billups is getting old, so Tony Parker.|`|JV8lgDRCaa	id rather have d-will|`|GksSFTcVaa	I would rather have Billups. Billups has a better shooting average and a better teammate overall. Parker works only good with the trio he makes with Duncan and Ginobili.

jr2xPsOraa	if you have the time and motivation to stick to the routine, then your on your way to a good start.   just i would make sure you add in about a 15 min cooldown at the end of the routine, and once you've been doing this for a while, maybe get a personal trainer.    dont listen to klas or what ever,   freestlye tricks, and things similar to hackysack but with a soccerball help you build better ball control.|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	how your going to be able to spend 5hours aday footballing is kinda hard depending if ur on vacations. Drop freestyle its useless IMO.
8cDd70dSaa	Nope. I'm perfectly fine on the ground.|`|08s03qFGaa	yesss! totally. not as much for the show but just to know that I had enough courage to actually go through with it, you know?|`|fy8YNH7jaa	ye it would be such a good experience|`|klhB1ijwaa	i havn't sky dived but i would love to    i would sky dive just to say i did  :)|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Absolutely, live your life to the fullest!|`|Szf3UEVNaa	ya its fun to sky dive ive done it once. try it!!!|`|n3R7DJ52aa	Do it, it'll be fun :)|`|nGOf6OT9aa	yeah i would love to and it seems really fun im sure ill try it once it does seem scary lol
TKNPveHDaa	it's most likely mental, since sand rarely is a good solid surface for speed work.  Sometimes, if it's hard-packed sand, it'll be a good balance between firm with some give, but mostly it'll slow you down.<br>  <br>  Grass is bad for running for speed.  Asphalt is called hard-ball by some runners because it's brilliant for speed.  I'm surprised you can do sand faster then asphalt.<br>  <br>  Like I said, you expect to do better on sand, so you do.|`|fPYe5jTWaa	the strain they cause on your legs. sand is very easy to run on, it doesn't bother your leg muscles in the least and is recommended for those with injuries. grass and asphalt, on the other hand, tax your muscles considerably.

Mexico never plays in Mexico so don't give me the Azteca crap.  2. Some stadiums in Mexico are built like jails, ARG, SPA, BRA or any of the top teams will not go there unless you play in the US.  3.

He was not in the wwe long enough even if he did make a good impact, but just not big enough.the amount of time he was here<br>  <br>  for example, look at the old wrestlers who are just Now or recently getting into the HoF and look back to all of the years they gave to WWE and the wrestling business in general (wwe related wrestling businesses ECW, WCW, NWA, old stuff wwe has ties to, not TNA, IJPW, or AAA)<br>  <br>  Kurt doesn't have any kind of years to compare to that stuff and while people like SCSA might not have been in as long as some of the older people, he made one of, if not the biggest, impact on the WWE/WWF and complete wrestling industry so he definitely deserves his spot, even if not wrestled for long time.<br>  <br>  other soon - near future HoF inductees<br>  HBK<br>  Taker<br>  Vince McMahon<br>  (anyone in new legends of wrestling game probably)<br>  <br>  farther down the line inductees<br>  HHH<br>  The Rock<br>  Jim Duggan<br>  Mick Foley|`|s8eDbeF2aa	at the moment, no.<br>  although he is a good wrestler and has held every title he was alledgible to compete for in wwe and tna, he's only been in the spotlight for about 9 years give or take. give him another 5 years. i think he's got too much fight in him to be put on the washed up list.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Not as long as he's working for a competing company. And I don't see him receiving recognition in the future if he - at some point - does not return to WWE in some capacity.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no,because he still wrestling
21J0IIZbaa	The would be the 6-7 seed.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Where's the bench?|`|3ON4hmRbaa	i guess you're a pacers fan, right. yep, if Indiana hadn't made some trades, this would be their current starting line-up. I believe they would definitely make the playoffs, but not past the second round.<br>  <br>  Reasons:<br>  - o'neal is playing very erratically these days<br>  - jamaal tinsley, and stephen jackson are me-first scorers. they probably couldn't mesh too well with danny granger (who is also a scorer but a bit less selfish)<br>  -a few years back, indiana bench was bad. so, if this starting lineup was true, they would have a bad bench|`|vFbzBo4eaa	It's possible and depends on the team records and team chemistry|`|zJAVYQWiaa	Nope<br>  because there's no:<br>  LBJ<br>  A.I<br>  CP3<br>  Melo<br>  Shaq<br>  or Kobe<br>  <br>  LOL thats just what i think|`|9UhoUcM2aa	where is the bench players?|`|wt7k1RRqaa	not just them 5 need more players buddy like a.i flash melo and cp3
qaz33UnNaa	they have been playing fairly well without amare so i plan to see them in the playoffs in any seed from 6-8.|`|Jp2415Whaa	Yeah, I have faith.|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	with the running Suns back, they very well may steal the 8th spot. Houston is due for a spiral into mediocrity.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	No, I doubt it.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	its gonna be a grind without amare, but ya i think theyll get in there|`|EcgzRGPwaa	Nope I don't think so|`|65H77wolaa	there's a chance, but not that big, coz other team are getting better this 2nd half of the season especially the utah jazz, boozer is back,., so maybe, they have 40% chance?|`|hB29qBMvaa	Unfortunaley not with the season they are having i mean Amare is out and their lineups are messed up... and their GM is a f*g so honestly.. No.|`|9Injuk2zaa	If Steve Kerr plays, yes.|`|kmBdx2koaa	nope they need him they were struggling with him now without him there gonna fall|`|RrfHfWWEaa	Nope, I dont think so|`|bRlF0U8Jaa	no|`|fZ38PPgSaa	nope

MMmv06Ynaa	Yes it is!!! I Love Soccer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ronaldo is probably the best player!!!!!|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Disagree. It's incredibly dull, more often than not there's very little scoring. It's also unimpressive to see some get get brushed by a shoe lace, then fall down like he just got shot, then get up a few seconds later once the penalty has been called..Not exactly manly IMO. Then there are the fans. They are insufferable, riots, urine-filled balloons, and stadium's collapsing because 80,000 fans tried to occupy an amount of space that could only seat 13,000.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	One of the easiest is how long he is practicing.    Different organizations use different levels.    IKMF(International Krav Maga Federation) uses Levels with Practioner 1-5, Graduate 1-5 and Expert 1-5 and Master 1-3.    KMAA (Krav Maga Association of America) uses belts, and or levels. They also have certification A-C. I have seen places use levels 1-5, and or belts.    There are a few other organizations so it depends.    But universally the time spent in Krav Maga would be a good indicator. If a guy has been teaching Krav for 8 years or so, chances are he is pretty good.    As is someone with extensive experience in the Israeli Defense Force, (especially someone who served over the mandatory 4 years, and was involved in a combat unit).    Mostly, someone with an extensive hand to hand background would be best. A Krav instructor who holds rank in other arts, as he had a good foundation to begin with.    But hard to look at a person and tell if they are good at Krav. Seeing them in action definately helps, sparring, movement, etc.    Most of the time, if you have some background in Martial Arts, it is pretty easy to spot who is feeding a line of BS and who knows the real deal. Krav is a little easier for people to get away with, because so many variances of ranks between organizations and stuff.    Mainly I would ask where they studied, what organization they are with, etc.
KOM1Bki8aa	CARRICK or FLETCHER, PARK played well, and if it wasn't for GIGGS being greedy i might of said him, i think O'SHEA and EVANS were very strong, EVRA ran his socks off and the usual sublime performance from RONALDO and BERBATOV, RIO kept everything tight at the back, but for me 11 clean sheets in a row another european record of 20 unbeaten matches in europe it has to be SIR ALEX FERGUSON, i also thought VAN DER SAR had a quiet game.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	I really think it was C.Ronalda.... he never stopped and he played against Inter without any fear or even respect..... I like that, he surprised me!!!!|`|QuGTZJIVaa	The referee<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm inviting the TD's aren't i?|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I would say Ryan Giggs. Performed very well last night|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	Patrice Evra in my opinion he never tired out last night. And every time he lost the ball he got up won it back! The whole team played well but berbatov and ronaldo strongly disappointed me last night.<br>  <br>  Ronaldo should have passed more and berbatov played good but rooney would have done better if he started for berbatov instead|`|p6E7g6CWaa	cristiano ronaldo as reported in the link below|`|wMyfu5FUaa	Darren Fletcher|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Cristiano Ronaldo or Ryan Giggs. C Ron nearly scored some amazing free kicks. He played well in that game.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Ronaldo :)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Mr. Ryan Giggs.<br>  <br>  <br>  I already told u why ;p

zN0aeqclaa	i am a knicks fan..i was at the jordan game..he was only a few games in an d he dropped 55..kobe is midseason and got to the line 20x's...i think MJ is obviously MORE IMPRESSIVE......kobe had more freethrows then shots made|`|AqzTovGsaa	I would say MJ. He played against a tough knicks team in the 90's.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Of course Jordan. He had "Patrick Ewing" in the middle to deal with!|`|c6a6e99e34da0a5df1d14201ee7ccc64aa	mj was more impressive, because he was the best and play against a tough knicks team.|`|PA7ryYR8aa	I'd say Kobe because hes only played in madision square Garden 13 times in his carrer, well Jordan played atleast 100.|`|PcxUNztLaa	Nope...Kobe's was more impressive...Kobe scored MORE points and took tougher SHOTS! and MJ's was against a Weak Knick team that lost to the Pacers in the playoff's...definetly NOT! contenders!.....plus MJ's was in the waterd down 90's...    and your right...MJ came outta retirement..so he was the FRESHEST guy on the team...he should have been putting up 40 a night......instead he Choked VS Orlando......    Kobe>MJ....|`|bT0kyzRPaa	free throws smee smows... kobe killed... people need to get of mjs lap he was an outstanding player but you kobe killed it too|`|nIG0j9wUaa	MJs|`|B8RADy1Paa	well id say MJs in that game but how about against the knicks|`|o5XWImGsaa	they were both against the knicks so I would say Kobe's was a little better

Yxz9YXXAaa	Put in earplugs and control your diaphram, or breathing :O|`|job9o5ioaa	Just keep training and sparing more and effectively.    I assure you, you'll get the confidence.    BUT, we're not talking about street fight now, are we!|`|d3zT4NFaaa	Make friends with this dude that everyone knows... his name is "pain".    Also if you can get acquainted with this other dude called "fear" then you can start learning how to fight!    Once you've started your training, You will need to shake off this dude who will always try to own you and screw you over... his name is "Mr. ego"|`|sAWOgZpFaa	pshhh just do it.  be fearless//  and be careful ;) lol|`|r8CmwwNiaa	Once you're not afraid of getting hit and loosing is when you'll gain confidence.......and to get that you have to get hit and lose =)|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Best way is just to do it.  Start off light contact, no face contact, and work your way up.  Grappling is also a good way to get used to contact without getting hit.      And drill.  Being in shape and knowing your techniques backward and forward is a huge edge in any kind of sparring.      If you get hit hard, immediately realize that you are okay.  Your head is still screwed on, nothing is broken.  You're fine.  Just keep breathing and remember that you are tough enough to take some abuse.

AA10698715	Definitely practice ALOT at home and then you can show them your skills next time you get out there.  You must have discipline when practicing for any sport.  You wont learn it over night.  Remember if it were easy everybody could do it!  when you are playing at school you must be active (dont just stand around) so people will pass to you.  Good Luck!|`|fo7cTEuxaa	Practice at home and if someone shoves u get up and shove tham back and then get the ball. Also if they don't pass the ball to u just get in the way of the person they r passing to and show them what u can do.
LIKkt8djaa	Depends what style riding you're looking to do with it, You could have easily gone down to a 148 if you wanted to be more freestyle specific, But that 152 isn't a bad choice for a more all-mountain oriented ride.|`|ucot94w3aa	The WWW is a more freestyle-oriented park board.<br>  You should have probably gone a little shorter, but a 152 isn't terribly long for you.  It's at the longer end of your weight range.<br>  <br>  It's not too bad of a choice though because the bigger board will also give you a little more width for your size 10.5 boots.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	once again Jake is very much misinformed...the K2 WWW is a park board and 152 for your weight is a little on the long side, but going long is not nearly as bad as going too short. whether it's a park board or a mountain board it has to match your weight...you can get away with a 152...but a 150 or 148 would've fitted your perfectly. Stick with the 152 as having a long board is not a problem...especially if you can already do tricks...|`|a1xU4KsOaa	A 152 would have been fine.  A 148 is even better for park, but I would just stick with the 152.<br>  <br>  Yes, the WWW is a freestyle oriented board, but that doesn't mean you can't take it out of the park.  I regularly take my Stairmaster onto the groomers.  I've seen (Bryan Fox?) ride it in powder.<br>  <br>  It definitely won't be as easy to ride as a stiffer board when bombing or in powder, but it's doable.|`|m8Qqbfnzaa	i have the k2 WWW as well, so first i would like to say, Great Choice.<br>  <br>  i am 5'10 142lbs and i have a 148.  however, this is because i spend all my day jibbin' away.  and it is the next step below what u have now.  but i would probably say keep the 152. it is more variable from park to trail
5etFAmrsaa	I agree 100%|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	Too bad for kurt championships are won when you have a defense.  Being nice doesnt get you a ring.|`|L3byzh3Gaa	Ben Rothlisberger deserved it because he led his team better than Kurt Warner did. Kurt Warner is a nice guy but Ben Rothlisberger is a better player.     I'm sure your a nice guy, but do you deserve a million dollars before the next guy? No, you gotta work and be better than that guy, I think Big Ben has worked and been better than Kurt Warner has.|`|sGQbF431aa	No but Ben Roethlisberger did. He finds a way to win when the game is on the line, especially in January (and February, for that matter).          Being nice doesn't get you a ring. Winning does|`|AA12220784	It,s America buddy, you are entitiled to your opinions.  But I don't think Kurt Warner would agree with you, he is a born again Christian and you just defiled his beliefs...good fan.|`|srIvu5PWaa	The best team won get over it. The steelers came on top and Ben is not the only one who got a ring the second-year coach Mike Tomlin. And I don't think Kurt deserved one anymore than Ben.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Both teams and QB's played well euff to win,   the Steelers just played a little better    I have the utmost respect for Kurt  He is  a HOF'er    so I'm not going to rant and dis insult him, like you did Beg Ben|`|Awfv7TV3aa	Kurt had the better numbers but Ben Roethlisberger wasnt going to be denied a second ring. I dont see how anyone can hate Roethlisberger. Aside from breaking your heart and being one of the most successful quarterbacks in the playoffs, the guy is a class act.|`|NbIgE12Daa	I wouldn't say ben didn't deserve a ring i would say every single person involved with the steelers in every imaginable way did not deserve another superbowl especially this year.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	so every NFL player that you deem nice is automatically awarded Superbowl rings ?     Theres other guys out on the field besides just the QB's you know 11 on offense and 11 on defense     Its over , better luck next year|`|AA12103453	LOL. Kurt Warner could have beat the Patriots and failed. Kurt Warner could have gone to the Super Bowl more then twice before Ben STARTED his Pro Career. You don't get Super Bowl Titles by being a nice guy. I can agree that Kurt Warner is a nice guy and should be proud of himself that he has got to 3 Super Bowls, that doesn't mean he "deserves" more then one Title though.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	So that's your criteria for deserving a Super Bowl win? He's a nice guy!    They lost. Get over it!    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|xIfvXy4waa	C'mon give him a break, we all make mistakes. Plus, he reminds me a tad of Bradshaw. Give him a chance, he is too young now but I see great things in his future. But 2005 made him an arrogant punk, he will snap out of it though I'm sure.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Really? Then just who was that person who dissected the Cardinals' defense with the biggest game of the year on the line?|`|eC9RmuAyaa	Maybe Warner should ride a motorcycle without a helmet too. That way he'd be a winner instead of finishing second, huh? You have some truly faulty logic.

If that is what you mean, then you need cleats. Other teams you play are likely to have field turf or grass, which would mean you need cleats. But if you will play on Astroturf type stuff, turf shoes will probably work better, but you need to have cleats and turf shoes because not every opponent will have the same kind of surface. Find out or better yet, ask the coach.
iOICjcZcaa	THANK GOD!     1. Bra and panties matches - NOT wrestling. Just girls rolling around to please horny boys.    2. WWE needs to get some girls who can WRESTLE. Getting Kelly Kelly, Candice Michelle, and Maria were the WORST possible things the WWE could have done. They can't wrestle. They aren't entertaining. They're pathetic.    3. If you want to watch half naked girls rolling around, go buy yourself a porno. Stop being such a pervert.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	A bra and panties match is F*** all to do with wrestling! it's something to entertain the horny idiots that attitude was aimed at. PG is a lower rating but means a more mature show! If PG drives away fans that only watch for garbage wrestling and Bra and Panties matches then i am all for it! i want wrestling not bimbos striping (try porn if you want to see that... you'll see more... only way you'll see it!)|`|w173betxaa	The bra and panties match has been gone, wake up and smell the coffee.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	WOW  that sucks.    PG sucks.    pg made it boring.|`|UWJinEbIaa	What your not old enough to look for porn on the internet?!!?!?!?!?!|`|oAjbBLDpaa	PG Strikes again? I think it hit the ball out of the park on this one.     Bra and Panties matches weren't wrestling. Just two girls pulling clothes off each other for idiots. I would much rather see actual talent in the ring putting on an actual performance in wrestling. These matches just lowered women's standards in the world of wrestling and makes most unable to be taken seriously. I would take Natalya, Beth, Melina, and Mickie James in an actual professional wrestling match over a bra and panties match any day.|`|3g08yf94aa	they also changed cena's fu into the attitude adjuster|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	It sucks but that match never really made any sense|`|CJzbIhWuaa	well i dont think kelly is the person to ask about active wwe rules, they cant seem to win, alot of people complain they are just eye candy and want to see them wrestle, then when they do, they dont like the fact they dont wear skimpy clothing, i do prefer the good ole bikini contests|`|uEfoR5BLaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Who cares about the bra and panties match anyway? There is no actual wrestling involved it it. It's just eye candy.

CELHea69aa	He could be awesome if...<br>     1. he can catch <br>     2. he can take a hit<br>     3. he can run in pads<br>     4. he can learn the offense|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes|`|Oes7TRNVaa	I don't care how fast and tall you are. U still have to know how to play the game. If he could play trust me he would be playing already. We don't even know if he can catch or take a hit. Run with pads. We don't know.<br>  <br>  He is the fastest guy this planet has ever seen though|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	he'd be a returner. possibly a receiver if he can catch.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	probably not|`|op4fEbEVaa	no|`|5gKGtSriaa	He'd be BOLT"N, but the problem would that he'd need to learn to run with pads, he'd need to learn to take a hit, learn to play for 2:30 hours or more and he'd need to be good at catching. But the most important thing is that he'd have to learn how to change up where he's going. Like, since he runs short distance, stamina doesn't really matter, he'd need to learn that, but also most importantly, how to be very fast, and be able to go left and right then break form Cornerbacks.<br>  <br>  So in the end, he'd be great WR, but the NFL could take him down. Speeds not only the most important thing, if there's a smart team, you can have Bolt, but they'll stop him. Sure maybe a few times he'll get in fo a TD, but he's no football player, more a soccer.|`|Om24dMRqaa	Can he run that fast on a field?  Football speed is much different than track speed.  Can he catch?  Run as fast as the wind but if he has hands of stone then it won't matter.  How about his heart? Will he go across the middle?  Can he take a hit? Can he run in pads?  There are a whole lot of questions about this guy and just because he can run doesn't mean he can play football.|`|wiXXfzFyaa	Justin Gatlin trained with a couple of NFL team in 06-07...i didn't work out, so i don't think Bolt would make it... yes he's 6"5 but also only weights 185 so anyone could break the guy in pieces. + the guy probably never played the game.|`|nq4cyjbwaa	Maybe As Good As Renaldo "Skeets" Nehamiah|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	that would be awesome and if the packers pick him up it'd be even better|`|aVhFFQbqaa	hit touchdowns? wow, just wow.

9hC7bbf7aa	It will fade like everything else...time frame ? I believe it's maxed out  or no more interrogation on the tennis site that I foresee.  Other tournaments will  take the minds off the incidence we don't usually witness at a Slam event.    It was an unusual scene whether you are a fan or non-fan of Federer. I did feel sorry for Roger, and my tears welled up too, a rather contagious feeling....to say the least.    And let us stop tearing apart Roger and go on with other important and interesting events coming up.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	I know right, I would cry if i lost a Slam..  But I say it'll happen for a week or so,  let 'em all digest the loss,  they'll get over it  :)|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Well i for one think Rafael Nadal totally deserved the victory, he was awesome. especially after that 5 set match in the semis against Verdasco!    Roger Federer crying is humilating, yes after a grandslam lost, its absolutely fine however go and cry in the locker room like a man would do! (rafa did that at wimby 2007, he was sooo close to taking that trophy but he did it in the locker room away from everyone) :( !  I mean Nadal is about to make his speech and then all of sudden everyone is sad and feeling sorry for Roger grrr not appreciating the tennis Nadal brought to win the match....so it was kinda of a let down, Roger stole Nadal`s thunder!!! (not saying intentionally, emotions just come out sometimes and you cant help it)! But oh well, i think the rest of yahoo answers should get over it haha it happened like 3days ago now, get on with your lifes, roger federer cried who gives a ****. haha i certainly dont, all i care about is Rafael Nadal now a grandslam champion on all the different surfaces :D :D :D im soooooo PROUD :)!
GRHqNrR6aa	You could run mid to high 1:50's in the 800 and 50/51 in the 400. If you run a 47 in the 400 or low 1:50's in high school you will probably go just about anywhere. And you could get into a smaller D1 school even if your times aren't amazing.    As far as applying, you should probably start the summer before your senior year.|`|Lol0iLfgaa	Talk to the coach before you apply.  Many schools will have ways to get in contact with the coach on their athletic website.  I'd suggest using email.    As far as times, if you can run a 1:54/48 or below, you should be able to get on most teams.  For DII, I'd say anything sub-1:58/50 will get you serious consideration.|`|EfaQpsd5aa	my goal is to get to a Div l school for track (University of Washington) and also make the 2012 olympic trials.

4VoQduaZaa	Some say that it is just his luck. I do not believe so. Luck may be a part of it, but there is much more to his success than luck alone. He has carried his courageous batting attitude to his captaincy. He believes in his team and he has made his team believe in themselves. Tactically he has always had answer to tough situations and to say in his words, his 'clarity of thought' has made all the difference. When he handed the ball to Joginder for final over of T20 WC, he asked him not to worry about the result. How many captains can do that? He has told his team to enjoy the time on field and it is very obvious in the way the team carries itself. At the same time, he has changed his batting style and taken up additional responsibility. He has not buckled under additional pressure of captaincy and now that has caught up with the entire team. If anybody is lucky, it is the Indian cricket which has this captain courageous and his band of fearless warriors achieving newer heights all the time.|`|0QBKiP2naa	nothing|`|M8XmhqIhaa	He is just a really good captain with really good tactics.

Nuj1eScCaa	It's not hard if you have the overall leg strength. I'm 6'4" and I dunk, nothing fancy just one handed stuffs. I don't really lift weights or work out with weights too much, I run.<br>  <br>  I will tell you this though and this is true, once you do it one time it becomes easier. Just getting over that thought of whether you can do it or not is half the battle.|`|RrfHfWWEaa	It should not be too hard as long as you work out...

0t8XYZKRaa	Gallas insulted the young guns of Arsenal so yes Wenger should sell him and Toure has been playing like someone who doesn't know how to play football. Both of them should be sold. It was right that Gallas was stripped of his captaincy for complaining on somethng.|`|GZ4ix77Saa	I agree, they both should be sold|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I thought they both played well last night, or did i miss something??  We didn't concede did we|`|PrsbAjZAaa	And replace them with who exactly?<br>  <br>  it's all good and well having YOUNGTSERS lined up for the FUTURE , but would you trust a few 16 year old's with little or no first team experience at any club , to play in the Premiership when you want to be pushing for a top four place?<br>  <br>  <br>  would you trust them to win the Champions League?<br>  <br>  <br>  Gallas and Toure may make mistakes , who dosen't? , they want to win as much as the rest of the team , they may not want to win for the team , but if they want to win they will perform when they need to.
XZTwrn2Qaa	He might, but it will be  bad move on his part.<br>  <br>  Lewis is getting up in age and he doesnt play at the level at which he used to, he misses tackles occasionally, but thats ok around that great defense in baltimore.<br>  <br>  but if he plays like that in Dallas, players will start calling him out and it will only cause MORE trouble in Dallas.|`|gBfPkdroaa	i think so, if you guys cut some players.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	they'll have to pick him up from dallas county jail.|`|AUjTaLvwaa	that'd be cool. then we could have the big leader we need here in dallas. but everybody who likes him as a player will now hate him because he has a star on his helmet.<br>  <br>  i don't think we'll get him though, because our cap space is very low and we still haven't resigned d-ware.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	Yeah.

I'm going to the season home opener though also.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Can I suggest something?    Don't waste your money, wait until the regular season begins and get them at CitiField.    Everything is priced way over what it should be during spring training.  Save your money, and go to see them on the road during the regular season in Philadelphia, Washington or Pittsburgh; or better still go to Cincinnati or Milwaukee. Thats more fun.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	I have been to Florida twice four years in between and let me tell you totally worth the money. But there was only one thing I hated and sorry to say but it was Traditional Field. I had like planned to go see the Mets play two games at home then follow them away. By the time we got to the spring training field it was sold out already and we got stuck with the bleachers or the lawn. And you get locked out from the other part of the stadium which is one thing I can not stand cause how do you expect to get autographs from the bleachers you don't! Traditional field was one of the most crappiest spring training stadiums I have ever been too, and I have been to a lot. I live in Arizona and have seen all our stadiums and the mets spring training field really disappointed me. But then I followed the team away and it was way better got tons of autographs go to be face to face with the players. My favorite spring training stadium in Florida is the braves at Disney wide world of sports totally cool and way better. Good luck hope you have a great time at the game and GO METS!|`|FfIqGrdkaa	Just get there early they let u move up to the field to get autographs.
eHcXI4jFaa	I agree with the above poster.  they still think they are in India.  the wickets may not be as green as last time they played but that one was two paced and you needed to choose your shots wisely.  NZ bowled well but India did not bat intelligently, so the captain must shoulder a lot of the blame for not giving adequate instructions to his players.  they kept trying to blast their way out of a whole.  They were very lucky to get 162 I think, it could have been a lot worse.|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	Though India lost few quick wickets, they managed to put 162 runs.  However, their bowlers failed to contain New Zeland Batsmen, which was the main reason for India's loss|`|H6CrxE45aa	Yuvraj really let us down in a time we needed to back up Raina.<br>  <br>  And i think now it makes sense why the Aussies did not attack Vettorie so often.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	i think our batsman who have just more aggressive,our batsman has to believe that NZ also knows how to play cricket..|`|oLwmpSPQaa	India have been curried by the kiwis.

HgXjAxzKaa	They wont be good enough.<br>  <br>  NZ to win most games.|`|eHcXI4jFaa	in 20/20 anything can happen.  If they perform like that again, then no.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am unconvinced by the quality of the indian bowling attack from that match, with the exception of the first 3 overs and 2 spin overs.  Khan and Singh will be great and consistent.  Sharma oozes potential (i thought he would be faster) and can swing it but might lack consistency.  Outside of these 3 India lacked real quality.  Perhaps the Pathans etc may improve but they really look to be part timers like NZs Ryder/Elliott/McCullum.  That would be my biggest concern for India.<br>  <br>  NZ has some truly top draw limited over bowlers in Mills, who was not playing, and Vettori, plus a number of handy bowlers like O'Brien  and southee (though he is still inconsistent) giving them a larger range of  options, let alone if oram can start bowling soon.  India will have to either blow NZ away with their opening bowling spell or really take off with their batting.  But wellington will be hard to do this, with its wind helping swing bowling, expect southee to be better there.  I would consider an extra seamer in the team and back the quality of the Indian top order.  They won't do that though.|`|KbzXg3hfaa	To be honest I rekon its about 50/50 as to them fighting back.<br>  <br>  They massively overrated themselves - I mean didn't they watch Australia play NZ at all and learn from that? India's bowling was very average and I rekon NZ will smack them all over the park unless India finds some very good bowling form and quickly. NZ on the otherhand have become a much more unified force and seem to be playing as they did against Aus - very cool, calm and collected.|`|vS9Y6Fgsaa	Difinetely.India are now realised about the NZ pitches and are also realised about the strength of the Kiwi team.They will make suitable preparations and will definitely bounce back|`|rjWRMDYUaa	definitely because india gonna taught them a lesson,that who are we..........<br>  we are WORLD ----CHAMPIONS......<br>  HAHAHA|`|QtdO1RlQaa	Yes they will after having tasted bitter defeat.

India is a side known for great comebacks!!! They just need some time to get used to the conditions. And C'mon India is the T20 World Champ!! They will definitely bounce back, win the game and level the T20 series!<br>  Watch out for India in the next match guys!!!|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	They can and they have to.<br>  B,McCullam and J.Oram are big hitters too.But they knew how and when they can take risk.|`|AA10976046	They will.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no
1XEUETPKaa	I personally like this move. It gives Arsenal more attacking power in their centre mid (Arshavin playing along side Fabregas once Fabregas comes back from his injury), and it takes less stress off of their strikers and wingers. Arshavin's also a great playmaker and a leader as well, leading Zenit and Russia.|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	Great PurchaseIMO get rid of some of our midfielders potentially play him as a attacking midfielder behind Ade and van Persie. Wenger has  to remember that van Persie shouldn't become the bench warmer like he did before.. really pissed me of as he is the best player on the squad!!!|`|MjPd9vyYaa	I think he is a overrated player. He is a waste of money. I don't even know why he is so well known...what has he accomplished to make him so famous. I think Arsenal are better off with out him.

This is a new record high for the Bianconeri.<br>  <br>  Roma are way behind in fourth with only €60m being spent on player wages. The Giallorossi had to break salary caps this year in order to bring in top-class players to help push their Scudetto challenge forwards.<br>  <br>  Fiorentina, Napoli and Genoa are the other movers and shakers. The Viola have seen heavy investment by the club’s owners and they are ready to make a serious challenge for the Champions League.<br>  <br>  Reports suggest that the total Serie A wage bill this season will equal €768,4m which is a €101,9m increase on last year|`|56ItcoTOaa	Ztlan Ibrahombic is the highest paid<br>  <br>  Kaka is the second highest player|`|ojHN65J0aa	zlatan ibrahimovich.|`|FbHxkey6aa	ZLATANNNN!!!!<br>  .... followed by;<br>  Kaka...

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	The KLX140 would be great to learn on, great to ride around the yard and you could even ride it on the track, you just can't do any big jumps on it and it is not suitable for racing. The CR85 is a great track bike if you are aggressive enough to ride it hard. This bike must be ridden at a very high RPM to avoid stalling and fouling plugs, it is not a great choice for riding in the yard. The CRF150R is the perfect all around bike, but is a little expensive compared to the other bikes you mentioned. If you get a new 150R you will out grow it before it needs rebuilding most likely. Just one side note, if buying a used race bike there is always the potential that something could go wrong. Buying a used trail bike like the KLX is safer but with anything used you never know what you are getting. If I were you Id go for the KLX140 if you will just do some track riding and no huge jumps. If you definitely want to start racing the CRF150R would do it all. Easy to ride, works just as well playing around as it does racing. The CR85 will not be good for just messing around. It is wide open or nothing.|`|BzctzIcgaa	I would go with a crf150r or a honda/kawasaki 150 but yea, that would be better. But as in 2 stroke vrs. 4 stroke, 4 stroke is better for racing.|`|QFCgRn5haa	Dude find a Kawasaki or a Honda  2 stroke 85 between 1991 and 1995.

Com|`|hwda98m6aa	get a 4 stroke, two strokes are more for enduro or long rides where you can open them up, if your just riding around the yard a 4 stroke would be ideal, plus you dont have to mess around with mixing the oil with the fuel|`|hl8LhZmcaa	I would suggest with your size to go with either the crf 150 or the cr 85 small wheel.|`|OvCXFpL2aa	get the cr85 big wheel while they are cheep and they are the best 85  out

I could not believe the fact that despite losing wickets so regularly India were determined to go along at 10 an over instead of building an innings (with one exception).  Dhoni should have got a more appropriate message out to the batsman.  It was not until Singh came in that an intelligent partnership was made.  Smarter batting would have seen 180 easily.

They could 've easily scored 180 or 200 odd runs!!! Falling of wickets was the major concern....I think the turning point was when Yuvi & Dhoni both got out for 1 and 2 runs respectively. They could 've easily hit some boundaries and sixes!!! Indians really didn't capitalise on the start they got with Sehwag hitting 3 sixes of the first s balls he faced! Indians should try n stay at the crease....loosing wickets at regular intervals will only slow down the scoring rate at the end! Thats wat happened today!<br>  <br>  Kiwis were great today....both with the ball & bat! McCullum & Oram partnership was a good one and Taylor was good too. Overall, Kiwis were much better than Indians today! <br>  <br>  But hey, India will bounce back! India will try & win the next match! watch out guys!!|`|mZ2Uluioaa	they underestimated NZ and Dhoni will not give it up like this. The batsmen should utilise the overs but after 12 overs , India had only 1 batsman there, they should drop guards and play proper cricket, pick and choose on shots instead of trying the clear the rugby stadiums on every ball, it is alright that boundaries are short but that doesn't mean that you hit 3 sixes and get out on next ball trying to hit another one~|`|uKLlkOPSaa	Except Suresh Raina every one of Indian Cricket team who played today failed to face / fight / play with Newzealand|`|E6YshjXzaa	In my opinion the score of 162 was not a challenging total, India loosed too many wickets early that caused them the match|`|AA10976046	1.

If i was Indian i would probably say because of the NZ's obvious racist attitude ;)|`|01I8QvrPaa	i think the main reaon to fall of wickets early, that only the main reason bcoz when innings is in 10 over five wickets are already fallen.that is the worst.they didnt help the sehwag to given that lightning strokes of sixes.india will realize soon .|`|KbzXg3hfaa	India lost before it started.<br>  <br>  I am certain that India like the Indian fans and like Australia - just plain underestimated NZ ability to play good cricket.<br>  <br>  NZ are a very decent outfit now having finally found a bit of form both offensively and defensively.|`|QayNFEd6aa	well there are many reasons, but the most important factor is :<br>  the location where the match is played.i.e.new zealand. new zealand has dry pitch,high currents, lack of sunlight,less bounce on the pitch,wide area and lack of practice in those conditions.|`|GbciNkZeaa	Most of the team members both batsman and bowler are new for the New Zealand's pitches, and they didn't get time to play any practice game there to understand the environment of New Zealand.

I used to have season tickets there.  Great atmosphere and setting.<br>  <br>  However, of all the NFL stadiums I've been in, I've always been partial to Arrowhead Stadium.  It's unique design has made it the only 1970's era football stadium that has stood the test of time.  And the way it's designed gives fans a great view of the field, no matter where you're sitting, and creates a homefield noise advantage like no other outdoor venue.  <br>  <br>  Most teams have had to tear down their old stadiums and build new ones.  Not the CHiefs.  They're renovating the stadium, and once it's finished, it will be one of the finest football venues in America.  It doesn't need the retractable roof or other super modern anemities to be great in its own right.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the gameday atmosphere at Arrowhead is second to none.|`|vnzSTerjaa	the cardinals, never been ther but it looks really nice, its like an oasis. the funnest tho is definately the chargers, great music, great weather, and a bitchin team!! ;]|`|QJz5UxLxaa	NFL says the buccaneers stadium is the best stadium of american footbal in america, but i think the giants stadium is better|`|xfJuyHoeaa	Cardinals, Washington, And the cowboys stadium looked nice even though they're currently building a new one.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Cowboys, getting new stadium.|`|n4QbLNC6aa	I would have to go with invesco field at mile high.

1XEUETPKaa	Well the Laser II's are DEFINITELY NOT light. They're actually quite heavy. I bought a pair and hated them, gave them to my brothers and got a pair of Adidas Predator Powerswerves (great boot). Otherwise, they don't give you blisters and are great for power(ful) shots.     I LOVE Vapor IV's (my orange ones wore down and now got blue ones...yes, i have 2 pairs of shoes lol). They're light and extremely smooth so then your touch and control on the ball will be great. They also are pretty sweet for free kicks and shots, because of the smoothness on the boot. They DO give you blisters however when you first wear them, and go away (for me) after about 2 or 3 weeks. You could also wear another sock on the inside or outside of your soccer sock, your choice, and buy the boot a half size larger (this WOULD depend on how thick your second sock is)      and for the Super Ligeras....are they any similar to Air Legends or AdiPures?  jw|`|0N4uVMKyaa	Ok well i got done with my first year of soccer, I made it to All-Stars as a Forward/Midfielder. I used the T-90 lasers and they were great! Here are the pros and cons of both boots.    T-90 Laser II:    Pros-    Lightweight  Accurate  Good control  No blisters ( from my experience )  Perfect feeling  Easier curving       Cons-    The boot does start to curve downwards at an angle opposite way  Wears down a lot      Vapor 4:    Pros-    More power  Good for doing tricks  Harder wear away  Accurate    Cons-    Less control  Possible blisters      My choice would be the T90 Lasers II.    Hope this helped! :)|`|oB362QAgaa	i'd get the vapors, as a foward you need to be quick and lasers are really heavy
69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	Get a digital scale. It'll run you around $20. I've used a Rapala one for years, Berkley also sells one. With a 50 pound capacity, it'll handle any fish you can lift. A buddy of mine tested his and mine (both Rapalas) against a certified scale at his job, and both were within a tenth of a pound at 35 pounds, right on at 10 pounds.    (I fish saltwater, and never had a problem with corrosion, though I've never dipped the scale in the water.)    Years ago I used a cheap luggage scale that ran under $5.00, it turned out to be a pound off at 15 pounds, and after a while it rusted up and broke. But if you don't need accuracy and fish freshwater and are on a budget, you might look for one of those.|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	This depends on the type of fishing-if its fresh water a small set of digital scales, like the rapala handheld scales will work fine, but if its saltwater, your generally going to need something with a much higher weighing capacity depending on the type of fishing e.g. big game but from the shore you might be able to use the smaller digital scales  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	boga grip|`|OKVRwX2Caa	Salter scales i feel are the most accurate, i've used them for many years weighing in at matches.
job9o5ioaa	Im not sure if its possible.   One can get knocked out in the process.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	If the opponent is prepared for it, it will likely not work without an all out football-like tackle.  The closest moves that I know are a bear hug, near knee pinch, and lateral throw.  Those are Greco-Roman wrestling moves.    A bear hug is when you have both your arms pinched tightly around his lower back.  You pull your arms in tight and low, while leaning your chest forward.  It helps if you are taller than him too.  The only problem is that if you don't adjust your weight correctly, he could salto throw you while you're taking him down.  But unless he is an experienced wrestler, that's not going to happen.  This is the most basic and most effective upper body wrestling move.    A near knee pinch is when you have a body lock, but around one of his arms as well.  You put your knee out on the same side you have his arm trapped and sag your body weight to that side.  You trip his body over your knee and he falls on his back.    A lateral throw is where you have an over-under (one arm overhooked and one arm underhooked on the other side.  Your head is on the over hook side.  You step your overhook side leg in between his legs, then step your underhook side leg around the outside of his legs, shift your weight, pop your hips, and throw him head over heels.  It is risky, but very flashy and effective if you do it right.|`|c73AAq22aa	HAHAHAHAHAH,LOL   you make me laugh   but lets get cereal   that wont work youll most likely get punched in the face|`|CAh2xCpOaa	If they're unprepared, I would imagine it could knock them down (depending on your and his size). But I can't imagine you would end up crouched over them.  More likely, you'll end up lying on top of them, which isn't so great.    Probably best to drop down and do a single or double leg tackle, then move forward with your knee onto their chest or abdomen.

qyATAaeXaa	What are you when you are not sometimes male? (LOL)<br>  <br>  MG, If I still was a shop supervisor and you walked into my store I'd be looking to put you on a higher end All-Mountain Advanced ski or or maybe even an Expert All-Mountain ski depending on how much you define "sometimes" as and where you usually ski. The Volkl Grizzly has tested very well as far as expert skis are concerned. I have not skied these, so I am going only by what I have read and feedback from others who have used them. I have tried the K2 Apache Recon. Very nice in long turns and pretty good in crud and on the groomers as well. It didn't take much to turn these puppies and they handled steep stuff pretty well. I used a 181cm but I have a few inches and pounds on you. Consider this in 167cm or even 160cm (which is as short as they come.) <br>  <br>  The Salomon X-wing 10 and the K2 Apache Sidewinder are good all-around All-Mountain Advanced options. I like the X-wings a lot.  They are good on short turns, and they plow through the junk too. Nice and snappy on the groomers, but I do remember some chatter when I was hauling butt down the hill and tried to make longer turns. Not the best in the bumps either, but aside from that they were sweet. However, the K2 Apache Sidewinder was also a sweet ride. About the same as the X-Wing when it came to long turns, but better in the crud and very easy to push through short turns as well. Again, I was using 180-ish skis. You can get by in the 160-170 range...but aim lower if possible.<br>  <br>  In spite of Richard's advocacy for 160cm skis, if you weighed 200 lbs, you shouldn't be on 160s. In this case, he was correct because of your weight, but it was a fluke.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Probably the same size as when you are not a skier, maybe a 170 cm, no shorter than a 160. If you are less aggressive than go with the shorter ski.|`|k1C70y8raa	I have been Ski Racing for 3 years and if you do not know this, the best ski racer's in the world use 165cm slalom ski's.  Obviously these ski's are made for more aggressive skiing, but the thing that many older skiiers dont realize (no offence Jim) is that the ski's now are being made with a lot more shape, and skiing is no longer structured around slide-turns, but is more so about carving.  Anything bigger than a 165 that is a fairly agressive ski will prove to be difficult to carve, unless you have lots of experience with carving.  If you plan to slide-turn then i reccomend around a 170, but if you plan to ski the way it should be done by carving, a 160 with a decent sidewall and some good shape should suit you well.
LIKkt8djaa	That's about right for an all-mountain length, I'm the same weight and an inch taller and have a 155 I use for my shorter end all-mountain deck. <br>  <br>  Since you're a beginner that will probably end up being your best starting style till you decide what specifically you're really looking to get into.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Right so a 220pound person on a size 160cm board should definitely only pick that size for a park only board, Sorry but your knowledge makes no sense. It's common knowledge in the world of snowboarding to downsize for a park specific board and upsize for backcountry oriented boards. For 15 years of riding you don't know much about the sport kid.|`|ucot94w3aa	It should be a good size for you.<br>  <br>  And Jake M is correct.|`|b384db6ad40e335e34a6b836f0c3ea3baa	If you ever see an answer from both Jake and Alvlee on the same question, take Jake's advice. Alvlee's advice might be good if this were 1997, but snowboarding technology has progressed light years since then and he seems to love to give the same advice over and over, all the while saying that everybody else is wrong. Look at all his answers, all he talks about is how everyone else is "misinformed" or the are all "rookies". Come on man, who gave you the magic key to all the so called "right" answers? So you've been snowboarding for 15 years, so have a lot of people, yet we don't all walk around thinking that we know it all.|`|TFhf5skNaa	That board and that length will be fine.  <br>  Oh, and everything Jake said is dead on. <br>  I would definitely recommend knee and elbow pads and wrist guards.

k4UKTpedaa	YES, I'm 5'11" 170. used to ski on the bombs 203cm and 200cm. With the new design of skis (hour glass or parabolic or wide) short is better. I now ski on 177cm and 182cm and thinking of getting 172cm. The ones you have will work but you will be really tried at the end of the day. Good Luck and Have Fun!|`|OrG2fBbKaa	They are quite usable for your height. These are long by current standards  but if I remember this model it is the old design with very little shape to them.  This means they do not turn as easily as a newer design ski.   Any ski with a plastic base is fun go enjoy yourself. try a demo day and learn about the latest design trends in skis.  Have fun.|`|vTf1ghlwaa	Yeah they are far to big for you sorry.<br>  <br>  If your not much of a skier then you should go something around 165 - 170 make it as easy as possible for yourself
tVZKmrz3aa	As any surfer already knows - Waves are what it is all about. Here we discover just what types of waves there are out there. One of the things that makes surfing so much of a challenge is that every wave is different. Which wave have you been surfing lately?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Types Of Surf Break<br>  <br>  <br>  The Three Main Types Of Waves<br>  <br>  Beach Break - The Beach Break is where the waves break on the sandy seabed. This type of wave is the best to start surfing on. A good example of a classic beach break is HHoosegowin Southern France which can hold perfect barrels up to 20 feet.<br>  <br>  Point Break - The SSwazi/ Reeves flick entitled Point Break was named after the type of wave! The Point Break is a wave that breaks onto a rocky point. A good example of a PPoint breakis Bells Beach in Australia (nice how this links the film and the wave together!)<br>  <br>  Reef Break - The Reef Break is a wave that breaks over a coral reef or a rock seabed. These waves are usually the classic ones that you can see on the surfing videos. These waves can be unforgiving if you happen to wipe out badly, but can be the most rewarding in their perfection. CCloud breakis a superb example of a Reef Break.<br>  <br>  NB left River mouthfrom the above sections because these can be waves that break over rocky ledges or sandy bottoms. Great waves in their own right though - a fine example is that all time classic Margaret River.|`|RZfoszJFaa	Good waves and a cool vibe.

It WILL NOT compare to the new composite sticks at the same price. period.<br>  <br>  All the companies are dropping wooden sticks and going with technology, like they always will.  Soon, good composite sticks will be cheaper and better , stronger etc than regular sticks.<br>  <br>  On the side, Jason Spezza of the Ottawa Senators used a wooden stick in his early years of the NHL.<br>  <br>  If wood sticks had Advantages companies would still make them.

5TIX6PH3aa	I would guess because it happened on CBS.  But if they have replayed the other CBS events then I would say it is because that event was marred with controversy, destroyed the working relationship between CBS (which owns Showtime) and EXC, and because it would just remind people of Seth's allegations which destroyed EXC and made CBS look dirty.  <br>  <br>  That is the event that was promoted with a main event of Ken Shamrock v Kimbo.  During the week leading up to the fight Ken asked for more money, he was declined the morning of the fight and was reportedly so angry he had a hard training session that caused a severe cut on his head which forced him to withdraw.  EXC was just going to cancel the fight but CBS said they had to have Kimbo fight or they wouldn't show the event.  <br>  <br>  Of course EXC, put Seth in the fight and he won - destroying the hype they had created around Kimbo.  Jared Shaw (an EXC VP) was shown on national tv yelling at the ref that some of Seth's punches were illegal and not to stop the fight.  To make matters even more embarrassing after the event Seth went on a radio show and said basically he was paid extra to keep it standing - which is illegal and shady to say the least.  I am sure Showtime does not want to be associated with that mess.

Taking a lot of blows to the head can affect your vision later in life. Striking a lot can lead to arthritic conditions in the hands. If you sustain back injuries, it could affect your ability to stand in once place for long periods of time. Then there is the aesthetics of how it might look to a patient to have a man work on them, who has cauliflower ears and a broken nose, which can happen to grapplers, wrestlers and strikers. My son is 16 years old. He boxes. He has only had one fight, but he trains and spars all the time, He has already suffered a broken nose and a dislocated shoulder. Of course injuries can happen in any sport. There are football players who have suffered as many concussions as fighters have. There basketball players and soccer players who suffer broken noses. Cauliflower ears are usually Limited to boxers and grapplers. Anyone who thinks you can't get these types of injuries needs to talk to some people who fight everyday at a high skill level. Athletes get injured sometimes. Good Blackbelts are supposed to be athletic|`|7u47XoUJaa	no your hands will never have a chance to hurt themselves... like anything else you haev a chance to hurt your hands. by doing jiu jitsu you increase that chance but you could also never hurt them. go for it

RjUWPz5daa	This site has a lot of rifle information. Just pick your application from the link below.|`|QrjuueMCaa	If I had to make the same decision, I would go with the .308-it is a bit more versatile, but the .30-30 is a great gun for shorter ranges and brush. Kinda depends on what you are going to ask it to do. <br>  <br>  Lock and load. Keep your powder dry.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Your Best Choice is the 308 caliber because you have a greater variety of bullet weights to choose from with it.* It will perform better and be more accurate at greater Hunting distances.* You will get more use out of it from Varmints to Big Game.* Buy a bolt action Remington or Savage Brand.* The Greatest amount of Big & Small Game is harvested within 100 yards or less.*|`|FhHIAbmLaa	I love my Wincherster 30-30.<br>  <br>  I killed some deer, and even a Moose with it. I used it for about 5 years, when I was a teen; Im now 40. It is currently honorably retired as that it is older than I; if that gun could talk.<br>  <br>  I then went to a .308, and later a 30-06. I have used other calibers, but have relied on the 30-06 for most all my game.<br>  <br>  I recently began to kill deer with a Marlin 1895 stainless .44 mag. Believe it or not, it drops deer better than the 30 cal rifles, as long as the shot is inside 100 meters; I shoot within 30 meters almost all the time.<br>  <br>  I guess I began to like the Lever guns again. They are traditional, reliable, faster than a bolt, and the ammo is now very advanced. <br>  <br>  This said, I will say that the .308 will shoot farther, and be less expensive to practice with. <br>  <br>  If you truly like a lever, as I do, then get it. A 30-30 will kill just fine. But a new .308 Marlin will shoot as well as the .308 win. Also a 338 Marlin will shoot as well, and kill as well as a 30-06, maybe a bit better due to the bigger round. <br>  <br>  Levers are cool. I use a .44 on whitetail open sights, a 45-70 on Bear, and Moose, 2x6 power scope. My 45-70 marlin makes 2 inch groups at 100 meters with 405 grain buffalo bore ammo. It crushes anything it hits.<br>  <br>  My point is that a Marlin Lever gun has been putting meat on the table since 1895. It has to be doing somthing right. I suggest a 45-70, 35 Rem, or a .308 Marlin, but a 30-30 is still a standby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|sGESw6v0aa	I would stick with the .308 because of the versatility.  Anything the 30/30 can do the .308 will do better.  Consider a compact style like a 20 inch barreled Ruger bolt.  It will be as fast in the woods and still have capabilities for open terrain.  Keep your scope power lower for woods hunting, say a quality 4 x, or a 1.5x6 variable.  <br>  Happy hunting|`|4AbXxowTaa	I'd go with a .308 bolt action.  You might want to consider the Remington 7600 pump action rifle in .30-06.  That's one of the best all around rifles.|`|4TLlrJnuaa	The 30/30 is good for deer and similar sized game out to 200 yards with a well placed shot. I personally love lever actions because of the easiness to carry and small size. The 30/30 is a good ready rifle. I have even heard of some people shooting elk at 75 yards.<br>  <br>  The .308 is going to be better all around though, because it is quite a bit more powerful. With that it will kick a lot more. the .308 will take deer out to 400 yards and elk at probably 250 to 300 yards. (This really depends on shot placement) <br>  <br>  Another gun to look at is the 308 Marlin Express. It is going to give you the best of both worlds. It is a lever action, fairly light, and shorter. But it also shoots very similar to the .308 Winchester. Just something to think about.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	If the price doesn't deter you, have your cake and eat it too.

Oh, yeah, the price.  Maybe you could say it's birthday and Christmas for a couple-three years.  Already used that one?  You could argue it's actually cheaper than buying a Win AND a Rem--like a two-fer!<br>  <br>  (take-down link is just for fun)|`|h8cCcQG1aa	I think you'll be happy with the 308 bolt action...I have a remington and I hunt every year with it...using 168gr winchester supreme ammunition...for white tail,bear,and moose...I always trust the Bolt action to any model  (lever,semi,pump..etc) with in 250 yards you should consider going with the 308... ENJOY<br>  <br>  Guy|`|7UbfExoKaa	What kind of shooting are you planning on doing? Deer hunting?<br>  <br>  The .30/30 is best suited for medium sized game at reasonably close ranges (up to 100 yards), whereas the .308 can be used on larger game, and at longer ranges (remember to never take a shot at ranges where you can't be certain of hitting where you're aiming).|`|CFQbdDRNaa	the 308 is a better long range gun and the 30-30 is a fast close range gun...|`|F8Ac1pPNaa	You'd probably find this site on rifles helpful.|`|YdOfpXkoaa	308|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	308

b2qdwABVaa	Assuming you have 2 and a half months off (10 weeks)<br>  <br>  First 6 weeks:<br>  Hit the weight room.<br>  This is where you work on the explosive first step, vertical leap, and stronger core, by doing squats at the gym. Yes, squats. Do them properly and it'll be the best exercise you ever did.<br>  <br>  Next 2 weeks:<br>  Conditioning<br>  Running, running, and more running. Think Richard Hamilton, or Ray Allen. They run a lot off screens for jump shots. If you want to be able to tire everyone out, get your stamina up, and guys will have a hard time keeping up with you in the game.<br>  <br>  Final 2 weeks:<br>  Work on the jump shot and ball handling. Don't forget the basic fundamentals. Do the simple drills and just relax and be ready.|`|HiuNSScLaa	use legs not to much its all in the wrist index and middle finger are last to touch the ball|`|tT1AssMVaa	Well i don't know about everything here but as for shooting a couple feet behind 3 pt line withOUT jumping, probably not smart. Your gonna want to jump on any shot... whether it be a few feet behind 3 pt line or 3 ft in front of free throw line =)<br>  <br>  But anyways. For improving your Vertical, there's an exercise program thing called 'Air Alert' it costs about 30$, but it will definitely increase your vertical by a noticeable amount (From about 8" - 14"). It a bit of work, so you would have to be dedicated.

hRsxiCU0aa	Yeah i remember the same question I  had no idea either until I read about it. A DIRECT free kick can only go toward the goal and if it happens to be an own goal then the goal doesn't count and the team gets a corner kick. BUT if its an INDIRECT free kick it is not allowed to go toward the goal but if it takes a deflection like an own goal it does count. <br>  <br>  P.S. You can read about it if you want at this website   <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsof...</a>|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	Here's the deal: A free kick, or penalty kick is what you're talking about right? This is a set play, and no players are allowed to be in the box except the goalie, and the kicker. So that rule is in place in case the ball bounces off the post or something and rolls into the kicker's own goal. <br>  <br>  If you think about it, don't both teams pretty much crowd around at that one goal and wait for the kick? The goalie wants to watch too, or else goalie is left all alone at the other goal. I hope I'm on the right track here. Later.

gfxXikenaa	since TNA has now lost Christian ,petey willaims and sonjay dutt .i have no more interest left in it.<br>  <br>  WWE is certainly getting better|`|JDuEuPM4aa	Watching RAW lately has actually been pleasent ... usually I won't even bother watching it, I'll tape it and forward to the things that make sense most and the feuds with the most potential but lately it's been awesome ... Having smackdown and RAW superstars on there also seems to help it as well as a bit of comedy whenever Edge has the mic and then you got this HHH/Orton feud heating up which takes me back to the attitude era a lot.<br>  <br>  RAW has been getting very strong ratings the last 2 weeks and Smackdown is basically single-handedly keeping MynetworkTV interesting so if the feuds keep up to par with the weeks and the ratings then I think the next few months at least should be an awesome time for the WWE.|`|RskPXtibaa	i will say it depends if wwe do well then it will be good<br>  but compared to last year this year is much entertaing|`|rs7fuvPxaa	based on the shows and PPVs this year I reckon we're in for a very good year.|`|JhdhXrdraa	the last few episodes of raw and smakcdown have certainly been a lot better and no way out actually included blood 4 a change. The reason for the downfall was the PG rating of the show. WWE will hopefully get better and back 2 somewhat how it was in the future|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	It depends if its certain company's you’re talking about or wrestling in general, ratings don't always mean a good show after all so I’ll give you my views on company's and then a general overview.<br>  <br>  WWE<br>  <br>  Right now the WWE is in the middle of building for a good era but they keep making mistakes which are hurting this, unpredictability is one thing but the two major titles have changed what 9 times since last September and that is too much. The wrestling is better, promos for the most part more mature and it is becoming more of a wrestling show than it was before. Looks good but booking will decide how it goes.<br>  <br>  TNA<br>  <br>  Personal I hate the low brow, cheap attitude era rip off TNA is slowly becoming. They use to be the wrestling show and we still get flashes of this but between a lot of talking and swearing which isn't good for the roster. Talent needs to be used right, the attitude era worked because they had better talkers who were not great wrestlers but TNA is the reverse. Things will get worse for TNA if they do not address the booking problems they are having more and more.<br>  <br>  ROH<br>  <br>  ROH all depends on how they make the move onto TV and how they approach that change without losing the identity that they have been building since they started. They handled a booker change well and are still delivering but the move to TV is the biggest thing for their future right now.<br>  <br>  Overview <br>  <br>  Since I’m guessing this is an American wrestling question I won't go into Japan or Mexico's promotions. With the variety in wresting promotions around the world I don't thing wrestling is ever going to have a bad era, it just depends where you look for the wrestling you most want to see. There is wrestling outside of the WWE and a lot of it is much better than what the WWE does, if only the WWE brainwashing didn't work.|`|NRs72Afxaa	The reason why Wwe is getting good is because their hyping up WM25. That's the reason why their getting good. If they their doing the same after WM then maybe Wwe is taking a turn. <br>  <br>  Tna last scored a 1.3 which is good for them, but I agree with La Parka. Their trying to be another Attitude Era.  It didn't work with Wcw what makes you think it'll work for them. The reason why the Attitude era worked for Tna before because they had the right talent. Sabu, New Jack, Sandman, Justin Credible, and Jerry Lynn while you had young wrestlers like Ron Killings and Aj Styles who were not afraid of getting a boo boo.  I've been hearing reports that Dixie Carter is kind of getting fed up the booking and might be taking some actions. So lets pray something is done.<br>  <br>  I have not watched Roh but I believe that have lots of potential. Can't wait till they debut on tv.<br>  <br>  I think 2009 will be a good year.
UoXpxxagaa	ok. your muscles will get stronger when you work them out. It depends on how much of a work out you give them. I would work them out hard and let them rest the next day before doing it again. <br>  your work outs should consit of bench press, dumbbell flys, push ups, and overall upperbody exercises. <br>  you bascially have to do reasearch and get on a workout program to improve overall strengh. not as hard as it seems. <br>  just get on a program.<br>  <br>  to just answer your question. do not do it every day. rest a day. you should do as many push ups as you can or close to it (for example 20). rest 1 min. then do another set of 20. keep that up for about 3 or 4 sets. you should be hurting and unable to continue. that is when you are done with that muscle. rest up the next day, then keep at it.<br>  <br>  if you want to get stronger and have better results, you should do more then just workout your pecs however.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	You should train, like doing arm exercises like picking up weights and increasing the weight a bit at a time. To make your legs stronger, you should run! I do soccer training and our coach trains us really hard. I have found that I have actually gotten fitter and stronger.

It's more technique and style. Now, you can't have a powerful punch without both. It's also not good to be too muscle bound. In order to get technique down, you need to get a trainer. If you want to increase your punching power, you need to work out. It's a lot of work.<br>  <br>  I knew a friend who was a boxer. He showed me a little bit. The thing people do wrong is they don't use their body weight during the punch. The body weight must go with the punch. You must learn to shift your body weight in the direction with the punch. Instead of one arm, the whole body moves with the punch and makes a more powerful punch. It's also foot work. You have to learn foot work.<br>  <br>  Once in awhile, a person will have a natural ability to create powerful punches. Mike Tyson was one of those. He grew up on the street. It's a rarity, but it can happen - much like some people are natural A-class chess players. Sometimes, a person just has the punch. Ali was like that, too.

To build accuracy you simply practice putting your hand on the bag in the same place, very slowly in the same position until you can gradually pick up the pace without errors. You will develop muscle memory this way. Dumbbells are great! Number of sets/reps will depend upon age. Assuming you are over 14 you should be ok with working your way up to 3 - 5 sets of 10 reps, reps being how many times you lift or push the weight and sets are how many times you stop and start reps.

Every year the rumble winner gets on the mic and officially makes their pick.  <br>  <br>  We have 5 weeks left til Mania and I personally think that WWE will pull the trigger early on a HHH vs. Orton match and Edge vs. Cena.<br>  <br>  It will be a Monday Night Raw or a Saturday Night's Main Event.<br>  <br>  HHH will retain and so will Edge but Orton still has his pick of which championship he wants and it will turn out to be a fatal-4 way match at Wrestlemania.|`|tPFikOY7aa	I'm sorry but if uve been watching the show u would no him v triple h is a certainty. The wwe will never go back to undisputed belts at any level. Had miz and morrison won the wwe tag titles from carlito and primo then maybe u may be going somewhere but it appears undisputed championship will never happen again.|`|rs7fuvPxaa	its trips vs orton obiviously, its ganna be the mcmahons and trips vs the legacy rivalry|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	He has until Wrestle Mania to make his choice he doesn't have to make at soon as Rumble is over.  He can even make it just before a match starts.|`|srP47FC7aa	OBVIOUSLY he's going to go for the WWE Title.|`|52luRGoVaa	he's gonna' go after whomever is on raw.|`|gfxXikenaa	i think he will take on HHH .|`|VQlrQ34Faa	It looks like Randy has already made his choice. He's going to face Triple H for the WWE title to end the feud. Smackdown can't have two titles. Look what happened last year after the draft when RAW had all three main titles. Only the WWE title stayed on RAW.

Effigy burning has never happened in Mumbai: <br>  This match doesn't have much significance for such drastic steps.
