RZzMse3Haa	You knew you guys owed rent. This was no secret.  You should have known they would take some action to collect.  As far as it going straight to collections:  That is not the right way to do things.  They need to prove that they tried to contact you first for this to be legal.  They CANNOT freeze your ss#. There is no such thing!  They can get a garnishment on you though. As the only one on the lease, you credit will be hurt.  There is no way around that.<br>  <br>  They can only collect from the people on the lease. Since those other people were not on the lease, they do not have their ss#, so they cannot file anything against them.  This is another reason it is important to have all tenants on the lease.  <br>  <br>  You would need to sue the other tenants in small claims court to get their portion back from them.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Never heard of freezing social security numbers. I don't think such a thing exist. You still have a problem, as the only one responsible for rent are the ones that signed the lease|`|y1W3Y0J1aa	You can freeze your own credit report.  But, they are making idle threats because you are young and they feel like you  will go for it.<br>  <br>  This is a life lesson.  Don't let anyone move in with you without going to proper legal channels.  Never marry a man that you have not looked at a current credit report, criminal background check, checked the IRS debtor master file and talked to his last wife or girlfriend and a distant family member.  <br>  <br>  This is a lesson that God sent to you designed to make you grow up!|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	The people who signed the lease are the ones legally required to pay. If your two new friends didn't sign, you are the one who will have to pay it all when the management takes you to court to collect.<br>  <br>  Freezing your SSN????  I have never heard of that. Sounds like an unscrupulous bill collector trying to scare you.   They can make a bad entry on your credit and obtain a judgment and garnish your wages, but that is all.

A surgeon is good, but you're talking at least 10years, and you need to be very good at medicine which is tough to get into.

AA11562326	Most likely, the options cost you nothing.  What the company is saying is that at a later time, you are allowed to buy a certain number of shares of the company at 4/$1.  If, at that time, the stock is $5, then you can turn right around and sell it on the open market, and make money.  On the other hand, if the stock is 0.24, then your options are worthless.<br>  <br>  How much the option is worth depends on the total number of shares issued.  If there are 10,000 shares outstanding, and you are allowed to buy 100, then that's 1% of the company.  Pretty good, if it turns out to be the next Microsoft or Google.  If there are 50 million shares, then that's not much.<br>  <br>  An initial public offering of a stock is typically at $5 or more.  Are you VERY SURE that the company is going public this year?  These are hard times, and a startup has to be doing well to go public.  Personally, I would be very surprised to see a new solar company go public in the coming year.<br>  <br>  If I actually had to pay money to buy the options, now, I would be doubly suspicious of whether the company is actually going public.

You must report the full $700, but you pay taxes on ONLY $35.<br>  <br>  If you file a paper return, you attach Schedule D and enter $700 in the column for proceeds, $665 in the column for basis, and $35 in the column for gain.  You are taxed only on the gain, but must complete all 3 columns.  <br>  <br>  If you file an electronic return, the tax is the same, but the software may use slightly different names for the same things.<br>  <br>  However, if you do NOT file at all, then the IRS may assume that basis was $0 and tax you on the full $700.  This is why YOU must report the $665 basis to avoid being taxed on more than just the $35 gain.

They are ignored until you have 7.5% of your gross income used for medical, and then after that they add to your itemized deductions.

Basically, like hosting a "bullentin board" for business owners to list their own material, since sales and promotions can change in a moment depending on business and trends.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.

1hciyvKdaa	I have bought there, Ive got all that I paid for, but one seller took three months to get the dvds to me. Its up to you ioffer doesnt help, monitor or anything its just a connection online, the most they do is provide feedback and a way to communicate. Since they are the only ones I can get dvds that I want, I take the chance. Ive bought I think 5 things from there and lucked out, my purcases were mosting from AU and Cananda. I use the ones who take pay pal only, I am not giving my credit card to anyone else, so I have had to ask people to start up a pay pal account and I have them add a dollar for their time to do it.|`|d7l1ssCcaa	iOffer is a very safe site, I've been using it for almost a year now, both buying and selling.<br>  <br>  For buying, like any other site, you just have to be very careful about your sellers. Make sure they're legit, have good feedback ratings. Check on their past transactions and selling history. Use safe payment methods and never trust bank wire services and western union and things like that.<br>  <br>  Know what you're getting and read the descriptions carefully. Read the fine prints of each item if there's any. There are fraud items like all the other sites out there, so just make sure you know what you're getting. Ask as many questions as it takes.<br>  <br>  Follow those things and you should have a fabulous time with iOffer! Hope that helps!

If insulated when wet it is no longer good, if drywall will have to be replaced, ceilings can be damaged and the funny thing about water damage is it can and will go anywhere (path of least resistance)|`|7HKTDcvYaa	The building can have rot from top to bottom. The roof can be the least of your problems.<br>  <br>  Repairing a roof that is leaking may be feasible, but it may require a complete re-roof, it may require replacement of a few sections of sheathing below the roofing, or many. Water tends to travel along surfaces and to rot out wood wherever it goes.<br>  <br>  I replaced my roof with steel, about 2000 sq ft, for a cost of $4030, but by doing the work myself. The original roof had not leaked,so my deck did not require repair, nor any of the structure below.|`|oojO4WAraa	Definitely offer way less than the asking price or ask the seller to repair the roof.

Roof leaks are potentially very expensive to repair, based on how badly it leaks, and how long it has been leaking for... How much damage is done in the attic? Ceilings? A new roof will  probably cost you at least $10-$15 GRAND. If it's truly a historic house, it may have a slate roof, which is ridiculously expensive to repair & replace.<br>  What is the current value of the house? In 2009 dollars that is... What has sold RECENTLY in the area & for how much? ( called Comprables or comps)<br>  You said the previous owners trashed it? Did they trash plaster walls? Those are soooo expensive to have fixed professionally. Did they do anything to the heating system? Water pipes? You soo need to get a home inspection done ASAP, BEFORE you buy it. <br>  Yes the home can qualify for fha loan, but you prolly have to prove to the historical Charter in your town that you can restore the home to it's former glory. gl!|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	MIA .... You should have a home inspector and a contractor  do thorough inspections of the entire house and give estimates of how much it would cost to fix all problems the house might have(   make sure they are licensed of course!). Also use zillow.com movoto.com and realtor.com to check recent sales , future trends and area demographics, the local police department is a good source for crime info, and this can usually be narrowed down to the exact neighborhood by finding the census tract number for that address. Also check for any encumbrances the house might have(city hall) and environmental issues like radon gas or lead paint(houses built in 1978 or earlier might have lead paint) hope this helps.|`|5dawOJcpaa	i think it will cost 20 thousand $ if you dont have enough money then just go to a group of gangsters and buy a gun from them and a knife then if you see someone then rob him/her if its not enough just go to the bank and the rob it. dont worry the police will not imprison you or kill you because you and the police can share the money dont worry!! its just a little amount cause after you rob the bank i think you can get atleast 20 million $ thats just the least you can get. cause you cant rob all their money cause you cant afford to fix your house then how can you afford to buy a vehicle to put the money in.|`|HtpRBMFraa	You can check the Property condition disclosure. Also you can offer any amount you want but try to be reasonable, you can expect a counter offer. I would also have the sale contingent upon passing an inspection which is usually required by the lender. Then have the estimate done and knock that amount off of you offer.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	If it's so old that it doesn't have closets and updated electrical then it will not qualify.  I'm not sure of the cost of the roof but if it's been leaking a long time it could have rotted the floor underneath too.|`|MczmTftTaa	It should be between 5 and 15 thousand dollars or you could get a bid on it by a contractor and use it as leverage to get your price.|`|RTgMgT6baa	Depends on if there's any structural damage,mold.|`|IeLBIACaaa	if you just need to re shingle your room it could be $1000.

This would include a right to appeal the decision, right to be accompanied to a disciplinary meeting by a colleague, a list of behaviours that are regarded as Gross Misconduct etc. <br>  <br>  If he wants to make someone redundant again there are legal procedures which must be followed, he must consult with his employees, discuss the criteria to be used for selecting those to be made redundant etc. Even if he decided to use previous disciplinary records for the basis of his decision he would still be required to abide by the disciplinary procedure I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  If you did resign you can make a claim for constructive dismissal this is where you are in effect forced to resign/leave your job due to your employers unfair treatment.<br>  <br>  Contact Acas for more detailed info on what I have outlined, I wouldn't at this stage contact a lawyer speak with Acas first they are free and are able to offer expert advice.

You easily have grounds for a wrongful dismissal suit. <br>  <br>  Although I am not a lawyer, I have had my share of difficult employers and learned a few things. It is *ILLEGAL* for force someone to resign. What your boss did is a classic case of professional harassment. He told you to resign or be fired. You can't do that, not legally that is. Probably what he is trying to do is lay off a worker, you, and not have to pay any severance. This saves the compnay money. That's why what he did is illegal. Companies must pay laid off workers severance, regardless of the economic situation. <br>  <br>  He's just using the dispute the collegue as a lame excuse to scare you into quitting. Don't give in. Contact a lawyer immediately. You have rights!! Also, employers will still give you a decent reference simply under the threat of legal action.

You're money is tied up and the interest rates really are not good. Open an online savings like I have ING Direct- they pay the same as CD's but you can get your money any time without penalty. Sucks though with the ecomony- when i opened my ING account 4 years ago it was paying 4.5% and now it's down to like 2%, but it's still a great place to keep your money and be able to use it if you need to. you never know what could happen that you might need some of the money for.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If the investor community loses its appetite for bonds and CDs we could see a major increase in longer term interest rates.

Inevitably, they will go up. In fact, you would be locking it in for 5 years at probably the lowest rate they are offering in about 30 years.  So don't do it.<br>  <br>  If you want a better return, try investing some money in shorter term deposits, and investing the rest of your money in other asset classes, like a mutual fund or directly in shares.  Speak to a financial planner.  They will be able to give you better advice that is more suited to your needs.  <br>  <br>  However, putting your money in a 5 year cd now would be financially foolhardy, I'm afraid.|`|3eEddbreaa	Hmmm, everyone seems to know where interest rates are headed.  For those who think CDs are a poor investment, look back 2 years and tell me unless you were shorting the stock market that a 3 year CD or 4 year CD or even a 5 year CD was not a great investment decision.  Two years ago 4% and 5% were common CD rates, most other investments in that time are measurably in the negative return category.  Now, I would certainly consider the fact that rates may rise in the coming years due to higher inflation levels ( the foreign buyer scare raised its head frequently when Japan was the largest buyer of U.S debt, a fear that never materialized ) because the U.S governemnt is going to flood the market with debt in the coming two years.  Now the Fed chairman, Bernanke, testified Wednesday that he does not expect inflation rates to be a concern in the next 2 years.  So...a mid term CD sounds like a wise choice or a CD ladder that places funds in different maturities. Midterm CDs are between 1 to 2 years in length.

You'll get a good chunk (probably over 30%) back as a deduction, and it keeps your RRSP maxed out, always a good move.<br>  <br>  I don't see any reason to use an RRSP loan, unless you're worried about having cash on hand.  It's just interest paid to no benefit.|`|y7Mwptsraa	If you have the money, it would be better to pay the cash directly into your RRSP rather than taking out a loan. You would have to pay the interest on the loan, and that interest payment is neither tax deductible, nor recoverable in any way.
AA11284831	You'd pay about 5 cents more on the 250,001st dollar than you do right now.  The tax increase simply restores the top bracket rate of 39.6% instituted during the Reagan administration.  Assuming no increase on the first $250k, the next dollar would be taxed at 40￠ vs 35￠ under the current rate structure.  If you gross $250k and pay $50k in mortgage interest, your taxable income would be well below $250k and therefore there would be no increase in tax.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	We will all end up paying more.

laVGEEeraa	Go to the County website.  Google (Dakota for example) County Property Tax.  There should be a spot on the website where you can type in the address (or house number in the case of Dakota County) and locate the property's tax statement for last year (Minnesota Counties are preparing the current year's statements so you may not be able to get this information, so try for the Details or Tax Stub).  This may have the bank listed or even the previous owner's name, but usually any back taxes are listed there.<br>  <br>  In Minnesota, as is alluded to by another, back taxes and other outstanding debts on a property are paid by the selling bank.  The bank tends to have to pay these at the time of foreclosure, otherwise the city or county has the right to sell the property directly themselves with no recourse for the bank or other mortgage holders.|`|AA11206283	Tax assessor's office can give you the tax status by owner or address|`|AA11173563	when you buy any back taxes will be paid so you can get a proper deed recorded.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	If the property is an REO the selling bank will have paid all of the back taxes and liens on the property.

And I'll tell you why.  Collectibles from comic books, to baseball cards, to coins are very very hard to sell.  Businesses that will sell you a Collectible will only buy it back from you at 20%-40% of the price you bought it.  Selling them is how they make a profit.  So the only way to get top dollar is to sell it to consumers.  People on EBAY who would otherwise but it from a shop, will buy it from you instead, and you make the price the shop would get (well a little less because its ebay, but way more than you could seel it to a shop).<br>  <br>  On ebay look at what similar pieces sell for.  I'd spend some time doing this, get a feel for the market.  Then list the item, possibly with a reserve.|`|AWSmknxLaa	ebay

So you pay your deductable and they either fix or write-off your car. Unless you car is worth less than $500 ( or close to $700 maybe even) then it's worth it to pay for the deductable and take the fee for higher insurance premiums (which will cost a bit more if you claim this accident). you may also be charged with a ticket for imprident/careless/or reckless driving which costs points against your license.<br>  to start go to Google and look-up your car make and model (found on your registration papers) assess the condition and try find a value for your car. Weigh that against the decuctable and decide if you want to claim it still or not. <br>  last piece of advice, if they do write it off make sure you do this homework and print off ads, as the insurance company will try to pay as little for it as possible!|`|9k4d7Kytaa	Some of these other posters are giving you bad information.  You never have to pay another person's deductible, your liability would pay for damage to the other car, and it's first dollar coverage.  It may or may not have been advisable for you to pay to have collision coverage based upon the age and value of your vehicle, but that decision is your to make.  The most important factor is not the age of the vehicle, but your ability to pay for repairs or replacement after an accident.  If you can't afford to buy another 1999 Honda Civic if yours gets wrecked or stolen, buy the coverage...some people don't understand that concept, but it truly is that simple.<br>  <br>  Now...normally speaking, you would pay your $500 deductible and the insurance company would pay the remaining $1,150 to fix your car.  If the vehicle isn't worth more than about $2,000, they would total the vehicle and give you a check for the actual value of the vehicle, minus your deductible.  However, I believe that you stated that your Civic already has a salvaged title.  Because of this, the vehicle will be considered far less valuable than a standard 1999 Honda Civic and it makes it nearly impossible to tell you what the company will do.  You'll have to contact your claims department and ask them how they will proceed.  Don't be afraid to ask them that question, it's their job.  If you don't like the info they give you, call your agent and see if they can intervene on your behalf.<br>  <br>  To be honest, if your vehicle does have a salvaged title, I can't imagine that the insurance company will value the vehicle at over $1,000, so I would guess that the best case scenario is that you get $500 and your rates go up due to an at-fault accident.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I hope you get more money for your vehicle than that, but the fact of the matter is that vehicles with salvaged titles aren't worth much.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If the other car "ran off", why did you tell anyone that you had a yellow light or that the other car had the right to go?<br>  <br>  They will either pay $1150 ($1650 minus $500) or declare the car totalled and pay you its value (which will be low, because it is a salvage vehicle) minus $500.|`|kifwyOgKaa	Depends on if the car is worth more than the estimated damages.  If not, they will probably total out your car....assuming you have full coverage, you will receive a check for your car's worth.

If you are good with numbers and navigating the IRS forms, then you can try one of the tax software packages so they will run about $40 - $60. But some people just don't like to even think of numbers so one of the chains (JH or HR, etc) could help you out. Depending on how complicated your return is, you could be charged $300 or more and people usually say the service is hit-or-miss. You may get a really good tax professional who has been working there for years or you may get someone who just took one of their "quick study" courses and is doing taxes to earn a few bucks. Either way, the company will stand by the return.<br>  <br>  You can also hire a CPA - there are many CPA’s online that you can use. Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.  In fact, the one I use (linked below) each year only charges around $50 for my return – it’s really a great deals compared to the other guys.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Depends upon the complexity of your return.

Most people think that Financial Advisors are either expensive or only for the rich. Not true. Many Banks have FAs that will help you for free. They do make a commission, but the decision is yours to make.<br>  <br>  When speaking to a good FA be honest with them and let them know where your comfort levels are. The two keys they are looking for is length of time for the investment and how much risk you are willing to take. If you are looking for something safe then they will tell you what would be good options, but if you are looking for a high return over a long period of time then they will advise you there as well.<br>  <br>  Most FAs work with Stocks, Mutual Funds, Bonds, Bond Funds, Treasury Notes, Annuities, and even broker CD's. Their are a number of products out their that are FDIC insured that you may not have thought of. Most people think it is just CDs and Savings accounts, but that is not true. There are some Treasury Notes out there that are set up to be FDIC insured. You will also find a number of products out there that are tax free. Green Bonds and Municipal bonds being some of them. <br>  <br>  Todays Market is not the best, but being that so many stocks have hit rock bottom, and these on companies that are very profitable, it can make for a killing on Stocks, but then you are risking everything. You can do Mutual Funds for a little better spread and therefore a bit more security. Bond Funds are similar in that it has less risk involved then just one Bond. These are all great things to talk about. <br>  <br>  If you want no Risk then look to FDIC insured products. These can average as much as 5% interest, but you will find more at around 4% these days.<br>  <br>  Now when speaking to a Financial Advisor find one that you are comfortable with. You do not want a Product pusher or someone acting like they are sort of wasting their time. Now their time is valuable so mentioning that you are looking to invest 25k right out the gate could help. Banks don't usually see 21 year olds with 25k so they may dismiss out of hand if this is not mentioned. Granted you would not be dismissed by someone with good Customer Service, but many times they got there on their ability to perform well for their clients. Not their Customer Service skills. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck!|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Right now, get a house and rent it out.  Foreclosures are at a all time high, and you can get a sweet interest rate on a loan, and the 25K, is good for a 10% down payment on a 250K house.  Once we get out of the recession, you could flip that house for probably double the value.  And to make the mortgage payments, you can rent it out.  Only drawback, you are a landlord then.

This will tell you how much you can afford, will tell the agent that you are serious and you won't be heartbroken when you find out the house you had your heart set on is not in your price range.  Believe me when I say this is such an important step for the first time homeowner. Some Realtors and agents work with lenders and get a kick back which is a moral issue and illegal so be aware of this.  Also there is a difference between being pre-qualified and pre-approved.  The difference being qualify is you've spoken to a loan originator and gave them basic information that is only the first step in getting a loan. Pre-approval means the information was given to a processor,checked against requirements for that day (changes are daily) and sent back to the originator for more information from you. That is how they come up with the basic amount,rate and down payment that you may need.|`|AA11173563	ask any question you want as the realtor works for you unless it is a property the this same realtor has listed and there is dual agency allowed in your state.

Then, when you visit a real estate agent, you can guide said person as to the price range in which you qualify to purchase.<br>  <br>  An added recommendation.

Don't sign an agreement with the first real estate agent you speak with.<br>  <br>  In order to find out the type of loan programs you are qualified for you will have to fill out a loan application, with a mortgage broker, which you can find one in your local telephone book. <br>  <br>  Make sure this mortgage broker or mortgage banker is able to do government loans such as FHA and VA loans if you qualify for one.<br>  <br>  He will fill out this application, which takes awhile so grab your favorite beverage and sit down. Once you have completed the application, he will run your credit report which will have your credit scores.  These credit scores will determine your interest rate.<br>  <br>  The amount of your monthly debt payments you are required to pay as per your credit report and the amount of mortgage you can take on based on your income will determine the amount of house you will be able to purchase.<br>  <br>  When you speak with the mortgage broker you will need the following documents to complete the loan application, there will be others, but this will get you started.<br>  <br>  #1 One month of pay stubs for each person that will be on the mortgage.<br>  <br>  #2 Six months  bank statements from each bank in which you bank as well as statements from any 401K from you place of employment.<br>  <br>  #3 Two years of federal income tax along with the W-2 that match.<br>  <br>  Once he has all that he need to do he can then issue you a pre-approval letter so you can purchase a home. In this pre-approval letter will be the amount of house you are qualified to purchased. <br>  <br>  Once he gives you this pre-approval you may now find a real estate agent to find yourself a home or he might have a referral.<br>  <br>  Now make sure before you get your pre-approval you and your mortgage broker go over all your options as to the mortgage programs you qualify for, the interest rate, monthly payments. <br>  <br>  If you are getting a FHA, fixed rate, two loans to eliminate PMI like an 80/20 or one loan, if you are qualified for and approved for a 100% loan.<br>  <br>  You should select the loan that best suit your financial condition at the time. That could be an adjustable rate loan. It could be a fixed rate loan for 5 or 10 years and then adjust. Some adjustable rate mortgages only adjust once.<br>  <br>  Make sure your mortgage broker explain all your options so you may make an intelligent decision.<br>  <br>  What might be good for one person might not be good for you, in other words just because your friends and all your real estate buddies are telling you about the great fixed rate they got, your financial situation might call for something else.<br>  <br>  So select the best option for you and your financial situation.<br>   <br>  You should also get a Good  Faith Estimate (GFE) which will indicate the cost you will have to pay for getting this loan. It will also indicate the amount of your down payment.<br>   <br>  Once you have found a home the real estate agent will then prepare a contract for you and the seller to sign.<br>  <br>  Your mortgage broker will now order an appraisal to show proof of  the property value.<br>  <br>  The mortgage broker might ask for additional information or documentation, don't get all up tight this is normal, just supply the information or find the documents needed.<br>  <br>  After the appraisal has been completed you will be called by your mortgage broker to sign your loan docs so you can take possession of your new home.<br>  <br>  Before signing any loan docs make sure they say exactly what you and your mortgage broker went over when you decided on what mortgage program was best for you.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"

5BTKscZraa	Credit Counselor can mean several different things, there's:<br>  <br>  1) Debt consolidation loans, where you consolidate all your credit card debt into one loan. You have to be very careful with this method...once your credit cards are paid off by the loan it's simply too tempting to start using all that available credit again, and you soon end up with twice as much debt as when you started. If you do this, cut up your cards after they are paid off to avoid this temptation<br>  <br>  2) Debt settlement....a risky tactic where you pay a monthly fee to a debt consolidator....this entire fee goes towards building a settlement account and to the consolidator's fees. Your credit card companies will deliberately not be paid so that all the accounts will default/charge-off so that they can attempt settlements at around 50%. If you are current on your accounts, this process will ruin your credit rating for sure. Debt settlement is like a roll of the dice with your finances...you can never predict how your creditors will respond to the deliberate defaulting of your accounts...they might settle at 50%...or they might serve you a summons, take you to court...and if they win, you could be looking at wage garnishment.<br>  <br>  3) Entering a Debt Management Plan (DMP) with a non-profit credit counselor like CCCS (Consumer Credit Counseling Services).  They can negotiate lower payments and interest rates. They do not negotiate settlements.<br>  <br>  They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.<br>  <br>  Contact your local Red Cross for a referral.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	Check here for a NFCC member near your:  <a href="http://www.nfcc.org/." rel="nofollow">http://www.nfcc.org/.</a>  These are legit, non-profit companies.

8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	You can talk to me for free.  I'm not a credit counselor, but I've been where you are and it's not as difficult as you think.  <br>  <br>  Cut up your credit cards.  Pay off the smallest one first.  If you feel like you need to have an emergency credit card, get a secured card.  They work the same as an unsecured credit card, they help raise your credit score, and if you ever got into financial trouble, the money is already in the bank to pay it off.<br>  <br>  Credit accumulates every 30 days.  If you must buy something on credit -- and query if you really have to.  Do you REALLY need that thing, and can you REALLY NOT pay cash for it -- make sure you pay that bill within 30 days so they cannot charge you interest.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, credit payments are not "late" until they are 30 days LATE.  So if your bill is due on, say, the 30th of January, as long as you pay it by February 28th, you are not "late" and it will not hit your credit report.  <br>  <br>  Start using cash instead of credit cards.  This is critical.  You cannot overspend cash.  You cannot miscount cash.  Cash does not bounce.  Cash does not charge you interest.  You are essentially paying $100 for something that only costs $75, and for what?  So you can have it now instead of two weeks from now?<br>  <br>  You do not need to pay someone to tell you how to get out of debt.   Use the smarts that God gave you and do it yourself:  <br>  <br>  Let's say you have five credit cards and they're all maxed out.  Their limits are $500 to $5000.  Call up the $500 credit card first and make what's called an offering compromise.  I can pay you $300 now if you will cancel the rest of the debt.  Believe me, in this economy, they're happy to do it.  Now you've got one paid off credit card, which is good, and you've got more money to put to the next one, which is better.   If you have to skip one payment of another card to achieve this, it's a small price to pay to get out of debt.   Keep doing that until all your cards are paid off.  Try to save your credit card for things like auto repairs and things that cost huge outlays of money.  Buy things like clothes and dry cleaning and groceries with cash.  <br>  <br>  In short, you can do it.  If you do it yourself, you have accomplished something that most people never will.  You will have learned something that you can pass on to help others, and you will never be in debt again.|`|AA10667393	Check out the list of US Trustee approved debt counseling agencies.

YeN1jJKtaa	A mortgage loan is a loan secured by real property through the use of a note which evidences the existence of the loan and the encumbrance of that realty through the granting of a mortgage which secures the loan. However, the word mortgage alone, in everyday usage, is most often used to mean mortgage loan.<br>  <br>  A home buyer or builder can obtain financing (a loan) either to purchase or secure against the property from a financial institution, such as a bank, either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably.|`|AA11173563	relax you will learn every thing there is to know over time ask lots of questions every day as that is your best way of learning what to do|`|AA10979361	Yea, don't worry too much about it. <br>  When you are in training, just remember the things your trainers say, sit in at every closing you can & pay attention to all the unique situations that arise in each one. <br>  Get yourself  a professional notepad & keep lots & lots of notes so you can refer back to them often.  <br>  <br>  Just relax!

These are very effective tasks, but they are time consuming too. That's good if you are performing these tasks yourself if (I can't do these myself lol), otherwise you can hire a company to do this for you (magicsolv.com). I mostly suggest peoples to hire this, because I think they are good and plus point is they have cheap fee plan. So if you are interested you can try to them.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10464818	You can use pay per click advertising in the search engines to reach audiences looking for your products. You can use Google Adwords <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/adwords</a> or Yahoo <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com</a><br>  <br>  Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: <br>  <br>  1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.<br>  <br>  2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!<br>  <br>  AddThis <a href="http://www.addthis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.addthis.com</a> <br>  <br>  3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.<br>  <br>  Google's Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide (PDF format) <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/se...</a><br>  Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/201...</a><br>  <br>  4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a><br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-releases" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com/press-releases</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a><br>  <br>  5.

In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Advertising services and products online is fairly easy.

Don’t get too confused your situation is really just a timing one that you can fix yourself in your own schedule. First, complete your education as a marine mammal trainer part-time. Once you have that career set you can still find ways to work part-time with both horses and dolphins - ask your humane instructors to help you with this one. I 'am sure your humane instructor will help you make a wise decision in helping both species full-time.

4RjM5lElaa	It all depends on the company and their policies.<br>  <br>  Some will give you all the perks up front - others will make you earn or 'accrue' them so you cannot use them until you earn them - and there are equations that will spell out how many hours you earn at each pay interval.<br>  <br>  There is a standard vacation schedule - so one to two weeks vacation for the first ~5 years of employment and then you can gain a year, etc...the longer you stay with a company generally the more time you earn.<br>  <br>  You can turn the tables on all of this though by negotiating for more vacation time when you get an offer - some will give it, others won't and it's all in how you ask.<br>  <br>  Personal/floating holidays are generally handled the same way.<br>  <br>  Some companies will allow X amount of hours/days for sick time w/o penalty - if you do not exceed the time allotted.  Others will discipline you if you get to intervals in the allotted time - so if there are 8 days of sick time allowed, you might get a verbal warning at 3 days, a written one at 6 and terminated at 8 - it depends on their policies.  Also, sick time is not a given - meaning that just bcz it is there you shouldn't use it bcz it's there - use it if you need to.  Finally, not everyone pays for sick time - some make you cover sick time with vacation time.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ehYD2IrUaa	Floating Holiday:  A day off w/pay that you can take anytime within the calendar year.

Is it people's commissions not showing up on the stats?  If so, contact the company and ask why that's an issue.  Sometimes it's something as silly as computer codes, cookies and wrongly assigned affiliate links.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's bad customer service.<br>  <br>  Did this company just change owners?  Did they change their name?  Is the CEO coming out with a statement.  He should. <br>  <br>  If you cannot glean much information whatsoever.  It's probably just better to leave the site alone.

UzEKkwWYaa	Having a simple, straightforward, and fair tax system does not benefit anyone who is in a position to influence the law.  There are currently a lot of people who make a ton of money by lobbying for specific tax rules for the benefit of particular companies and industries.  It's a fantastic story of American capitalism meets American political corruption, and the result is a terribly complicated tax system which supports the livelihoods of those involved in it, but drains an absurd amount of money from the nation as a whole.|`|4eTRhWweaa	I don't have an answer to your question but it seems as though the higher income level you are the more tax breaks you get.

They will not cash a check if you don't have the balance in your account to cover it.  Also, why are you cashing your paychecks instead of using the checking account to hold your money where it is safer?|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The only way around this is to see if you can have your paychecks directly deposited.  Then the money is available on payday.|`|AA10667393	The bank that the check is drawn from must pay the check when it is presented, unless there is not enough money in the account to pay it.<br>  <br>  If you "present" it (legalese for trying to get it cashed) to any other bank, it can decline to honor it. If you have an account at the bank, in most cases you will have to have enough in your account to cover the check if it bounces or you will have to deposit it. Banks are tightening up their practices, given the economy, because if they give you the money and the check bounces, and you cannot pay your bank back, they will have to sue you, not your employer. Banks don't like suing their customers.

Woo hoo!|`|Nqp4zjGSaa	depends....do you work? If your answer is yes, then "NO" you will not be receiving a stimulus check. <br>  <br>  The new 2009 stimulus is only giving checks to those who "don't work and don't pay taxes." <br>  <br>  I know makes a lot of sense dosen't it. <br>  <br>  Well, I guess you could look at it this way. It is stimulating people to quit their jobs. Why not, they're getting free money from the government, free healthcare, free food, free housing......why would you wanna work?

0u6qy9Uuaa	banks were in trouble long before oil prices dropped - some had already gone under|`|AA11966821	Banks were failing, the stock market falling, and the economy going down the tubes about 10 months before the price of oil started dropping.  In fact, Bear Stearns went under a year before oil prices started declining.  The price of oil went down because the economy was slowing so fast that consumption started declining dramatically.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Partly, but not principally.<br>  The economic collapse was well underway when the oil price began to fall. Oil prices fell when demand for oil dropped in response to the economic downturn.<br>  <br>  Banks mostly got burned by investing in mortgages on housing that was no longer worth the value of the mortgages. Housing prices took a steep dive for two reasons. The availability of credit to buy those homes started to shrink, just as the housing market moved into the overbuilt zone.  Too many homes had been built to supply a finite demand.<br>  <br>  This brought banks to a solvency crunch. They could no longer borrow money from wary investors, or even other banks because investors started to realize what a deck of cards the banks were stuck with.
y4SUDnpaaa	I have all my money, except  for what's in my 401K , in  CDs. It's safe, FDIC insured, at least it is in Credit Unions.  If you need the money you can withdraw it and ,again at CUs, there is no fee you only  forfeit 2  months of interest but if you've owned the CD for any length of time you have earned enough  interest to more than compensate. You can get no questions asked loans by borrowing against the CD at an interest rate 2 points higher than you are earning on  the cd and you continue to earn the same interest rate on the the CD as when it was opened. If you have a dire emergency the  amount you owe on the loan is taken from the CD so you never default on the loan. My CDs are earning 4.5%, which is a decent rate in these times.I highly recommend them as a no risk investment.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Dumb idea.  Take a loss on stock when I could be buying a bottom prices and put it into a CD paying 2%. paying tax on that and not even keeping up with inflation.  I would rather gamble on the market increasing.|`|kmTlCtOPaa	I still think real estate is a better investment than CD.  Net lease properties are relatively stable and offer higher returns as well as appreciation potential.  Unless it is a smaller amount of cash (not enough to buy real estate), then I would put it in a CD.

I1VivZxfaa	I'm not 100% sure your question, but if you are asking IF an insurance company's Asset Management Division offers a fixed annuity fund, how do they invest?  On a high level, they will typically split the portfolio into at least 2 segments...the bulk of the portfolio will be allocated to non-correlated asset classes with a very conservative return, most likely involving passive fund management.  eg. instruments that are indexed to Treasury Bonds, or a Dividend Index...basically instruments with lower risk, but highly predictable dividend payouts.  A small portion of the fund may be managed to be invested in slightly more aggressive asset classes in order to make more than they are paying out.<br>  <br>  Not sure if this answers your question, but good luck.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Each fund is different. You will want to speak to your Financial Advisor and ask them. They will find out for you.
AA11082914	I don't think they do a credit check. They do a background check, but that's different. (My credit is bad too, and I got my job there...)|`|WveXRwt4aa	Yes they will hire you!|`|cYmIMtGOaa	i dont believe they will do a credit check|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	typically most companies do background checks and if the position is related to finance, accounting, upper mgmt or deal directly with profit & loss.  The background authorization forms you sign are generally generic to the how company/all positions so it may state they are doing a credit check but they probably won't unless it's for the type of positions listed.<br>  No matter what, the results of a credit check can only be used to determine an employment decision if handling money is directly related to the job (handling money does not mean as a cashier, it means controlling the money).|`|PnPVoakoaa	It would probably depend upon the position you are applying for.  If you are going into a finance area, your credit could be a factor - mostly, companies pull your credit report to see any outstanding public liens.  If you have none, don't worry.<br>  <br>  If they've gone as far as giving you a drug test, chances are that you have the job.|`|4MypYVHYaa	Wal-mart has ran a background check on you, they would not normally run a credit check so after your drug screening test then normally the hiring process is over.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|wLpVXhbBaa	I know that banks do a credit check, because I got disqualified from a job at a bank because of poor credit/account history.  However, Walmart should not have any right to do this.  I'm surprised they'd even check your credit.  In any regard, I wouldn't worry about it.
qGfAlDd2aa	No, not at all.  We have accounts in two different banks.  Some are for special purposes (savings, escrow for taxes, etc.).  Credit scores don't take bank accounts into consideration anyway.  Credit scores measure how you use credit.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No.  Have had for 30 some odd years.  1 checking account for household bills, My checking account another place my savings account, his checking account and our emergency savings account and our IRA.  How you keep your money sorted out has no bearing on your credit unless you bounce checks constantly|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	The only time a bank account can hurt your score is if it is charged off, you are caught kiting, or you bounce checks. Even if you bounce checks it is the merchants that generally report you.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	Bank accounts have absolutely no impact on your credit score.  Many people have multiple bank accounts.
fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Utah has no statute or requirement regarding a notice to enter.  The law only "suggests" that the landlord give 24 hour notice.  He is not required to do so, but should as a courtesy.|`|bg86ji6naa	hahahahahhahaha.....no|`|7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	I love replies like "go to city hall and.."  I mean seriously, it's 2009.  Who goes to city hall and asks for that type of stuff?<br>  <br>  A copy of the Utah landlord/tenant laws are here:  <a href="http://www.utcourts.gov/howto/landlord/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utcourts.gov/howto/landlord/</a><br>  <br>  Regarding notice to enter: "Give the tenants 24 hours written notice prior to entering their home, except in emergencies"<br>  <br>  So like in most states, the LL needs to give you written 24 hour notice if it's a non emergency.  However I'll enter a place from time to time for non-emergency reasons if I have a "good" reason to do so.  I'm not snooping around.  I knock first, etc.<br>  <br>  A good example:  I've remodelled a lot of bathrooms in this one building.  I had a vacant unit and wanted to buy the same vanity for the bathroom that I've been buying.  I couldn't' remember if it was an 18" or 24".  So I went to a unit that was upgraded, knocked on the door.  Then went in, measured their vanity, left and re-locked the door.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't think the tenant would have an issue with that.<br>  <br>  Is there a REASON the LL gave for going in your apt?|`|cXgRDZMLaa	Generally no - but read your lease - if there is a clause in there that states that the owner can enter the property with out notice at anytime then you signed it and that is the case.|`|vDJGUxl8aa	Go to city hall at the clerks office and ask for a copy of the landlord tennant laws, it should explain everything in there|`|WUA5xdI0aa	Generally no, but a clause may say yes

85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	To start if you are going FHA insured financing you will need 3 1/2% of the sales price as a down payment.Then you will need to ask for 3% closing costs paid by the seller.On FHA the closing costs are about 4% so you will need to come up with close to one more percent of the sales price to add to the down payment.This being met will put you on track with good credit to purchase your first home.I feel you would be safe to figure 28 to 30% of your income to make monthly payments.<br>  $2,500.00<br>  X        28%<br>  ---------------<br>  $700.00 per month     <br>  <br>  So with taxes and insurance you will be able to buy that home of your dreams.I am amazed and am proud of your economic responsability.Best of luck to you on getting your dream home.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	visit a RE brokerage and see out a foreclosure.  TILL you have<br>  50k in the bank, be careful about obligating yourself to a mortgage.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	A good rule of thumb is never to spend more per month on housing than you make in a week - if you make 600 a week then your payments shouldn't be more than 600 a month.|`|PxoKseAiaa	In addition to the $521 you need to add condo association fees, insurance, and taxes.  Possibly PMI if you do not put down 20%.  <br>  <br>  I would say look for a place closer to 90k so you can be comfortable.  When you add the other fees, you might be closer to $850 to 1000 a mo for a 120k house/condo.
d2ae6085cefba5ad885e5915f9b8ccc7aa	Teaching requirements differ from state to state.  In Ohio, the undergraduate degree is enough to teach.  The MA will allow you to make more money as a teacher but does not guarantee a promotion to principal.  The MA should be pursued immediately following your undergrad degree so you can expedite the process.  In most schools there is a lead teacher (by subject).  Become this person.  This and promotion to principal can take as little as five years to 25 years if people are waiting in line.  The best advice is to network and volunteer your services in the educational arena and let people know your goals.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You have to work your way up. Many times they start out as teachers or counselors. Go to college for elementary education/child developement. It's normally 2-4 years and then get the teacher certification which is a few months to a year.|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	You can earn a bachelor degree in 4 years, 3.5 if you go summers.  It takes about another 2 years to get a master's degree, assuming you go full time.  <br>  No degree automatically guarantees a job, note the unemployment stories in the news.  <br>  The good news is that good teachers are always needed.  However, to move up to a principal's position, most school districts will want a teacher to spend a few years in the classroom for practical experience.<br>  You can teach for a couple of years taking all the enrichment programs your district offers.  If you want to stay in Texas, take enough Spanish to be able to converse with non-English speaking parents--this will be a huge boon.  <br>  You might also take classes about working with developmentally delayed students, and programs for gifted and talented students.  It sounds counter intuitive, but G & T students are at as much risk of dropping out and failing as some disadvantaged students because they get so bored in regular school.  Or they may be gifted in one or two areas, but have regular abilities in other subjects.  They are an underserved group in many states.<br>  Then you might enroll in graduate school while you continue to teach full time.  It may take you 3-4 years to finish, but by the time you do, you are more likely to be seen as a viable candidate to promote.  You may be able to move up the ladder while you are in graduate school to vice principal, but honestly, expect to spend 6-10 years minimum working your way up.  (It takes a bit of age before the teachers and parents will respect your abilities and trust you with this responsibility.)<br>  When you do get your first teaching job, let the school district know that this is your long term goal.  If it is a large enough district, they may have a fast tract career ladder.  (If you are willing, volunteering to work in disadvantaged or stressed schools may help.)<br>  Talk to your existing teachers and principal.  They will be able to offer you more practical information.  They should be very pleased that you want to follow in their footsteps.  Good-luck.|`|pAZs55Mzaa	It should take you approximately four years to earn a B.A. degree plus one year to learn the science of teaching  and one more year to work on an  administrative credential and experience.

You need to be more specific. Anything that can be traced back to Nazi Germany is a quality product. It is sad- but unfortunately true. For me Germany makes the best audio products and the best vehicles. This goes back to WWII and Hitler basically had a gun to people's heads to make these products. With sound, Hitler wanted life like sound to use as part of a plan to fool the allied troops into thinking the Nazi soldiers were in one location and they were someplace else hiding. He would wire a fortess with speakers and trap the allied soldiers in there, then bomb the fort with the enemy in it. <br>  Most German vehicles have interchangable parts with quasi military vehicles. One the old Volkswagen Beetles, you could easily convert it into a dune buggy and mount weapons on to it. <br>  So, sound equipment and cars and trucks the German engineering is superior and has been since the 1930s.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	The main difference in german automotive is the fine engineering of their machined parts versus the habit of casting these parts in north american autos. My Benz 450 SEL from 1976, I am third owner, is as beautiful an auto as when it was first sold and is still seen as cutting edge in many areas and systems. The close tolerances have resulted in less wear and longer life in general. The handling is superb and the V8 has ample power. The education of the factory workers due to intense competition for jobs has led to an edge in many markets. I drove north American cars and trucks as well for the last thirty years and love my Benz more than the rest.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Germany has a strong work ethic, and is known for precision.<br>  <br>  But what sort of natural resources?

pJR1tRu1aa	Student cards are easier to get since they are designed especially for students who are beginning to establish their credit.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

They have a few books that should really be able to help you out and point you in the right direction.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	You really need to do your assignments for yourself.  If you don't understand something - talk to your instructor.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is not a source that should be cited in a report/essay. If it's a different kind of assignment, well if you just get someone else to do the questions for you, then you don't learn what you're meant to learn and you'll just have more trouble later on.<br>  <br>  Take the time to master the materials for yourself - it will pay off later.<br>  <br>  Your instructor should be happy to help you if you're struggling - that's what they're paid to do.  They may not be so happy to help if you've just been lazy and not read the materials/attended class - that's up to you to fix.<br>  <br>  If you really want to ask for help on this site, my advice is to have a go at the questions for yourself and then ask for feedback on here (eg "I think the answer may be xxxxx... am I on the right track?").  Then people like me would be far more likely to help you.

They blame it on the computer and changing systems.<br>  I am with a company that has a guarantee that they will always be cheaper than the big six on standard tariffs. I no longer need to search around for the cheapest company as I know pretty much I have  as good a deal as I can get. No matter what these so say ind. web site comparers say, one you have both gas and electricity with one company the most you will save by swapping around is about ￡30 and whilst publicly they hate each other, behind the scenes they make agreements, which is why the one that is cheapest now, will not be in a few months time, but it takes 4 weeks to swap after you realise this so really the punter cannot win.

DoHaUEziaa	My son is looking into this field as well. Check out the info below. Good luck.<br>  Significant Points <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Faster than average employment growth and excellent job opportunities are expected. <br>  Clinical laboratory technologists usually have a bachelor’s degree with a major in medical technology or in one of the life sciences; clinical laboratory technicians generally need either an associate degree or a certificate. <br>  Most jobs will continue to be in hospitals, but employment will grow faster in other settings.<br>  <br>  Nature of the Work [About this section]  Back to Top <br>  <br>  Clinical laboratory testing plays a crucial role in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Clinical laboratory technologists—also referred to as clinical laboratory scientists or medical technologists—and clinical laboratory technicians, also known as medical technicians or medical laboratory technicians, perform most of these tests.<br>  <br>  Clinical laboratory personnel examine and analyze body fluids, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, and other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood that show how a patient is responding to treatment. Technologists also prepare specimens for examination, count cells, and look for abnormal cells in blood and body fluids. They use microscopes, cell counters, and other sophisticated laboratory equipment. They also use automated equipment and computerized instruments capable of performing a number of tests simultaneously. After testing and examining a specimen, they analyze the results and relay them to physicians. <br>  <br>  With increasing automation and the use of computer technology, the work of technologists and technicians has become less hands-on and more analytical. The complexity of tests performed, the level of judgment needed, and the amount of responsibility workers assume depend largely on the amount of education and experience they have. Clinical laboratory technologists usually do more complex tasks than clinical laboratory technicians do.<br>  <br>  Clinical laboratory technologists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriological tests. Technologists microscopically examine blood and other body fluids. They make cultures of body fluid and tissue samples, to determine the presence of bacteria, fungi, parasites, or other microorganisms. Technologists analyze samples for chemical content or a chemical reaction and determine concentrations of compounds such as blood glucose and cholesterol levels. They also type and cross match blood samples for transfusions.<br>  <br>  Clinical laboratory technologists evaluate test results, develop and modify procedures, and establish and monitor programs, to ensure the accuracy of tests. Some technologists supervise clinical laboratory technicians.<br>  <br>  Technologists in small laboratories perform many types of tests, whereas those in large laboratories generally specialize. Clinical chemistry technologists, for example, prepare specimens and analyze the chemical and hormonal contents of body fluids. Microbiology technologists examine and identify bacteria and other microorganisms. Blood bank technologists, or immunohematology technologists, collect, type, and prepare blood and its components for transfusions. Immunology technologists examine elements of the human immune system and its response to foreign bodies. Cytotechnologists prepare slides of body cells and examine these cells microscopically for abnormalities that may signal the beginning of a cancerous growth. Molecular biology technologists perform complex protein and nucleic acid testing on cell samples.<br>  <br>  Clinical laboratory technicians perform less complex tests and laboratory procedures than technologists do. Technicians may prepare specimens and operate automated analyzers, for example, or they may perform manual tests in accordance with detailed instructions. They usually work under the supervision of medical and clinical laboratory technologists or laboratory managers. Like technologists, clinical laboratory technicians may work in several areas of the clinical laboratory or specialize in just one. Phlebotomists collect blood samples, for example, and histotechnicians cut and stain tissue specimens for microscopic examination by pathologists. <br>  <br>  Work environment. Clinical laboratory personnel are trained to work with infectious specimens. When proper methods of infection control and sterilization are followed, few hazards exist. Protective masks, gloves, and goggles often are necessary to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel.<br>  <br>  Working conditions vary with the size and type of employment setting. Laboratories usually are well lighted and clean; however, specimens, solutions, and reagents used in the laboratory sometimes produce fumes. Laboratory workers may spend a great deal of time on their feet.<br>  <br>  Hours of clinical laboratory technologists and technicians va

Ns6I7MmBaa	Usually minimum payment for a HELOC is interest only.  If that is all you pay, you would still owe the whole principal balance at the end.  So you have to make an effort to pay extra to work down your balance or you may find yourself having to refinance the balance under less favorable conditions.<br>  <br>  So pay as much extra principal as you can to work down that balance.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Just add money each month toward the principle.

DPajzalfaa	You were only there 3 months- you do not need to put it on your resume. Especially in this economy, no one questions a lapse in employment. <br>  <br>  Some people are naturals when working with the public...others, well...not so much. You really need to evaluate if your personality is conducive to working with the public. <br>  <br>  Some companies expect very high standards from their 'front line' employees, and others are more lack. Unfortunately, you have no idea which way they tend to go until you get in there, and receive an evaluation. <br>  <br>  Leave the position off your resume and look for a new job. Perhaps a 'behind the scenes' position where you only deal with a few people, or one department as opposed to hundreds of people with questionable psychological issues! ;)|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Dealing with the public is stressful.

An angry tinge is the voice is very discernible to all that come in contact with you.

dgkpTirfaa	lifeinsurance.awardspace.info - try this one. I have their insurance and, as remember, they can provide such a service.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	There is none.  Life insurance is not primarily a financial investment (those salesperson will argue otherwise).|`|2YSKXb8Aaa	Rate of return?  Are you talking about the cash value?  Life Insurance is not an investment tool...|`|HEcA3SN0aa	If you're speaking about a VUL (variable universal life) policy, then the expected rate of return would depend upon the subaccounts that you choose or the fixed rate accounts (some companies have them as well).  Some conservative subaccounts might be at 4-6%; while more aggressive ones might be 8-12% over time.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about an equity indexed product, then that would depend upon the index that the particular provider uses.  A lot use the S & P 500, but some use others including international indices. <br>  <br>  If you're discussing a universal life or whole life, then it would depend upon the provider guarantees for what they will pay.<br>  <br>  As for all the buy term only and invest the difference folks: they almost invariably neglect to factor in tax consequences down the road as well as likely loss of insurance coverage as you age.<br>  <br>  Now having said all that, your question is a bit vague.  If what you were really asking is what amount of insurance do you need, a good fast rule of thumb is about 10x your annual salary.  That amount coming to a family after you die could be invested long term in something growing at about 8-10% and that would about replace any lost income of the deceased wage earner.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Never use life insurance as an investment.   Life insurance is NOT an investment.

If your spouse has already filed his return and itemized than the IRS will send you a notice informing you that you must also itemize. You will not be in trouble, but you will have to amend your return. However, if he has not already filed and you file first with the standard, than he will be required to take the standard as well.

oQ99z5dFaa	It depends on the seller.  Ebay leaves it up to the seller to charge sales tax.  Most individual sellers will not charge sales tax, but most businesses do.  The current law only requires sellers collect sales tax if you live in the same state that they are conducting business in. So if someone is trying to charge you sales tax from a different state, they may be trying to rip you off.  Some larger businesses have a physical presence in several states, so they have to charge sales tax in several states.

If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!<br>  <br>  AddThis <a href="http://www.addthis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.addthis.com</a><br>  <br>  3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.<br>  <br>  If you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/201...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a><br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-releases" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com/press-releases</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a><br>  <br>  5.

A good website costs only $300 to start so a pretty site does not mean anything.<br>  I would say that , No, you can not trust any site on the internet. YOu are giving them credit card information that is worth thousands of dollars to a thief or scammer. And it can result in endless headaches for you because of one small mistake. Even if another person had good luck, that doesn't mean that you will be safe.<br>  The one good sign was that Pab Technologies did not leave any tracking cookies on my hard drive. That makes me think they might be ok. But you still can't take a chance..|`|3mAgM405aa	Anyone who conducts a search for "pabtechnologies.9hz.com" scam at google.com will bring up some 48 search results which simply state:  "It's a scam!"

fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	There's nothing illegal about it. Poor management, yes. <br>  <br>  But why he's punishing the entire department is beyond me. Is it a case that they cannot keep up the workload, or is it a case that the management is trying to get more business hopefully by opening up for additional hours?<br>  <br>  I'm in HR, and as far as I can tell, there is no federal guidelines governing the hours you have to work. However, unless you are salaried exempt, they do have to pay you 1.5 times your hourly rate for any hours over 40 per week. Your only course of action is to look at your employee handbook and/or  your employment contract (if you have one). Is there anything in there that shows your manager is violating company policy. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you have to realize that in this tough economy, employers are gonna push the envelope, because they know that there are people who will be happy to get hired in your place. So, if they can get someone to quit because they don't like the working conditions, they don't have to pay them unemployment.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Dan B's information is absolutely correct. Make sure you are documenting the hours worked. Your manager cannot require you to work hours that you are not being paid for. If you are being required to work hours that you are n ot being paid for (and are not salaried exempt), then you have a situation that can be taken to the state's Wage and Hour division. Just make sure that you have accurate documentation, including dates and times. <br>  <br>  However, if you are salaried exempt, it means that you are exempt from the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and that means that you really have no legal recourse, because you are exempt from labor laws governing hours worked and overtime statutes.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	whats a teller?|`|24kFbAdsaa	He will have to pay you for your hours worked.  Make sure you document those hours.  Check the Fair Labor Standard Act laws in your state labor department.  Making you stay over because work needs to be done is a lot different that stay over for punishment.<br>  <br>  I think that policy is dumb.  It's as dumb as taking a gun to the bank and pointing it toward a customer and saying, "You'd better open a checking account or else!"  If I don't need something from a business, I resent them trying to force me to buy something I don't need or want.  If my bank, or Home Depot, Sears, etc tries to get me to sign up for a credit card, I always tell them that if I can't afford to pay cash, I sure as hell can't afford to charge it.  Thank you.|`|q57LZ6XWaa	I would check your contract. I do not think that that is legal.
c8MYNPdBaa	The quickest way to get traffic to your website is to setup Google adwords (pay per click advertising). This will give you an instant influx of visitors depending on the keyword you use, every time somebody searches on google using your keyword you will be displayed in the sponsored listings. Each time someone clicks on your advert you will have to pay a certain amount. The more competition on your keyword from rival sites the more you will pay per click. You can set up a daily budget to stop you from running up a huge bill! Although its the quickest way to get traffic its also the most expensive way.<br>  <br>  There are other ways to get traffic but they all require hard work and a little time to see results. Have a look at the blog below for some great ideas.|`|3mAgM405aa	The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Lots of content and excellent SEO skills.|`|5rYChsWFaa	Content is the first part of promoting your website. If you don't have good content, you're not going to get people to convert on your website. Good relevant content also gets you good ranking with search engines and will get you listed faster.<br>  <br>  A great way to build links to your website and to get traffic going there is to utilize social networking sites like facebook and myspace to post content about your website and links back to your home page.<br>  <br>  Another way to do this is to utilize social bookmarking websites like digg.com, technorati, reddit, delicious, and all of the other hundreds of sites out there.<br>  <br>  Now, you can go through and spend hours upon hours building these links or you can use a widely accepted solution that most Internet marketers use.
