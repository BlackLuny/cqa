2c8bec6bff9ba49f3d653ae100b420c9aa	Lookie here, Milli Vanilla...  No, men do not look okay with extentions.  Leave that to us girls.  Dammit isn't anything of ours sacred anymore?  First you guys are coming in and sitting next to us in the nail shop getting manicures and eyebrow waxing, now you want to take our hair extentions!!!!????  No way, Jose!  LOL  Just kidding.  But seriously, no.  Don't get the extentions.  It will not look right at all.  Just be sure to get regular trims, use a leave-in conditioner once or twice month (go to a salon if these directions are confusing), and don't use too many products in your hair (gel, mousse, etc).  Just maintain it well, and your hair will grow in enough for you to get your much coveted braids.  Good luck sweetie!|`|b7a74c018e1a497e4747a26c5e2aaa3daa	I have long hair, and for my braids I get extensions.

Your braider should use a method of applying the extension to your hair that will be invisible once the braid is finished (you should not be able to see the little extension knot at the beginning of the cornrow, this is achieved by adding the extension to the middle of the cornrow - sorry I don't know the name of the technique), that way people will not be able to tell that you have extensions.

The top of my head does not touch the pillow, and that's where I have the least hair.  But my idea is contrary to the "experts".  The experts call it male pattern baldness.

KOHLS buys a lot of cheap material clothing, but that is why the prices are so good. They are cute jeans, but if you are uncomfortable wearing them, don't. You can always put the belt with another pair for the same look. Look at the tag and find out where they are made, too. If they are scratchy in an allergic reaction kind of way, maybe you should get rid of them. You could also put nylons underneath them too to protect your skin, but that may or may not work.

ec89ed1aa4ec0834ca5eeda8910b4a37aa	hello.  a good diet and excercise would be a great start, however, the aging you are seeing now on your skin is probably because you are not exfoliating, or exfoliating enough.   There are tons of products on the market- granular exfoliants as well as chemical, which help you get the layers of dead skin cells off.  as we age, our cellular renewal rate declines, which means dead skin cells build up.  It is important to remove this ourselves when we cleanse every day.  regular cleansing is not enough.  you either have to add a second step with a granular exfoliant such as Loreal's microdermabrasion two step system(don't use the moisturizer, it has alcohol in it), or...even better....2-3 times a week use a glycolic acid product as a second step.  Credentials carries a wash that is excellent and you can order it online.  there are many others too.  you want something that's about 15% glycolic acid with a pH of about 3.5.  you will start out using it twice a week and then work up to once a day if there is no redness.  I can almost guarantee you (unless you have some other health issues going on) that you will see a huge change within 3 months.  I know....I've done it myself and I'm an esthetician.  If you want something faster acting, go to an esthetician and get microdermabrasion and glycolic peel treatments....and if THAT isn't working fast enough for you try finding a physician that does the Obagi system.  You'll have baby butt skin in no time.  hope this helps!|`|6900c12ec007b0883c923d7e542cf485aa	stay out of the sun, don't smoke cigs, exercise alot, avoid stress, dont eat junk food like mcdonalds, avoid eating meat, and use a good moisturizer if needed such as Eucerin.|`|3b93919f420270108b3b77af1d0742e1aa	less meat, more veggies, LESS SUN & TANNING BED too...those two will have you looking like a rasin!|`|3cdd2aaeb296085fa38e26fbfe4c3122aa	what dixon said..:)|`|6c7dcf17f495a9eaf6fcd1864d0837e8aa	grow old gracefully|`|6128169f0370b04ccf185e10c7a2a05caa	Darlin to tell you the truth you won't get that back.

Work out (walk, run, dance) at least 30 minutes everyday.  Take vitamin E supplements and drink decaf greet tea which is full of antioxidants for your skin.  Exfoliate your skin twice a week, and moisturize day AND night.  Make sure your day moisturizer has an SPF of at least 15.  But for long sun exposure, wear sunglasses a big hat and SPF 45 or higher.

12e15ba933e02817747ea6230c7199aeaa	It's similar to a regular pony tail.    First, brush your hair out so there are no tangles.      If you want it to look really symmetrical, take a comb and starting where your hairline meets your ear, drag the end of the comb (like, one tooth, otherwise it can get snagged and hurt)  around to the center of the back of your head.  While you're doing that, your other hand should be gathering hair from the top of the line into a ponytail.    Next, repeat on the opposite side.  Continue to hold the first bit of hair gathered, and gather the second bit.  By then you should have the top half of your hair gathered into one hand.  Use your brush to brush the top smooth and wrap an elastic around it like a normal pony tail.    If you want something a little fancier than the typical half-pony, don't pull the tail completely through after you loop the elastic the last time; let it fold over itself and you'll have a little pony 'fountain' that's really cute.    It may take several tries at this, so don't wait until the last minute to try.  Practice when you have some free time.|`|AA11612057	Like you make a bun the pull out half oof te hair on top then it a half-a-pony|`|f276bcc741e51f78906edf7e4183dae9aa	1.

8abd916dfa1a8aaa27c12bd780b6ff23aa	well a really good and easy way to do french manicures is you put tape on each nail covering all of it except for the tips, curving to the shape of the top of your nail, paint the ends white, and then it looks professional! it also looks cute if you pick your fave color and do that color of tips instead of white. and for an extra touch, put a shiny top coat on! different eyeshadow colors bring out different eye colors too. blue brings out brown eyes, brown brings out blue eyes, and pinks and purples bring out green and hazel eyes. i also think that people with darker skin and brown eyes look pretty with light purple eyeshadow. choose a blush that's just a little bit darker than your natural skin tone. put it right under your cheek bone and curve it up when you get closer to your ears and that really lets your cheekbones "pop" out. i also think sparkly or shiny lip gloss is cute.|`|91ab79dab589b3fa12654a2c8396f749aa	go to the web page http://makeover.ivillage.com/IVillage/fl...  sign in and upload your photo.

Certamente non dovrebbe essere un trucco molto pesante, alla nostra eta deve solo mettere in risalto le cose belle che ancora abbiamo.

Mettere sempre una crema molto idratante come base, evitare il fondotinta color terra, o metterne 4000 strati per coprire una pelle non pi giovanissima, perch cos si ottiene solo l'effetto Belfagor, dato che il fondotinta si insinua nelle inevitabili rughette e invece di nasconderle, le accentua. Non mettersi chili di matita che infossa gli occhi, usare rossetti superidratanti, perch quelli normali dopo 20 minuti riempiono le rughette sopra le labbra e fanno quell'effetto "taglietti" orrendo (meglio allora solo un lucidalabbra). Si pu essere curate e piacevoli non solo a 50 ma anche a 70. Io avevo una zia che si truccava sempre ma leggermente, senza mascherate e lo ha fatto fino a 85 anni. Era una bella donna, anziana ma curatissima. Penso sempre a Claudia Cardinale e al suo viso bellissimo anche con le rughe. Improbabili quelle che a 50 anni pretendono di mettersi un trucco allucinante, con i jeans a vita bassa, il piercing e i tacchi da 15 cm, alla ricerca di una giovinezza ormai passata.

Certo che ci sono poi delle accortezze per le pelli non pi giovanissime: anzitutto la base, mai usare fondotinta effetto cerone che evidenzia rughe e imperfezioni. Poi gli ombretti: i colori perlati evidenziano le "zampine" e le rughette, meglio opacizzare. Per le labbra eviterei i colori troppo scuri a meno di avere denti perfetti e bianchissimo e labbra piene. In generale s ai colori neutri e caldi. Un'ultima cosa, il capelli da soli fanno moltissimo: dopo i 30 anni meglio spendere un pochino di pi per il parrucchiere, con una testa in ordine le imperfezioni si notano moooolto meno e ci si sente pi sicure.|`|51410c14a391791db6c1691838a483fcaa	credo che debba truccarsi normalmente, prediligendo magari colori chiari, non troppo sgargianti e rossetto non brillante. magari un fondotinta color carne per non cambiare troppo, copre gli inestetismi e mantiene un colore neutro, gli occhi tranquillamente la matita che valorizza il disegno e un colore (anche prugna se si ha un vestito scuro) altrimenti interno chiaro e sfumato pi scuro all'esterno, l'importante e non eccedere nel colore. un p di terra sulle guance sfumando dall'alto verso il basso onde evitare l'effetto Heidi. rossetto che si riprende con l'ombretto magari sempre non troppo forte e non brillante. per potrebbe applicare un p di lucida labbra per rendere un p lucido, agli angoli della bocca sul rossetto e poi non sfregare le labbra ma imitare il movimento con queste come se si stesse tamponando qualcosa (spero di essere stata chiara non  facile per iscritto) curare anche le sopracciglia (non so se le ha sfoltite attenzione alla ricrescita) e pettinarle (si, si pettinano) dall'interno verso l'esterno. ah per il fondotinta  preferibile applicare quello liquido omogeneo per tutto il viso e il collo (movimento dal collo verso il viso) e se  un tipo che magari suda e ha timore che questo si rovina pu tamponare con fondotinta compatto (sempre leggermente), per il contorno occhi usi del correttore ma non applichi fondotinta sopra (almeno cos mi hanno sempre detto). porti con se sempre il fondotinta compatto per un qualsiasi ritocco e magari se ha la pelle grassa e durante la giornata tipo il mento o la fronte hanno preso a luccicare un tocco di spugna e il gioco  fatto. sono stata un p caotica ma spero che questa sia la risposta che cercava|`|ce0488ab2d534e4348fd3faf407feca2aa	ma per fare cosa??  a 50 anni ormai nn c' pi nulla da fare!  cos sei  e cos rimani!|`|f9acc33df4745f65933991e1a10f8f15aa	moooolto pesante!!!

It is becoming wildly popular here.  Waxing can lead to premature wrinkling of the skin and is pretty harsh.  Plucking is always an option but when compared to the aesthetic look of threaded eyebrows, etc; it comes in second place.  Here is some background info:  threading hair is basic to women and girls in India and possibly the Middle East.  threading is used on the entire face, including upper lip, chin, eyebrows, sideburns and cheeks. Men and women have it done.  it can also be used to shorten hair to give eyebrows a polished look.    Technique:  The practitioner holds one end of the cotton thread in her teeth and the other in one hand. The middle is looped through the fingers of the other hand. The practitioner then uses the loop to trap a series of unwanted hairs and pull them from the skin and even to trim hair (as in eyebrows).     Pros:  Inexpensive, fast, neat, considered less painful than plucking/waxing for many. Good for eyebrows and facial hair. Results can last up to two to four weeks.     Cons:  skin reddening or puffiness for some people    Can't get more 'natural' than that...hope that helps :)|`|461930e206725e96eac73c7f11ad0eaaaa	Anything you do to remove ANY hair, ANY place, is, by definition, un-natural.

I capelli "cambiano" circa ogni 7 anni, possono diventare pi scuri, pi lisci... ma una caduta cos evidente come dici tu pu essere causata o da squilibri ormonali e alimentari, (per cui: analisi!) o da stress, depressione, dispiaceri (a Maria Antonietta si dice siano diventati tutti bianchi in una notte...); per cui: autoanalisi! Non pensare solo all'aspetto estetico: i capelli sono un importante campanello d'allarme se qualcosa (fisico o psichico) non va...Sei giovane, formosa e i capelli sono l'unica cosa che pu ricrescere, per cui non ti abbattere!

Importanti il ferro e le proteine. Poi c' un prodotto magico che io ho utilizzato in un paio di occasioni. Viene utilizzato da molte donne al cambio di stagione, quando i capelli "si ricambiano", oppure in seguito a stress di vario tipo. Sono le fiale di DERCOS, anticaduta. Dopo uno o 2 mesi di utilizzo, i miei capelli sono rinati. E' un prodotto che aumenta la circolazione nel cuoio cappelluto per qualche minuto. Ho notato che rinforza e ingrossa i capelli, e soprattutto che ne favorisce la crescita. Non  un prodotto invasivo e si pu utilizzare tranquillamente. I risultati si vedono dopo circa 3 settimane, giuro.|`|4fdc09c3b29e12c5e44153ce6adeb242aa	credo sia una mancanza di vitamine e minerali, intanto fai un ciclo di multicentrum x rimetterti in sesto, poi pu darsi sia dovuto a uno stress e poi anke il fatto ke sei ingrassata questo  stress  forse dovresti cercare di calmarti, non sei vekkia hai solo 26 anni quindi tirati su e vai da uno specialista ke pu darti delle dritte x le soluzioni migliori  x i capelli x rinfoltirli usa dopo ogni shampo un p di gocce di olio di semi di lino x rinforzarli..    ciao=^_^=|`|8fe61adaa8dbc309fa031589d74504ceaa	usa olio di ricino per 3 mesi.fai un impacco di olio per tutta una nottata e al mattino lavi con un shampoo neutro biopoint o kerastase e ci aggiungi una noce di balsamo nutriente della stessa linea.a me e' successo lo stesso ma solo che son dimagrita tanto,per questi cali o prendi peso il corpo ne sente molto e anche la tricologia del capello.forza allora!|`|e764d26cf5e486f4166cc6e49ecec5aeaa	Non  che sei stressata??

Si  ammalato di tifo e dopo quella malattia i suoi capelli sono diventati lisci e normali come quantit.  Potrebbe essere capitato a te qualcosa di simile?

b62db0e56c9a37aa174fdc720254d985aa	The difference between Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette is that Eau de Parfum is more concentrated then Eau de Toilette.  Eau de Parfum is usually more expensive then Eau de Toilette.    The thing is that you just have to put less perfume if you buy an Eau de Parfum.     Now when you put the perfume you should always put it on places where you can feel you pulse. Since the perfume will come out more when it is warmer like. Some places is on the side of your neck or on the underside of your wrist.

6cf506357cf6b51f9195633383080982aa	the rule about blusher is:  less!  Never apply to the round bit of the cheeks.  Take a line from the forehead at the side of the eye, come down at a right angle to the point of the nose.  Now that is probably your cheekbone, and just there is the line you should follow.  Start at the forehead side and brush down, stopping halfway to the nose.  Use a little powder (always better than cream) and brush lightly.  Brush again, if you need a little more.  What you should end up with is the faintest glow of colour.  Too much blusher can make you look like a clown, and it's a mistake that is widely made.    Always do it by natural daylight too, as artificial light doesn't show the true extent of the colour.  Manby times I put blusher on by the bathroom light and go out of the house, to see that the colour is just too strong.    So remember the golden rule - just a little blusher, high up on the cheekbone.  have fun!|`|64b9238101a0cac1fd292382d4f07069aa	With blusher you need to swirl your brush and tap off any excess on the back of your hand. Apply to your cheek bones in the best place that suits your face. If you have a long face then apply by sucking in your cheeks and apply under the cheek bone. If your face is round then apply above the cheek bone. Blushers should always be pinks or peaches never browns. Practise with powder blushes or cream blushes. Remember a little goes a long way. Invest in a yellow neutralising powder. This helps for when you have applied to much blusher. By applying the yellow powder it reduces the colour already applied but it does not leave you yellow in the face.|`|nrMwBR24aa	Purse your lips, or smile, and apply blush to the top of the apples of your cheeks..I prefer gel blushes like the ones from Tarte and Stila...just don't go over the top with blush because it can make you look like a clown!

2dd43f0f449ef56d3c5f72700ca0bf6caa	the introduction of skinny jeans was meant to be paired with chunky, voluminous tops (the new proportion).  so loose-fitting styles, trapeze, poofy, etc.    if you dont like that kind of proportion, i suppose you can go with a leaner silhouette, with more clingy and tight tops, or you could get a nice belt (i think patent is in) that cinches big tops at the waist.      but its really meant to wear with looser tops, layers, chunky sweaters, etc  (an 80s vibe, if you will)|`|015632ffd4d58ea1441023497bc304f3aa	a wrap around top would look cute|`|8d094430728a5b8f9248204baaa79d2caa	Tunics look very cute.

I was horrified!!so I know how you're feeling now.    So I tried Nivea Sun~Face Sun block Whitening cream SPF 30 and another one that sounds a little Japanese(sorry I really forgot the name) but the packaging is small & red.  And when I was home after the sun,I'd mashed a strawberry & mix it with a little yoghurt and just spread it all over my face,of course after you've had a bathe and all.It worked for me though it may take a while but be patient ya.    Good luck,hon!

TI ASSICURO che non c'e' nulla di meglio in commercio di cosi' efficace oltre a rendere le labbra tutte da BACIARE e molto piu' SENSUALI...Fammi sapere se anche per te funziona ok??CIAUUU!!!|`|bJStiZaUaa	I rossetti della max factor!!

(rimmel - Oreal - Max Factor..ecc.) E' inutile che ti indichi una marca particolare: basta che vai in profumeria o in qualsiasi supermercato o centro commerciale per trovarlo.  Principalmente il rossetto no transfer si compone di un applicatore a pennello con il quale applichi il colore che tu preferisci, poi un gloss che applichi sopra e fai asciugare qualche secondo.  La bocca rimane bella per ore... e a prova di bacio... Costo  16 circa.. Mica male..|`|JrlhYFxnaa	esistono MA UN PO DI TRACCIA LA LASCIANO SEMPRE  mentre ti appiccichi alle labbra di una persona,  ovvio. non stiamo mica parlando di pennarelli!  sono pur sempre "creme".  E COMUNQUE...E NON E' BELLO. a me darebbe molto fastidio.      il problema,poi,  che i rossetti no trasfer, per la loro formulazione, seccano molto le labbra, per la loro consistenza... e non le fanno apparire proprio "morbide e sane".      io mi metto sempre nei panni del ragazzo: mai vorrei baciare una donna con il rossetto... non mi sentirei veramente "libero", mi risulta un po' troppo "da cinema".    tanto a fine serata, nel momento dei baci, il rossetto se n' gia andato da un po'...sfrutta questa scia!|`|4p46mKv9aa	solo max factor  ottimo e a lunga tenuta|`|zKh0djXLaa	Ciao!

Tambien cabe la posibilidad de que verdaderamente le gustes y no se atreva a encarar la situacion por miedo de ser rechazado y quedarse sin vos ni la novia.  Pero te doy un consejito...sea cual sea la respuesta acertada a tu pregunta, por ningun motivo te vallas a anganchar con ese loco, por la simple razon de que si la fuera a dejar a su novia por vos, en un futuro seguramente te haria lo mismo cuando se pasa ese fuego que existe al principio de cualquier noviazgo.

0762e0af2ae06d9efd0d51739b00c607aa	Look in the yellow pages and search google for job fairs and modeling oppurtunities around your area. Usually, agencies will come to a place, like a hotel, and interview aspiring models who come to them. Then, make sure to put that in your schedule. Agencies are not only searching for beauty, but they're searching for personality. Just be yourself! Don't try to be anything you're not or fake it. They can see right through that, and that is a major turn-off for many. You have to be a people person, be funny, have a sense of humor. Be freindly and approach them in a professional manner. Don't make your interview forced. Also show that you really want this position. When dressing, pay attention to the job advertisments. Sometimes it will say wear casual sttire. Wear usual everday wear or spice it up with cute accersories, but don't make it look tacky. If it says formal wear, opt for a fitted blazer with layered necklaces and black fit pants. Go Easy On the makeup!!!!!! If you insist on wearing it, go for bare minimum. If you wear too much, they will think, what is she hiding under there? Also, agencies are looking for natural beauties.|`|B7My6gxjaa	watch americas next top model and see if u can get in thro there.|`|e5xV4MZvaa	no sry wish u luck|`|w2sho540aa	Well i tried my local agencies and then as things got better i was signed better jobs which then meant moving to a more popular agencies.

The only thing I would suggest would be that you change the shoes, because even though the shirt does have blue on it, you'd be mixing patterns if you wore it with those shoes. The camisole has circles, and the shoes have stripes. I would suggest wearing that with a different pair of shoes.    The jacket with the t-shirt under it seems cute too, although I can't picture it too clearly either.

bc1785b43981089d0ee25e9b19f799f8aa	For larger boobs you should wear a prom dress with a wider strap.  Unfortunately strapless bras don't really give the support needed, so you would want to be able to wear a regular bra.  I know that sounds like a bummer, and you hear a lot of larger breasted girls wearing them.  Think about it though.  When celebs with big boobs where strapless or spaghetti straps they have them hanging out of the top of their dress, and despite what they think, it doesn't look attractive unless you are a horn dog of a guy.  You probably know that shelf bras don't work so halter isn't great either, but you can find a good support halter bra at Macy's.    check out some of these prom dresses...http://calito.com/all/prom.html|`|246ef8c6e18c79f44e6b784be1d7dcbeaa	do like jennifer hudson with the jacket at the awards show..|`|5397f455d9ee7b5cd6e42f54e3d29dbaaa	no style. plastic surgery is my best guess      time to call dr. ray!|`|AA10535861	I would say go with something like a Marilyn Monroe type dress or Halter top dress as they are called....

Stay away from ruffles on the top, they will only add to your fullness.|`|usKoF3oMaa	The secret is to start with the right bra! Everyday bras won't do for a big night. Special occasion dresses require special occasion bras. (You wouldn't wear any old dress out on the town, so why overlook what you'll be wearing to hold everything up...literally?).     The key is to buy your dress first, then head for the lingerie section of a department store or a boutique that specializes in full-figure innerwear. Be sure to get measured by a professional saleswoman; she'll be able to determine your accurate bra size. Take your dress with you, so you can try on bras under what you'll actually be wearing. Make sure you have a perfect (enough support) and flawless (no seams or wires showing through) fit.     If you're going strapless, look for a strapless bra that gives you great lift, real support, natural cleavage, and most importantly, serious comfort (you don't want be tugging on your bra all night). If you want to play down your chest, shop for a minimizer. As far as dress styles go, try a halter that's cut high under the arm, which'll cover an unsightly bra. Also try an off-the-shoulder style, which will balance your total look.    P.S.: If you're much larger on top, buy your formal dress a size up from what you normally wear. Make sure it fits properly in the bust, then have the areas that are too big taken in.    Don't wear a halterneck if you have broad shoulders - it will only accentuate them     Try to avoid strapless numbers if you have large boobs - you'll be forever pulling it up and it'll look top heavy     Do think about corseted tops as it'll "lock and load" you in.    Do think about halter tops, one-shoulder tops (with a nice flowing chiffon piece off the one shoulder maybe, or a large flower a la Carrie Bradshaw), and 2 strap tops.    If you have a nice back, show it off with a deep open back number, but make sure you buy the RIGHT bra to hold you up and not show bra straps.    If you have nice legs, consider a knee-length dress. I know it might be out there and you want a prom long dress, but a knee-length might be a nice fresh style/twist on the traditional prom dress.    If you've got a tiny waist and big hips, a tight bodice will look great as long as the skirt is floor-length and A-line. Choose a heavy material that won't hug your hips|`|ae8f22bf529b422c84e60442c5b63f64aa	definetly nothin strapless cuz ull look like ur overflowing. try something with straps or one of those sheer shaws to go over it good luck|`|f521a3f0b4312c2c60a3f7b4852ff2ccaa	Halter dresses have the best support. They also keep your girls in and looking great. I wouldn't suggest the strapless style, you have more of a chance of "popping out." Not fun when you are dancing. A dress with large straps will allow you to wear a bra with straps, more support. Have fun!|`|etbc9zunaa	the perfect ones
c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	regular use of face pack  and apply vitamine E cream around your eyes|`|mjAYCszCaa	"i have bags under my eyes"    Get more sleep.  Bags under the eyes are generally a sign of sleep deprivation.  Cut caffeine out of your diet for two weeks, and get a minimum of eight to nine hours of solid, uninterrupted sleep a night.  All the other advice you're getting here is just going to mask the problem.  Getting a decent amount of sleep will actually cure the problem at the source.    "im pale skinned."    Get outside more, and be sure to use plenty of suntan lotion.  The extra exercise will also help you sleep better, which will aid you with the first problem.  I recommend Rock Climbing.    Stay away from fake tan products.  They'll just turn you orange.|`|8d094430728a5b8f9248204baaa79d2caa	For the bags under your eyes: put cucumber slices on them whenever you get the chance.    For the pale skin: smile more, have more fun, excercise more, be happier! And go to the beach and get a tan, but wear lots of sunscreen. Also eat lots of fruits and vegetables that are bright colored, like tomatoes, peaches, and carrots.|`|dcd70cdb12dddffa520e3983a2ca4204aa	Me too. Use concealer under your eyes and I love my pale skin. Also, slice cold raw potatoes really thin and place them on your eyes. They will rejuvinate them. The people that tan all the time won't look so good when they are old. The sun is bad for your skin. I own a great t-shirt...it says: PALE IS THE NEW TAN!|`|L7XS4mgcaa	you're pretty the way you are|`|AA11549317	Get enough sleep and use a bronzer.|`|QdjawKgeaa	concealer!!!|`|2efWKG2Uaa	You should use concealer under your eyes, but not too much or it will look extremely ugly and apply a peach blush.  I don't use that much make up, I work more on my soul than on my face.  The best thing you can do is have an amazing spirit, and it will reflect in your face and be the best kind of beauty.|`|f521a3f0b4312c2c60a3f7b4852ff2ccaa	Use a light foundation to even out  your skin tone and use a brightener under your eyes to reflect the light away and give the illusion of no bags. You could try putting some preperation H there too. It will take care of the swelling, just buy a new tube and keep it where no one else can use it. I have pale skin too. Also get more sleep to get rid of the baggies.|`|AA10468622	When you get older, you will learn to love the face you were born with-- pale skin and all.    There are tons of things you can do for bags under the eyes. Small amounts of Preparation H reduces the inflammation and puffiness, and cucumbers really help. So do chammomile tea bags.     If your skin is naturally pale, don't try to darken it with tanning and bronzers. That always looks fake and tacky. I see it a lot on my college campus. Love  your pale skin!|`|80adee845b1d274cf137faa6d069eaecaa	have facials done regularily. (however that may be expensive) if so do them at home yourself.|`|AA12077656	While sitting up, apply a cool tap water compress to the skin under your eyes for a few minutes. You can also use chilled cucumber slices, a refrigerated gel mask or chilled, damp tea bags.That should work for you! Good luck!    Oh,did i mention concealer?! I use it everyday for the dark circles under my eyes.

39f1e02605bcff32190bb274c182020baa	Hair grows, on average, a 1/2 inch per month....so 6 inches per year. To grow out long, healthy hair, it really is necessary to get regular trims. Most people think that if they are growing their hair out, there is no way they should cut it at all. If you don't get the damaged ends cut on a fairly regular basis (8-12 weeks for long hair), the breakage can move up the hair shaft and leave you with some nasty looking hair.  So if you get the trims - it may take a bit longer, but the hair will be so much more healthy.|`|qxQdPzDYaa	everyone hair grows different i cut mine to my shoulders 1 1/2 years ago and it is in the middle of my back now|`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	I have very very long hair.

Its a myth that if u dont cut off ur split ends ur hair wont grow, please, ur hair is ALREADY DEAD! :)    With that said, just take care of it.|`|62f07b22e3162d7e3e42a0be08b40750aa	As others mentioned, the average hair growth rate is about six inches per year. Whether or not you can make it to waist length depends on both genetics and hair care.      Frequent heat and chemical damage leads to breakage, which prevents super long length.    Frequent trims do not help hair grow more quickly. They are only needed if you have damage. I get my hair trimmed about 3-4 times a year. As long as I condition frequently and do not use high heat settings on my hair dryer, I can keep damage and split ends at bay.    Some have noticed faster growth from supplements, but individual results vary on this|`|u6izUuBoaa	You're hair and nails will grow faster if your body is adequately nourished.  If you take a multivitamin each day it will help your hair grow faster and more keep it healthy.  That's why women who take prenatal vitamins say their hair grows so fast.  Prenatal vitamins are very similar to a women's multivitamin, with just a little more of a few nutrients.  So I would recommend taking a multivitamin everyday, and you will notice the difference in your hair, especially since you have a long way to go!
9M27Sx1Kaa	well I don't know exactly what products are available in India but I would assume you can find some sort of hair gel- curly hair WILL get frizzy if you don't put gel in it! just put a big blob in your hand, flip your head upside down, rub your palms together and then run your hands through your hair. Do this maybe 2 or 3 times, then scrunch it with a towel and try to touch it as little as possible, because if you separate the curls they will frizz!    also, never sleep with your hair in a ponytail if you can help it- it breaks off your hair and then the short hairs make your hair look frizzy.     as far as hairstyles, get some layers around your face. the fact that you have curly hair is good for a long face though because it won't lay flat against your head.|`|AA10697205	not sure if this is available in india,but   go to the health food store, get a bottle of aloe vera gel, not juice. it will be thick, clearish and a little bumpy. wash and condition your hair as usual, towel dry. pour some aloe vera gel into the hand, and squish out the lumps, distribute it through your hair. comb in through well, style as you would like, form the curls with your fingers, you can let it air dry then comb thru with your fingers or a wide tooth comb. this will calm the hair, make it very shiny and healthy looking without stickiness or odor. do not brush when wet.|`|AA11974456	Frizz-ez.|`|c99c641be358ef9640c31508fa26e7f2aa	hmmm, I think any kind of anti frizz product you have over there would help......and a diffuser on your blow dryer, don't blow dry your hair all the way just enough so that the diffuser works....thes a tubular looking thing with a wide end that helps with frizz.......lets see........air drying you hair is ok depending on your weather......I know it gets REALLY hot over there and the heat especially with humidity is havoc on naturally curly hair.......here we have shampoos conditioners, frizz drops and styling products to help with frizz.......you can prolly order things on the net to be shipped to india.......Biosilk silk therapy is WONDERFUL!

OK I Am giving you links to what i use ok , maybe you can find simlar there or buy offline.

In genere si truccano anche gli occhi e si tingono le labbra con il rodssetto nero. Se ti senti veramente punk non ti importer di ci che pensano gli altri e segurai i miei consigli! CIAO CIAO!|`|lPzYa3X3aa	Comincia a farti di eroina, il resto (abbigliamento in primis) verr da s...NO FUTURE FOR YOU, comunque|`|9388f2479eb17738098780e8efa230f5aa	2007 = era della MODA punk??? dovete smettere d fare domande su: le scarpe pi punk i vestiti punk...non avete ancora capito che non  una moda se uno si vuole mettere una cosa se la mette punto e basta...se sei davvero quello che dici tu dovresti averlo capito!!PANKKKK??!! CMQ koko 93 stai zitto invece d dire stronzate che  meglio...|`|g9DYh9wHaa	io sn punk e di d dei piccoli consigli.  primo non si  punk con le borchie come dice uno che ha scritto.  ti posso dire come mi vesto io: scarpe vans (quelle a scacchiera bianche e nere), pantaloni della g-star neri non larghi (assolutamente non larghi) ma neanche tanto stretti.  Cintura, e per le magliette ti consiglio colori scuri, grigio e nero, nero e viola(questo  piu da femmine x :-)) ma mai e sottolineo MAI il giallo, l'arancione il verde e il blu.  Eper i piu malati (io lo faccio in discoteca perch sen ti prendono per il culo a vita...vedi mio amico) la matita nera sugl'occhi.  Ai capelli mai il gel almeno che non hai la cresta io per esempio ho i capelli alla jesse mcartey o come diavolo si chiama, neri e spinti verso gl'occhi.  Pearcing al sopracciglio(come ho) e all'orecchio al quale va un orecchino bilanciere quelli lunghi (io ce l'ho nero) e piu pearcing hai meglio  per ti consiglio una cosa i pearcing stufano dopo un po.  TI AVVERTO: ci sar anche gente che ti dirche fai skifo o qualunque altra cosae non stupirti se il mattino dopo saranno vestiti uguale a te perche cosi avrai lanciato moda e mi raccomando la gente non  abituata tanto ai cambiamenti quindi il tuo cambiamento deve essere graduatorio sen sembrer finto e sforzato.

Boa sorte.|`|3199e7f38a2e97b31bada7cb0fe73472aa	Dicas para o cuidado dirio    Use sempre xampu e condicionador adequado ao seu tipo de cabelo: oleoso, normal, seco, misto, colorido....   N?o use xampu demais nem o coloque diretamente sobre a cabe?a. Espalhe-o nas m?os e s depois esfregue-o nos fios e no couro cabeludo, com a ponta dos dedos (nunca com as unhas). O excesso do produto pode provocar irrita??o, enfraquecimento da raiz, descama??o e at queda.   Enxge bem os cabelos para retirar o excesso de xampus e condicionadores e use um xampu anti-resduos uma vez por semana. O produto elimina impurezas e os resduos de produtos cosmticos que se depositam nos fios, roubando o brilho.   Nunca tome banho de gua quente, pois ela abre as cutculas do fio. Prefira gua morna ou fria. Se puder, d a ltima enxaguada com gua fria. A gua fria ajuda a fechar as cutculas e devolve o brilho dos cabelos.   Depois de lavar os cabelos, utilize um produto leave-in que intensifica o tratamento dos produtos hidratantes.   Antes de usar o secador retirar o excesso de gua com uma toalha, apenas espremendo os fios. Depois trabalhe com o secador a uns 15 centmetros dos fios, em temperatura mnima ou mdia. Produtos especficos para proteger o cabelo do calor tambm ajudam evitar que os fios fiquem quebradi?os.   Evite ar condicionado, pois deixa o cabelo ressecado e, conseqentemente, mais frgil, retirando o brilho natural. Para formar uma barreira de prote??o aos fios, aplique algumas gotinhas de silicone que ajuda tambm a selar as pontas duplas.   Evite passar as m?os nos cabelos constantemente, principalmente nos oleosos.   A alimenta??o  um fator muito importante para manter a beleza dos fios. Procure comer alimentos proticos - como carnes, leite e ovos - e os ricos em vitaminas do complexo B (presentes em cereais integrais, peixes, frutos do mar e vegetais folhosos), pois eles ajudam a nutrir o couro cabeludo.   Proteja os cabelos do sol. Use chapu e mantenha-os hidratados.|`|0a01bf9ef3568774359a7dfb18ddae78aa	olhe o ideal e procurar um dematologista ...   caso fike um pouco apertada.. compre produtos sem sal primeiramente... aplique vitamina A q se compra em ampola... e misture com o condicionador.. e este n?o pode ter residuos qdo tu finaliza a lavagem...  evite escova e piastra.. corte para tirar a parte fraca..   caso nao goste de ficar sem escola e piastra... fa?a um corte diferente e invista em tiaras e arcos de cabelo.. mas evite de pende-lo qdo estiver molhado para evitar fungos..  uma vez por semana fa?a hidrata??o.. utilize iogurte e uma colher de elo de amndoa prprio para cabelo..

Compre um pote (grande) de creme de hidrata??o profunda de jaborandi. Lave os cabelos, e com eles midos, passe creme, mas tem que ser muito, se lambuze mesmo. Coloque uma touca comum (n?o trmica) e deixe de 20 a 30 min. O creme pode ser daqueles baratos. O importante  vc usar bastante em quantidade e umas quatro vezes por semana.

Se h uso de qumica a situa??o fica mais crtica pois a tintura deixa o fio ainda mais fino e frgil. Se vc ? consegue deixar de pint-los ent?o cuide deles fazendo hidrata??o toda semana e cortando as pontas a cada 3 meses. A hidrata??o vc pode fazer com manteiga de karit e envolvendo com papel alumnio  por 30 min, 1 x na semana. A manteiga de karit eu indicaria da marca Loccitane pois ela  pura. Evite de lava-los com gua quente p ? ressec-los mais. Corte-os na lua crescente (para crescer) ou na lua cheia (para deix-los fortes). Evite tb de pente-los com frequncia para evitar a queda e de quebr-los pois cabelos finos quanto mais se escova mais podem quebrar e ficar eltricos. Vc pode acrescentar ampolas de vitamina A no shampoo, s?o vendidos nas farmcias e custam baratinho.|`|Ea4buLoSaa	olha, o bom mesmo  voc fazer uma hidrata??o de 15 em 15 dias com um profissional , o meu tbm estava muito ressecado, n?o crescia e resolvi fazer tratamento no sal?o, hoje ele esta brilhoso e crescendo, vale a pena

Basicamente y en general, te ayuda a conocer los alimentos, como debes comer y a disfrutar de los alimentos sin pasar privaciones incluso cuando vas a comer fuera. En segundo termino, implantar una rutina de ejercicios acorde a tu condicion fisica, que luego podras ir incrementando y por ultimo la paciencia y el positivismo, esto, la actitud es impresindible para tener exito en un porceso donde estas cambiando los malos habitos y requieres de ver resultados., pero eso si, si no combinas ejercicio con una rutina apropiada de alimento, no conseguiras un resultado seguro y perdurable en el tiempo. tambien hay algunas pastillas en el mercado, pero no me animo a recomendarlas, pues en cada persona pueden variar sis resultados, por ejemplo yo tomo aqui en E.E.U.U. unas llamas "Hydroxicut" que tienen muy buena fama, mas no conozco a certeza si funcionan.

xzjUMP4Maa	Antes de plancharlo debes aplicar algunas gotas (mejor en forma de gel), que vendan en tu comunidad y que sean especiales para ese fin.  No te aconsejo marcas porque soy de Guatemala y no se de donde eres t, pero te dir que eso les funciona muy bien a mis hijas.  Tampoco debes plancharlo demasiado mojado (medio hmedo si) y busca una plancha que al mismo tiempo emita aire.    Eso si, recuerda que debes hacerte tratamientos para evitar que te lo dejes liso, pero quemado.    Tambin te aconsejo poner tubos grandes y hacerlo seguido, porque as el pelo se va acostumbrando.

Usa RENA  escribe a esta direccin un mail, y te mando los datos para que tengas un cabello bello!    Yo he usado este producto y te puedo decir que funciona. te deja el cabello ***** y suave y sobre todo notas que el cabello te crece, tengo entendido que estos es por el jaborandi. bueno te cuento que es un producto natural pero a pesar de eso tu cabello debe tener por lo menos tres meses sin que te hayas aplicado ningun tipo de quimico(tintes, cationicos,arcillas,japonez,et... esto haria que se te parta tu cabello y tampoco puedes aplicarte ningun quimico despues de usar este producto, debes tener eso muy claro. para su aplicacion debes tener paciencia, porque segun tu tipo de cabello es que sabras cuantos sobres debes usar. Ejemplo: si tu cabello es muy rizado debes usar por lo menos seis sobres de gel, aplicandolos uno cada 2 o 3 dias.con esto debes tener paciencia porque en la primera aplicacion el cambio que mas notas es el de color, pero cuando ya llevas unos tres sobres vez un buen cambio en el cabello asi que debes cumplir todas las aplicaciones requeridas para que veas el cambio que quieres,cuando lo apliques no lo enrolles con ganchos dejalo bien estiradito y pidele a alguien que te ayude a cubrirlo con plastico envolvente de estos de cocina y dejalo el tiempo que se indica en el sobre. despues de esto lo puedes repetir unos 3 o 4 meses  despues y hasta mas dependiendo del crecimiento de tu raiz. pero ten en cuenta que tambien debes hidratar tu cabello con ampollas, mascarillas, etc. lo que quiero decir es que tu tambien ayudes un poco a estos tratamientos para que tu cabello se vea adems sano. Escribeme, no te vas a arrepentir!!! te lo aseguro.  productos_rena_en_venezuela@hotmail.co...|`|d7219b1153d0dd0e312878edf9a8b1abaa	Es que alucino con las palabras que leo por aqu...  ?Alguien me puede decir el significado de tener el pelo "esponjado", "griffo" y "chino"??

You should be applying thin layers of ointment 2 to 3 times a day (with clean hands) for about a week. During the course of the week your tattoo will become dry and it will start itching.. This is normal, but make sure that you apply the ointment and not scratch it as you want it to heal properly without leaving any scars.     After the week is over; you need to use an unscented medicated lotion for the next 2-4 weeks. Once again avoid scratching the tattoo and avoid direct contact with the sun during this time to help the color settle into your skin properly.     Hope this information is helpful and I also hope that you enjoy your tattoos as much as I do!!..|`|fMyODoaUaa	sad!   go through the following websites.  good luck.

The products have a large clientele among the quality-conscious and upwardly mobile customers in various countries including the USA, Canada, France, Australia and Hong-Kong.    The products are revolutionary and the product range consists of a wide range of Formulations, Shampoos, Conditioners, Supplements, etc all manufactured for a precise and specific application to achieve desired results. The products are a highly concentrated and balanced compound of rare and exotic botanical herbs and other active ingredients including antioxidants. The scalp and hair-formulations have been designed to work from the root & arrest pre-mature greying and promote hair regrowth, treat thinning, damaged/dry hair, dandruff and psoriasis-like conditions in the scalp. Needless to say, all the products are effectively pH balanced, without side-effects and are GUARANTEED for visible results.    Specific to your problem, it is stated that premature greying  starts due to an improper hair-cell metabolism. Good nutrition is important to have thick, full, luxurious hair with bounce, shine and proper texture. To ensure good quality hair growth and texture, the hair root needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutritional substances, which it obtains from the blood. The starved hair follicle needs to be nourished from within. The lack of proper nutrition to the hair root and follicle and unbalanced vitamin intake leads to tired hair and subsequent hair loss. Apart from lack of nutrients, Stress also causes hair-problems by the constriction of capillaries which feed the hair follicle. Stress also causes excessive perspiration attracting airborne debris and pollutants, thus clogging the hair follicles, leading to hair-loss.    I suggest you to use a herbal supplementation formulated from the best known herbs for healthy hair growth from roots. The rare herbs and active ingredients that help so are Fo-Ti, Stinging Nettle, Kelp, SawPalmetto, Silica, Comfrey extract, Gingko Biloba, Rosemary, Inositol, Biotin and Horsetail. I recommend to you the following for a minimum period of 4 months for visible results leading to reversal of the premature greying of your hair :  i) Segals Advanced Scalp Formula: For cleaning the scalp and revitalizing the root of the hair for new hair growth. It makes the root free of all sebum, grime, flakes and dirt thereby strengthening the root and thus encouraging hair to grow. The blood circulation in the root is considerably enhanced, laying the foundation for healthy hair growth. To be applied on the scalp every night before bed. Not sticky. Will get absorbed in the scalp on its own.  ii) Segals Advanced Hair Root Supplement: For stimulating hair-cell metabolism and strengthening the connective tissue. Active ingredients in the Supplement have a nutritional ability to not only grow back lost hair but also restore hair to its natural colour and strength. Contains rare herbs like Fo-Ti, Saw-Palmetto, Kelp, Stinging Nettle, Inositol, Biotin, Horsetail and Silica, apart from other active botanical extracts, which are proven to show healthy hair growth from the roots.    Alongwith the Formulation and Hair Supplement suggested above, you need to you use Shampoo/Conditioner specific to arrest these problems. You may require to use Segals Hair Root Shampoo and Segals Hair Root Conditioner. There are a host of products of the same Brand, available for Damaged Hair, Dry Hair, Permed Hair, Colour Treated Hair, Dandruff, etc. You will have to choose the Shampoo / Conditioner depending upon the condition of your scalp/hair, for which you yourself are the best judge. Please don't use any commercial shampoos available in the market that contain Sodium Lauryl Sulphate / Cocamide / Propylene Glycol / Sodium Chloride / Artificial Colouring or Pearlizing Agents. Avoid perming and blow-drying for atleast 2-3 months while using the specified products, till the effects are visible and stabilise.

Regular massag e of "amla" paste rubbed into the scalp has worked wonders in many cases, frequently reversing the process of greying or falling off of hair.   or      Massage your hairs with coconut oil and Lemon everyday for at least 15 minutes. There are instances of people having black hairs even up to the age of 60-70 years by using this method.  or     Soak about 10 to 12 rithas and 3 to 4 shikakai pods overnight in a pint of water. Next day, boil for a few minutes and strain. Use this liquid as a normal shampoo. Separately soak 10 to 12 dried amlas in half a cup of water overnight. Strain and use as a hair conditioner after your head bath. Leave it on the hair for ten minutes and rinse your hair with clean warm water. This will leave your hair smooth and shiny and also stop premature greying of your hair.   or     Mix lemon juice in castor oil and beat till frothy. Add 'henna' in to it. Apply the mixture evenly over the scalp, and bathe after an hour using 'shikakai' and 'ritha' shampoo as above.

A.Position a chair behind a clean, wide bucket filled with hot water.  B.Fold a bath towel into a square and place it at the bottom of the bucket.This will give your feet a comfortable surface to rest on when you soak them.  C.Add half a cup of Epsom salt, a natural disinfectant. You can also throw in a few capfuls of Herbal Vapors, readily available in the markets.The best would be one that contains rosemary, eucalyptus and menthol -- three therapeutic, cleansing herbs that make the room you're in smell just like a spa.    2.Grooming Stage:?  A.Use a cotton pad soaked with nail-polish remover to take off old polish.   B.If your cuticles are dry, add a drop of olive oil to the pad before using it on your nails.  C.Clip your toenails straight across with clippers.  D.Use a nail file to smooth the edges, including the sides. Best shape: square with rounded edges.    3.Soothe Your Soles:?  A.Soak your feet in the hot water for five minutes, then rest them on the edge of the bucket.  B.Dip a foot file, in the water, then use it to smooth your heels, the balls of your feet and the outsides of your pinkie toes.  C.Pat feet dry with a towel.  D.To get cuticles under control: Use the edge of the nail file to push your cuticles back, then a nail brush dipped in an exfoliating scrub, to clean the area where your nail meets your skin.  E.If you feel that you must get rid of your cuticles, have a pro do it in a salon so you don't end up with painful, ingrown toenails.  F.Rinse, then dry feet and apply a generous amount of super-moisturizing foot lotion or cream. Massage it into your feet and calves.  G.Wash the moisturizer off your toenails with soap and water and let them dry.    4.Applying Nail Polish:?  A.Create space between toes with a foam toe separator.  B.Apply one coat of base coat, two coats of color and one coat of top coat.  C.Confused about which color to go for? For summer, say good-bye to burgundies and browns. The hot shades are bright. Think coral with a sheen to it, hot pink and orangy-red.  D.Use a Q-tip moistened with nail-polish remover to remove any polish that missed the mark.  E. Let your polish dry for a few hours before putting on close-toed shoes.  F.Apply one coat of top coat three days after your pedicure, then every third day after that to keep polish from chipping.  G. If your feet are going to be in the sun, use a top coat with sunscreen, to keep the polish from fading.    for hands-------  First, remove your older nail polish and then file your nails.Long nails are best suited to people with long slim fingers, and if you have short, sturdy singers, please make sure that your nails are shaped to an oval, and not more than 1/16 th of an inch past the fingertip.  B.Next, soak your hands in the soapy water, for 2 minutes.Press back the cuticles, very gently with your towel.They are very delicate, and need moisturising.To remove any soap deposit, wipe your nails again with nail polish remover.  C.Apply a base coat, beginning with the thumb.Base coats are normally transparent nail polishes, which are either strengtheners, or just present to stop the chemical products of the nail polish, to yellow your nails.  D.After it has dried, apply nail polish.Use only 2 light coats, allowing the first to dry completely before applying the second.  E.Finally, when the polish is completely dry, massage the coconut oil/ Almond oil/ olive oil into your hands up to the wrist.   A manicure once a week keeps your hands feeling good.As it is always preferable to use natural products, rather than expensive creams and moisturisers, go back to nature and every night, use a bit of milk cream, or milk as a natural moisturiser.A little bit of salt added to it will bleach your hands beautifully.    If you have to use your hands for washing up, gardening, or any work which needs hand care, it is always best to use hand gloves.And if you think that it is too tiresome, what is to stop you from oiling your hands too well, with coconut oil, or milk, and then washing up? For gardening, always make sure that little soap pieces are placed under your nails, so that dirt does not get caught between fingertips and nails.    Remember that very hot and very cold water is disastrous for hands.Make sure, the water is at room temperature.In the winters, it is always preferable to wash your face and hands in cold water, to keep the naturally moisturising oil in, but make sure, you apply some oil after a wash.|`|JxCLZP67aa	This is easy.

tm8AjwSwaa	i use solid. its less messy. if your eyes are a dark color, use a brown shade. they make your eyes stand out, if your eyes are a lighter color, use a black to make them sparkle!|`|8EOBkru8aa	SOLID absolutely! But you can use pencils, gels, or creams for the solid; you have lots of options for whatever look you're trying to achieve. You can go natural, bold, or anywhere in between!|`|GAybqLiSaa	I think that the pencil eyeliner is better because liquid can get messy sometimes, but I like how liquid can help you get a smoky look sometimes. Also using a pencil seems to be easier to mark.    But I like to use eyeshadow as eyeliner instead since it's easier for me and I can get a narrower outline than how I do it with the pencil or liquid.|`|dduBFkLkaa	solid is what i use and it works fine|`|Ov9qM1gdaa	Depends on where you wear your liner.    If you like it on you lid, I think liquid. If you like it on your waterline I think solid.|`|Fk34tsngaa	Liquid is more dramatic and sexier. Solid is a better daytime look. For a sophisticated and smoky look, use a cream or gel applied with a brush, and sweep dark shadow over it and blend.  If liquid is difficult for you, draw a line with a pencil and apply the liquid over it- it gives you kind of a pathway to trace and makes it easier. Make sure you dab the liquid brush on a tissue before applying, to avoid getting it everywhere.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	Well depends. Liquid is more difficult to put on but looks better. Solid is good for beginners. Just a tip, if you're going to use pencil eyeliner, use a creamy eyebrow pencil instead. Instead of smearing, it comes off so it's easier to retouch.|`|Ggx25cdUaa	solid it better believe me , i wanted to use the liquid but it was so hard . also every one that i know uses solid eye liner|`|a268c12b5ec47775ab6f4e878095ab26aa	liquid for the top, pencil for the bottom.
sV0DUJD3aa	Yeah I say go for it - just make sure its a thick one because nobody likes the straggly thin one's that a few people get at the hairdressers! lol     From looking at the picture I think a fringe would suit you way more than without! =D|`|vDCWkqheaa	You have a really nice color to you hair.  Have you ever tried wearing it curly?  That would give major brownie points for your face shape.  Your hair looks kind of short.      If you wanna fringe go ahead.      But yea, if you could go curly.  Like glossy voluptuous curls.|`|rgh4HluPaa	It might make your face look out of proportion but i dont know.|`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	Yes.

4vqzkIr4aa	The strongest you can find. And when you apply it do not rub it all the way in like you normally apply sun block or tanning lotion. Apply a gob of the stuff and do not rub it in. Leave a thick amount on the surface. The sun is a tattoos worst enemy as well as going swimming in ocean, a pool, a lake, a stream, etc...|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	yeah usually just the strongest you can fine. I prefer to use a sunscreen stick on mine.|`|P1VoMS36aa	once your tattoo is healed, any! you can go about your usually skin regime once healed.   when you have a tattoo its important to always use sunscreen to keep it looking its best.plus i always moisturise my tats to stop them fading and it helps keep the colour!  good luck  xxxx|`|5wDjXzSraa	I use SPF 30 on mine, but honestly, 50 is best.     Tattoos begin to fade with time at any rate - to go out in the sun with no sunscreen only hastens the fading and causes the ink to look lackluster. As the years go on and the ink of the outline begins to break up under your skin, it will be even worse if you didn't use your sunscreen - the damage you did will be very apparent.     Oil based sunscreens tend to be more waterproof but regardless of what the bottle says, you should reapply immediately after swimming or if you begin to sweat.   Additionally, avoid "fashion" sunscreens that contain glitter or pigments - these actually draw more sun, almost counteracting what you originally intended.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Once you're all healed up, there's nothing to worry about when it comes to picking a sunscreen.  Get a high SPF rating, 30 will work, but 45 or 50 would be better.  Be sure that it's waterproof, but even then, reapply it after swimming or a lot of activity where you sweat a lot or if you towel off for any reason.    You just gotta make sure it stays protected!  I like sunscreen sticks, they're really nice and thick and I've noticed they stay on a lot better after getting wet.  You can definitely get them in 30, and usually 45 and 50 as well, and they'll probably be marketed as a face stick or something like that.

c382951c6fb5e148fcb37421d37780ffaa	ok mira en si las axilas o el sudor no huele mal lo que pasa es que el sudor es agua del cuerpo que al entrar en contacto con las bacterias del cuerpo eso es lo que produse el mal olor...entonces como sabras en las axilas no hay mucha ventilacion de aire lo que hace imposible la ventilacion y por ende la acumulacion de bacterias muertas y e de haci el mal olor de las axilas...al igual que en tus partes intimas verdad ,entonces por eso siempre mantengamos el haseo personal para no dar una mala impresion de nuestro olor  bayy...|`|AA10664023	Por que hay un tipo de sudor que no es tan "acuoso" sino mas "lechoso", este sudor es un excelente caldo de cultivo para algunas bacterias que lo fermentan; por eso huele as, es un proceso de fermentacin bacteriano.|`|afe299b11b2e550b3f824bc8ae3fbc70aa	q no te lavaste bien sucio...sino no te huelen...besos|`|28843e98ee15c6e050fd30d99111ac3eaa	Quienes las huelen ???|`|6b97012e2bd31157f1388f908b965e84aa	No s cmo se llama pero s que es una bacteria que, en contacto con la transpiracin produce el olor desagradable, lo mismo sucede con los pieses, por so es importante, despus de lavarse bien usar algo que mantenga las axilas secas.

Ma9gectDaa	yes!   i wore them for halloween together. i was a bunny..dont laugh! lol.  anyway i had on short gray shorts,cute dance top,my ears, and my tail/stub/bunny thing... i got many compliments and my guy friends said i looked rockin'. ( theyre not alowed to call me sexy. makes me feel weird. lol. but smexi is allowed if they want death glares from the girls in our little group! =) . i have them whipped! )so all in all yes!!|`|IqK0wcTLaa	yes. i wear them 2gether all the time.|`|MK1z64Kraa	yes i know a girl who wears them together all the time it looks fine|`|1iBiMe4Xaa	yah i guess|`|jVaY4sEVaa	yes.|`|BQY6itt6aa	yep , cute |`|pHTSL3Ylaa	heels look so much better|`|A92AiVZsaa	yess....|`|mpsy2yQRaa	yeah|`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	definitely:)|`|IUw0f5u5aa	Depends on the colour of the tights, bother boots in purple would look great.
WLuEIwp5aa	Most places will require a deposit if you make an appointment for a later date, and yes, this does all go towards the tattoo.  It's just a way to make sure you come in and you're not wasting a spot in the artist's appointment book.  And don't worry, if you catch a cold or break out in a rash or something like that, god forbid, you can call and reschedule and not worry about losing the deposit.    Anyway, when you go in, you have basically already paid for $40 of your tattoo.  If your tattoo ends up costing $100 all told, you'll only need to pay $60 (don't forget the tip!) after actually getting it done.    It's a super normal practice, and unless you know the artist reasonably well, you're going to have to pay it.  I don't pay deposits, but I've been going to the same artist for a while now, and he knows I never miss appointments.|`|RFOf5dw0aa	Every Tattoo I have gotten (3) they have charged me a $20 deposit, and it did go toward the price of the Tattoo. However, you might want to call them and ask, but I'm pretty sure it will go toward the total cost.|`|UZEEKKPeaa	I have 6 and never had to pay a deposit. Didn't pay for the tat til he was done and I approved it. Every shop is different.|`|P1VoMS36aa	yes it does, all my tattoos iv given deposits for  xxx|`|ypQGG9hnaa	If they took the time to draw something up for you, most places will charge you a deposit. Its just to ensure that because they took the time to draw it, that they get paid for it and you just don't take it and have someone else do it. It should always go towards the price of your tattoo, unless like I said, you have someone else tattoo it on you.|`|5wDjXzSraa	I like to think deposits keep people honest, whether it's an appointment or artwork deposit.    It's a waste of a shop and artist's time and money if people come in and set an appointment and never show. They have blocked that space and time for you and if you don't show, if they don't have a walk in to fill it, that artist and shop has just lost money. They could have filled that slot with someone else.    Most shops charge a deposit for a custom draw only.    More shops should be charging deposits for appointments period. Most that do, if you cancel within the allotted time frame, will refund you. But this keeps the lookyloos and the wishy washy folks to a minimum.    Deposits are always applied to your work at any reputable shop.|`|eRIge5D9aa	yes it should go towards the tattoo..usually it's 20 but i've paid 50 dollar depsosit before.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	did they charge you a deposit for a custom piece that they have to work up? If yes, then this is normal and yes it goes toward the piece and you are giving them some money so that they are not wasting any time by preparing a piece that is not followed through with. If you had to put a deposit for flash work then demand your money back and go somewhere else that is not in the industry to just rob those that don't know any better of there hard earned money.|`|JduQHocdaa	Yes|`|PT49mUyeaa	yes pay it, that is for the artist time to draw the tattoo, if you get the tattoo it will be applied to the cost of the tattoo. it also insures that you will keep your appointment. you wont believe how many people stand up their artist with no phone call or anything.|`|N19mmDELaa	yea, it goes towards the tattoo.. it just ensures you show up. no one wants to lose $40!!|`|AA11927261	You know, why did you not ask this??  I mean if you are old enough to get a tattoo you should be old enough to have a conversation with someone and ask questions.    But to answer your question, I would guess so.  I have only placed a deposit once, but that was the first time I used this artist.  After that once I never had to do it again.  Once they know you are real and they get some relationship with you that is unlikely to happen again.  It is used as a way to protect the artist from spending their time working on the art for your piece and then you not come in.

YEfplvXtaa	it really depends cuz sometimes i think ppl look funny when they bleach theyre eyebrows and theyre like a goldy or yellowy color...  i dye my hair blonde from black but prefer my darker eyebrow cuz im too scared if i bleach em they might look funny plus its really funny when they grow out and ur eyebrows have roots.    look at my pics on myspace i have black eyebrows with blonde hair and feel like its not that funny lookin...  http://www.myspace.com/peace_l0ve_hippie  |`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	If your trying to make your eyebrows lighter use Jolen  creme bleach. They also have mild formula.|`|YHNPzXQDaa	Sweetie they won't look funny, but ppl will b able to notice that u died ur hair, in all actuallity, it SHOULD look REALLY CUTE!!!!!!!! Go For IT!!|`|RVwGuJbraa	I think it would look best if you did light blonde with darker lowlights. That would make your hair look natural with your eyebrows and your roots will be less prominent when your hair grows in. Besides, lowlights are in this fall and highlights are out, that is what I have heard anyway.|`|ALGA8uRIaa	I Always Put A Little Dye On Brows - Brightens Your Face |`|Gh8918f1aa	I use to have platinum blonde with dark brown brows. They don't look awkard. If you don't like the look of it, you can get your eyebrow tint at the salon or do it yourself. Its very cheap and easy and fast both methods. Don't dye with hairdye as it can be unsafe.

31addee65693225c68c169daf536009aaa	This is what happens to my scalp. Like me, you are probably allergic to Lauryl / Laureth Sulfates. It's what makes shampoo foamy. I learned about the allergy in an article and what do you know, after about 2 shampoos, the little white flakes were gone!! You need to find a shampoo that does not contain these ingredients. You can find them in the organic section of the grocery store or at a health food store. It will say right on the front of the label that it does not contain these ingredients. I currently use a shampoo and conditioner called 'Naked Naturals' and I love it!!     Hope this helps! :-)|`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	This is better then the original Head And Shoulders; that one didn't work for me but this did.    http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Dan...

Ij5KXWIQaa	If that is how you look then I think you should definitely get it. You will look fabulous and prettier then you already do. trust me you have the face and hair for it. |`|aff8fff1d56a54667e1efefaa5413649aa	you would look good with one. But would look kinda emoish.|`|pLnyVKyBaa	Whats a Marilyn piercing???|`|FLFspMmeaa	its not really called a "Marilyn" piercing.  its a "monroe" piercing.  and no, i dont think you should get one.  it would look weird cause you have a beauty mark under your lip on your chin.|`|waXIN5O7aa	Yes.     Marylin Monroe.   Represents her beauty mark, the mole.  The piercing would look fabulous.  It has nothing to do with being emo/scene.  It was actually way before that sh!t came into this world.|`|N0ovJj25aa	You already have a cute lil beauty mark on your chin. I do not suggest a Marilyn piercing to go with it.|`|40d6692ef04eb7fe7b08f825a19388daaa	It would look okay but in general I'm just not a fan of Marilyn piercings. |`|gcYDA1ZRaa	omgg yes. do it|`|6rFOb158aa	yes.  but first..do something with your hair. a short blunt angled cut would really make the piercing look great. trust me|`|ge3nxwyXaa	Get a medusa 
INf502UUaa	You're fourteen? O_O You look older, in a good way(kind of mature looking, you know?)    Re-animated doesn't know what she's talking about. She's one of those people who like boosting their egos by judging people because she's society's definition of "pretty", so that MUST make her special. (Sarcasm with that last bit).    For the record, re-animated, nobody likes being stick thin :]. Just accept there aren't always "thin but curvy women" in this world and learn to admire other women's body types.

Not outrageously pretty, but not near ugly either.  I would suggest at least acting like you are self-confident because I can tell just in those pictures that you aren't. It's in the smile. You never smile fully and it's very unbecoming if you look fakely smiling.  Hope I helped:D|`|94KDq48Aaa	yes your pretty.

Find some nice heels to match.  If you're really unsure what to wear, ask your friends who've been to a dance or maybe even that same dance last year.

I5RuJPONaa	Waterproof liquid cover-up makeup, several coats, allowing to dry in between. Or,  If you're wearing panty hose, you can use a skin colored telfa bandage pad. Or,  go to the craft supply store and buy water-based paint, that matches your skin color. It won't hurt you.

lkNJNnlSaa	If your aim is to attract boys, it isn't working.    just keep it clean and tidy, thanks|`|4vqzkIr4aa	First wait a couple of years until you are old enough to get this type of work done by a professional. If a shop is going to this for you then I would run from that shop because they are just money hungry punks that truly do not appreciate the art form. It is not legal in any state to get a tattoo under the age of 18 without the consent of a legal guardian. And any shop that will do this for you should not be in business and most is in business for all the wrong reasons|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Your nose will hurt like hell but it's quick...the tattoo will also hurt depending on where you get it done, however you are too young for either of these so unless you want to contract HIV from some back alley piercing place i suggest you wait until you're 18.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	dont do it|`|5RoYyprkaa	First, you're underage. Meaning you can't get anything done professionally until you're 18. Second, your nose isn't going to feel good, but it doesn't hurt that bad. It stings a little, your eyes my water, and then it's over and done with. You could put a tattoo on your hip, depending on how low you wear your jeans. Anywhere else will eventually be seen, whether you be wearing a tank top, bathing suit or shorts, so that cancels out most of your back, your ankle, foot, shoulder blade and wrist.|`|UMg1CL7baa	i have my Nose pierced and honestly i think it hurt less then getting my cartledge pierced. Its not as bad as you would think. But i think you should wait on the tattoo untill you are entirely sure its waht you want. Its going to be there for ever.|`|yXzMV56Naa	Nose hurts less that your belly(i have both of them done), You wont be able to get a tattoo at that age and if you do its likely that it ll go saggy in about 5-10 years, just wait till your 18 that's what im doing|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Firstly, nose piercings WILL hurt. It's a needle going through your skin. Your eyes will water but the pain will be over in no time. Tattoos feel like a needle scratching over your skin.    Second, Any place that would tattoo a 14 year old girl without a parental consent is not a place you wanna go- they probably don't care about any legal troubles and use unsterile needles and such. Which means HIV, Hepatitis and other things. Pam Anderson got hepatitis from using an unsertile tattoo needle. And if you don't even know what HIV and hep are, you're clearly not ready for a tattoo or any piercings.    Just wait til you're of legal age. It just makes you look silly and immature running off and sneaking behind your mothers back.|`|pOgzmCn2aa	You can not get proper tattoos or piercings without parental consent. If you are doing this to be cool, then it is failing. Getting a tattoo is an adult descion, that is why you have to be 18 or older to make it.  If there is someone piercing you and tattooing underage children then I would be concerned and getting an HIV/AIDs test because I could not possibly imagine them having the appropriate business liscenes nor the appropriate sanitation procedures.|`|L4Bnecwoaa	Well first of all I'd say dont get a tattoo until ur at least 18, it's something u really need to think about seriously and REALLY want it, it's got to be something u love forever.  I started thinking about what I wanted when I was about 16 and only knew for sure I had my design about 6 months ago, just before my 20th.    As for getting ur nose done, it doesnt hurt that much. It hurts more than ur ear lobes for example but less than most as theres not much cartilidge there. Plus it's over in seconds!|`|rlXGRjAHaa	First, You're only 14.. Hun you have 4 years and than your legal, but make decisions, that you will most likely regret down the road.. The tattoo part.. Think of something, and wait, in 4yrs if you decide that you still want that tattoo get it.. Until just wait..     Plus, you no one will do your tattoo considering you are 14, and if they do, their needles aren't sterile, and you will get sick.|`|6hDRLkgkaa	get both of them.  have vintage on the cupcake wrapper.
Xg9F0C3qaa	I also love his tattoo and used my own ideas to create the tattoo I just got.    http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e161/R...    I recommend finding the best tattoo artist near you and going for a consultation. I put a $50 deposit down and he drew this amazing tattoo for me. RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH    A cheap tattoo isn' t good and a good tattoo isn't cheap!|`|4vqzkIr4aa	I wouldnt worry bout steeling someone else's idea. Only about a million other people have koi fish with kanji tattoos and most much better than his.|`|H3PcFertaa	Sorry, but I still believe that you are stealing someone else's tattoo idea.  To me, you are at the beginning of your search, and this should be a 'seed idea' - something to inspire you but not for you to copy.  Your not a big fan of Incubus  Are you a Buddhist? A long term Buddhist? or a Buddhist of a couple of months? Or do you just kinda like the idea of Buddhism?   I think that you are rationalizing about this, to try not to admit that it is 'stealing' if you get it.   Don't be lazy about your first tattoo. There are millions of images, and ideas that have never been tattooed. You could take this idea and make it a challenge for you to find your own unique image.  Take a deep breath, and dive down a bit deeper, your tattoo will be so much cooler if you do.  This is just the start of your tattoo idea:  http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=...  even if you got this, couldn't you put something of yours in it?  Hold off for at least a month and think of other possibilities.  luck~|`|5RoYyprkaa	It'll be fine as long as you tell your artist to add your flair to the artwork instead of directly copying his.|`|rlXGRjAHaa	Okay, first off.. It's fine, as long as its what YOU want, and you won't regret it down the road.. Me and my friend went and got our 1st tattoos when we turned 18, in January. Now she got something she wanted, but now she regrets it.. I got something for my father, who passed away and I love it, and I am extremely happy that I got it.. The best advice I can say it.. Just think about it before you get it, and make sure it something that you will want 10years from now.     Put your own little spin on it, if you do.    Best of luck!|`|uomYVsiLaa	No I don't think you should for the fact that your questioning your self and I would not get it below my elbow for the reasons that you will have a hard time getting a professional job down the road.All my ink that I got done I never once ever second guested it!|`|EwFq9zMqaa	I love Incubus and Brandon Boyd! I think that would be a great idea, but just make sure you won't regret it later... and as long as it really means something to you, it should be totally fine. Don't worry about stealing his idea; like they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If anything, it'll just be in admiration of him. Go for it =)|`|vlpmnEeLaa	sure why not but tell ur artist u want that but have him draw it some what different so it wont be exactly the same,,,, maybe he can ad on ?????|`|HVBWfKaFaa	tatoos seem kul be4 u getem but they r disgustin so get small sizes|`|IUv0x8wiaa	I think you should get it! its awesome.|`|sJrR8jK2aa	i would think of something original. draw something out that you like.|`|5wDjXzSraa	This is a nice idea to START WITH.     Directly copying another person or artist's work is fairly lame and unoriginal in my opinion. I like that tattoo as well, but to directly copy it - not so much. When someone asks about it, what are you going to say? That you liked Brandon Boyd's tattoo so much that you got it for yourself?    To me, copying someone elses work is the only thing worse than choosing flash from a wall.     If you like this particular Buddist tattoo, see what else you and your artist can come up with that holds the same meaning. They just might surprise you.     Just think: If you get exactly this, every time YOU look at it, you'll remember that you copied someone else's work.
ILKWjRL6aa	Oxy is very strong and potent. As you can tell by the smell of it! But it is meant to be strong to fight the spots and perfect pores.  If you have sensitive skin then it would be wise to switch to a product that doesn't cause a reaction to your skin.   From the sounding of it you have dry skin this is not sensitive skin but the two skin conditions are closely linked as dry skin is normally a symptom of sensitive skin.   I did some research on Biore and Biore products are not meant to be used on sensitive skin so I found you some face wipes that will not react with your skin.  Simple products are designed for sensitive skin and are kind to kind. They do various face pads that have the same results as biores face wipes.   Remember to do a daily skin routine:  CLEANSE  TONE  MOISTURISE- USE A RICH CREAMY MOISTURISER AS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DRY SKIN AND YOUR SKIN NEEDS TO BE FEED.    Good luck Hun if you have any other queries or questions just email me on xTabithacatex@hotmail.co.uk    Tabitha  x|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	oxy is to harsh for your skin and is so chemicals I recommend aubrey organics.com or dermaE.com they have good products for dry sensitive skin like yours and please stop using bad products that are making your skin dry.|`|Gq6AVBhGaa	hormones can make your skin break out, then people try to dry their faces out and it just makes it worse! if something's drying your face out, stop using it! It's not always oily skin that makes your face break out! you'll wind up with scars if you don't have oil to help smooth things out. be careful!|`|h31D5UDgaa	i LOVE the olay skin line.  so i'd recommend something like this:  http://www.olay.com/boutique/clarifyandc...
4vqzkIr4aa	Bad karma dude, don't do it. It is like playing with a Ouija board or something. You never know if will hoax your or not. A better idea is to get an image of something done that represents your partner, like something that person likes a lot. Maybe a flower. Flowers are cool for dudes and chicks. I love a kicking bright flower.|`|PT49mUyeaa	don't do it, your partner is temporary, sorry to say it but its true. just look at the national divorce rate. I know I know it will never happen to you, but do know how many names I cover up every week.|`|IUv0x8wiaa	I decided to get it when I realized that he was so like me. I am still very happy with it and with him. It did strengthen our Love, he felt I could truly be commited to him. Things are only a bad sign when you arent with the right person. If you cant imagine a day going by without that someone...then its real. We have been together for 10 years and married for 5 years. =)|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	I have my soon to be husbands name tattooed on me. I would not change it for anything. We have a 2 year old together and we have been together for 3 years now. I would say that it strengthen are love. He has my name and I have his name. We also have matching tattoos on our wrist.|`|5wDjXzSraa	I got mine when we'd been together three years and had a child. He's history now, and so is the tattoo! (Thankfully I was smart enough to get one coverable).     A name is a death sentence for the relationship, sorry. If you want something to honor a partner, you can do so without script. Names scream "I have no imagination and all I could think of was to carve your name in my flesh". How about no.|`|AA11675226	I was totally in love with my partner, and had decided I would get his name tattooed on me. I'm glad I never went through with it because even though i thought I couldn't live without him, we ended up divorcing and it would have just been a painful reminder of how much I loved him and how much hurt I went through.    Get something that symbolises your relationship or your partner, but get a symbol or icon not their name...

I think as long as you stick to something like you are talking about- natural looking color and all. It would be fine. As long as your parents are cool with it, go for it. Your life is about you, if it makes you happy and/or more confident then rock it out!

8THz1sp9aa	I'm not fond of lettering on the ribs. It's not such a big area to work with. Images look beautiful on the rib cage though.  Anyway.. it's your body, I see this across your upper back, upper chest, & lower abdomen.     As for pain, I've heard the ribs hurt pretty badly, but it's all worth it in the end. :)|`|YIplumj8aa	I think about 9 out of 10 people would say that the ribs are the most painful place to get tattooed - especially if you're a guy (females seem to take pain much better when getting tattooed).  If this will be your first tattoo, I would suggest getting it somewhere other than your rib cage.  Maybe your calf, thigh, arm, back, etc.  Think about it a while before you make a final decision.|`|sJrR8jK2aa	It hurts like hell! on your rib cage. but if you want it get it.

I have talked to a couple people and they say that the ribs hurt because there isn't fat, and its thin there. So I would expect for it to hurt, but also, you should think about it, and than decide if you want it.. Just don't get it, because you may regret it later down the road.    Good Luck|`|5wDjXzSraa	Ribs kill but tattoos on the ribcage always look nice on a man.     Small piece of advice: Don't just get floating script. Work with your artist to find a design that complements the saying, which is great, BTW.

Don't bleach them because the chemicals in bleaches are very harsh and they can really burn the sensitive skin on the face.

We have been fooled, tricked, deceived, and just plain lied to. It's time that someone put a stop to it, and everyone learn the truth!    Those of us who suffer from acne have usually been given 2 choices and neither of them work:    1. Over the counter remedies such as cleansers, creams, ointments, etc. These things have been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.    2. Go see a doctor and or dermatologist. They will generally prescribe prescription drugs which include topicals and or antibiotics. This, too, has been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.    I found a step-by-step program that cured my acne and it has never come back. It is amazing and doesnt use any drugs or doctors. The truth is that acne can be curedif we know the secret the doctors and drug companies dont want us to know.    There is a great website: http://cure-my-acne.info/3daycure/ that has all the details. I really suggest you check it out and see if it works as well for you as it did for me.

It is a small thing but when people dont wear it, it looks like they dont care about their appearance at all for some reason. It makes them look sleepy or something.    Or bare minerals when i have issues on my face lol.

Bad gal lash mascara!|`|K6rZmVmAaa	prob mascara. makes my eyes look more open. feel like a boy when i don't wear it lol
hOVzviFIaa	No. What you want to do is apply the opposite shade of the circles.  If the circles are a pinkish-purple, go with a more light green/yellow (just a small amount) and then apply concealer

Also a tripe barrell curling iron is awesome too!  Why not also try putting it up in a bun or in buckles.|`|nD2zbkovaa	either cut it with some fun layers or curl all your hair just as it is into big ringlets:    http://justabouthair.com/shag/medium-lay...    http://fitsnews.files.wordpress.com/2006...|`|c89J6VFEaa	I have the same hair wear...   high ponytails   high braids   poofs with your side bangs  Two low braids and poof  up and down  Be Creative|`|9Qi7L1WWaa	i would curl it with a 1inch curler. it looks really cute! does crimping look good on your hair? try it first before you crimp your hair for school cuz my hair looks horrible when i crimp it. you could wear it in a high pigtail and let your bangs fall out.|`|zUANF1ydaa	you can gather them in twin ponytails and curl the ends, since you have sidebangs, you might want to emphazise those by the ponytails being low and coming to the front of yourself|`|jc7L2TtPaa	Since the only picture you display on your profile is a cartoon, it is hard to decide what your face shape, etc. look like to decide what you need.

hFgAr7vNaa	its a kind of a new pimple forming, just like blackhead
lkNJNnlSaa	It's abit Dykey|`|XLhOUUDuaa	I think the outfit is really cute, but maybe you should wear a different colour tank top under your grey one so it doesn't blend to much with your skirt other then that, it's perfect.                                    Good Luck at Collage :)|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hon that skirt is not very flattering & needs a good iron running over it.  Please re-think yr look, not many guys like motor bike boots on a girl either.  sorry.|`|VwG2lhcNaa	That skirt and those boots are hideous.|`|9yMRbtK5aa	the skirt is pleated, and that looks more preppy than rocker.   try and find one that is straight instead of pleated, and a little bit darker. if you do that, then we'll be rockin' (:|`|rNdun1V7aa	eek no go with a cute tee and some ripped jeans :)|`|O24FewSQaa	that is a hideous outfit - like butt ugly no joke.

The Skirt and Boots don't work at all together    sorry but no its not =/|`|j4hmUPJgaa	Those boots look like something you wear with stonewash jeans in the 80's! You should try to get a nice goth-style boot. You would look more punkish- rockerish =)  Unless you want to look like a an 80's rocker, but legwarmers with those is a no go either way!     http://www.heelsforyou.com/Images/Demoni...|`|l5zJ1bldaa	thumbs down.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	everytime i look at this.. i get shivers up my spine.    im not even kidding, you should go on what not to wear.

Actually, I question the skirt.  Why not go with a more stylish pattern and cut?  Something short, plaid and pleated would work with the boots and help you get the look you're going for.  Not that skirt, though.  That's an office job/Sunday go to meeting skirt.  Also, there is no possible way that a black tank top will go with that skirt.  Please, don't do it.|`|GNcHTLisaa	i don't really like it!srry!|`|pXjtTLadaa	totally out of fashion!|`|GPZuYCyCaa	Hmm, just wear something casual, and dare I say it..normal :)
33l3blvsaa	hay hun i know this will sound gross!!! but COOKING OIL!!! it works just like cocoanut oil!! ok so it doesnt smell as nice but after you have a shower its totaly worth it!!! SERIOUSLY!!    & F.Y.I THIS GIRL WANTS ADVICE ON TANNING OILS NOT 2 BE FRIGGIN CRITISID BY YOU!!! YES WE ALLLL KNOW THAT TANNING BEDS GIVE YOU CANCER!!! BUT SO DO SMOKES & PEOPLE STILL F*CKN DO IT!!! STOP BEING A PACK OF JUDGEMENTAL COWS!!! AND ANSA THE ACTUAL QUESTION!!!|`|YpWNnPcHaa	er your tanning bed sounds broken. i've never been on a tanning bed where it tans your middle areas more. it sounds like you're going on it too long.. i dont want to sound like your mum but seriously you should never ever burn???!! dont go on it if you're still burnt!! and you dont look particuarly old, in the uk it is illegal for a 16 year old to go on a sunbed how old are you? sorry again dont want to sound patronising or rude! you possibly are a lot older i'm just letting you know how dangerous they can be!!|`|dDDAbqqhaa	you can buy bronzers from stores, they add a tanned effect, just not as strong as a natural or salon tan|`|UQWusO1waa	I will require a full nude body photograph to determine the cause of this thing.|`|lWEWhyTtaa	Or you could jut paint yourself orange and shoot concentrated cancer into your veins. Same thing, right?|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I think you just need to go to a better salon. They probably don't change their bulbs often enough. I never have trouble tanning my face.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Do not put oil on your face because they wont be looking at your tan they will be looking at your acne|`|X4U36dHzaa	well honey if want to be riddle with skin cancers all over your body keep on going to THE DEATH BED as we call them here in Australia cause they increase your chances of getting skin cancer by 70% so i woulnt be goin to these places anymore,trust me the was a women on the news all over Australia that went to a tanning salon only 7or8 times and she unfortunately passed away at the age of 26 so if this doesn't snapped you out of it,god help you cause you will visiting very soon if keep on going to these places! now there is a policy in place so the beds only give a certain amount of uv rays,but they still cause cancer big time,your better off getting a natural tan!co-co nut oil!  PS the shop owners dont tell you how much uv rays the bed give out so be carefull!|`|eaLuDhyfaa	bad for your skin...|`|fHNOiZP0aa	Dont use anything from home because the lotions you get at a tanning salon are made especially for the beds.  The oils and other ingredients you find at home have a tendency to ruin the glass or plastic parts of the beds.  Try lying onr your side instead of your back, that way your sides, arms and legs will get more exposure and your stomach will get less.    I would also suggest breaking down and getting a lotion at the salon, they work great, especially for arms and legs.  I really like Chocotini if you can find it....yum!|`|AqWJDMGSaa	unless u want skin cancer, you have gordeous skin, dont ruin it!!|`|hZ9omSataa	ur stoooopid, your going to get Cancer taaaaaarrrrrddddd!  STOP IT NOW!!!!  y would u do that???  pale girls are waaaaaay prettier than dark skin, especially if they are 'sposed to be pale!  Get a spray tan if ur so worried about being a white person.  Come ON!!!  Stop inviting cancer in2 ur body, sweetie pie!    (I tried not to sound racist, did it work?  I didn't mean 2 sound racist...I just like pale skin cuz tattoos look so well on it...)|`|kkM8vFfKaa	Tanning in a bed isn't nearly as healthy as tanning in the sun with some sunscreen. What teenies these days always assume is that you cannot get a tan if you're wearing sunscreen. WRONG. You can get a tan while wearing sunscreen, in fact, just as good as a tan as you would if you weren't wearing any... withOUT the sunburn. Tanning in the tanning bed is horrible for your skin. I would advise to slip on a cute bikini, go to the beach, and tan there. Oh yeah, the beach is free, also, and a lot funner in my opinion.    But, if you would like to fry your beautiful young skin, you could use the heavy tanning oil and when you get burnt just go to the bed the next day... keep repeating. Don't worry about the burn, it will go away with the more oil you use.  (^^ that was complete sarcasm)|`|efEsTQ9yaa	i use oil and it does help you tan faster one day i was in the tanning and i feel asleep and the lady can i was orange that's how long i was in there lol don't apply to much oil because u will get really orange and only do it for a little bit of time because that's how fast you tan so just make sure u apply it all over ur body and how fun and come out looking nice and if u want apply some lotion on ur body|`|W4sNRgs3aa	your increasing your risk of skin cancer I hope you know that  plus soon you'll start to look old,but do it anyways..whatever      spray tan is safer|`|s6BzNXRfaa	Banana Boat Tanning Oil with SPF 15, it'll get your skin tanner faster with out damaging it.   I don't know if you have it at home, but if you don't its only 7$|`|y6T6zMegaa	you should probably lay off the tanning for a while. You probably got the burns from tanning very frequently. Try to tan less because you could increase you chances of cancer!!|`|5gW0GCd4aa	Try an tanning salon, that should work!|`|SyagBw4Qaa	STOP! You're going to burn your skin, damage it, make it wrinkle, etc. You might even get skin cancer. The more you tan and try to make your skin look better, the more disgusting you will look...    TANNING LOTION IS FAR BETTER FOR YOUR SKIN BECAUSE IT MOISTURIZES, WHILE STILL ADDING COLOR. TRY THAT INSTEAD|`|sxyo17Zsaa	lol pale is beautiful! u dont need tanning oil! :)|`|LLBxpMc7aa	Yea sure why not tan?  Go ahead. What are the risks? Who cares, as long as you are tan its all good right? Its not like you could get cancer. Its not like skin cancer is the most deadly of all cancers.
yhgRaBPXaa	Keep your skin extremely moisturized. Use lots of aloe vera too!|`|X4U36dHzaa	aloe vera,it has to be from the plant,not bottled crap go straight to the source,grab a few leaves it does wonders!|`|LWyBbBxEaa	noxema will take the heat out of the sunburn|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	Just keep it really really moisturized and probably look into an alternate method of tanning because you're aging your skin very badly by doing this. Might look great now while you're younger, but as soon as you get a bit older watch out! Here comes an old leather sofa!|`|hUTkuOYmaa	Just keep doing what you're already doing and it will turn into a tan. But you shouldn't do this very often because you're damaging your skin and you'll start looking older than you really are.
GvZzhABCaa	I have a ridiculously round head too but I find if I keep my side sweep somewhat thin and my hair half way down my triceps at the longest it looks fine. If you have round eyes try and accentuate them, I got lucky with naturally big round eyes and I find that it makes your face look smaller when your eyes are prominent.|`|5JbARGHraa	I think our face stays the same unless you lose dramatic waste that you said you don't want to lose. Try pushing your bangs to the side, and curl your hair with loose curls... Draw the attention to your hair.|`|217f45ca54f30cb63e99ed07b568da05aa	if u can afford it go to a salon and ask them for a style that will compliment your face. they have pictures and can make suggestions. good luck|`|LLBxpMc7aa	Your face won't change shape because its your bone structer that determines the shape of your face so even if you stop eating (which is a horrible idea) it won't make your face skinnier    get side bangs     and get some confidence :)
Rh6BekvUaa	when you get out of the shower, immediately, part your hair on the sides and dry it out with a hair dryer and a comb.  then blow dry the roots with cold air and slowly go down the hair, so it stays.    :)|`|CrhV6u6yaa	when you get your haircut next, tell her to cut it with a part on the side. and mayb some sidebangs? but at an angle, no too short. like mid-face.|`|XAIurFZnaa	To kinda get rid of you're middle part, take a comb, and scratch the part with it (kinda hard, but not hurting) so that you'll mess it up and it will fade like at that minute (it should) and then do the side part how you usually do it, and see if it works, hope i've helped! :]|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	i have the same problem and i find if after i do my hair the way i want it that if i put bobby pins in it for a while it helps it stay that ways and if you do that while you are sleeping it helps tame your hair stay that way over time.|`|KUKDdAyFaa	After you shower, comb your hair to the part you want and blow dry. It may not work the first time so just keep trying it for a week. I remember when I was little and wanted my hair parted on the side. I'd gel it down over the weekend (when I wasn't seeing anyone) then after it got used to staying that way.|`|wCvnw9A5aa	I used to have the same problem. When you get your haircut I suggest telling you hairdresser about your problem. She cant cut your hair so that it will be easier to part. Other than that I suggest when your hair is wet part it to the side you want using a comb. Then blow dry them to your desired side and spray them with a little bit of hairspray. After that you can straighten them to help even more, though it is not necessary. When your hair is dry I would use some sort of styling wax, hairspray, or both!  I really hope this helped! In a few days you will notice that it is easier to get it in place without all of the products! Good Luck!|`|4q1LKBnNaa	bobbypin
ycvgQdSpaa	when you pick which side it's on, decided if you want it to be seen alot or a little then pick which side is showed more. like, i always carry my bags and books on my left side so if i didn't want everybody seeing it, i'd put it on my left side or vise versa(: also, this may take a while but pick a tattoo or a few styles and keep them on your desk and if you ever think for one second, you might regret that tattoo then ditch it and look at the rest everyday for a month (i did it for 6 months) to make sure you still like it. and still be careful, it's extremly painful, expensive, and disgusting to remove a tattoo, THIS IS PERMAMENT. even when your a saggy 80 year old, it'll still be there. also go to a well kown tattoo parlor, some reuse needles without wash and you could get aids ! be careful and good luckk.|`|LUxKhTlqaa	a cross bone on the left.|`|NWazPeE0aa	Tinkerbell on your left leg, left of the shin..

Really think about your past and important events that have happened. Anything really have an impact on you? Lose anyone close? Make sure you do your research on the shop and artist of choice. Look over their portfolio and if their work doesn't blow you away, search for someone else. Don't just rip off others art work, go to your artist when you've figured out what you truly want (and wont regret) and describe to them what it is you want. They will draw you up something and if you end up loving it get it, if not don't be afraid to tell them the changes you'd like to be made. good luck|`|l5zJ1bldaa	something meaningful to you.|`|RVwFYKwNaa	peacock feathers...     " Peacocks, and the colourful and flamboyant feathers (see Feathers) prominently featured in the extravagant tail display of the male Peacock have often been featured in tattoos, particularly those with an Asian or Far Eastern theme. We have all heard the expression, Proud as a Peacock. The expression was first used by Chaucer in the 14th century and still works today. Pride, vanity and strutting arrogance, those are the qualities we immediately attribute to the handsome Peacock. But its astonishing beauty -- especially its magnificent plumage -- has gained it a symbolic presence in temples, royal gardens, and even at the gates of Paradise, according to one Muslim legend."|`|WLvGFqAwaa	ask yourself questions. what's your personality, what colors do you like, what type of animal would you be, or ask people that really know you well.  And your side is a long area, you could get many beautiful designs or scenery tattooed there.  But most importantly, it needs to mean something.  If the tattoo is for fashion reasons, you may not like the design you chose in 5,10, 20 years from now.|`|3apyZmOBaa	Some guy on that show got his dog, coming out of a banana!    You should do something that symbolizes your life. (or something like that)    Japanese/Chinese letters are always cool!    You could look at some cool tats in the parlor or on other people.

So I vote, don't get one.|`|fHNOiZP0aa	I have three large tattoos and I am all for them too.  Kat Von D rocks!  But I always say you should wait for the idea to come to you...then think about it for a year at least.  That will guarantee that you won't regret it later.  Believe me, waiting one year isn't that hard with a life long thing like a tat.  PLUS, it will give you time to save up for the tattoo as well.  The one on my calf cost me over $1500!    Find a tattoo that means something to you, you will most likely cherish it longer than something that someone suggested to you on Yahoo Answers.|`|Wo6K4vPraa	every girl gets like butterflies or something but i like stars i seen a couple and they look cool or you could get like snoopy =p|`|jcy5hXQnaa	I know this might sound stupid  but in my head it looks nice  Lol  its like a rose, but like an emo one as people would say  but not so emo, red is there.  then there shud be like 2-3 roses,  then the vines curves nicely going down the side of your hip.

yqVojuXVaa	Yeah, I'm 13, and I think you do. Actually, I don't think you wear A LOT but you make it seem like you do. Because some people might wear 10 different things like blush, toner, lip gloss, etc, but it's all so natural or it's just for covering up that you can barely tell. But when you wear something like mascara, colours that are noticable, dark eyeliner, it'll look like a lot.|`|RI9itLSRaa	I think it sounds like a lot, but its hard to say without pictures. A lot of people wear tons of makeup and look very natural. Either way, I think you can eliminate the base if your wearing cover up..    I'm fifteen&I wear foundation, blush, light brown eyeliner, a little peach eyeshadow&mascara..So maybe hold off on all the makeup at least until your in high school (:|`|AaYEgDwWaa	No you Preteens need to stoping listeing to your dumb *** friends threre just jeaouls im 17 and I wear wayyy way wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more makeup then that I know I wear alor of makeup Im fine with it cause I love it|`|OT5J4U54aa	No. Most of it is on your eyes so I would say that's a no no....but if you wear coverup you could probably go without a base.

YES THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|QnNUo7diaa	for a 13 year old...  maybe just a tad bit to much   how about easing up on the eye make up....|`|Ciizvi3daa	I don't think you do. I have been wearing a lot of makeup since I was 12. And I like it. So in my opinion. If you like it then nope you don't wear too much. :)|`|fNUfpgjRaa	I don't think so.   I'm 13 years old and i wear all those things too and i never hear nobody complaining about it.

oEYrC1Wsaa	Can you Get L'Oreal Garnier Nutrisse where you are?   They have a great color range & with some of the blondes (depending on how dark yr brown hair is) doesn't require a pre-lightener.   I think Napro do a "Scandinavian" blondes range too.   The blondessimes may work but you might require an "ash coloured mousse" as a toner.      If you are concerned go into a Pharmacy or hair-colour/beauty shop (not a salon) & write the phone no. of the help line down (off the side of the box) & ring the relevant company before purchasing anything.  They will give you the exact instructions on how to achieve 'salon results' without salon prices. Good Luck:D|`|UD3jAqQ9aa	you have to bleach your hair if you want to go lighter.  bleach it then dying it the colour you want usually works well with good colour results but it damages your hair soooo much  you better off saving and going to a salon to get it done professionally !|`|c5QEtCPwaa	omg i have that same question. i have light ashy golden brown hair (its colored) and want to go dark ash blonde but im afraid itll turn orangy like last time. i think im gonna buy loreals dream blonde kit i heard its good and that it has a lot of prodcts 2 keep it from going brassy. but idk i still have my worries. i think im still going 2 buy it, and also im alo buying a brown colorbox just n case it turnsout 2 orangy.

6K1D6Azmaa	Eventually the hole will shrink down to a tiny hole.    But seriously, these people didn't do it right the first time. Go to a different shop unless they're redoing it for free. ?|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	The hole should reduce on its own, but you'll probably have a scar for years, at least.    The scar cream won't do much. It's really only good if you have a scar from a shallow cut. It won't work from scars from deep wounds.|`|eNPcNGSjaa	A scar cream isn't going to fill in a hole.  Scar creams reduce the appearance and redness of scars, they do not patch up holes in your skin.    Because it is a new piercing, take out the earing you don't want and the hole will probably grow in with little visibility.  Other than that you can really "fade" an earring hole.|`|AA11640839	If it's a new piercing, it should heal up really fast if you aren't putting anything in it. This is especially true if it's your cartilage.   I can't remember the name of the scar cream my doctor recommends, but I really don't think it will help.
WLuEIwp5aa	If it's what you want, get it.  Better to have a tattoo that some people might have some backwards opinions about than a tattoo that you don't totally love.    Hell, I'm almost done getting my entire side tattooed, from my boob all the way down to my upper thigh, and then I'm going to get most of my other thigh done and some of that side too.  Who cares what other people think?  If you want it, get it.  It's your skin, not anybody else's.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	i think it might look weird i was never big on tattoos just dont make some decent art work look trashy  and consider if you plan on using low cut shirts or backless do you want it all out there? esp bigger    its all a personal choice if you want it larger  and fix it up then do it if you do not wish to do it then dont.     personally id fix it up a little if it is really messed up but not make it any larger|`|UMg1CL7baa	nah. i think it would look pretty cool.|`|pluPzfVMaa	I think big tattoos look good on girls and guys! =)    If that's what you want then go for it! Be yourself and be happy!|`|n12YRU9paa	i think you should go for it i have one in the same spot it only looks weird when girls get them on there arms|`|WQbHHOJ4aa	I think that any kind of tattoos look nice on women....except tramp stamps...I'm not a fan of those.  But I like large tattoos...I think that anyone can pull them off if they're well done!|`|vljRwNbMaa	half of my back is covered in tattoo and Ive gotten so many compliments on it|`|rtx0YQDJaa	no way! girls with big tats are hot no matter what body type, well that's my opinion anyway.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I have large pieces and I get compliments all the time. The only way for a large piece to look bad is if you went to an artist that didn't know what in the world they were doing. Make sure your artist is amazing at cover-ups!|`|7XXTxFUmaa	big tats on girls makes you a lesbo|`|AA11927261	Who are you getting it for?  If you said for yourself then who gives a rats backside what "others" think.  I have seen skinny women with horrible large tattoos and plus sized women with really sexy ink.  A good artist will make sure it fits you and your body.

It should get better after a few days.|`|pNoCq63daa	just breath, focus on something else besides your new piercing. i had mine done a while ago and if it got uncomfortable i would soak it in sea-salt and warm water (they should have given it to you from the shop) but the warm water will soothe it.    good luck|`|OD3FqMaKaa	http://www.tellmehowto.net/howto/care_fo...      you can use ice cubes but this site gives you lots of help|`|4wr7HhIWaa	you wanted it so suck it up and deal with it.   i had it too and it doesnt hurt so stop complaining|`|RcvzWBraaa	Take a small glass of warm water and add a tablespoon of salt. Lay on your back and place the glass with the solution over your stomach and keep it there for 10-15 minutes. Also, hot compresses helped me out a lot!|`|s78yIb9caa	Sea salt soak will help it. Don't touch it. Be careful not to catch it and just remember it's there. Take a bath and it might feel better. It will get better in a few weeks.

altDLtTKaa	Revlon Colorstay  my skin is mix so i use revlon colorstay mineral foundation, it's one of the best for me and too long lasting..  but my cousin has a very oily skin, the only foundation that has served it and was recommended by a professional makeup was revlon colorstay pressed powder for oily skin, u can find it here: http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Pro...|`|u7o75zipaa	Since your skin is oily, a powder would be best for you.  I'd try L'oreal Mineral Powder.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	I really like Revlon Colorstay as it's good quality & also very good value.  other than that, I like Bobby Brown. Altho' I have tried her other ones & haven't tried the one for oily skin, I'd highly recommend trying it (u can go to their counterm ask them to match ur skin for right color & ask for a sample which u can try at home & see if u like it). It's called Oil Free Even Finish (also available as compact):  http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/pr...  compact:  http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/pr...  Altho' I prefer liquid as it's more controlable.    U might want to chek out their new one which is for all skin types & is supposed to look like "skin" not foundation.:  http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/pr...|`|bTYIIrpbaa	The best foundation that i have is Dream Matte Mousse because it doesn't look like there is much in the pot but you only need a tiny bit because it spreads really well. It is 6 and has lasted me over 5 months.|`|EcVR3LPCaa	derr are alott but it depneds how well it blends into your skin, because some foundations can turn people orange! personally i like maybeline dream matte mouse foundation you can find it in local stores like superdrug,boots e.c.t if you get a foundation you should get a sponge applicator so it comes out evenly and exfoliate and moistirize before applying so it comes out evenly :) hope this helps|`|NDJORGHeaa	Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish foundation is fab and will not make your skin any more oily or shiny. Lasts all days and gives a great finish. I have been using this Elizabeth Arden foundation for ages and it is one of the best. You can buy these for less than 10 from http://www.beautyparlor.co.uk|`|YJGEEJhWaa	Revlons foundation colourstay for oily to combination skin is very good, and is about 12 x    I also have Elizbeth Arden 'Intervene' which i like that was 27|`|mOJhj3ssaa	mearl norman, its a reasonable price, they try it out on you, & it last a really long time|`|f3tcE46Faa	Theres really a lot you could do. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.This is a good review website at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and read the reviews.|`|0W8xImLwaa	well i have hyperpigmentation and i've used everything outthere intil i've used makeup forever HD and it's really last long and covers well but if you want  real cover up you should try MAC and it is way cheaper than makeup forever|`|DQdYUF1daa	Ok, so if you're not worried about price you have to go with bare minerals. It is AMAZING stuff. It is a powder, but covers so well you would think it was a cream. It's very light so you don't even feel it. You can order it online through bare essentials. I got a deal through them that came with 2 months of foundation, a bronzing powder, what they call mineral veil which hides oily spots, a shimmer, and 4 professional sable hair brushes. I swear by this stuff. So, if you're truly not worried about price, go for it and you won't regret it.|`|PKBecNkGaa	It may sound kinda crazy being that I'm only 24, but I use the basic cover girl stay clean foundation....it covers really great and lasts all day. It's a classic beauty product that has stood the test of time unlike a lot of these "fad" make up companies. :)   Another suggestion though is revlon colorstay foundation, it covers great too, but MAKE SURE you get the right shade or it will look horrible.|`|o9muJ73yaa	I wear Sheercover and it is awesome, also try the concealer too, I have always worn it with the concealer and it makes my skin look flawless|`|dxWf70Khaa	The most amazing foundation (well the best one I have found) is Liquid Minerals from Bee Luscious.

Its quick and easy. Then make sure you use the tanning oil.|`|5PVFXry8aa	If you were any kind of cover up, that could be a good reason why your face isnt tan, almost every cover up has some kind of spf in it, plus your tummy and legs are in the middle of the bed!|`|GZVTLPwuaa	Your tummy and legs are right in the middle of the tanning bed.

atzw0IP4aa	After you find a solution to the breakouts, your skin will heal over time. I would try some kind of light foundation / half lotion (that does not block your pours) . It will tone down the red and look natural . Sometimes the way you clean your face is the results of the breakout (strips natural oils). Or, the foods you eat. Drink more water too.
qG4Gcfeoaa	I had the exact same problem and I am African American also. if you are using anything fruity (shampoo, conditioner, anything like that) in your hair STOP! I have been alternating between Motions and Cream of Nature Shampoo (I switch it up about every other month). Buy a heat protectant made for ethnic hair, as a matter of fact make sure that all of your hair products are good for ethnic hair. The next time you wash your hair condition it 1st, then wash it, then condition it again, put a plastic hair cap over your hair and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Also try a hot oil treatment every now and then. When/If you use a blow dryer don't use high heat. Brush your hair going upwards (or flip it over and brush it) that way you will be brushing the way your hair grows. But don't over brush. Wrap your hair with a silk wrap at night.Don't use too many hair ties on your hair and take them out when needed (especially don't use rubber bands for long periods of time.    After i started doing these things my hair began to show improvement very quickly, also don't forget to moisturize your hair at least every other night (depending on your method of doing so)|`|HS44HUrgaa	wow dude, that's a *lot* of hair falling out.  dont use pantene whatever you do. its terrible for hair.  id use garneir fructics protecting shampoo|`|KGToyCnqaa	okay. stop getting your hair relaxed, this is very damaging and is not worth it. try not to use heat at all, towel dry your hair for as long as possible, and hair dry when it is damp as this also makes your hair feel softer and silkier!   use a make called joico, you can find it on ebay here    http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Joico-Body-Luxe-Vo...    thats volumizing, but i think what you need is thickening as this will make it stronger and less likely to fall out. your hair also tends to fall out when you are stressed out so if you are stressed (you may not realise it) then try relax :D also, try not to brush your hair as much especially when it is wet as this is when your hair is at its weakest.     if you stick to this hair detox lol, within a few months your hair should be perfect.     another good hair product brand is redken, try not to use too many sprays and serums and waxes, just shampoo, conditioner, and a protective spray, as the products make your hair immune to them and put layers on chemicals on it.    hope i helped. xxxxxx|`|VvD3UTXgaa	You can use Henna Hut's Neutral Henna hair dye which is just a conditioning treatment.  It will make you hair healthier, stronger and shiner.  It can also help with any scalp issues you may have.  I have been using henna hair dye myself for a long time and don't even get split ends anymore.  You might have to do the neutral treatment a few times before it restored completely but, you will notice a change immediately.    You can get it online with complete instructions.    http://www.hennahut.com/hair_dye    They have great customer service that actually answers the phone if you have any questions.|`|2bZMxMitaa	I don't know if this will help, but when you wash your hair, warm water opens the cuticles to let in the shampoo and conditioner to clean your hair.

If it is a high powered bed, about 5 minutes. If it is regular or low powered, about 6-7 minutes.   Don't be eager like I was my first time, I stayed in for 15 minutes and came out a lobster! Even my eyeballs were red. lol    Gradually increase your time by 2 or 3 minutes. But if you burn, make sure you wait until your burn is gone before you tan again.    stay moisturized(=

MVsQ2xjIaa	no it doesn't plug out the folicals, only melt the hair on the surface of your skin that's why using depilatory cream is the same as shaving. You only get rid of the hair you see but not pulling it out like hair wax.  In 3 days the hair will grow out again just as for shaving.  It's not bad for your skin but if you use it on little bruises or whatever it is very bad|`|AA10858028	Veet melts the hair that it touches. It is a chemical reaction.

Proceed to line your eyes, just as you would if you were using an eye pencil, staying as close the lash line as possible.  Smudge your finger over your shadow, and proceed to "smudge" it on your eye lid, leaving the inner corners of your eyes alone. With your pinkie fan the shadow outwards. The naked corners will add dimension.  Finish off with a few coats of thickening mascara, remembering to zigzag upwards from the root of the lash to the tips.    Tips:    When lining your eyes, be sure to wet the brush. You want to create a dramatic look, so inky black is what we're going for. Try it a few times before going out to gauge how intense you want your eyes to look.  Always start with clean fingers. I suggest using your pinkie, because it forces you to apply the shadow with the lightest hand possible, preventing you for going overboard. Start on the outer edge of the eye, and simply press the shadow onto the lid without going all the way to the inner corner.  Don't be afraid of the "smudge" portion of the lesson. It is the main part of creating the smoky eye. Experiment with different textures of shadow to know what works for you, and don't be afraid of using this technique with other dark shades such as chocolate, navy or eggplant.|`|wjPoMK9Iaa	http://www.youtube.com/profile?gl=GB&hl=...    this girl has LOADS of tutorials, and theyre really good.  im sure shes got a few smoky eyes ones, and some nice mocha ones aswell.  xx|`|hJagdJIQaa	Okay it works way better with eyeshadow and liner but hey if you just want eyeliner:  Put liquid liner on your top lid and above your lower lash line.

Lighter at the top getting slightly heavier towards the lash. Apply a thick line of liner, don't worry about it being straight. Use your smudger to work the liner up until it's as dark or high up as looks good on you eye. Line and smudge the lower lid as well.

DONT touch your curls when they're warm.  good luck!|`|9yMRbtK5aa	try bunching the curl up in a spiral, bobby pinning it to your head, and spritz with hairspray.   also, you could consider layers to thicken up your hair to give it more body to help your curls stay (:|`|cEhmxuywaa	try putting a curling mousse in while your hair is still wet. also, be patient with your curling iron if you don't leave it in your hair long enough, the curls won't stay.|`|KIcnBGoQaa	Put some hairspray on it  ^^|`|9Qi7L1WWaa	check how many watts your curling iron is because that determines how hot it will get even if your iron says that its like 400 or 300 degress. for it to be really hot the watts would be around 170-250. i had a curler that was about 20 watts and it would not curl my hair.     if your curler has alot of watts and it still doesnt curl your hair then i would try spraying each piece of hair with hairspray before you curl it and try holding it on longer and spray it again while you are curling it. make sure when you are curling your hair you hold the curler horizontal and make sure you are curling it tightly.|`|ChyqsJ6Zaa	i know a girl with this problem.  her hair would never curl.  then when she hairsprayed sections, put it in rollers, hair sprayed it again and then slept in it, it was curly and stayed all day and even the next.  (which is kind of gross that she didnt wash it but it looked loose and pretty on day 2)  but it wasnt crunchy from hairspray and it was currrrrrrrrrrrrrrrly.  let me tell you!
4aGoWKtEaa	Do not get it. I was reading some reviews and it said it really hurt. It did not work. It just left your skin all red and raw and it is disgusting worst of all it barely takes off any hair. If you use it and put lotion after wards your either going to have a Lot of pain i mean it feels like getting stabbed by a needle a million times or your gonna a whole lot of pimples. The whole thing is a scam. A huge rip off. Doing it on your upper lip will be much more worse.|`|kgwcYjeqaa	Its crap, Dosen't work at all, you have to rub and rub and rub for about 5 mins and even then barely any hair is removed and i have very thin hair on my legs.  After all the rubbing my skins all dry and red and sore.  Shaving is much quicker.  They advertised on t.v for it being $14.99 and you get one free.  Well the shipping was $33.99 and they never notify you about the shipping.  After you place the order you click on "submit" and thats it you don't even get an email confirmation.  I paid 3 times as much just on the shipping.      Its such a scam|`|aX4s2bh7aa	Oh i want it too. I saw it at walgreens and its 9.99. The lady at the cash register said she loves it and it works really good for her. I wana go and buy it soon =)

Anyone can look good in hollister b/c their outfits are so simple. nothing exaggerated nothing s p e c i a l.   B/c your skin is darker you try different colors (same with White Asians and Latinos) as long as your "flaws" are hidden (if u consider there are any flaws. outfits can create illusions, make you seem slimmer, taller, even broaden the shoulders or fatter. watch out)  Im in HS and well, too much Asians wear the same outfit,hollister,abercrombie,AE. its sick [mind u im female&azn too. and NY has tons of Asians :D]|`|zBvXHu22aa	I love american eagle and I think guys look great in their clothes!!

So take the tablets - 2 in the morning and evening,     but also buy an oil - any oil will do even oilve oil that you rub into your nail base every time you get a chance... massaging the nail base will help simulate growth (nail bitters when they stop tend to have nails that grow quicker, as they are stimulating them all the time by nibbling - but dont nibble!)    I would suggest when you watch tv, rub for about two minutes into each nail base - it does help :)    Good Luck|`|nNtSmkE1aa	either take vitamins   or go to the nail shop and tail the you want crystal on ur regular nail no addition to it just Regulus nail|`|Vb39EH9Waa	eat other peoples nails i hear that works, also the bunghole method works 2|`|WqmnQNp6aa	It is not possible to make your nails grow faster - so don't waste your time and money on any of the pills, potions, or lotions that claim to be able to do it.

Lastly, use pink eyeshadow below the pencil liner, and use yellow on your top lid.|`|AVC6ehuNaa	oh em gee.!  i do make up really good.  wish i cud try on u.|`|e0urnErUaa	its pretty    fake lashes|`|3Oi7OJSMaa	Apply shakestick all over your eyelid and a stripe beneath the eye. Then, use a vibrant yellow to fill your whole eyelid and a bit above. Next, use a pink to make a line on the bottom. After, get a really dark, black eyeshadow, mix it with water, and apply it on some of your eyelid, as shown in the pic. Top it off with liquid liner. Last, use a big mascara to spread out those lashes.|`|7Wu2RQVraa	here hopefully this helps  the colors are not the same but you can substitute them out for the colors you want     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJJlaJmCH...
i38Ev1Zaaa	spray your hair before you curl, brush it through, then curl your hair, and spray right after your hair gets off the iron (DONT SPRAY IT ON THE IRON!).    Also, what type of iron are you using? if your hair curls easily, but the curls dont hold, it could also be that your iron isnt getting hot enough to form your hair into a long lasting curl.    I recommend a hot tools curling iron, which you can find for about 30 dollars at stores like ulta, or via folica.com:  http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...      if your on a budget, you should keep a lookout for a Wigo iron. They're decently cheap when found on sale, and they curl your hair quickly, and keep the curls in all day long:  http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...    good luck!|`|f3e7c4c036dc8907e1a513f5a173f5daaa	during the day why not spritz a bit of water on your hair and scrunching it with your hands upside down, the water will reactivate the product and the scrunching will put more body in it|`|07A1bCkyaa	I have really thick and coarse hair too (except I'm Asian). My friend curled my hair once, and she used a special hair spray for curly hair. She sprayed it once, curled my hair with a curling iron, and sprayed again. The curls stayed in for three days straight!|`|mjJKvxEkaa	What kind of shampoo do you use? Usually if it works good for your hair the brand usually also has hair spray which should work!|`|pHxYgXOqaa	idk if this will work b/c we have different hair.. my hair is light and silky.. but if u do this the night before it should work... wash your hair the night before and put moose in it, preferably a curling/scrunching one, it'll hold the curls better the next day when you hold them. hope this helped.

1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	I love how guys think that they can block a girls slap.... unless its extremely predictable, they have martial arts reflexes and the girl brings her arm around slowly, no you can't really. Unless you put your arm up at the same exact moment and happen to be lucky. If you were slapped you probably deserved it no offense... as amusing as it'd be we don't go slapping people for no reason xD    I can block a punch and stuff since I'm a martial artist. But if a girl wants to slap a guy, she's gonna slap a guy.|`|rnQoZaELaa	just grab her arm??|`|xk5XK6CPaa	ummmm someone on here asked tht sammeee exact question like every month id find tht.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Why did she slap you?|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Wooow..hahahahaha....love the story. Dude just stay at home I think you will be safer there.|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	You put both forearms up on either side of your head, like you're placing a hat on your head, that way nobody can hit your face. Then lift  your leg up and kick straight forward like you're ramming a door open with your leg. Practice on your couch or against a wall at home. Don't kick like a soccerball, kick like you're stomping in a door. Both arms around your head, and stomp-kick forward right into her gut. That'll keep her away from you.    Fighting never solves anything, but you should at least be able to keep someone off of you if they're trying to hurt you.    Ok then. Peace!!!|`|MNl2HmXRaa	No you can't block it, you will feel our wrath..|`|bg86ji6naa	You sound slow and childish. Why don't you just not put yourself in that position?|`|05aKFYl5aa	if you have a fast reflex you can grab her hand before it reaches you.|`|e0urnErUaa	thats not a makeup qustion|`|77a6f94018eaab3cf1e42502c3817012aa	She ***** slapped you.  So you gotta pimp slap her.  Which is performed with the back of your hand in a sweeping upwards motion.  That'll do the trick.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	she slapped you.  dont just stand there, punch the ***** in the face.  unless youre a guy. then be a man and just walk away.|`|46R7Ypxzaa	yes put your arm out so her arm will hit it then grab her arm with your other hand and twist it out and then knee her in the gut ( it works ive tried it)|`|vjC5FVDaaa	B down B up down down left A A A     Thats how you block it.|`|MCjHAtdRaa	yeah i know how to block it...    don't get in fight  it's not attractive|`|L7d3PSgLaa	you cant block that  its a trick everyone knows  unless you know its coming you cant block it unless you put your hands in front of you face|`|nLXfeQbpaa	tell her to back the **** up and dont slap you like a *****.   I wouldn't ever talk to her again. She should not hit you for no reason like that.   Unless of course you did or said something to deserve it.|`|LsUCS654aa	I don't think you can block that....|`|71wows1waa	well the move looks like shes about to kiss her hand but if you want to block it if you say something and you see her make a face that means you said something bad about her, her family, her friends etc. so when you see a face you know you said something wrong so then just tell her i got to go.
GHci7XBXaa	Ok, first off, stop messing with the piercings lol. There's a reason they tell you not to change them too much until they're healed.    Anyway, clean them daily with antibacterial soap (I've had better experiences with it than the solution they give you at mall piercing places and whatnot). Try not to touch them much for a while longer since it would seem they aren't fully healed yet, and really, it's too early for them to be fully healed at this point honestly.     DON'T use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide as that dries out the piercing too much and impedes the healing process.    Your ears aren't infected, as far as I can tell. That clear, slightly smelly crap coming out of the piercing is lymphatic fluid, totally normal stuff, and if I'm right, it dries on the piercing and gets all crusty and gross, right? Just clean it off with warm water.     Short answer- use antibacterial soap on them once a day, give them a few weeks with the starter studs (or whatever you had in) before you try to change them again and be patient.    Good luck :]|`|hZ9omSataa	pus means infection, so if you are seeing pus you may have an infection, go get a script of ATB from your Dr. or clean it with ETOH...|`|1jToUfoOaa	GO TO A DOCTOR|`|LLBxpMc7aa	use rubbing alchohol and really clean your peircing out every day in the morning and before bed|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	it will clear up soon.  likea month maybe , i h vehad mine pierced for almost a year   that happened , it smlls like fish/rotted cheese/milk and it is gooey and icky. so i let my ears close up , and then two yrs later i got them pierced again , well the SAME thing happend to me the second time so i just cleaned it with that cleaning stuff and washed it 4-5 times a day with alcohol. on the weeekends when i wouldnt go out , i bought these medicated little circle strips with medicateed stuff onit / alcohol and they worked great . .  i can wear cheap and hoops , its fine  DONT WORRY if  a little ball on your lobe grows where your ear is pierced thats normal.|`|9035ecc230615edb7a8f8452d54d7898aa	If it smells you have an infection.  You need to see a doctor before you end up losing your ear.  Yeah the infection can get so bad that the ear lobe will literally rot off.  Ewwww.

hOVzviFIaa	I have worked in a hair salon for awhile and seen plenty of "bitchy customers" and the ones who come in for a color corrections are NOT one of them!    It is good that you noticed, so go back in (or call), tell them what you had done and show them what you want fixed and ask them what the fee for a "quick color fix" would be. They should say it is free, all good hair salons want to keep their customers, and a small touch-up like that is nothing.    Definitely not a b*tchy thing to do!|`|UqouUmsNaa	i think that you should go back.   i mean all you have to do is tell them that the bangs are not how you like them because you like clip them back...dont worry you are not being a b***h by doing this, its just the facts. Make sure you tell them though that you love the rest its just that one part.
Zv7sXMbTaa	depending on how thick your hair is it might not even dry over night. and also it is not good to wear your hair up while you sleep. the hair tie actually pulls and breaks your hair! and if it dried it would come out wavy. but you would have the mark of your hair tie on the top of your hair.

MJz7ZRXraa	hey hun, im a hairstylist!..  alot of people have oily/ greasy hair. i do,..and it just depends if you have overactive sebaceous glands. everyone has sebaceous glands in their skin/ scalp..everywhere except your palms and under your feet. sometimes your skin is just prone to having overactive sebaceous glans which is okay. sebaceous glands are where your oil comes from in your skin. its actually a good thing because they help lubricate your skin and scalp and help so your scalp or skin dont dry out. as weird as it sounds,..its normal.. but its life. their is also other reasons to why your hair/skin is greasy. you are what you eat. so if you eat alot of greasy foods,.etc.. it comes out of your skin through your pores. .. also another reason why your hair is greasy.. you might be using the wrong shampoo,..or wrong conditioner..and mabey using conditoner wrong, if you notice that your hair is greasy,..you need to buy shampoo for greasy hair. if you buy ones that say "moisture"..its basically putting more "oil"..or more like moisturee into your hair that you alredy have. and even if your hair is greasy but yet you have dry hair.,.,its usualy your ends that are dry,..not your head., so when you shampoo ..make sure you use the right one and wash it twice with shampoo..and try using only a lil condiotner on your ends only. if you put conditioner all over your head its guna make your hair more greasy becuse condiotner has alot of moisture, so take caution when doing so, and also try training your hair. only wash it every 3 days. also change up your shamppoo and conditoner,..it sometimes helps cuz ur hair gets too use to the same shampoo and makes it dull. ..and a little secret is if your really in a rush and dont have time to wash your hair..get some baby powder and sprinkle it a little in your hair and use your hands to smooth it in.,.. the powder will dry up the oily look and you wont be able to tell !.. but dont put too much cuz u will see the powder,  if you have a little dandruff,..its normal. if its alot of dandruff,..see a hairstylist maby they can help you work that out or give you advice about it, sometimes its just a means of finding a good shampoo..or just washing it. dandruff sumtimes means your scalp may be dry in sum areas and the skin starts to flake off. sometimes a good scalp massage treament and scalp treatment can help...with your hair being greasy..its more due to oil thats in your follicle which is in your pores thats in your cuticle which is attached to your hair that growns out of it. hard to explain but try a scalp treatment . if your ends of your hair are dry.. you might need a lil trim on your ends. your hair wont grow properly,..nicly because its splitting up the hairshaft and makes it look dry and ruff. a lil trim now and then can help that. but if you starighten your hair or dye your hair alot..it will deffintly cause your hair damage and dryness. ..cowlicks in your bangs are normal..i have one too., try parting your hair a different way and blowdry it like that and it will stay.,you just gota train it.. it will take time,,hope i helpd.  if you have any question feel free to msg me!. xox|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Head to Shoulder Shampoo and I would only condition your hair maybe every three days.|`|EeBpGOQPaa	yeah buy some head and shoulders right away and dont condition it every day, only like 3 times a week. good luck|`|ChyqsJ6Zaa	i use pantene too.  but not every day.  i use head and shoulders dry scalp care 3-4 days a week.  (it helps with dandruff control for me)    those days i dont condition.  then the other days that i dont use head and shoulders, i use pantene shampoo and pantene conditioner.  but i use much much less conditioner than shampoo.  when applying conditioner put it more so at your ends and not so much at your roots. if you put it at your roots it weighs your hair down more and makes it greasy (at least it does that to me)    best wishes!|`|LEUaHjFJaa	my side bangs are really greasy to. sometimes if you dont wash all the conditioner out of your hair then that can happen. Also make sure you wash and rinse your bangs very well. You should also striaghtner your bangs cause that can help with the grease and you should try putting a straightning product on your bangs. what you do is you put the product on your bangs and then right after flat iron your bangs. it works great for me.|`|zUANF1ydaa	yea, head and shoulders is good, but it wil take a little while, so be patient, also, if it gets super oily:  this might sound weird, but on sunday, at night, wash the oily part with toothpaste (it will help, trust me) use only a little, then either later on that night or inb the morning, shampoo it|`|tXMDzQ9jaa	don't wash it every day. doing so can actually dry out your hair and then your hair will naturally make a lot of oil to replace it. try just washing it every other day. hope this helps! :]|`|pumHqbjiaa	Well maybe washing your hair every day is the problem.  But to reduce the oiliness, use conditoner only on the tips of your hair and shampoo mainly only on the roots.    =]|`|MfvhpvAbaa	Use a dryscalp shampoo like Head & Sholders. It helps restore ur hair and helps w/ the greesy-ness!|`|yMuCMQk9aa	My friend has the same kind of hairstyle and problem.  Hers gradually stopped, but she found using really light conditioner, and only on the ends helped. Also,she found using different really light moisturizer, here you can buy one by a brand called "simple" helped, because her bangs were always touching her face so it helped. A good shampoo is probably tea tree or tea tree with anti dandruff, but generally if you look at labels and they say "for greasy hair" it should help (: and try and condition your hair less.|`|fO2a2eeYaa	GARNIER FRUCTIS !  you wont be disappointed

RVwFYKwNaa	I've never actually seen a metallic tattoo. I'm not sure if it's able to pulled off. Maybe in grey... Also, you'd have to consider your skin tone, the lighter you are, the more vibrant the colors show up. I have a friend who is around the same coloring as Seal, and the colors don't show up as well on her skin. Anyways, I wish you the best of luck. I'm sure whatever tattoo you get it will look awesome.    you also want to make sure that the tattoo artist is clean, and that the needle is fresh. Hygiene is so vital when you're getting a tattoo    the link below has some risks, it's from the mayo clinic.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	First of all, go google the tattoo shop your going to. read the reveiws. make sure, others think its a good place. Then, call ahead, make sure you don't need an appiontment, and then, when you do go in. Drink lots of water that day. Don't take any pain meds cuz they can make your blood go out of whack, and you don't want to bleed too much. Then, take a water bottle with you just in case you get lightheaded. Maybe something to snack on right before. Then, if you can,  bring something to keep you distracted, like an ipod or a friend. Make sure you ask questions tho. when you get there, ask how they clean the equiptment, and how long that particular artist has been wokring on tattoos. Then, Make sure they have a printout of EXACTLY what you want. If your getting words, make sure they're spelled right, if a pic, make sure its detailed. GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY TATTING!!!

9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	I like larger women to an extent. I like women with curvy figures, not those bony, anorexic models. Many people are making fun of Jessica Simpson but I actually like her new figure (though her wardrobe is another issue). However, there's a certain point at which a woman can be too large. Queen Latifah and Rosie O'Donnell are definitely on the too large list. However, it's ok to carry a few extra pounds.|`|AA10451072	Eh, I like skinny/toned  girls.

I've got two myself, and I love them. One is of a palm tree, odd I know, but I love it still. It's unique, and I don't know too many people, if any, who have just a palm tree. My next is *hopefully* a peacock feather... :-)|`|DiWtE0Ksaa	i wouldnt get a tattoo ppl say it ruinds ur blood and maybe jobs wont hire ppl with tatoos .....idk that is wat they tell me but if ur heart is into it go for it !!

B3jpU4Jraa	make yor layers short and cut your hair short make sure you flip the layers each day and that will give the effect of thicker hair|`|hBHA006haa	Two inches below the shoulder, choppy at the bottom. Whatever you do, DO NOT dye it. You do not want it any thinner. If you deep condition and get some shampoo that they have now for post cancer patients it will help with the thickness. Use that for about a year. Yay, I know, long time. Then you can probably dye it. Highlights and lowlights are okay for now.|`|OLYnyXb9aa	i think you should shave your head and wear a hat. there are very in style now.|`|kJjO63p0aa	get a short haircut|`|jpF5rd2Paa	mohawk  bald  taper  dreads|`|t1rn1jDBaa	cut it just above ur shoulders that would look very good|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	do a side bang not straight down the middle|`|w1pbRmazaa	SHAVE IT ALL!!!!!!!!|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	side bangs

But some stores would be Fairweather, Le Chateau, cute boutiques...like in Toronto there's this store called Studio We! on Queen St.East and it had cute dresses, and they weren't too expensive. Umm...Bebe, BCBG, A|X, and if you're lucky, Forever 21.

TBRMH4hbaa	To make your hips look bigger, get a lighter brighter color. Which means definately don't get black. I'm not sure the brightness of the other colors but a pink or red would probably be ideal.|`|AA11481224	any really but i would go with number 4|`|Azz6U6Woaa	red or topaz !|`|njF45Ihgaa	umm, either 3,6,or9.|`|lPzoVwjXaa	Topaz definitely.

Try making a necklace out of plain plastic pony beads (or try saying that 5 times fast), or better beads if you have them. Put your hair in two braids if you have long hair. Just make sure you don't freeze.
vxipI3Wjaa	Its just a back combed French Twist
GhetCx0iaa	Yes, they work totally fine.  If you're hard-core lightening skin person, you can use bleach, alot of people do.  But i didnt say anything~~~~~~~~~~~~ :**    Be happy with who you are :)  NILA|`|YtpN4YXIaa	I'm not sure|`|Twq7efhQaa	This is what you need all together:    Mix one teaspoon of powdered milk, one teaspoon of honey, one teaspoon of lemon juice, and a half of teaspoon of almond oil. When using this mixture, you apply it to the face and wash it off after it has been on for ten to fifteen minutes. This special combination will add shine to the skin and it will also remove the tan. Another special mixture that is included in the best home remedies for dark skin is a mixture of oatmeal with tomato and curd juice. You apply this mixture to your face and leave it on there for twenty minutes and then you will need to wash it off with some cold water. This will help to remove the tan and it will also lighten the skin    Also it doesnt matter if it lemon or lime as they are both acids...|`|bTYIIrpbaa	OMG NEVER USE BLEACH ON YOUR SKIN!!!!!  NEVERRR! Yes lime will work but please dont bleach your skin that is the most stupidest and painfullest idea i have ever heard!|`|JbSebJJYaa	I wouldn't use any of them !    -Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|lBRud4y5aa	Why are you not grateful for the skin you are in? Citrus fruits will not lighten skin. More likely to give you dermatitis. Dark skin can be very attractive to all, including us whities, like me. I used to fancy P.P. Arnold in my younger days (probably before your time).|`|NvoOGU3yaa	yes,it will totally work
r4i7xPnMaa	Y'know, I tried MAC mascara a couple times with high expectations. It wasn't that great.    CoverGirl Lash Blast is currently my favorite, along with L'Oreal Telescopic.|`|FftR5yToaa	Covergirl LashBlast is amazing!|`|nl7tkxc3aa	Try not to get duped to believe that expensive mascaras will work best.  YSL; is rubbish=]      LashBlast; covergirl is the best.|`|AQxqS7Kyaa	Estel Laudre    Or that elizabeth one|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Clinique High Impact is the best that I have used, the first girl doesn't know what she's talking about, when it comes to mascara you get what you pay for|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	rimmel is good and CG is like amazing but if your looking for the GOOD stuff than like lancome or Chanel or YSL !|`|CPZe3g74aa	It really depends what kind of mascara your on about.    Rimmel do brill lenghtening mascaras.(esp d new purple 1!!! AMAZING!!)    Boots' No7 mascaras are great for seperating lashes    Miss Sporty mascaras aern't the best    Loreal is great (well thats what I think!! lol )    **************************************...|`|arfdXyy7aa	MAC- you can buy online or at macys|`|JbSebJJYaa	I LOVEEEEEE the Dior Mascara !  It's amazing     -Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|iFAlZfVMaa	I've done high end department stores and bottom rung drugstores and I have to say my favorite is the new LashBlast by Cover Girl.  Department Store lines are a rip-off... same (or worse) products as Target.    However, my one MUST have with any mascara is primer... lashes are thicker and there's less flaking and smudging.|`|ObxU6FVmaa	Sexy Curves - Rimmel London    It curves and volumises, and it has a new triple pump brush, its amazing. BTW I agree with the first person, most expensive isnt always the best, I tried Benifit BadLash, and it was terrible.|`|o9muJ73yaa	I swear by Loreal Voluminous....apply one coat and then blow dry it and apply a second coat and guaranteed that you will receive compliments on your lashes|`|altDLtTKaa	Lash Blast by covergirl  best to me, because it's outlasting and make your eyelash look bigger and better|`|FVDJMWDEaa	the best ive used is Lash Blast. i'd be lost without it|`|3dmMvaisaa	MAC it's the best !!|`|jXqaK611aa	I use Max Factor. All their brushes are rubber and make your lashes appear really prettily long, while some just make your eyelashes look unnaturally HUGE. Because of the brush, it NEVER clumps, which is really important.|`|dz6GcV6Zaa	I think Hypnose by Lancome is the best mascara you can get if you want really long lashes. It really fans them out and defines them. But, it might be pricey for some people.    Diorshow Blackout is ace if you want a false lash effect. It makes lashes really black and if you curl them, they'll definitely look like false lashes. The downside, is that a tube of it is expensive.    A cheap alternative is Maxfactor's Masterpiece Max. Its wayyy better than some other brand mascaras.|`|J9xCcWFRaa	So far I've had the best luck with Cover Girl mascaras, especially the Lash Blast and Volume Exact ones. I haven't had any luck with Maybelline mascaras except the Colossal one.|`|dxWf70Khaa	The best mascara is Bee Luscious High Def. Mascara. It works as good as Dior but it won't flake off like Dior does sometimes.

0RAzOuQraa	Maybelline's Dream Matte Mousse Foundation is the one I use, its so creamy and easy to put on, and looks so natural! It leaves your skin looking perfect and smooth, and looks great on any type of skin! I have dry skin too, and i bought pressed powder, and my skin was visibly dry and uneven, so Dream Matte Mousse was a great help! http://www.maybelline.co.uk/PRODUCTS/Fac...  hope this helped!  xx|`|Flrnnme1aa	As a professional makeup artist for over 20 years I highly recommend the following:      Liquid Minerals:    http://www.beeroyalproducts.com/store/pr...    Powder Pressed non flakey or cakey:    http://www.beeroyalproducts.com/store/pr...|`|V2AML53Taa	Go to Belk and have a  free makeover done!  I went to Lancome yesterday.  Tommorrow I will try Estee Lauder and another day Clinque and so on till I find out which one I like best.  Then I will buy just the foundation from there.  I have tried all the kinds in Target and Walmart and nothing works good for me.  Its always off an hour after I put it on.  Yesterday it stayed on all day! and it looked so natural.|`|aJFVCGOgaa	Dream matte mousse is good   that's what I use it is really good as it isn't to dry or gooey!  x|`|THKwNaU9aa	You should try Rimmel Long Lasting 16hr foundation depends on your skin tone but if you are light like me go with 103. It's the best thing I have used it lasts all day, it doesn't smudge easily, I also have dry skin so it helps me protect that, and it's enriched with minerals. Just give it a try you can get it at any department store, I would suggest at Wal-Mart or Kmart.|`|GtSYXc9Eaa	I would also try putting a moisturizer on your face before applying foundation and depending on the type of foundation I like to dampen the sponge a little before applying it.    hope this helps.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	if you're having trouble then go to sephora.  i was having trouble finding the right colors and brand, and the ladies there helped me until i was satisfied.  plus, you can mix brands.  if you use one brand of foundation, that doesn't mean you have use the same brand all over.|`|vYyIpxo9aa	I love Bare Minerals by Bare Essentials   It covers EVERYTHING.   and its really good for your skin- you can even sleep in it!|`|jgTvzlUlaa	You most moisturize your skin before doing any makeup.  Then try a liquid foundation.  Specifically from Clinque or different high end brand like that.  Then, if you need it, put a little pressed powder on top of that.|`|0aWn1Ip5aa	For dry skin, try an oil based makeup such as L'oreal quick-stick or Max factor pan-stick or foundation.  Also, a mousse is really good too, as someone already mentioned.  Avoid oil-free types, because your skin is dry already.      You can forgo the powder if you want, or use one that's not oil or shine free.  Shine free kinds are really best for women with oily skin types.
fCSGDpROaa	I would say love lorn.  But if you really want an amazing pink get Angel lipstick.  It is my all time favorite.|`|Flrnnme1aa	Neither and both are hard to work with it gets clumpy.|`|q9BItD25aa	Speed Dial,,,,,,,,,?|`|bOBGD3j3aa	speed dial|`|IIpEaDCcaa	speed dial|`|ZUD25nA3aa	speed dial!|`|aJFVCGOgaa	lovelorn  I really like it I don't know why|`|0RAzOuQraa	Speed dial is a younger look, quite girly, but if your going for a more mature and sexy look, I'd go for lovelorn.  I personally prefer speed dial.
ZUD25nA3aa	yepp. i tried licking mine and it didn't taste like cherries, it just smells like cherries... :( Very disappointing|`|58THMcy5aa	No it does have the flavour.|`|IUgkylWqaa	You're not supposed to eat the sh!t.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	Uhhh ...REALLY IT'S CHAPSTICK IT'S NOT SUPPOUSE TO BE EATABLE IT SMELLS LIKE CHERRY NOT TASTE LIKE CHERYY HONEYq!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG PEOPLE ARE SO DUMB THESE DAYS WELL WE ALL CANT BE|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Yes, that's true.  It smells really good but doesn't have a taste at all.|`|l2rNPQYqaa	I think it smells good, and actually, if you wet your lips then put it on, it tastes like cherry.|`|4PkRBYkPaa	I think that is the point.  It is supposed to help with chapped lips, not taste good.
yhgRaBPXaa	Are you talking about a piercing?    It might not be pierced deep enough. Mine was pierced really deep and has lasted for ten years. My best friend got hers done and it was too thin. It grew out. You might have to have it redone. Sorry!
9VB4uWhMaa	I think it's time to switch makeups.  You need a makeup that will last all day long.  Try different brands until you get something that works for you.    Good luck|`|Flrnnme1aa	As a professional makeup artist I recommend Bee Luscious pore perfecting primer, liquid minerals and if desired pressed powder.    http://www.beeroyalproducts.com    Also the medicated acne spot treatment will blast acne good buy forever.|`|jgTvzlUlaa	It depends on the quality of your concealer.  You may need to bring your concealer to school/work to reapply it.  I have an amazing concealer pen that has an Illumia side and a Concealer side.  The Illumia side is lighter than the concealer side for this reason.  It's by Vincent Longo, and is probably very expensive.  But it is definitely worth it!  It saved my life!  :P|`|jRmR0NrQaa	If you have some redness, try using a concealer corrector that has green in to neutralize the redness and then apply your concealer over, if its left a scar, you can use a good concealer, I like make-up Forever and NYX.|`|pr1sr54naa	i have acne and i use benifit dr feelgood balm to even my skin texture it makes skin so smoooooooth so makeup is easy to apply, then tinted moisturiser the no7 mouse foundation then any concealer that matches skin tone paint on with concealer brush dab with sponge an the use pigmented mineral makeup powder in circular motion on acne area then brush it all over face for total coverage. trust me thats how to cover up London style. I am a model and thats how you hide EVERYTHING.
yhgRaBPXaa	I had both ears pierced with a gun. One ear was fine, and the other one started developing a knot in the ear. I took the ring out, and it eventually went away. I would go to a reputable body piercer to have it done.|`|JduQHocdaa	It's true,and it's completely unsanitary. In my state it's illegal to have it pierced with a piercing gun. 2 of my friend had it done in another state one got the "cauliflower" ear,and the other had a really bad infection. Stick with the needle, it's more expensive for a reason. They use the proper tools,that are sterilized.|`|WR9NuZFiaa	you shouldn't get it done with a piercing gun. It could shatter the cartilage and increasing the chance of infections. Try getting it done with a needle it is a lot safer.|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	I have had mine done 2x's with a gun and been with friends who have it done, it does nothing like that, just pierces it like normal....nothing to worry about!|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	needle is better... and less dangerous  check out these websites ;)|`|cVhuFVWSaa	I would definitely suggest going somewhere that will use a needle. Complications with cartilage piercings are very common, and much more so when a gun is used. Chances are you will get scar tissue built up (like a hard bump at the site or the piercing) if you use a gun. Needles actually cut out a hole in the skin where the studs in a gun will just push through the ear and displace the skin!|`|c8e5c89c1dc331721052c8eb011d29a0aa	I have had my cartilage pierced with a gun, it wasn't fun, but i can't imagine it would be no matter how i did it. It didn't get infected or shatter (which sounds impossible to me)  I got it done at Claire's.|`|f650668c14b2d6c103dc37b0b2affbc4aa	Piercing guns are unsafe in general.   They are unsanitary, and can never be fully sterilized the way piercing equipment is.    Piercing guns use an ear stud with a pointed back to push through your ear. Since this is not too sharp at all, what it ends up doing is forcing skin from the outside of your ear to the inside, resulting in scar tissue, and small, but visible bumps.     Not only is it very painful to pierce your cartilage with a piercing gun BECAUSE it is so dull, it will also take longer to heal. Most piercing shops charge between $10 - $30  to pierce your cartilage, but its worth it, plus most of the offer free aftercare products.

I have a stylized chinese influenced one. I strongly reccommend not getting your calf muscle tattooed btw|`|4S3pvbK0aa	if you tell more about it i could help
M8zLiySJaa	Seeming as you helped me :)  http://ear-piercings.com/wp-content/uplo... Thats a conch on there :D  A dermal punch is where they get a kind of needle that takes out, a whole lump of flesh to make the whole a bigger sized.  http://echohelloworld.com/wp-content/upl... :)  Enjoy now :D
df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	glad to hear the diet worked for you.  i unfortunately am stuck with scars for life.  aside from having skin discoloration, i have small craters on my cheeks.  these don't go away without some kind of skin treatment (microdermabrasion, laser).  now i use bare minerals to cover up scars.  i get pretty good coverage with that.|`|MAaub5YUaa	I am totally w/ you on that. I started doing the same thing as you 2 mouths ago and the only acne on my face is from being a teen.
sxamG3u1aa	No It does not. I got mine pierce and Im terified of needles and Im a sissy for pain. the whole process goes so fast that after its done you feel kinda of silly for being so scared.hehehe|`|7fl1T1k5aa	hm prolly only for the second|`|vlpmnEeLaa	when i got mine, yes it did hurt!!! i got the middle of my lip not the side and seriously i ended up taking it off that same week because it was bugging me. i would suggest getting the side of the lip pierced better!!!|`|qfe5GOcMaa	it looks ugly on every 1|`|6GcS2r1vaa	yes it hurts only if it gets infected tho...so take care of it., but it looks perrrty.. =)|`|NijqYSMJaa	its doesn't hurt at all :] thankfully!  my lip peircing was my first body peircing besieds my ears. it was so easy after i had it for a while i let it close and then got a monroe. and thats that im 13.|`|wlB0kTjdaa	It really doesn't hurt. It was a quick pinch. I have made a few videos on youtube, about lip piercing. you can check them out =D     Click on the source to view the video|`|mFYBg5BKaa	I don't think you should get your lip pierced. You should get you nose pierced, on the side, you know? You would look sexy with one. And/or your tongue. The tongue doesn't hurt, I have mine pierced.|`|RqcLxDesaa	I got a snakebite, and yes it hurts. Actually it was worse the next day because it got very swollen which made it hard to eat or talk. It healed rather readily, but problems I had were: biting down on the studs while eating, getting things caught on them and having people treat me like trash. Sorry. I wore them for a year and then took them out. It seemed like everyone either really loved them or really hated them. I have to admit, they don't look respectable. I told myself I didn't care, but I discovered I did.|`|pCfsvdpxaa	nope! it actually felt good i tok it out to get it done again, it was done wrong but wouldnt mind the pain again!!!|`|AA11206135	Make sure you have the cash for the plastic surgery it will take to fix it once you grow up and realize how idiotic it looks..|`|WiSlOcBraa	trust me on this one i got mine done and it does not hurt that bad just like a little pinch to i did not think it hurt at all good luck|`|rYhm4LN1aa	Your getting a needle through you lip.. do u really think thats going to feel good?
SWxkfepuaa	the back of your hand|`|zYwnyy3Laa	neck, i guess. it'll look pretty cool.|`|gemaW0KQaa	Don't get it on your back by your waist -it would look like a tramp stamp!    Why not on the back of your neck or shoulder?  That way you can cover it up if you ever need to or show it off when you want.|`|27gnpuxwaa	on you back like right when it hits your waste line that is very attractive to a lot of men|`|GNZP0XLkaa	On the forearm of the hard you write with, that way it'll be easy to see and wont always be in your face.|`|AA11451457	Hi - Im getting one done on my wrist for the same reason as you mentioned - so I can see it all the time. Either your wrist or maybe your foot? Id suggest taking your design to the tattooist youre going to use and discuss with them as they may be able to do more detail than you imagine, or have a suggestion of where else to place it. Good luck!xx|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	I think tattoos on feet are adorable, all you have to do is look down and you'll calm down. also your feet are bigger then your wrist so you can get it bigger.|`|Awz77bejaa	id say inner wrist too|`|jjWDRuDHaa	Either the back of your wrist or on your foot. =)|`|mRq7vswNaa	I would say on your wrist or on your ankle. Try not to make it TOO big though LOL|`|JZKMxaNeaa	your lower back.. tattoos look mint there..or behind your ear.|`|UQCFzOJhaa	if i would you i go for the inside of your forearm that way you could always see|`|a7CABccHaa	If you aren't concerned about being able to hide it, I would say on the inner part of your wrist  :)|`|EuxU8J7Raa	On one of your breasts then it will give you a reason to be sexy and be able to check your tattoo out at the same time.

dyhk0zbZaa	Hello, I am a Utah plastic surgeon, http://www.yorkyates.com, and have some insight for you.  In November 2006, silicone implants were released for use in breast augmentation again after being off the market for some time.  The FDA restriction requires you to be 22 years of age.|`|JduQHocdaa	18 and up are allowed to get it. Your body your money if you feel implants are the best option for you go for it. Be sure to do a LOT of research about implants,and surgeons. Best of luck to you.|`|9dNEw7etaa	If you're 21 then you can get whatever you want. However, the better option would be to accept your body and get yourself a nice car with all the money you'll save.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	You might not want implants but rather a breast "lift" - look into that instead. But to answer your question you can go ahead and get whatever implants you want - hell, you could get a sex change if you wanted to.
zggJKu5Gaa	You should worry about where the tattoo will look the best.  If you ask the artist for help with the placement, I am sure they will be glad to help.  Depending on the size, shape, color, and detail, different tattoos will look better or worse in different areas.  Don't worry about the pain or hiding it.  If you truly want the tattoo, and it really means something to you, those aspects should not matter.  Just try to get the best tattoo possible.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	a girl? no place!! a woman some place and something feminine and taste full|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	I got my first (and so far only) tattoo in the upper middle of my back and it's pretty cool because it's easy to cover up if necessary but also easy to show. I wouldn't recommend the wrist for a first tattoo and ankle tats can look kinda trashy.  If you have good legs, I've seen pretty cool ones on the upper thigh. You can show it off when you're wearing a bathing suit.|`|LXROkDtHaa	well a tattoo isn't something you should for one not know where you want it, and for two ask someone else where to put it. you should take some time and think about where you want it before you just go get it done. location also depends a lot on what you're getting, good luck!=]|`|AA10512345	I have three tattoos. my very FIRST one i did on my chest right above my boob.  It's a great place for your first tattoo! because it doesnt hurt at all! seriously.  my second one is on my back right below my neck. this one didnt hurt that much.  my third one was pretty painfull. i got 4 letters on the inside of my lip.  Hope this helped : )|`|rlXGRjAHaa	Well, I have one tattoo, and I just recently got it, and I got it on my hip, now I won't lie it hurt a lot, but It is a good place because depending on where you work, they don't like when your tattoos show.. But I mean its the place where if you want it to show you can but if you don't you can also hide it.|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	Theres lots of places. if you want people to see it, then you can have it on your wrist, or maybe even your foot? but if you dont want people to see it, you can hie in on the back of your neck, or on your side?|`|WpxgaEsRaa	You need to put it where you want it, but to help you decide, you should probably get it some place fleshy or fatty. The less bony the area the less pain you feel, that is why top of the foot ribs and spine hurt alot.|`|mAOL6R4saa	like on your lower back thats where i would get it
yhgRaBPXaa	Mine works great. Use it at night before you go to bed. That works best|`|jvLsrtBNaa	yea its great! i always use chapstick brand...its the original.
1vaqtRI2aa	Try an at-home waxing kit. I've done it myself and though it would hurt, but it really didn't. There are kits that you can buy that have everything, including lotions to prevent and treat red bumps. Some even have scissors to trim and trusty little mirrors so you get everywhere.    You can buy them at Wal-Mart, the drugstore or anywhere else that sells Razors and Nair. They're not very expensive, especially if you buy them at Wal-Mart.    Shaving causes more ingrowns and those painful red bumps way more than anything else.|`|c5anDswjaa	I use tweezers and pluck my bikini line, then shave the rest.. Im a cheap-o and refuse to pay for waxing kits lol|`|heCuvfPSaa	What ever you do Don't WAX that will hurt like a B****   Shave it it's the best way you got
zon13nY2aa	Why would you do that!? You don't deserve advice!!!|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Don't pierce yourself again,    And buy this solution called Surgical Spirt.    You can get it at any pharmacy, it's a spray btw..    Warm sea salt aperantly works but thats too much of a hassle.|`|vjpqvrlsaa	Respect for self piercing....    Still a bad idea though    Dont pick any dried up blood from it (if any)     Once cleaned with weak WEAK warm water and salt solution, leave it and do not antagonise the wound, dont pick anny crusties from it, as this will cause a build up of white bloodcells inside the wound and cause scarring.|`|rxqZ1nLgaa	Salt water, or savlon solution is great. Make sure you twist each stud around 360degrees everyday to make sure that your skin doesn't just form around the bar, rather than making a hole.|`|4Joz9E9Xaa	Use Salty Water.  May I Say You're A Bit Of An Idiot Peircing It Yourself!|`|SW6fButzaa	You have to wash the area 2 or 3 times a day with mild soap and water.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	Dilute dettol twice a day works really well.
kCdISEGqaa	Since you're asking, I assume you're doubting it?  The Chinese letter thing is a fad, and it will die out soon.  Are you Chinese?  If so, I say go for it to honor your heritage.  If not, try to think of something a little more special to you and your nephew.  Best wishes!!!|`|7fl1T1k5aa	hm i think on the top of your neck would be awesome :)|`|N19mmDELaa	i have chinese words on my wrists. looks cool. and i can always see them too :)|`|A0nRQHDCaa	sounds original.

J02pqH84aa	i work at a tanning salon and am certified in lotions, skin care and all that jazz. it does not matter how much lotion you put on your body, it will not get you tanner if you put more. what does matter is the ingredients in the lotion...check to see if it has bronzers, accelerators and tinglers, this is what will maximize your color and the frequency of how often you tan. just put enough lotion to cover your body. happy tanning :)|`|wlB0kTjdaa	I would just put enough on to cover your body. I don't think it will make you tanner the more you use. You would be just wasting the product. =D|`|FvjbdPNPaa	idk but dont use too much. it can scream fake!
