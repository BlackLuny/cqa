20071206041938AAEsXbr	Pets;Dogs	Cane testardo?	salve a tutti, possiedo un cane di nome James, e' un bassethound ed è un bel maschione...se non fosse che ha un problemoneoneone...Alla "TENERA" età di 8 anni non ha ancora imparato a non fare la pipì in casa!! Espongo meglio la questione.   Esce 3 volte al dì per una durata totale di c.ca 15-20 min ogni uscita, tutti i giorni che torno a casa per pranzo, la trovo la sorpresina, ma la cosa + bella è che i guarda con aria come per dire "ma che ho fatto?" e scodinzola quasi come se volesse prendermi in giro; io penso che non si ricorda o non focalizza il danno che fa (e non perchè non lo capisca dato che qualche volta qualche sculaccione se l'e' preso anke lui!!)...Ma cosa devo fare? sono disperato!!!

20080220171828AAadRJm	Pets;Dogs	Strange Obsession?	I just received a 2 year old beagle. He is not neutered at this time. I also have a 4 year old pug. For some reason, the beagle is absolutley obsessed with licking the penis (and surrounding area) of my pug. I know, dogs are dogs, but one would think that after a while, the beagle would lose interest once he has gotten to know the pug. I was just curious if there is a way to break him of this, and if neutering him will make any difference. I plan on neutering him anyway, but I was just wondering if it may change things.

20080620181043AAnoViv	Pets;Cats	Is it normal for a cat to only have one kitten?	Ok before I get any speeches about cats in need of homes, here's the story. We live deep into the country and there is only one shelter. The shelter charges 60.00 for a kitten. People out here have very little money and have big barns full of animals. They need barn cats to take care of the rodents and many of them! My cat has had two litters in the past. She had 2 the first time, and 4 the second time. All but two babies found homes and were well taken care of. We kept the remaining two babies and got them spayed. Meanwhile Mommy had another litter. She was very small and I assumed she wasn't very far along. This morning she gave birth to one lonely good size healthy baby. Both mother and baby are healthy. After a litter of two, then four, I was expecting way more than one! But they're healthy and Mommys belly feels squooshy, as if there aren't any more babies in there. Is this normal?

Ok, first off, I am not setting up or intending to set up a bowl, but I did stumble across this website that listed fish that do well in a bowl    http://www.eskimo.com/~swkw/newsletter/O...    You have to scroll down a bit for the chart to show up.  Any way, it listed the expected fish like betta, mosquito fish, frogs and goldies, but some shockers appeared like shrimp, kili fish and danios.  I was under the impression these fish could not "retrieve their own air" as a betta or goldie could.     So my question is, can they?  I'm curious...see, I really want to know if a white mountain cloud minnow can get air like their goldfish friends. I'm hunting for the info and keep getting mixed results!   Thanks for satisfying more of my curiosity!!!!

I have a rely skittish dog that from when i got here was very skittish most likely because we bought her at a store and was probably a puppy mill dog. But she was so skittish that we sent her to this prison dog training program that did a great job to were i could actually get her out of the house with out dragging her and when she saw people she didn't snap at them. But we have this cat that she just stares at and follows and does it with a few other cats around the nabber-hood and she just stands there and stares at them and if they move she does. Also she is the biggest attention hog ever i mean we named her sweetie just because the name fit so well but she has attacked our cat viciously twice in the  year we have had her and was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to get her to stop stalking her and possibly to prevent another attack?

20081027093441AAA7ID9	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat keep pooping on the stairs?	First off, I have read every article on the internet, so this is my desperate attempt for an answer!   Here's the story, we got "Charlie" an 8 month old male from the Humane Society about a month ago. For the first few days we had him, no problems with the litterbox. We kept it downstairs in the basement and cleaned it daily. We use regular clay litter. Every few days (like once a week or so) he would poop on our stairs. We never see when he does this, it is usually in the morning though. So, I tried moving the box to the middle floor and put it in the bathroom. Everything was fine for a few days, then he did it again. We have started keeping him in the bathroom overnight but he still occasionally does this! (Like today dammit) I am at my wits end! I have tried spraying an avoidance cleaner on the area, we have tried putting cayenne pepper on the area, I have to try to monitor the cat's eating schedule. I am just puzzled. He is spayed, he doesn't go anywhere else in the house, he is very sweet and playful, he seems well adjusted. I'm not sure what else I can do! I'm considering putting tinfoil or plastic sheeting on the stairs, but that seems a little extreme..? Why is Charlie doing this? I need help!

She had this problem a month ago, but it cleared up (Thanks to the pills she was put on by the vet). Now it seems it back. The last time the vet thought it was because she could not "clean her private areas". I cleaned it with a tissue, and although it was a bit dirty, it had no blood.      I cannot get to a vet until tomorrow - if they even have an open spot. I could say it seems serious, after all, reading through some questions it seems quite serious. What should I do in the meantime? I don't want to find pee everywhere when I wake up tomorrow... urg, I think I'm screwed for now, until I can get a hold of the vet.. :\

We have a large yard, fenced by an underground electric fence on half, and a physical fence on the other half.  She does not come in the house, so keeping her inside isn't an option.      I don't know if she's jumping the electic line (the collar is turned up all the way), or getting through the physical part of the fence, but either way she keeps leaving the yard and it's a problem.  I'd love to physically fence my whole yard, but my parents are unwilling to deal with it.      How do I make Katie stay in the yard?
20081202194156AAw8Y0S	Pets;Dogs	Why is my dog throwing up in a weird color?	My golden retriever, Beau, has been very sloth and unresponsive  today which is very unlike him.  Also, he was gagging alot and not eating,  Finally, tonight, he threw up in this weird greenish-black color twice (about 4 hours apart).  He was at the vet earlier (he had an appointment by coincidence b/c of a tumor in his nasal cavity he got in May, which has been under close watch.) But, the vet said all systems (heart, lungs, stomach) were fine.  Also, this happened overnight (yesterday, he was eating  and playing around like he usually does), but the gagging started right before he went so sleep last night.  Anybody know what could be wrong and if he needs to be treated by a vet or if he just needs time to clear out his system.

20090227130337AA6GF9O	Pets;Cats	Why is it inhumane to declaw your cat, and not inhumane to have it spayed or neutered?	It is amazing how many people on here talk about how inhumane it is to have your cat de-clawed, but no one seems to be against spaying or neutering an animal. Removing a part of an animal is the same as removing a part of an animal. Both procedures are done to the convenience of us humans, and one is accepted and the other is not. Seems a bit hypocritical to me. The most common answer to de-clawing is 'how would you like it if someone cut your fingernails off?' Well how would you like it if someone cut your sex organs off?

20070425093907AAYB1vn	Pets;Fish	I'm trying to find a small betta tank complete with light. Any recommend tanks? No betta bowls?	A small betta tank to go on my book shelf. I've seen the Mini Bow 1 (is it any good for a betta?), the Aquatic Edge 1 Gallon, and Marineland Eclipse Explorer 2 Gallon. Were these tanks bulit to torture bettas as some people have said?      Betta are known to live in small spaces- I highly dislike putting them in those bowls however! But many people say 1 gallon is also too small even for a betta, they say a 6 gallon or up is recommended. I'm not putting a 6 gallon on my book shelf, however!      I have a 2.5 gallon as a hospital tank for my other aquariums, and I thought I could use it as the shelf tank but it was much too big. I need something small.   I know the betta grows around 2 inches, so would a 1 gallon make him sick?

20090308003414AAvRo1Q	Pets;Rodents	A Question For Rat Lovers!?	Do any of you take your rats or one of your rats with you to places you go?      My oldest male, Patrick, just LOVES to go everywhere with me. He sits calmly on my shoulder or in his little purse. If we go to a drive through, the people always give him little bits of food or fight for his attention or who's next to pet him. Or he'll ride in his purse through the store peeking his head out occasionally.      Note : I am not suggesting this is ok for every rat or rat owner to do. Patrick is a special boy who comes when called and is very friendly. Never do this with a baby rat or a rat that's startled easily and never take your rat(s) to a pet store where they can be subjected to illnesses.

20090227132852AAFT8Z1	Pets;Fish	Which fish in my tank could be killing my guppies?	I am having a big problem with my fancy guppy tank. First off we have a mixture of fish in the tank. One golden dojo loach, two cory's, four kuhli loaches, 4 golden apple snails and fancy tailed guppies. We have had this tank going with this same mixture for about a year now with no problems at all. We started out with two males and 5 females. They have successfully bred and multiplied. We have kept about 50 of the nicer guppies. That is until recently. Within the last 2 months we have lost all but 5 of the guppies. They have just disappeared. Something in the tank seems to have eaten them but we haven't been able to figure out which one it is. Does anyone have any experience with these different type fish as to know which one might have caused the dissappearance of most all of our guppies? I would like to be able to just get rid of the ones causing the problem instead of having to get rid of all of them.

20090308014003AA5oGta	Pets;Dogs	Re crate training a dog?	My dog was crate trained and then i stopped using it, now I'm starting to use it again due to aggression with my other dogs so he is seperated.   Well, he's been in the crate 18 minutes and he's down a poop. Two actually.   Should I clean it up, or leave it in there so he knows not to poop in there?   One poop next to his water bowl and the other in the middle of the crate.   THANKS!
20090308015111AAsajBt	Pets;Dogs	Dogs are den creatures so we crate them?	Yet we crate them seperately from us and other animals even though they are pack animals, and in a real den they'd be together?   Isn't that picking and choosing which natural behavior to go with?      Sorry this just occurred to me.

20090308030015AA3xi9n	Pets;Fish	Help with my guppies please.?	We have just acquired some guppies.   We have had tropical fish for years but never had guppies.   We have cheetahs, zebras, tetras and black widows and 1 pleco.   The tank is 3ft long.   Anyway, got these guppies a couple of days ago, 12  females and 4 males. The lady said 1 female is pregnant.   After lots of research, it all tells me about the gravid spot.   This is where my question lays.   Do all females have this dark spot all of the time, whether pregnant or not??   Is it just present during pregnancy??   Is it always black during pregnancy as i have 2 with pinkish/ orange in this area??   I know they grow fat and square near to birthing but all my  female has this spot, are they all pregnant??   I know how to look after the pregnant female and her fry once born as i have had platies. Just confused about this black gravid spot on these guppies.

20090308012049AAc3kFc	Pets;Fish	Why did my female guppy die?	Yesterday my wife was counting our fish and she couldn't find the female guppy.  I pulled the tank forward for a better angle (from the top) and there she came, floating up from behind the pump.        She looked like she had been partly eaten as all her skin had gone, showing the flesh underneith.        We bought her with another female and a male last weekend and have had no trouble since.  We also have 9 neon tetras in the tank.        I don't know if this has any connection to the female but the male has been right at the top of the water, not going up for air, but with his mouth wide open against the flow of the water from the pump.   Any help with either issue will be greatly appreciated.

20090308015857AAp2Upa	Pets;Cats	Will my baby kitty always suckle even when he's a big kitty?	Hi! I found my baby solid black kitty "Snowball" when he was about 8 weeks old on the side of the freeway. I of course rescued him & took him home. After a few days he started "hogging" my bed! Then I noticed he was "nursing" on the blanket. I felt bad for him as I knew he missed his momma. Fast forward to today he is about 7 months, neutered, & he still hogs the bed. Needless to say he still suckles on the blankets although not as much. Has anyone ever had this happen? Can I expect him to do this all his life?

20090308013744AAUUANz	Pets;Fish	Can a pair of Ram Cichlid be kept together with a pair of Agassizi's Dwarf Cichlid?	I have a 45 gallon aquarium stocked with 5 lemon tetra and a twig catfish. I think the tank is cycled, so far, water quality is under control. Everything is normal.      I want to add a pair of Ram Cichlids later on, and I wonder if it could be kept with another pair of Agassizi's Dwarf Cichlid. Will the males kill each other? I asked the pet shop worker and he just shrugged and said that if they have enough space, nothing should go wrong.      Give me suggestions!   Thanks.
