20090220103600AAIWBYZ	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Is this a good way to increase traffic?	I think I finally figured out what it takes to get more traffic-real traffic!!    You need a page on your site dedicated to your fellow website owners. It’s that simple.    People who do this make a lot on money. It’s an awesome way to get more traffic.      Google and Yahoo notice if you are participating in friendly conduct. This includes sharing links. Getting kicked off or shut down isn't as hard as you think. Just take a look at some forum/blog notes about people who have been shut down for no apparent reason. If these huge search engines have to make room on their system, you are a sitting duck if you aren't playing NICE. Think about it-if they drop you because all you are is a single site with nothing more than ads and something to sell, they've lost nothing by closing you down-someone else will replace you in a heartbeat. BUT, if you have other links and referrals on your site, dropping you will cause a domino effect which could cost them a lot of money. So, they’ll pass.      That being said, would you like to exchange links?   I have a special page on my website just for you!  It doesn’t matter if your website isn’t related. People who are looking have different interests. You may be what they need next.       I'll write a nice blurb and add your site address. (In exchange for the same, of course) It’s FREE Advertising, and who couldn’t use a little of that? Please let me know if you would like to be listed. My Site: www.a-secret-to-share.com If you visit, you'll see what I'm talking about.       Email me: lynnmiller4158@hotmail.com and let me know. When you respond, please include your URL so I can take a look at your site. I'll email you when I've posted your info on my site and give you a couple of days to return the favor. Fair? Good. Now let's get this party started and make some real money!

I got a warning for the cell phone and a suggestion to lighten my front windows but no "fix it" ticket.       The officer was really nice so I have no complaints. I just don't want to spend money unnecessarily by having the windows scraped and re tinted.

First off, the other car was nowhere in the vicinity of the intersection when I decided to make my turn ( at glance, she was far enough away from the intersection to where i could make a clean turn). When I did make the turn, my friend screamed as we where milliseconds clear of the intersection, and thats when i noticed that the other car was speeding and didnt stop as she rammed into the middle of my car. She knocked me into the left lane of the street i was turning onto and really did a number on my car. Was I at fault? And if so, how far off does a car going in the opposite direction have to be before you can make a left turn???

20090220104127AAC2h7s	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Convertible Car Seat (Britax, Evenflo, Graco)?	I'm in the market for a new car seat, and have been going crazy doing research on the seats I think are suitable. The problem I have are the two cars we own. One is a Ford Focus and the other a VW Jetta (the newer model). I really like the Britax Regent and Britax Frontier, the Evenflo Symbphony and the Graco Nautilus come in close second, mostly because of the maximum height and weight limits they share with the Britax.   I wanted to know if anyone out there owns either of these four car seats, and has them installed in a small car like the ones we own. I want to know if the seats fit nicely and also if they interfere in any way with the passenger and/or driver seats.    My other child has a Recaro Como convertible seat, and it's REALLY BIG, we always have to place that one behind the passenger seat, because the person that rides on that side, will have to scoot the seat forward quite a bit. I personally don't mind, because it doesn't affect me at all I'm short, but it does bother my husband because he's an average 6'0.   Sorry for the long story, I just wanted to be as specific as possible with my concerns.    Thanks for the help!

20090220111828AAUVO5m	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What advise and tips would you give to buying a used car?	Ok, I have $2000, which I know isnt a lot for a car, but on $10/hr, thats a lot. I have a history of buying the crappest cars on Earth, mainly because I dont know anything about cars. I open the hood, pretend to know what Im looking at and thats that. The last car I got for example from a priest turned out to be the worst car in the world. So, any advise?      So far, I would like to this time jut pay a small price and have it taken to a car place before I buy it and have them look at it. Id rather lose $40 up front than more down the road. Otherwise, I know to avoid some brands, like KIA, etc. Also, I think a V6 would be a better bet since it should hold out more. What do you think? Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

I have narrowed down my car stereo to one of two choices      Alpine CDA-9887R       http://www.caraudiocentre.co.uk/product_...       or       Alpine IDA-X305       http://www.caraudiocentre.co.uk/product_...       I have an iphone 3g, and I am soon to replace my Zune with a ipod 120, so I will have all of my music with me at all times.  I rarely  use cd's anymore which has me leaning towards the x305, plus I like the way that one looks better than the 9887.  HOWEVER I realize that I will never get the true pure encoding on an mp3 as I will with a CD, so that makes me want to get the 9887, just in case I want to use cd's.  Like I said though I pretty much buy all my music online now though, I can't remember the last physical cd i bought.       What do you think (please don't suggest other head unit's)?      Thanks

20090220122927AA2jQKq	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Problems with the engine Help!?	So im not really sure whats wrong with my truck. I drive a 95 Ford ranger with 140,000 miles on it and it broke down by dieing on me last week. So i left in where it was for a week in like anywhere from 0degree to 25 degree whether all week and the car just sat there. Me and my friend went up and it would even turn on no lights nothing at first so we let it be jumpstarted for like a half hour. Then drove it to autozone. Since we just jumped it they said they cant test the batetry but they tested the alternator and it was putting out. Then we checked oils lack of transmision oil so we put some in. Then we filled the gas and took some coke and cleaned the corosion from the battery. But we still think it was the battery. Got part way out of town and had to stop at a light and the oil gauge went crazy and the car all of a sudden started to overheat. I being a girl and knowing nothing about cars freaked out and pulled over and turned off the car. Then my friend eneded up having to jump it again. There goes another 30 - 40 minutes, Then the car is running and we thought we were in the clear and while i was driving it just died. Then we tried jumping it and gave up. So we went and bought a new battery and put it in. Then when we tried to start it nothing happened. So we jump started it and when i went to turn on my lights the car EVERYTHING went dead. So we didnt know what to do. We gave up not sure whats wrong and had it towed. What do you think could be wrong? And is it fixable? Do you think it will be expensive!   Any help would be great! Even if your not sure Please help! Thanks!

I've been contemplating on getting those Cobra R Replica's, but they are quite expensive for my college *** budget! So I've been looking around for some cheap new/ used rims. I came across these rims called "Maxxim Wonders". They yield the similar specs as the Cobra R's and they are quite nice!       1) I was just wondering if these will fit my explorer?       http://i520.photobucket.com/albums/w...O...       The rims are 18x8.5 although the width is 8J (what's that mean?). Offset is 15mm. 5x114.3.

20090220125115AAc61wL	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My van died yesterday while driving, like it ran out of fuel, had half tank, filled it up, then it drove fine?	I have a 96 gmc safari van. I recently replaced the fuel pump only 3 months ago. its done this before sort of, where it felt like its dying a bit when you step on the accelerator, but then you ease it, and it keeps on going, if you put gas in it it fixes the problem usually, and goes away. it hasnt done it in a long while, and I thought it was through doing it, and it may never do it again. but it would like die a bit on like even a half tank, or 3/4 tank, other times I can run it till its at 1/4 tank and its fine. I cant figure out what it is, my fuel gauge is broken so its hard to tell exactly how much gas is in it, so I just use the trip odometer to get an estimate of how much is in there. when it died yesterday I thought it ran empty, but then only 10gallons filled it up max. but then it ran fine and is still running fine. what could be wrong with it? its like its getting clogged or something every now and then and feels like its out of gas. I just did an oil change on it, and did a radiator flush on it, the battery is full, the starter and everything is good on it, and has a pretty new and in good condition transmission.

20090220133033AAiEb5m	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Husband scratched up Dad's Truck, how can we fix it?	My husband decided a shovel would be a great item to scrape the ice off the truck with, no need to say anything, It was clearly a huge lapse in judgment on his part.       The shovel scratched the hood of the Truck pretty good, real deep scratches that have since started to rust. There's a few scratches on the side of the truck too, near the mirrors. My Dad noticed them yesterday although they occured back in december. The way my Dad's reacting you would have thought it was totaled.       It's a late 80's Ford F250 I think, it's in great shape. We had it at our house because we gave our Chrysler to my dad who drives about 300 miles a week and needed a more economical vehicle.      My husband thinks since my dad drives our car that we shouldn't have to fix the scratches because the truck is old anyway and it's not like we charge him to drive our car".       I think he needs to write my dad an apology letter and pay to get the scratches fixed, which may be expensive but stupidity isn't cheap.       I read a few places that we could fix the scratches with a mild rubbing compound, will this mess with the paint? And do we need to do anything about the rust before we fix it?       Anyone have a rough estimate on a price for a pro to do it? The scratches are about a foot long. Will be be a couple hundred to fix, or less?       Any advice is appreciated, unless it has to do with my husband, as I have already decided to keep him.

20090220131928AAyrdFv	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	How does this plane/car vehicle power itself on land when driving and not flying?	I'm sure some of you have heard about this plane/boat hybrid vehicle where the wings can fold up.  It has not been released to the public yet.  I know that there is a propeller in the back which moves it through the air when flying.      But my question is, does that same propeller move it on the ground when driving or is there some sort of other engine/motor for when driving?      I don't get how a prop on the ground would be plausible.  It would be loud and very unsafe for any people nearby.  Also it would accelerate and brake like a car.  Some clarification would be greatly helpful.      Thanks!

The driver was speeding and hit me as I was changing lanes.  Fault was not indicated on the police report.  It was more of a "he claims, she claims" statement.

Furthermore, it wasn't even my vehicle, but I was cited for no insurance.  No other tickets were issued.
