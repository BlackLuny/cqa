20090220221238AALHEs4	News & Events;Current Events	How do you think Caylee Anthony was actually killed?	None of us know but we can all be fairly sure Casey did something to her here but how do you think she did it? There is evidence of chloroform so the first hing that would come to mind is she was drugging the kid so she could go out & party & keep the kid conked out but at the same time she was looking up things like neck-breaking & household weapons on the family computer which kinda signals it was premeditated. What do you actually think happened? What was the last few days like up to Caylee's death & what do you think caused her death?
20090220221035AAO6sVw	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Stephen King being against Stephenie Meyer and praising J.K. Rowling?	Stephen King said Stepehenie Meyer's Twilight is really overestimated by readers cause of how "romantic" it has been between Edward and Bella and he sais she should be like J.K. Rowling who really has the direction correct in her books..      What do you think of it?      `If you'd ask me, I think Stephen King is a little too re-acting.   Sure, I admit, I am not a fan of Twilight cause I don't like it and it's cheesy.. but the part of him saying that she's not a good author really sucks.   Of course it only depends on the plot of the author.   Like for example, take J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter movies, prolly she wouldn't start with Harry making out with someone, wouldn't she?         ------      Stephen King is known as one of the best authors around and he has written some amazing vampiric books as well..

I am a single mom who works 40 plus hours a week with no help from the dad. How in the world does someone who has 14 kids, no job, lives with parents (who by the way house is up for foreclosure), lives off of food stamps afford a million dollar house. I do not live off of the government with one kid!!! Is anyone else as mad as me about this whole situation???

Now, i may be wrong, but didn't congress get mad at the CEO;s of the auto industry for flying in on company jet when they asked congress for money, yet NOW, congress voted to give them a tax cut on the purchase of one.      AND I THINK BIRTH CONTROL FOR MEDICAID PATIENTS IS A GOOD THING, but put it where it belongs....NOT with this stimulus package.....wrong place for it.

Kudos for the PR guys, really it looks like news.com.au editors do nothing more than taking Press releases out of the fax machine and publish them just like that.       I've been a fan of news.com.au for quite some time but did anyone else notice the very thin story lines and almost transparent content? Does anyone else see the irony in the daily "Now is the best time to buy ... said John Doe from Doe Realtors in Sydney" stories? Today the 208 deaths in Victoria aren't even mentioned in the top stories. Also, what's with all the typos? Seriously these people get paid to ONLY publish content, why aren't they able to do that one and only thing correctly?

20090220183206AAkb0lc	News & Events;Current Events	Can the economic news get any worse?	NEW YORK (Reuters) â€“ Renowned investor George Soros said on Friday the world financial system has effectively disintegrated, adding that there is yet no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.   Soros said the turbulence is actually more severe than during the Great Depression.  "We witnessed the collapse of the financial system," Soros said at a Columbia University dinner. "It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom."  His comments echoed those made earlier at the same conference by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who is now a top adviser to President Barack Obama.     Volcker said industrial production around the world was declining even more rapidly than in the United States, which is itself under severe strain.
20090220184133AA7XGAc	News & Events;Current Events	Can someone explain the difference between terrorism and legitimate slaughter?	In Israel, a terrorist blows herself up on a bus and causes 20 civilian deaths. The world hears about and she is labeled a terrorist. A terrible word.      Israel retaliates and blows up a suburb in Gaza with F18's and causes 200 civilian deaths. That is called legitimate response by an army.      The tactics are different due to capabilities. The Palestinians don't have an airforce or an army, so they do what they can, and use suicide bombers.      Both acts are terrible, but I don't see why one is called a terrorist and one isn't. They both cause a great deal of terror.      I think the word 'terrorist' has now become a political tool to justify one sides position.
