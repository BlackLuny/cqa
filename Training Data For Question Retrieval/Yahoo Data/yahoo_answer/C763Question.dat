I love baking cupcakes but whenever I tried to bake, my cupcakes taste good but the outer layer will always be slightly hard and I really want to know why. Is it because I did not choose the sign (oven) properly or something? What is wrong?       For your information, I use the sign something like this..      ----   fan (imagine this is a fan picture)   ----      the '---' is the heat, I guess..      yeah. The sign look something like that, is that the correct sign for baking cupcakes or those signs are not the cause of my cupcakes to be hard?      I really wish some professional baker would help me or something..   Thank you

I made my boyfriend a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting last week and he loved it - my family never say nice things about my cooking (but eat it fast enough so I do know it's good!), but he went on about it for a while - which made me feel really good! So i'd like to make him something else, but different to what I already made. Here are his likes/dislikes:   Likes: Chocolate, butterscotch, toffee and ginger   Dislikes: Fresh cream and jam      I don't really mind what I make (muffins, flapjacks, cake) but different to last time would be good!

This family member isn't really into the birthday thing, but she does like to be acknowledged. We all say that we don't care, but we know that's not true, because we all deep down want someone or others to do things even if we won't admit it..Hehe...      Anyways, she likes books, but has a ton of books already and all of her favorites. I need help. I want to go big, because she is indeed turning 30!!! Please help...Also, nothing too expensive. I only have the pie/cake thing covered. I need ideas on everything. Decorations (what to get, and how to decorate) etc. Things that she'll be surprised on, but nothing that will upset her or make her mad.      She is sweet, caring, very devoted to others, animals etc. She is somewhat a casual, but stylish person. It just depends on her mood for the day. She enjoys movies, just nothing horror. She likes mystery things, movies, tv, books, etc. She also likes to watch programs and read books when times that were based back in the 1800's. Hope this helps a little to give ideas.      Thanks! I need to go big, I want to blow her away!

20090223000443AAL6kEs	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Ten Reasons to Throw out your Microwave Oven  - is this true?	I got a forwarded e-mail from a friend. Is everything under for real?            Ten Reasons to Throw out your Microwave Oven         From the conclusions of the Swiss, Russian and German scientific clinical studies, we can no longer ignore the microwave oven sitting in our kitchens. Based on this research, we will conclude this article with the following:         1). Continually eating food processed from a microwave oven causes long term - permanent - brain damage by "shorting out" electrical impulses in the brain [de-polarizing or de-magnetizing the brain tissue].         2). The human body cannot metabolize [break down] the unknown by-products created in microwaved food.       3). Male and female hormone production is shut down and/or altered by continually eating microwaved foods.         4). The effects of microwaved food by-products are residual [long term, permanent] within the human body.         5). Minerals, vitamins, and nutrients of all microwaved food is reduced or altered so that the human body gets little or no benefit, or the human body absorbs altered compounds that cannot be broken down.         6). The minerals in vegetables are altered into cancerous free radicals when cooked in microwave ovens.         7). Microwaved foods cause stomach and intestinal cancerous growths [tumors]. This may explain the rapidly increased rate of colon cancer in America .         8). The prolonged eating of microwaved foods causes cancerous cells to increase in human blood.         9). Continual ingestion of microwaved food causes immune system deficiencies through lymph gland and blood serum alterations.         10). Eating microwaved food causes loss of memory, concentration, emotional instability, and a decrease of intelligence.         Have you tossed out your microwave oven yet? After you throw out your microwave, you can use a toaster oven as a replacement. It works well for most and is nearly as quick. The use of artificial microwave transmissions for subliminal psychological control, a.k.a. "brainwashing", has also been proven. We're attempting to obtain copies of the 1970's Russian research documents and results written by Drs. Luria and Perov specifying their clinical experiments in this area.

If it is natural, that means they have to do less to it, also they don't put other ingredients in it [thus, natural sugar]. So, it should cost the sugar factory less to make this kind. But I would pay more if I bought this kind.    The white granulated sugar costs me less, and the sugar factory does more to it, and spends more on ingredients and steps in the process.       The same thing with flour. They "bleach" it and it costs me less. All "natural" flour costs me more, when they do less to it.   Did I miss something here?   Help me understand.

20090222113145AAD5YXE	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Any ideas of a wine to match Greek food, specifically lamb with minted yoghurt?	I have a difficult match to make as there are a lot of flavours going on. The main dish will be lamb with minted yoghurt butb there will also be side dishes involving chicken and a small amount of beef. The predominant flavours as with a lot of Greek food will be mint and yoghurt along with some garlic so I'm thinking that the "match red wine with red meat" may go out of the window. Any thoughts?      One suggestion to me so far has been either a rose wine to cover all bases, or a not too sweet sparkling white? Any help greatly appreciated.

20090222161228AABu6Z1	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Help fixing my blackberry wine that is too tart.?	I'm making blackberry wine and it is completely fermented and should be ready for bottling soon.  I tasted it about a month ago and it was too sour so I added potassium sorbate to prevent refermentation and added sugar to try and balance the sourness.  I tasted it today and it is still too sour and seems to not have much flavor (perhaps being masked by the tartness?).  I was reading in one of my books and they recommended mixing the blackberries 50:50 with merlot or zinfandel grape juice concentrate before beginning fermentation.  It's a little late for that now but would it be a good idea at this point?  Should I add table sugar?  I was considering malolactic fermentation but found out you can't do that after adding potassium sorbate.  I'm looking for a dry wine with just a little sweetness.  Is there any hope for this batch?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

20090223044449AAWmjco	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Non cruel dairy/milk?	Of course most of us have seen those videos showing how cruel animals are treated and it turns many people vegetarian. Non of them have done that to me. But for those of you who I'm sure will most stuff saying I NEED to be vegetarian... I do not eat pig meat, period. I just hate the taste and thought of it. And I very rarely eat any beef. I really just eat chicken and turkey. Which I know videos will show "standard" ways of how they're treated. But I know it's not "standard" because I know people who work in that industry. Yes... they do kill the animal, what do you expect? But they are not treated like shown in the video in every single place. Anyway. On to my questions.   In my house we don't really eat eggs because of cholesterol, but if we do we eat Eggland's Best. Which I really do believe they're not lying about cage free chickens. So if anyone wants to show me full 100% proof that they aren't cage free please do.   And as for milk, I'm sure not all cows are treated like they show in the videos (I honestly think they show the worst of the worst for a reason, otherwise nobody would be interested in watching them) but still, I know it's almost impossibly to know which brands don't basically torture their dairy cows. But there is this one brand of milk sold where I live that is from a smaller local farm. Does this milk probably have a higher chance of being cruel free?      Sorry for the long long question just to get one thing out of it :)
