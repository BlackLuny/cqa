vemSTfwAaa	if they sync it on their computer, everything u have on there will be gone. They can however opt not to sync. If they want to add some of their own songs without deleting yours, they can check the manually add music or videos option in itunes. then they can grag individual songs to the ipod and everything else should stay put. I've heard of the authorize computer thing, i think that has to do with they can play purchased songs on their computer without having to repurchase the song. Im not really sure how the whole autorizing thing goes since i don't buy my music from itunes.

The camera would become very hot.<br>  <br>  Try wiping the contacts inside your camera gently with a cotton bud. It could just be that the contacts are a little greasy. Wipe the ends of the batteries too with a clean cloth or tissue. If the contacts are not clean the camera may see a reduced voltage even if the batteries are OK.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	It is Kaput.

Unlike the other model alphas, Sony listened to things that A700 shooters wanted and kept giving us little mini upgrades. It's been given solid reviews from all the top magazines and websites.<br>  <br>  The last time I looked, SonySytle, Sony's online store had the A700 for 999. That means the used bodies take a hit in value, no doubt. 600 would be a stretch, but with the economy being bad, I've seen all kinds of good deals on anything you can imagine.<br>  <br>  Check not only ebay, but craigslist.org in your area.<br>  <br>  <br>  A700 pics <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.StrangerSoundLabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.StrangerSoundLabs.com</a>|`|2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	The Sony Alpha A700 is Sony's mid-range, semi-pro DSLR body. It's comparable to Nikon's D300 and Canon's 50D. Assuming that the $600 is a price offered to you from a reputable dealer, it's a very good deal. It's garnered positive feedback from many reviewers:<br>  <a href="http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/sony/dslr_a700-review/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/sony/d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra700/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslr...</a><br>  <br>  It's safe to say that the A700 is no slouch in the capability department. The body alone typically sells for around $800-900 new. You should check out the A700 in person before you make any decisions, nevertheless. Remember that you're also buying into a system of accessories. Sony's own lineup of lenses and flashes have been expanding steadily since its aquisition of Minolta's imaging division a couple of years ago. Unless you have some personal preference for a particular brand, the A700 is definitely worth your consideration.

96c1fdd2ec46193779a7d841d0176878aa	Yes. I have been deployed 4 times. The Xbox360 has a cd reader that has a special eye to read at different depths. Each depth (tiny increments) is a different type of disc (CD, DVD, DVD-R, game, etc.) and if the eye gets dirty, dusty, or knocked off its axis, then you have problems reading a particular type of disc. From your question it sounds like this is the case. I suggest that he clean it with a CD/DVD cleaning disc (he can get it at the PX/BX over there) and keep a tighter lock on how often his cd tray is open.|`|LKiVXEcCaa	Ok well it depends on what the screen says when he tries to play it. if it says disk read error, its probably the laser and it needs to be either cleaned or replaced.

Most converters will have a coaxial output. All you have to do is connect that output with the coaxial input of your VCR.<br>  <br>  If your converter or VCR don't have coaxial connections, as long as the converter has an output which is of the same type as your VCR input, you can still connect them.<br>  <br>  Your VCR will not be able to automatically change channels though (since the tuner is in the converter).

So is Uncharted: Drakes Fortune...<br>  My PSN is "Pricey193" if anyone wants a game sum time!<br>  Yeh 18s are generally violent... like Manhunt and GTA... :O<br>  Both games invlove killing people kinda badly...<br>  Especially Manhunt, where u get more points/money of you kill people in more gruesome ways!!<br>  EDIT: Oh, but Manhunt is now banned as it was SO bad!|`|RWVQS0ZRaa	if it says 18 it is suitable for over 18s only maybe because of sexual scenes, bloodshed, horror, violence etc but a few good games are (depending on your fave genre of games) mirrors edge (fighting & adventure Like No other) tony hawks pro skater (skateboarding) fifa 09 (football) Singstar (singing) Tomb Raider Underworld (adventure) uncharted drakes fortune (another adventure) Legendary (fighting mythical Creatures) Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 (tactical Shooter) Buzz Quiz TV (best With Friends) or resistance fall of man 1(amazing online when you get used to it)|`|f3x2q0iDaa	Should get COD:World At War but is rated M(mature),Resident Evil 5 coming out on March 13 is M,Street Fighter IV came out this monday i think is E(everyone),|`|pl2SocVKaa	well then if you can't get M i recommend you get Mirrors Edge and Uncharted Drakes Fortune|`|UzV0jc2haa	Well most of the 10 that I'm gonna recommend is rated M.<br>  -Resident evil 5(not out yet  3/13)(rated M)<br>  -Fear(rated M)<br>  -Fear 2 project origin(rated M)<br>  -killzone 2(not out yet 2/27)(rated M)<br>  -gta 4(rated M)<br>  - soul caliber 4(rated T)<br>  -midnight club La(rated T)<br>  -I guess call of duty WAW(rated M)<br>  -resistance 1(rated M)<br>  -resistance 2 (rated M)|`|CFPNtjuBaa	Ok den non-18 games<br>  <br>  Metal gear solid 4<br>  COD 5 (alrite but not that good)<br>  Assassins Creed<br>  Midnight Club LA<br>  Fifa 09<br>  Pes 2009<br>  Fight night round 3|`|yrQFXxcXaa	Resistance 1<br>  <br>  Resistance 2<br>  <br>  Warhawk<br>  <br>  Ratchet & clank<br>  <br>  Uncharted, is a must<br>  <br>  Singstar, for a girl.|`|YI8V5e36aa	well all the game i would recommend your mum wont let u play.... but anyways here they are<br>  <br>  FEAR 2<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Resistnace 1 <br>  gta 4<br>  ..... o ok i got one for u download Flower off the ps store|`|s6hhRtQuaa	Mirror's Edge!<br>  It's a great game. It's not any ol' normal one though. It's completely different. You play as a woman named Faith who is a free-runner. A free runner is someone who runs across roofs, jumps up things, wall-runs, spins, everything you could imagine. So as you can guess, it's really fun playing it.<br>  <br>  Here's the trailer -  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N1TJP1cxmo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N1TJP1cx...</a><br>  Rating: 16+<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Call of Duty: World at War!<br>  <br>  This game is quite like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare except you're fighting in the World War 2. It's pretty fun online but the campaign is just as good. There's enough things in this game to keep you occupied for quite a while.<br>  <br>  Trailer - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuvefjxZrN0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuvefjxZr...</a><br>  Rating: 16+<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  The Orange Box!<br>  <br>  This game has a collection on 5 games in 1. These games are Half Life 2, Half Life 2: Episode 1, Half Life 2: Episode 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2. All of these games are probably the best I have ever played on any console. The Half Life games are absolutely amazing. Just the first one has won 30+ awards, and the second two have won 10-15 awards each. I'm literally being serious here. These Half Life games will keep you busy for weeks. However, the gameplay in them isn't for everyone. Look into these before buying The Orange Box. Now, Portal is a game which is so unique. Never been used in a game before. You have a Portal Gun and say you looked at a wall and shot two Portals in it, you would walk in one and come out of the other. Using this gun you must go through 19 levels. There becomes obsticles you must dodge as well. And the whole time there is a voice of a woman who convinces you so much that she's nice. She says that you will get cake when you finish and that you are amazing etc but then at sometime in nearly every level she tries to kill you. You also find very amusing writing on the walls sometimes saying 'THE CAKE IS NOT REAL!!! Now, Team Fortress 2 is an online experiance you will never forget. Everything looks a bit cartoony but don't let that put you off. There is many classes to choose from including Engineer, Pyro, Spy, Sniper, Heavy and Scout. Each has a special ability such as the Spy which can turn invisable for 10 seconds. There are many different game modes as well. I did honestly spend 3-4 months on TF2. So, all in all I spent about 6 months in all playing The Orange Box.<br>  <br>  Trailer - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8pWUXBxZNA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8pWUXBxZ...</a><br>  Rating: 15+<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Ok, there you are. 3 games i'd recommend. Out of them all i'd mostly recommend The Orange Box or Mirror's Edge. Call of Duty: World at War IS amazing but it's pretty much the same as COD4. The same perks online and everything.<br>  If you want to add me on PS3, my name is HairySpud.<br>  <br>  And as for why some games are 18, well, some don't deserve to be. Take Resistance 2 for example (that's an amazing game as well, 60 people online!) theres no more blood or violence in it than COD4/5. The only time I can remember something bad is when someone got cut up with a big splice thing but that was over in around 3 seconds. However, some deserve that rating. GTA IV for example. No more violence than COD4/5 but you can have sex, shows scenes of taking drugs, innocent people getting brutally murdered (in some scenes gangs go up to defenceless people and start whacking them with a crowbar until they die for no reason. They was just bored). And you can kill innocent people when your just wondering around as well.<br>  Basically it all depends on the game. Some don't deserve to be 18s but some do. You should really look into 18s before buying them. Oh, and another. Manhunt 2. If you found GTA IV description bad, you don't want to know whats in this game.

caOfuKl5aa	According to playstation.com, the only ones that are backwards compatible (all have 4 usb ports, not 2) are 20gb, 60gb & 80gb (model # CECHE01 - release date August 2007 for 80gb).<br>  <br>  Ok, so my tried & true source is Amazon & they do have some backwards compatible 80gb versions, used from $413 & new for $550 (includes shipping):<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000TVT8PI/sr=/qid=/ref=olp_tab_all?ie=UTF8&coliid=&me=&qid=&sr=&seller=&colid=" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B...</a><br>  <br>  Or 20 gb used from $404 & new from $464 (includes shipping):<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000IZWNLG/sr=8-2/qid=1235165132/ref=olp_tab_all?ie=UTF8&coliid=&me=&qid=1235165132&sr=8-2&seller=&colid=" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B...</a><br>  <br>  I love Amazon & I do all my online shopping there.  As stated by so many others before me, you can always try craigslist or ebay.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mPaqhgUuaa	If you want a backward compatible PS3, you're gonna have to buy a used one since they're not being produced anymore. You'll have to look for the old 20gb, 40gb, or 60gb version. Any PS3 with 2 usb ports are not backward compatible.<br>  You'll most likely find these models at Gamestop, Craiglist, or Ebay.|`|UzV0jc2haa	Well if you have a ps2 then why do you need backwards compatiablity?  Just keep the ps2 hooked up and if you still buy a ps3 connect that to.  Thats what i did with mine.  But i guess if you want try either ebay or gamestop.  They both sell used ones but ebay sells both.  I would trust a used one from gamestop though more than a new one from ebay|`|3kgqmJ6Laa	if you have a ps2 that works.....why spend the money when you really think about it?  but it's your call.  you can try ebay or amazon, or any site that has them.  i bought my ps3 when it first came out....so i have a  full bc 60 gig model.|`|l2FAMoZNaa	No, not all PS3's are backwards compatible.  The 40 gb and 60 gb versions of the PS3 are, but the 80 gb and 160 gb are not.  Try craigslist.com for local sellers.|`|EfejPjIMaa	So many wrong answers.  The only PS3's that are backward compatible are the 20GB, 60GB, and 80GB bundle (Motor Storm and Metal Gear Solid 4) PS3's.  All backward compatible PS3's have 4 USB ports and built in Flash Card readers (except the 20GB version which has no Flash Card readers.  The 20GB and 60GB PS3 use Emotion Engine hardware to play PS2 games, which means it can play more PS2 games then the 80GB bundle PS3 that uses Emulation software. <br>  <br>  The 60GB model is the best as it can play the most PS2 games, and has built in Wi-Fi, unlike the 20GB version that doesn't have built in Wi-Fi or Flash Card readers.<br>  <br>  You can still find new 80GB bundle PS3's ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bundle-Sixaxis-Controller-Cable-playstation-3/dp/B001CSE6AO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1235176289&sr=1-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Bundle-Sixaxis-Con...</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000TVT8PI/sr=/qid=/ref=olp_tab_all?ie=UTF8&coliid=&me=&qid=&sr=&seller=&colid=" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B...</a> ), but doubt you will find a new 60GB PS3.  You would need to buy a used 60GB PS3 if you want to make sure you can still play all your PS2 games.  You can look at the Sony site ( <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/CompatibleStatus" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Co...</a> ) to determine what games are backward compatible with each of the three backward compatible PS3 models (Motor Storm and MGS4 PS3's are the same model number).<br>  <br>  Amazon is the best place to find new 80GB PS3's.  They come and go, so you may need to look often to see when they come back in.  If you go with the 80GB version, then make sure it has either Motor Storm or MGS4 on the box, or it is just a regular non-backward compatible PS3.

If u get 1 red light then u have a hardware failure, for that keep it vertically because if its horizontal the wires and chips inside get loose and it damages the xbox. If u get 2 red lights it means its overheating and u should cool it down. 3 red lights is the worse, it means major hard ware failure, that is a tough one, if u get it than u either send it to microsoft or wrap it in towels for it to overheat and that could fix something up.

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	The number of pictures a 2 GB Olympus xD-Picture Card can save depends on the camera you have. A 7.1 MP camera will be able to store slightly more than 500 pictures on a 2 GB memory card.<br>  <br>  Are xD memory cards good or not? Such an assessment really holds no purpose, since such a product is necessary if you plan on using an Olympus camera. They work like a memory card should (since Olympus has considered all limitations of its removable storage format when designing its cameras) and the chances of failure are no different than any other format. There are only two brands that sell and use xD memory cards anyway (manufactured by Toshiba for both Olympus and Fujifilm) so there's not much choice.

Don't get a Blackberry Pearl.

Happy Hunting|`|Vf0g0q8uaa	You should definitely get that phone, i know i am. and hopefully they learned from their past 2 mistakes with the keyboard always breaking, considering this will be the most expensive out of the duo and matrix. I would wait until about the 1st day of march, then go online and look at the reviews just to be safe.
UtHnh0aHaa	I like bass too. I really like it to be crisp and accurate rather than 'boomy'. If you prefer it that way too, I can suggest several speaker systems.<br>  <br>  Check Polk Audio for drivers that match your power rating. Get the advice from the sales tech of the ones that match both impedance and power rating.<br>  <br>  JBL also makes good quality compacts that have an amazing sound and really accurate bass response. <br>  <br>  My old system was Altec Lansing mains with piezo horns with a JBL sub-woofer. I even used it as the reproducer for my bass guitar practice.<br>  <br>  The ultimate air mover is the Bose lifestyle 55 system. I don't recommend the speakers be used with any other amplifier though. And the full system is pricey - $3'800 US but well worth it for perfect reproduction.

AA11331817	I'm having the same problem on my Voyager Titanium, but mine's w/ both AIM and Yahoo IM, since day 1 (over a week ago). Verizon claims it's the system and not the phone, and that they're working on it. When I asked why the 'systems' working fine for everybody else and not me, they just gave me the run around, saying they weren't sure, that they were working on it. <br>  <br>  Did you call Verizon (*611 from Verizon phones, or (800) 922-0204 from others)? Maybe if more people report it they'll do something faster. Try *228 and update roaming and all that before calling if you've not done that already, as that's what they'll have you do, as well as restart your phone then taking the battery out and stuff/taking the battery out to jump start it (taking it out w/o shutting it off).<br>  <br>  Good luck

There are plenty of pros & cons to having a cell phone.

f4SYAgJeaa	the glitches involve the "Z" button, if you have the ball with someone, hold that down, then let it go, the ball will be released from your players feet and go a certain distance depending on how long you held the "Z" button (which is the large button on the nunchuk controller) if you knew that then sorry, but yea, you need to practice on how to use this glitch, i learned from watching other kids online, and then tried to copy them, <br>  <br>  Boo is more specific, but simple though, when you approach the goalie with boo and are holding down that "Z" button, use his deke, which is the down arrow on the D-pad of the Wii remote, Boo will disappear which is when you mash the shoot button, "B" and for some reason, the goalie can't stop the shot if done correctly, but you cannot get angry if it doesn't always work, since it is a glitch, and must be done perfectly<br>  <br>  And for lobbing in the air, just hold down the lob button "Z", and pass with "A", but if i recall, only players with good passing skills can do it, like Boo and Toad|`|hwaTOBL7aa	their not glitches. To do a lob pass then press Z+A, or Z+B<br>  sorry i forgot which one does a lob pass. <br>  <br>  Tip: press the control pad when YOU have the ball to hit some one or jump,roll,etc depending on the character.<br>  <br>  Tip: hold onto B long enough (without letting go of B) when you have a ball to do that character's special.<br>  <br>  <br>  To learn more simply read the instruction booklet that came with the game.

ZFuiy3Tsaa	This often happens whem the music is ripped from a burned cd. <br>  <br>  If the music is from a burned cd it is possible that Zune doesn't recognize the songs and labels them as Unknown. The first thing I would do is use the search feature of the Zune program. Search for the title of the song. If it shows up after the search right click on it and select the option show in collection. <br>  <br>  If it still doesn't show up in the collection even when you do a search then find one of the songs that does show up and find where on your computer Zune has stored it. Then go to that folder and see if the other music is there. If it isn't there then check some of the other folders that are near it to see if the music is there.<br>  <br>  Give that a try. If that doesn't work then use another program to rip the cd. Then move the music to whatever folder you have Zune monitoring for music. That should add it to the Zune program.|`|9byacd9Naa	It can happen when there is no quality application for ripping.

EfejPjIMaa	Legally, no.  You can buy a filter that goes between the PS3 and DVD recorder that removes the Copyright Protection.  Because the product is illegal, I can not give any links, but if you do some research, you can find them to buy online.|`|UzV0jc2haa	No maybe you could try but I am not guarrenting.  Try burning the movie on a disc that has nothing on it.  then try downloading the movie.  So then if it doesn't work then the copyright protection is impossible to get around

UtHnh0aHaa	Are you good at taking apart things and putting them back together?<br>  <br>  The spring is probably broken and needs to be replaced. If it is a good tape measure, you can buy a replacement spring at a hardware store and follow the directions to change it. It will be pretty easy if you are the least bit handy with things.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	This link could show a picture of the USB cable for your camera.  There should be software and instructions in the camera manual.  Would think the cable would have come with the camera.<br>  <a href="http://www.showmecables.com/productDetailsPopUp.asp?idproduct=4309" rel="nofollow">http://www.showmecables.com/productDetai...</a><br>  <br>  There may be USB ports in the front and rear of your computer. Try both and you may have success. Also, install any software that came with your camera and turn the camera on in Review Mode.<br>   <br>  There is an option in the Control Panel or Yahoo Messenger, Preferences (Calling & Audio) to select back or front USB and Audio inputs.  If you can find this place you may be able to choose the one you want to use, but until then just use the one that works.<br>   <br>  If you still have trouble, the following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer or memory card.<br>   <br>  Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer or the slots don't work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files. You can then select the memory card folder e.g.,100HPM417, that you clicked to see the picture you took and click Copy.<br>    <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|RwqziqWgaa	The end to the computer is a flat standard size connector (only one size available).

You will just have to play around with the settings until you get a stable picture. There is a switch on the component lead to switch from HD to normal component, try changing that.

You see, there's two versions of the 60 GB PlayStation 3.<br>  <br>  1) European/PAL CECHCxx (the one you have)<br>  2) NTSC CECHAxx (Japan/North America).<br>  <br>  Note -- CECHAxx and CECHCxx are PlayStation 3 model numbers.<br>  <br>  The NTSC 60 GB model includes both the PlayStation 2 "Emotion Engine" CPU chip and "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU hence offers 99% compatibilty with PS2 games. This model of the PS3 is the best to be released by Sony Computer Entertainment.<br>  <br>  The European/PAL 60 GB model excludes the PlayStation 2 "Emotion Engine" CPU chip. However, it still keeps the "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU. Due to emulation of the "Emotion Engine", the level of compatibility was reduced.<br>  <br>  1,782 of the 2,451 PS2 games (73%) released in Europe were playable on the European PS3.<br>  <br>  Edit: Call Sony Customer Service: 08705 99 88 77 or 800-345-7669 (800-345-SONY).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	It should if it doesn't try another ps2 game.

RpCwfcRzaa	Let it rest for at least an hours and try to turn it back on. If it still won't come on, turn it off and make sure all of the cables are connected properly and none came loose when you moved it. Check the power cable and make sure it's all the way in the back of the console. When you try to turn it on, look at the power brick and see if the orange light turns green. If none of this works, you luckily still have a warranty on it seeing as you just got it for Christmas. Have your parents call 1-800-4-My-Xbox and explain that it won't turn on. They'll walk you through a few steps to see if any will work. If it still won't, they'll have you send it in so they can fix it for free.|`|avfJI5CGaa	If you just got it.

oIcdt0FXaa	handbreak my sister uses that to put dvds on her ipod and she has a mac, handbreak gets the files off a dvd and then u need a program to convert the dvd files to mp4 search this on google because i don't know any.<br>  <br>  download handbreak from here:  <a href="http://handbrake.fr/?article=download" rel="nofollow">http://handbrake.fr/?article=download</a>|`|dp9CXhzRaa	you can try searching for bit torrent downloads of applications by the companies "xilisoft" and "cucusoft".Search those names and the word "iPod" in in the search bar.Unfortunately, most of the downloads are prolly for Windows.If you have no luck, you'll have to buy a copy through the company.I think its like 30 bucks for a license|`|Q80sgEa5aa	I don't think you can do that. I think you can only buy them from iTunes store.|`|uWFs6KO6aa	well the dvd is too big to fin the ipod|`|IGYa2yF6aa	Getting DVDs to load onto your iPod from your Mac is easy. First, you'll need a DVD ripper. I recommend one called Handbrake. You can download it free from www.handbrake.com. When you insert your DVD into the drive, it will show up on the Handbrake application. Click "Rip." As the DVD is ripped, it will be converted to a mpeg format. Then all you have to do is click and drag it from your desktop to your iTunes library. Rename it, plug in your iPod, and import your movies.<br>  <br>  That's all there is to it. Enjoy!|`|Mo2J38uAaa	I think if you burn your dvd onto your IPOD, or download the movie from a dif source like limewire for pcs, then transfer it to ITUNES it usually works, If you have a program to download music and shows for free on you Mac use that to transfer it to your IPOD if you can't transfer the DVD|`|HWcfmg8Maa	Well I think your not thinking...

Depending on how you obtain this program it might cost you money. <br>  <br>  If the DvD ripper doesn't automatically convert the copied DvD to .mp4, you will need a video converter. That might cost you money as well, depending on how you obtain the program.|`|5RhDnLHLaa	my sis has a ipod, you can't put a dvd in a ipod, you have to down load it of of lime wire ( make sure you use the safe) or real player.

5HfuI3MEaa	well, if you dont like any RPG games, then i suggest that uyou do not get the game. i love no more heroes. so, no, you might not like okami.|`|9M8lEQDqaa	I wouldn't say that Okami is a clone of the Legend Of Zelda games, but they are in the same genre so they have some similar elements.<br>  <br>  No More Heroes is a great game that I suggest to anyone who.<br>  <br>  De Blob is also a pretty good game for the Wii and it kinda sounds like you would be interested in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for the the Second question:<br>  <br>  Gradius and Super R-type are available for download on the Wii Virtual Console<br>  You may also like:<br>  Xevious<br>  Life Force<br>  R-Type III the 3rd lightning<br>  Gradius 3<br>  Super Star Soldier<br>  Fantasy Zone<br>  <br>  There are some more...|`|ghlZwYPEaa	You will probably not like Okami because the gameplay mechanics are basically the same as they are in zelda. Super Smash brothers Brawl is a great fighting game with your friends. You should also try call of duty world at war and medal of honor heroes 2. If you like old games like that then you should probably try the old metroid or Mega Man 9 on the wii shop channel.|`|EpvHhbByaa	No, you will not enjoy "Okami" if you don't enjoy "Zelda"<br>  An RTS on the wii is "Battalion Wars II," don't know if it's any good, however.<br>  <br>  An FPS, "The Conduit," is coming in June, so look out for that one.<br>  <br>  A 3rd person shooter that might interest you is "Resident Evil 4", unless you already have another version of that game.<br>  <br>  An action game (besides zelda which would fall under this category, not an RPG <.<) being released on March 10, 2009 is "Madworld" and is ultra violent and I think it might interest you. "No More Heroes" is also a good choise and is already released if you don't want to wait for "Madworld" to come out.<br>  <br>  And tons of old SHMUPS could be found on the wii's virtual console service, just need to buy them off their Wii Shop Channel. I think Gradius and R-Type are released on it.<br>  <br>  As for simulation, I don't think any good games in the category is released on the wii.
GWwffetQaa	I've heard you can dry it out if you put it in rice. My friends do it and it seems to work for them.<br>  <br>  Hope this will help your phone.|`|UQWusO1waa	first thing you should have done is to remove the battery so it would not damage any circuits. so do that now. Then try to dry it. dont put the batt back in untill you are sure it is dried out.|`|BILIAKSOaa	Take out the charger and let it dry out. I actually heard about putting it in a bowl of rice. It think that's supposed to help. Don't blow dry it because that could damage the phone. Leave it out for a couple of days. Look up on google for some other helpful tips because I don't think I helped that much. Charge the phone once you think it is fixed and turn it on. Hopefully it gets fixed. Worst thing you would have to buy a new sim card, right? <br>  lol, good luck. (:|`|ky3B42f6aa	Carefully dry it out -- put it in a warm dry room.  Take the battery out to prevent any short circuits (hoping that has not already happened).  Your chances are slim, however, since the integrated circuits are highly susceptible to precisely short circuits.  I did manage to get my digital camera to work sufficiently to at least take pictures again, though.  And even upload them to my computer.  So, if you are lucky!!|`|IxD8aNHTaa	take the battery and put it in a bag of rice for 2-3 days. The rice will absorb the liquid and the phone will be good to go!|`|IMwLfHQvaa	you sound like you could be " daughter"|`|Awo7g1K4aa	Sux 4 u.  TRy getting another phone.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Take it apart if you know how or have your husband do it & then blowdry it on low, then leave it apart & let air dry overnight. My husband fixed mine that way when someone put it in a glass of water at a party.<br>  <br>  And I don't know if this works, but my sons friend got hers wet & she told him she wrapped it in many socks then put it in the dryer on low a little while. She said it worked.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	BEcause you didn't let it dry out completely before you turned it on you shorted the phone or a part of the phone. In this case, the screen.<br>  <br>  There isn't really anything you can do besides get a prepaid phone from the store and just pop your sim card in.|`|OGhWKEWoaa	the screen is pry gone for good. i'd try taking it completely apart. Battery out and all that. Let it dry over night and then try.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Cwex6straa	Let it dry for at least 48 hours. Rice is a good idea, or those little packets in show boxes that absorb moisture.|`|JI6IYe9Aaa	soak it in plain rice for two days,<br>  it helps with water damage.|`|yVDaoZTpaa	go to AT&T they can fix phones.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	nope, u have to take it to the place u got it and see what they can do|`|QYbMxFE0aa	First off DO NOT try to turn the phone on. It will most likely kill any chances of it working again by frying the phones insides. I work at AT&T and the tricks I have heard from customers are:<br>  <br>  - Put the phone in Rice (it absorbs the liquid)<br>  - Take the phone completely apart and let it air dry for a couple days. <br>  - Take a blow dryer to it.<br>  <br>  The thing I would say is take it apart and let it sit in front of a fan. <br>  If you have insurance spend the 50.00 bucks and get another one sent to you. Other than that.. Hopefully you have the money to buy one outright.|`|HOedKyX2aa	Take it back to where you got it, (make sure there is no obvious water damage) and say that you turned the phone off and when turned back on the screen doesn't show. Should work, it'll have warranty if only a month old but i doubt they will accept it if you tell them it was dropped in water!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|MZ6e7UZMaa	I hate that! It might come back to life, but for now just try to keep it dry.  I had a nextel and spilled a whole bottle of water in my purse, and my phone got soaked. Surprisingly after the incident, it worked, albeit some minor glitches.|`|xFbntCMNaa	Go to the store and see. is this your daughter? Be sure to forgive her it was a accident. Your daughter didn't puposly drop her phone intop the water.

Leave it in for a few days.|`|Wcx49I40aa	i was able to fix one...but the other 2 my nephew put in the water were good as gone...hopefully u have insurance....|`|eq7IYnMaaa	This happened to me. <br>  take out the battery and sim card and let them dry over night.<br>  Then put it back together.<br>  Good luck|`|WVIWOohvaa	Get a new phone do u have insurance if not then put/soak it in rice|`|CbaSQOkDaa	soak it in a bag of rice|`|uGaivyoZaa	my sister put rice in it and it is supposed to absorb all the water.

Then, you need to install software onto your computer to recognize the camera and allow you to transfer the files from it. The software recognizes the camera as an external hard drive and allows you to access the files. Call your local Best Buy and ask them about it.|`|U7EWuA8haa	don't you have an usb cable? when you connect the camera and the computer through the cable and open the file containing folder with the pictures you must also find the videos there - just copy them. That's what I do (I also have a Kodak camera)|`|TqQcB2gWaa	either plug it into the computer or take out the memory card and put it in your computer (if it has a memory card, and if your computer has the right input, probably a SSD input)<br>  <br>  Once you pug it in, if noting pops up, go to start>my computer|`|n6IBfiDPaa	It should be the exact same way as you do your pictures. I have a Kodak camera and when its uploading my pictures onto my computer, it puts the videos on there as well.<br>  Sometimes it takes awhile to put them on though.|`|RaLiLTT9aa	It the same, the videos come off the camera just like the pictures do. Just upload the videos when you upload your next set of pictures. That how my camera worked, but I had a GE camera.|`|998f97d6c0bce2ae3b29f27253234babaa	Plug the camera into the computer and look in "My Computer" to find the Kodak drive and just copy and paste them to a file on you computer.|`|7Zm5dvIFaa	Get a card reader ?

AA12155452	You are right to be concerned, of course and it is brilliant that you have the vision to recognise the problems.  IF I were you, I would firstly get a qualified and written report on the state of the electrical system, defining what is incorrect, unsafe and needs immediate remedial attention.  Once you have a written statement in confirmation, you can present that to the surveyor requesting his comments and requesting why the points were never highlighted.  The bottom line here is that money is going to have to be spent, it's just a question of who foots the bill.|`|AA12180617	Yous should NEVER have signed the contracts if you had electrical issues pointed out.  since you have completed it is now up to you to get the place rewired unless it was in the sale contract.    if it is contact your solicitor - if its not fire your solicitor.    These sound dangerous and should be condemned - if you get an electrician or the electric company in  be prepared for them to disable the supply until works have been done.    the work sounds illegal and should never have been passed by the estate agent!      You have no recourse but via your original solicitor  and make a claim against the builder or NHBC  or to get a contractor in at your own expense - expect it to cost around 1200 to 1600.      As its a new build please name and shame the builders!!     You should realise now you get better homes and more space than new builds by buying from an owner occupier plus a much better price!!|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I am amazed none of this was pointed out on your survey...I think you take it up with those who did it, they are at fault if the wiring is so antiquated its unsafe.|`|3kYxlXV6aa	HOPE YOU HAVE VERY LOUD SMOKE DETECTORS FOR WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING!!

AA12271834	A more sure fire way to transfer the pictures from your camera to your computer is to access the camera as an external drive.  Go to My Computer and there should be a new drive in there with the same name as your camera.  If you click on it there will be a folder called DM000X or something like that.  In there will be all the photos on the camera.  View them as thumbnails and move them to any folder on your computer you want (drag and drop).  Once you move those pictures to your iTouch then you can delete the pictures on your computer.  If your worried about your camera leaving pictures on your computer you can do a search for *.jpg on your C:\ drive.  This will tell you all the jpg files on your system (which will include all the photos on your system).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ABtqc2WPaa	No idea.|`|302680db555a4c5eafb397d24fa76f80aa	look for the picture files on your computer (right click on Start and click explore for a windows operating system) and delete the files AFTER you have transferred them to your touch. then empty your recycle bin.
Fh0fOUzDaa	If you copy them to your ipod then delete them from the computer, then she won't be able to see them on the computer. If you want to be able to get them back on the computer eventually from your ipod, it could be a bit trickier, but not impossible.|`|Cwex6straa	If the plugging the camera in creates an extra drive in "My Computer" then you can just copy straight from that to your desktop, or wherever you want them.
05uraLcQaa	sounds like it could be a software problem. take the battery out of the phone for 30 seconds and put it back in (called a soft reset). this should help. if it doesnt, take it back to the sprint store you got it in and becuase its still within the 30 days of having a new phone they should be able to help you out whether you have insurance or not, just make sure its within 30 days since you bought the phone.|`|zpYbB0saaa	My phone just started going black on both the main and outer screens, there was no way to see anything. I could still call out as long as I knew the number, but there was no way to see if I was getting a call or a text. Thank goodness I'm getting a new phone tomorrow. These are junk...my advice get another one until they figure out all the bugs in the lotus. I know 4 other people besides me that this has happened to,

It is NOT possible to purchase the iPhone from Apple; ATT; Best Buy; or WalMart without in store activation; iPhone data plan; and 2 year service agreement in the U.S. You would have to seek other sources such as eBay or Craigslist.<br>  <br>  With a two-year contract, the price of an 8GB iPhone 3G will be $199; the 16GB model will be priced at $299 if you are a new customer or are upgrade eligible.  If you are not currently eligible, you may have the option to purchase an early upgrade priced at $399 for 8GB (black) or $499 for 16GB (black or white). Two-year contract required.

NDXhxaJ9aa	The power supply probably burned out. An easy to test if this is the case is to borrow a friend's power supply and see if the Xbox will run on that. Otherwise, it is something internal which would require professional repair.<br>  <br>  Edit: well, since you have diagnosed the issue as the power supply, I would simply replace it.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Did it start doing this as soon as you changed the bulb?  If so, maybe the bulb is not in right?  If you take it out and put it back in maybe that will fix it.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that the bulb timer has timed out?  That is less likely but to reset it you usually have to have the projector working so you can go through the on screen menu.<br>  <br>  If all that fails, maybe you have a bad bulb?  Or maybe the projector needs to be sent back to Infocus.

Troll somewhere else!<br>  <br>  EDIT: They MAY send you an 80 gig because the 40 is no longer made. However, I would say it is more likely that they would fix the laser in you current machine or they would give you a whole new machine and swap your hard drive into it. The warranty department (in any company) isn't in the habit of just replacing with new and holding on to broken equipment to be fixed later. They fix the product that is sent to them; that is their job!|`|4m8i8MfWaa	well you can try and fix it yourself using youtube or you can just pay the 150 i would go for the 150 if you have no idea how to fix it|`|1aqrRzqLaa	No you can't repair a huge problem with your PS3 like that. However, it is a really wise decision to pay the $150 because SONY will just send you new console, instead of you having for pay full price again. I sent mine it a couple days ago and it had a list of reasons that will get you a new system and if your PS3 can't read your blu ray disks than you get a new one. They will send you a 80gb system. I am hoping I get the 80gb.|`|4tOeSdXjaa	if it's all they way updated, it's done for and needs to be fixed. Just get a 360
lJAaBmlyaa	Nope the 8700 is bigger therfore a case for a 8700 wont fit a curve.
RrvJ99uaaa	Buy and sell used electronics at Gazelle. See link below.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Not sure how cheap they will be but you could check pawn shops in your area.
j5Apt8hWaa	At the end of your shooting session, copy all the images to your computer and then when safely there, format the card using your cameras format feature.<br>  <br>  When you have enough saved image files on your computer, you can back them up to a CD (700 MB) or a DVD (4.3 GB) and put them somewhere safe.<br>  <br>  It is also a good idea to carry a  spare card to you are not tempted to delete images on your card to make room for more ... this is perhaps the single most dangerous thing to do, since it can corrupt all the files on your card.  The other way cards become corrupted is when users do not format the card after they have copied all their image files to their computer and continue to use it after deleting some of the files to make more room  It is never a good idea to delete files from a card.  This can mess up the image index file (FAT or FAT32)<br>  <br>  If you do end up corrupting your card, you are looking as spending around $35 for a program which will try to recover the images for you, but there is no guarantee it will work on 100% of the lost files.
57480649613941c1fb8c81765ddf29f2aa	Yes the others are right. With the right set-up you can run an indefinite amount of on-line devices. Wireless or wired. I personally have 2 computers & 3 360's on my home network.|`|9wTsBxnSaa	yes. All you need is a router with 2 or more ethernet ports in. or run one or both by wireless. its easy to tell if your router is wireless, as it has a wireless antenna but its harder to set up.<br>  <br>  Here is xbox.com's help :<br>  <br>  <a href="https://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/XboxLive/GetConnected/SetUpAHomeNetwork/IntroToHomeNetworking.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/x...</a><br>  <br>  Hope it helped =)|`|NARak4iBaa	You can,  but if you both are running xbox live (or using the Internet connection) your speed well be slowed down.  If you have fast enough internet this shouldn't be a problem. <br>  <br>  Why get a second one?  your son can't use yours?|`|RJL9I2xpaa	yes, if you have wi-fi (wireless internet) you can.
bC5OAfs5aa	If your music are still on your iPod, you can use an iPod-to-iTunes transfer program to help you retrieve everything. I've used Movavi iCopy. Works pretty well for me.<br>  <a href="http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/Movavi-iCopy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/Movav...</a><br>  <br>  It will help transfer all music and video (both purchased and non-purchased) from iPod to iTunes and secure your iPod media content by copying it to your PC. More importantly, it will flawlessly sort video and audio content and preserve all your playlists. <br>  <br>  Best luck! For more iPod support information you can also go to apple's official site <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/</a>|`|14S2PmqEaa	I don't think you can get the music back.  Whenever you purchase music they tell you to make sure you make back up cds of the music you buy.  I would check itunes.com or if there is an apple store in your area call them.
sN87Hxueaa	In my opinion, the Rumor is a lot simpler, but the Rant has a lot more features for texting.    Good luck(:

q3vTZMt0aa	no. you can only see from the phone  so delete them  and yer good.    BUT - one thing he CAN do , is come online annd see your yahoo answers on. annd look at the questions youve asked....and see that you asked a question stating that there is texxt messages you sent that you dont want him to read|`|eVyGiF7Xaa	They dont see what you type. Only how much.|`|lqeQDRNnaa	lol nah it will not show up babe =]|`|RvOH0hjhaa	no it just tells him how many youve sent|`|aqegafmTaa	I don't think it's possible unless you have police technology or something. But he will be able to see numbers you've sent to on the bill. Not the messages though.|`|t7XnGkSOaa	you can only see them from your phone.  delete em'.|`|xri2lFpKaa	its impossible unless ur parents have set u up with a specific plan that records all of the info    which i doubt they would know about!@! ur safe!|`|4qSUqhNnaa	to be able to see it he would have to go in an ask for it. long drawn out process and they don't just give it out for nothing :]|`|wx1hUivLaa	For one thing i dont think your dad will go threw ALL the texts you sent, and no there is no way he can see those texts, unless u keeo them on ur phone and he manages to get it|`|OSUpfLULaa	no its not possible for anyone except the cellphone holder to see the text messages sent from the phone and if you delete them then they cant see them at all if you send them online then there is def no way he could see them dont stress out i think you should be fine|`|Wa6mMJyjaa	haha thats what i wondered then i found  out it doesnt show up on the bill but the bad part is that with certain phones u can go online and see them not most though so dont worry|`|dDeBJel5aa	nope, you'll be good as long as he don;t go through your phone|`|xyMqWvOJaa	u can't really check online unless they send it to your email, but your dad could get a print off from Verizon if he wanted to. so it might not be a good idea to get stuff you don't want him to see on it. :)|`|fSoqa6mdaa	lol, there is no way someone can see your text messages, in any phone company, unless they get your phone, or your phone's internal memory, the only way they MIGHT be able to see them, is by going into verizon wireless, and telling them to let him see them, but he need some kind of permit from the government and its only for serious life and death causes.    long story short: no, he cant. so hold on to your phone and secret messages.|`|2BoEjhA3aa	your parents can check the text messeges that you send and get thats why my friends doesnt like to text because her parents look at it online|`|UV5I0fdvaa	only the amount of texts that are received/sent are showed  and only the person who's name is in the contract can see (or law enforcement if subpoenaed)  they can ask verizon for a list of sent/received text messages for a certain cell number  but unless he's suspicious I doubt he will go that far|`|cdEVIDlxaa	The text messages could only appear on your cellphone.|`|OFveHXsOaa	nope jus how much youve been texting|`|3BrOSZujaa	No not at all, cell phones are private but i would erase them on your phone just incase. Don't worry that's not a stupid question.|`|dXcm5971aa	Don't worry, you can only see them on the phone, just delete them!|`|aQ8utQOeaa	No need to worry.  You cannot check online and it does not show up in the bill.  You are safe.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	No, it won't show up on the bill or anything. And you can't see text messages online either. The only way he'll see them is if you leave your phone laying around and he goes through the inbox/outbox.|`|utyBYnrBaa	Your all good.. lol.. as long as they dont get your phone.|`|42WmRqNoaa	Its possible. Your dad can ask for them. But they're not automatically on the bill.    Just be careful|`|ROWNVIUVaa	There's no other way short of hacking Verizon. You can't see them online, and the bill only shows the time and number it was sent to, no details. Relax.|`|MT1498npaa	Text messages can only be viewed on the cell phone.|`|jfUwbEBcaa	on my bill it just shows up how many i sent (which wasa a lot) and i have never found ne of my texts on the net either so i think u should be save love|`|OOptQPnFaa	depends on how much u txt|`|8IfePMa3aa	The account only shows how many were sent/received, you have to have the phone to know what's been said.|`|37PYnKr9aa	Nope your fine!|`|9DtJeAUKaa	No, but if Daddy ever has reason to need to check, if you are a minor, he can push the issue & probably get the info.|`|s6O9PU1iaa	i believe you can see them online in the message usage link of the bill if i am not mistaken. Verizon i believe just added something to where you can see the cell  number texts were sent to but not the message and that goes for calls too...sweetie in life its very hard to be sneaky and not get caught. so maybe you should lay off those kind of texts - whatever they are. Best wishes to you!
DUuf81tKaa	You could buy one of those plastic jelly covers for your phone. Some of them might have a hole for you to attach a keychain/charm. Or better yet, just get another phone if you're that desperate.

j5Apt8hWaa	If your camera has the firmware, it will record the number of shutter cycles in the image files EXIF data.<br>  <br>  To view the data, there is s free program called OPanda.  You can do a Yahoo Search for it.<br>  <br>  The shutter information will look like this <br>  <br>  "Total Number of Shutter Releases for Camera = 12321"<br>  <br>  -- from my old Nikon D200<br>  <br>  It is found near the bottom of the list of data.
2235a96a63c564e70804806a305bcd5aaa	Bigger screen, Touch Screen, update flash browser, camera, upload download features, etc. thats the mylo2 the mylo 1 has none of that. <br>  <br>  Its better at browsing and does more that is why its a new version, oh and also because it has wireless g/b and not just b like mylo 1.<br>  <br>  So in other words it does more and is an updated better system.
j5Apt8hWaa	The best landscape lens for your camera would be the Canon 10-22 mm wide angle zoom.<br>  <br>  It is a little expensive, but well worth it, even if you have to save for a year to buy it.  In the mean time, you can just use your 18-55 mm "kit" lens set at 18 mm to practice and learn to use your camera|`|i5OVORXgaa	For landscapes you'll want to use a wide angle lens (between 21-35mm on a full frame). The XSi and XTi both have a crop factor of 1.6X, so you'll want something between 13-21mm. And FYI, they can also use both EF and EF-S lenses.<br>  <br>  The best choice for you may be the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM
qWicVoU9aa	There are no truly free sites as cell phone records are NOT public records. To get the information requires that records searches be performed by a legitimate agency and they DO charge for this. You will find all kinds of sites that claim to be "free" but all you will get for free is the city and state. I have tried my personal cell phone number in many of these sites and they do not give correct info even at that. They usually come back and tell me that it is a landline number, which I know it is not|`|4gkepThIaa	call and hang up before the messiaing ****|`|2gDQrFxdaa	You could try in the yellow pages online, or any phone number search engine like that.<br>  But I'm not sure if it works for cell phones, because they are more of private, maybe not get the full name but you can get the company name for which the number is from.<br>  But for land lines if it's not under private or blocked number you should get a name.|`|nzD7HRdhaa	hmm u ask the company who bough this number or u call the number as a "prank" for example: <br>  saying that u belong to the company and need the personal info of who bough it to prove it and such sh!t coz someone said someone stole his cell with the number.. i did it befor ona friend and it worked i recorded it just for fun :D.. <br>  <br>  but that isnt "free" u gota pay the calling bill o.o
w7Ffw6MYaa	yes they do,<br>  <br>  Online and in the store. With the purchase of a new Net10 phone you get 300 free minutes with 60 service days.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ;-)|`|AA12063605	Well my net 10 phone did so yes I'm pretty sure they do. Also if you order new minutes after that the best way I've found to get them is online because you get 50 extra minutes for $5.|`|bb6cd77825eb74955d957ac23093ab37aa	ya but it cost like $5
bC5OAfs5aa	Yes. Many of my friends put their own movies onto their iPod. It's easy. The only thing you need to make sure is the movie format. It should be compatible with iPod - that is, mp4.<br>  If not, you will need to use some iPod converter to help you, like this one called Avex DVD to iPod Video Suite <br>  <a href="http://www.gutensoft.com/Multimedia/Avex-DVD-to-iPod-Video-Suite.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutensoft.com/Multimedia/Avex...</a><br>  <br>  It's a One-click, All-in-One solution which helps you create iPod movies from DVDs, TV shows and home videos. <br>  <br>  You can search more at <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a><br>  Best luck!|`|3CJAUyqPaa	Convert video to MP4 format. Drag it to iTunes. Sync iPod with iTunes. This presumes your iPod is video-capable.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Yes you can. Steps are as follows:<br>  Convert the movies into MP4. Once done open your iTunes and the folder with MP4 movies. Drag and drop the files to your library. Sync your iPod.<br>  <br>  Remember, that they have to be in MP4 format, otherwise they will not be recognize by iTunes and your iPod.|`|7QEcLWuzaa	Make sure the video is MP4 or H2.64 video for iPod.<br>  try Cucusoft iPod Video Converter Suite to rip DVD movie and convert videos in any format to iPod. It is the fastest converter I have used. Also, the output quality is great.

You will need a program called Magic DVD Ripper. Its not free but you can download it free on various Torrent websites but its considered illegal but everyone still does it. If you decide to go the torrent route. I reccomend Mininova and The Pirate Bay. Just get that and rip your DVD onto your Computer. Once you have done this then get Videora iPod Converter (Google it) THIS IS FREE. Then convert it. And transfer it to your iPod in iTunes|`|3piD14gAaa	Yeah but you need to put in MP4 Format.  Try Downloading Jodix, AnyVideoConverter, or a different free program that lets you change the format of a movie!|`|JI2x62nLaa	Yes, but if it is NOT MP4 then you will have to download a video converter but if you don't don't worry there are plenty of free legal ones out there, then add it to your movie section on iTunes then drag it to your iPod.

So really you have nothing to worry about - especially because you're doing it in Canada. I have unlimited texting as well and i always text my mates in B.C and Quebec.|`|JOx1FQC0aa	About Free texting can be read in <a href="http://free-yahoo-info.blogspot.com/?q=Free%20texting" rel="nofollow">http://free-yahoo-info.blogspot.com/?q=F...</a>
NuIWGFa9aa	Out of those I would say Zelda Twilight Princess because it has a good story line that will keep you busy for hours, if you don't really want to deal with a plot then play Wii music it is fun but not addictive. In my personal opinion I might even go out and rent a game if I were you like Call of Duty:World at War, Resident Evil 4, Mario Cart, or Shawn White Snowboarding they would be new and interesting.|`|aoke15yxaa	Legend Of Zelda Twilight Of Princess Is Awesome:D|`|ethmRAiLaa	wii music|`|1uVZkMuxaa	mario kart. best game ever!|`|pyC5kMA9aa	well, Animal Crossing is the best game ever and if you should get it....<br>  but, i think u should play  Wii Music!!! i luv that game me and my friends have a lot of fun|`|puMU4dIwaa	Super Smash Bros.

Lx8CB1HMaa	I've dealt with ALL major cable/ Satellite providers and I can tell you that Fios isn't bad, in fact I currently have it. <br>  The pros include: <br>  - Great picture quality<br>  - Nice HD <br>  - Very well organized channel line-up (like you don't have the food network right after Court tv or something, everything is organized into categories).<br>  - Lots of On Demand choices, a lot of which are free.<br>  <br>  The Cons include:<br>  - occasional loss of signal (this happened a lot when the service first came out, but hasn't happened to me in months!)<br>  -There's a huge gap in between basic channels and cable channels (they have greatly improved this since it originally came out however. Now there are only about 20 "local channels" with nothing on them half the time).<br>  - They have many "package choices" that include the Spanish language channels that you may be interested in. BUT they usually make you get a lot of extra stuff you may not care about.<br>  - There are so many channels (which is also a plus), so that sometimes it takes forever just to find the one you're looking for. A glance at their handy channel card helps this.<br>  <br>  Overall, Fios is decent and once you get used to the adjustment from regular or digital cable, you'll have no problem at all. <br>  Good Luck!

ethmRAiLaa	you will need to buy the mansion and garden stuff for yourself or un-install all your sims games or another expansion pack because when you install an expansion pack your game data is saved in a new file format. i think the main reason for this is because they don't want people to do what you have done

X92FdfPeaa	yes, especially when it is running a game because that is when it is working harder and if u ever hear a scratching noise, take out the disk, unplug the xbox 360 and hope it didnt scratch your disk. Very loud noises (when i mean very loud i mean unusually loud cause the 360 is already loud) then that might meen that somethings wrong.|`|sfUUml0Daa	it makes a whirring sound sorta like a fan. and if you have an intercooler attatched, it really sounds like a fan. and it beeps from time to time.

But you can use flash drive as a memory for the Playstation 3; it supports both read and write for mass storage USB device like a flash drive.|`|jDiGvVpmaa	NO|`|nZpSM7ngaa	the only 2 things you can use as memory for xbox is a 40 dollar memory card that holds a little less than half a gig, or a 120 60 gig harddrive.  for its size,  it sucks on memory,  it doesnt even have internal memory,  and its microsoft,  good luck finding a way to trick it into thinking the flash drive is one of those.

They send their signal to a cell phone tower and the equipment there changes it to a signal that transmits over phone lines.

hnXS1Nttaa	My thoughts<br>  <br>  Wii - the console you bring out when you have friends over - the games are really dry when playing by yourself. No really great games - just 1000 varieties of Mario and Sonic, the rest being terrible ports from the PlayStation3 and Xbox 360. <br>  <br>  PlayStation3 - Still overpriced ($699 retail price - still on its first price drop since it was released). Doubles as a BluRay (which can be great if you will be renting / buying BluRay movies, but an uneccessary feature if your fine with DVDs). A relatively small game - line up (not a lot of games that you can't get on the 360). Free online gaming, web browsing.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 - The biggest, bestest game - line up. Online gaming may have a trivial fee, but is world's ahead of the PlayStation Network. Not overly expensive. May have a few appauling reliabilty issues. <br>  <br>  Xbox 360|`|jxpV13rTaa	wii is targeted at a younger age group, but you can still have a lot of fun playing mario etc. you just miss a lot of good shooters with it.<br>  <br>  PS3 <br>  -one of the best blu ray players on the market (if not THE best)<br>  -free online play<br>  -rechargeable controllers<br>  -VERY reliable and durable<br>  -will have more games than the 360 at the end of 2009 (with bigger and better titles)<br>  -online play is great<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -game discs are blue ray (which makes better graphics than the 360)<br>  -only 0.2% defective rate after opened from box<br>  -won best console of 2008<br>  <br>  360<br>  -larger online community<br>  -online costs money to use<br>  -30% defective rate after opened from box (yes, 30!)<br>  -breaks down and creates the ring of death (scoaring of the discs until they arent readable)<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -has HD DVD player (which is obsolete and useless because they only make Blu Ray DVDs, not HD DVDs.)<br>  <br>  Dont waste your time with an xbox they will just break. i have owned both for a long time and the PS3 is by far the better choice. so its 100 dollars more...big deal. you get a larger hard drive and an amazing blu ray player. dont listen to bias people. you will get xbox lovers saying how the ps3 is junk. they are beyond ignorant. they are both amazing but the ps3 triumphs|`|tzDwuaTHaa	It really depends on what you use it for. As an employee of Gamestop, I am asked this all the time. The Wii is a console for families, parties, or small children. It is based on games that get people to work together and have fun. The Playstation 3 is more of a universal media console than anything else. The graphics are amazing on it, and online is free, but I find that the quality and reliability of the online play is questionable at best. The Xbox 360 is a everyman game console. It has tons of titles that everyone can enjoy, and even though Live must be paid for, it is far more reliable than the Playstation Network.|`|bU5QgsrKaa	xbox 360<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT FREE XBOX LIVE CARDS, M.S.

LKiVXEcCaa	Ok the guy above isnt that smart then... I have mine connected wirelessly to 3 different computers in my house. The 360 basicly gives you step by step instructions for your 360, then for the computer to connect it says you have to go to a certain website... xbox I think (dunno right off the top of my head) but it tells you to enter a code that you got from your 360 so that it can recognize it. THE worst problem I/ we ran into was the computer not letting us put in the code, so we redid it, problem solved|`|tzDwuaTHaa	It helps if the Xbox 360 is directly connected to the PC. Over any modem or router connection, your chances of getting the PC to recognize the box are slim.
m4VVsdmWaa	Check and see if your video cables to any of your appliances are plugged in securely to their proper spots and if they are and you're still having the black screen, your TV might have burned out if you've had it for a long time and used it frequently.|`|SOHkHQUBaa	plug in the yellow plug in the back of your tv or in the front
s7Muujxzaa	>will HDMI 1.3 cable prevent this<<br>  <br>  No. <br>  <br>  An HDMI 1.3 cable is certified and maybe tested to a wider bandwidth and that is totally different from propagation delay, which is what you are talking about. Besides, the signal still travels down that cable at roughly 95% the speed of light which means the cable has for all practical purposes, no delay.|`|akvrwpywaa	As the other answerer said, the cable often has little to do with the lag.  This is more of a characteristic of LCD and plasma televisions, which is one reason why many gamers favor CRT televisions for fast-action games.

EhD32t2Kaa	Well first, if it says, "could not access IM server", it probably means you only have one or two bars on your phone. Try moving to an area where it has three or four bars.

There is probably a short in the cameras advancing motor which is draining the life out of your battery.<br>  <br>  You will have to take it into a camera repair store and see what can be done.<br>  <br>  This is one of the main reasons I suggest you only buy used camera gear from craigslist.

That's what I have.|`|NUVvQ96Yaa	No, we just went through that. I am on my parents plan and I text them occasionally and they text each other. My mom insisted that it is free and she didn't see any charges on her last bill but I wasn't sure that was true. So I called Verizon and after going round and round with the customer service women, I found that it was quite simple. They charge $0.20 to send a text and $0.20 to receive a text. My mom didn't notice it because her total charges were less than a couple dollars. So whether you are texting a friend who also has Verizon or even if you are texting someone who is on your same plan, it costs at least $0.20 per text. You would think that they would change that. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would change service plans for a company that would offer free calls AND texting within the same company. Oh, and if you do get a text plan, get the $10 unlimited plan. It actually adds up to be the best. Expensive I think but it'll save you the outrageous charges if you do accidentally go over.|`|13iKOHXhaa	nope. it isnt unless you have a texting plan.
AA12288303	Microsoft has issued every xbox 360 owner a 3 year warranty to fix any issues with the RRoD. The one year warranty that I believe you are talking about includes any issues with your console. The three year is only Red ring related, so don't worry about this, you should still be covered.<br>  <br>  Generally the issue is with the three red rings- but you can still have them try. From there they will determine what to do with it. they will either give you a new one, give you a refurbished (used) console, or will do nothing and send it back. <br>  If you still want Microsoft to fix this, and they decline doing so, the worst you'll have to do is pay for their service which can run around $100. <br>  <br>  NOTE: The towel trick does not prove to do much of anything. But if you really want to attempt damaging your 360 to get the red rings, it would be worth a shot. Keeping it on all night isn't very effective but may help you. Like anything, it will be a waste of energy, but you will not find your electric bill to be much higher. Just be sure to keep an eye on your 360 at all times.|`|LKiVXEcCaa	They do check the systems so don't try that. If you want to get rrod do the towel trick... basically wrapping it up and letting it fry itself, BUT DON'T TELL THEM U DID THIS IT VOIDS WARRANTY ONCE U THINK ABOUT IT|`|3b5AOCZFaa	Dont listen to anyone else, the towel trick FIXES the RRoD , it doesnt make it occur. Leaving it on for a long time might do it, but not necessarily. just have some intense gaming sessions like 5-7 hours a day. or try dropping it.|`|ok4DPpHlaa	Towel Trick.

AA12288303	Yes, they do take back Xbox 360's. Keep in mind that you will receive a lot less then what it was bought for. A few months ago I did the same thing as you, I returned my xbox 360 elite- with the console and all the cables, you will be able to get about $70 back from it, with the controller will make it $80, and with the hard drive will bring it to about $90- $100. <br>  <br>  Just be sure that is what you want to do. As for what else to buy, you'll need to be more specific. It really depends on what other system you have. You also don't have to spend it right away. Wait until something that interests you comes out.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	yes they do!,  i sold my halo 3 edition xbox 360 for 70 dollars only though,  so if its still up and running,  id try to sell on Ebay or a friend before anything else.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	Gamestop will take it but not for alot of money.<br>  They only give u store credits..|`|04jKvHBDaa	First of all you could have just called them, but yes they do.
IoKjLtN9aa	Do not let it sync, this may erase all the music you have on your iPod, which can be a headache! I think the easist way to do this if you have NOT purchased your music through the iTunes store is to download a program called SharePod.  (found here) <br>  <a href="http://www.getsharepod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.getsharepod.com/</a><br>  <br>  Instructions on how to move the music to your iTunes library can be found on the website, I would give you a link but yahoo prevents me in doing so as it's rather long. On the sharepod website click "Help" and then near the "Free your iPod" text you will see a "copying" link, you'll want that one. This is about the easiest way for windows users! <br>  <br>  If you have boughten all your music off of iTunes just click the file menu option and "transfer purchases". <br>  <br>  Good luck! If you don't want to download the program just update your information and I'll give you a work around, but it's a bit more complex! <br>  <br>  Don't worry about downloading SharePod no viruses or any type of malware. I've used it before with satisfactory results!|`|cTVPyN5Maa	SYNC THE SONGS FROM THE iPOD TO THE PC.<br>  Once you plug in the iPod it should say "sync" or something like that, let it sync.<br>  Or press on your device and go to the lower right corner and press sync when your on "summary.

The number "1080" represents 1,080 lines of vertical resolution (1080 horizontal scan lines),[1] while the letter p stands for progressive scan (meaning the image is not interlaced). 1080p can be referred to as full HD or full high definition to differentiate it from other HDTV video modes.[2] The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels. This creates a frame resolution of 1920×1080, or 2,073,600 pixels in total. The frame rate in hertz can be either implied by the context or specified after the letter p (or i), such as 1080p30, meaning 30 Hz.<br>  <br>  1080p is sometimes referred to in marketing materials as "Complete High-Definition". However, 2K/4K digital cinema technology is commercially available, and ultra-high definition video is in the research phase.<br>  <br>  In addition to the meaning of 1080p as a display resolution, 1080p is also used to describe video equipment capabilities. Use of 1080p and the closely related 1080i labels in consumer products may refer to a range of capabilities. For example, video equipment that upscales to 1080p takes lower resolution material and reformats it for a higher resolution display. The image that results is different from the display of original 1080p source material on a native 1080p capable-display. Similarly, equipment capable of displaying both 720p and 1080i may in fact not have the capability to display 1080p or 1080i material at full resolution. It is common for this material to be downscaled to the native capability of the equipment. The term "native 1080p-capable" is sometimes used to refer to equipment capable of rendering 1080p fully.<br>  <br>  ATSC and DVB support 1080p video, but only at the frame rates of 24, 25, and 30 frames per second (1080p24, 1080p25, 1080p30) and their 1000/1001-rate slow versions (e.g., 29.97 frames per second instead of 30). Higher frame rates, such as 1080p50 and 1080p60, are foreseen as the future broadcasting standard [3], but they could only be sent with more bandwidth or if a more advanced codec (such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and AVS) were used.<br>  <br>  In the United States, the ATSC is considering amending its standard to allow the incorporation of the newer codecs for optional usage like the DVB Project consortium already has done with DVB-S2.[4] However, doing so is not expected to result in widespread consumer availability of broadcast 1080p60 programming, since most of the existing digital television sets or external digital receivers in use in the United States would still only be capable of decoding the older, less-efficient MPEG-2 codec, while the bandwidth limitations do not allow for broadcasting two simultaneous streams on the same broadcast channel (e.g. both a 1080i MPEG-2 stream alongside a 1080p MPEG-4 stream).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Production standards<br>  The movie industry has embraced 1080p24 as a mastering format in both native 24p form and in 24PsF form. This may be the first universal video standard which transcends continental boundaries. This is an area previously reserved for film.[5]<br>  <br>  A new high-definition progressive scan format is not available for picture creation, but is currently being developed to operate at 1080p at 50 or 60 frames per second.[3][6] This format will require a whole new range of studio equipment including cameras, storage, edit and contribution links (such as Dual-link HD-SDI and 3G-SDI) as it has doubled the data rate of current 50 or 60 fields interlaced 1920 × 1080 from 1.485 Gbit/s to nominally 3 Gbit/s. It is unable to be broadcast in a compressed transmission to legacy MPEG-2 based HD receivers. This format will improve final pictures because of the benefits of "oversampling" and removal of interlacing artifacts.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Availability<br>   This section does not cite any references or sources.

(March 2008) <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Broadcasts<br>  In the United States, the ATSC standard allows 1080p24 and 1080p30 video. In practice, 1080p is extremely rare in broadcasting, as all major networks use a 60 Hz format in the MPEG-2 header – either 720p60 or 1080i60, and the consumer televisions do not support codecs needed to support 1080p50 or 1080p60 as of yet.<br>  <br>  For material that originated from a 24 frame/s source (such as film), MPEG-2 allows the video to be coded as 1080p24, irrespective of the final output format. The progressively-coded frames are then tagged with metadata (literally, fields of the PICTURE header) instructing a decoder how to perform a 3:2 pulldown to interlace them. While the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process from such stations is 1080i60, the actual content is coded as 1080p24 and can be viewed as such. That is to say,|`|8EmeNHyjaa	If you want it for gaming and blu-ray,1080p is the way to go.But if you want for watching tv get 720p.Samsung or Sony are great brand that I suggest.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Your girlfriend better be an otherwise excellent girlfriend if she's denying you a big screen TV ;-)<br>  <br>  Anyway, everything I've heard says at that size and viewing range, you won't see a difference.

jKc7aDCwaa	Nintendo doesn't release details about when the updates are or what it'll update. Of course they'll attempt to stop people from hacking or modding, but there's no telling whether channel updates will be in the system update or part of a separate channel update. They are supposed to roll out a "Video Channel" sometime this year, as they released it in Japan a few months ago. And considering how much Nintendo charges for their Virtual Console and WiiWare games, it's doubtful (without hacking) that it'll ever be as easy as dropping games onto an SD card and playing for free. They'd probably just offer them for free on the Wii Shop before they'd do that.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	nobody knows when yet, the update lets you play games online with less lag, and will search and break wii's that are modded. no, it wont let you play games from your SD card.

Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Sharing<br>  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|3piD14gAaa	I use DVD Video Soft.

The best, and cheapest way to get music downloads is through snappy-music . com.  They offer unlimited music downloads for only a few bucks a month.  It's much cheaper than any other site I've came across and they are 100% legal paying the artist for their hard work in making music you enjoy.  They also have just about every song in every genre.
