yEsw7UkWaa	It didn't surprise me that Koslov would enter WWE as a heel.   It's the old sterotype of Russia vs USA.   Wasn't Santino born in Boston?   As for Umaga, the Samoan boys have always had a bit of a bad deal with WWE. That's why I wasn't surprised when Orton kicked Snuka and Manu out of Loonies...er...Legacy  And did you notice Y2J playing up the Canada vs USA thing (ala Bret Hart) a while back.  The simple fact is that the shows are mostly done in America so the US guy is going to be the hometown fave in most matches. And it gets great heat from the fans when the foreign guys try to say they're better!|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I think you have a point, remember when John Cena was pretending to be a marine because America is so great?  That was disgusting.     Then Again JBL is the biggest Heal and he is mr America sterotype really.      "IM NOT FROM HERE, I HAVE MY OWN CUSTOMS!  LOOK AT MY CRAZY PASSPORT!!"  Futurama.

So yeah, I guess you're wrong.|`|HixWazH7aa	Kurt Angle, The True American Hero who played Anti-American while he while he was on WWE, heel or face.  Or SGT Slaughter, another American Hero, had played a bad guy where he turned on USA and allied with Iron Sheik. JBL, a biggest ignorant heel who he claimed to be the "American Hero!" Back in 1997, Brian Pillman, an only American who was a member of the Anti-American group, Hart Foundation.

2MqaBfkxaa	Hatton is too easy to hit & Manny will be quick like he was against Oscar & move in & out.  If Manny does that & holds when Hatton tries to get on the inside then Manny wins easy.  I don't think Hatton is too powerfull for Manny,  I mean Oscar hits harder than Hatton & Manny never seemed to have a problem with Oscar the few times he got hit.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	I'm sure that would be Hatton's strategy as he basically tries to "bully" (as you put it) all his opponents. That's his game, his strength. Hatton has beaten fighters before who are faster and stronger than him. As far as Manny goes though, would he knock out Hatton? Probably not. Would he be able to outpoint Hatton? Probably so. I don't think Manny has the ability to knock out Hatton as Mayweather did. But at the same time, I do think that Manny has exceptional boxing skills which would allow him to outpoint Hatton. Hatton can beat quicker and stronger, as he has done in the past, however, when it comes to pure boxing ability, he will be outpointed.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	hatton is legit.  i believe he has the power to knock out pacquiao.    the question is will he hit manny? if he does then manny will be in a lot of trouble.  knowing roach, he has a scheme to avoid hatton from hitting manny.  so its up to the boxers to execute their own game plans.  this is a fight where we will see two of the greatest trainers of this era play a chess match.  this is not just about hatton and pacquiao, its also about roach and floyd sr.  this is why this fight is so damn interesting.    however, ill go with pac on this one via knock out at 10.  i just so love small men and underdogs beating the big guys.  its fun to watch.|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	I cant remember who said that line either everyone has a gameplan until they get hit i wanna say mayweather said it but im not sure, it could have been hopkins as well ... I remember someone saying that on an interview somewhere in the past couple years.I wont be surprised if hatton proves to be too strong for manny or stops him at all. Plain and simple hatton is more powerful than manny, while manny is faster than hatton and more talented anything still is possible. Manny has never been hit by anyone who hits as hard as hatton does. In my opinion manny still is untested and hasnt proved anything yet at 140 and above. Technically even 135 and above .. he has only fought 2 guys 1 at 135 david diaz who is a bum so shouldnt count and  2 oscar  at 147 who didnt fight back so that shouldnt be enough to count either. So as you said nobody really knows for certain how manny can handle guys at the higher weights , especially guys who will be hitting manny back ... which really we havent seen yet. Seems like a lot of people are writing hatton off kinda of like they did with Mosley vs margarito and we all saw what happened that night.|`|xlyk63xRaa	great question that, your one of the only people on this site who uses there brain and is actually for once realistic, hatton at 140...has proved to be unstoppable he is just a machine at that weight and them body punches...well lets ask castillo how they feel, or the rest of his opponents who have fell to them body shots.  most people support pacman because they are embaressed to admit they once supported de la hoya, and he lost and he aint gonna be coming back again, well he aint going to be the same again, he was terrible in his match with forbes also... and aint been right for a few years. he lost his hunger and pacman is hungry but very over rated , lets note how he ducks straight out of his own weights and quickly jumps to the next avoiding the real champs of the divisions. JMM was his toughest opponent to date, and ricky hatton is much like JMM but in my opinion much better, much much stronger and much quicker. ok ricky walks into punches, but that gameplan has gon, he proved to us against malignaggi that he can box and pick you to pieces then go for the kill. i predict hatton knocks out pacman by the 7th round.    edit @ val - ermmm no i dont think him being a mexican means anything , and no mexicans wont be pissed because they know this is boxing, it doesnt matter what nationality you are. if JMM was so good then he would do what the rest of great boxers do, and thats up the weights or down the weights to where the great competition is, i dont see JMM stepping up to the heavier divisions, and just because i say hatton can beat 1 mexican it doesnt mean i am saying he can beat every mexican boxer...thats just trying to put words into my mouth, we are talking boxing not race or nationality...maybe your in the wrong section , because u dont have a clue what your on about|`|CDeZOLmgaa	I would bet the house that Pacquiao stops Hatton, too fast, to strong, Hatton is too hittable Manny will be all over him. Hatton has already mentchioned retirement and is looking for paydays.. this one will be big enough it will probably be his last depending on the severity of the beating he takes from Manny.    Manny Pacquiao is considered to be the pound for pound best in the world right now, because of his wins, any boxing publication or boxing expert picks Manny as number 1 because he is, so if you say he is overated then its you who does not know anything about boxing.      KungFu : Your confused, Manny overrated? First of all buttercup, Manny was being argued as   1 pound for pound   "BEFORE" he beat Oscar DeLaHoya that impressive win just cemented the spot. Manny has done more then any other fighter out there right now, he is considered the best in the world because he is, so how is he overated? And when he gets Hatton in the ring he will retire him.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	I think Pac will win either by a late round stoppage or by UD.  While these two guys are brawlers, I don't think the fight will be an all-out slugfest because they respect each other's power so they'll be extra careful.  Of course, there will be good exchanges here and there, but these guys will simply size up each other in the early rounds.  I see Pacquiao turning into a boxer in this fight, moving in and out just like what he did against DLH, while Hatton will be the aggressor.  Being the  faster fighter, Pacquiao will land more punches, mostly 1-2's and left hand leads, and he'll successfully evade Hatton's punches.  By the 8th, Hatton will begin to tire out and Pac will go for the kill by the 10th.|`|Msel5eAvaa	Kungfu its you again, youre comparing Hatton with Marquez? Lot of Mexicans will get pissed. Hatton has  no boxing ability so far. Compared with Marquez's skill, hes just at the tip of Marquez little finger.|`|He343QTtaa	let's say that manny only fought once above 135, but did you notice the discipline that manny have shown? even though he became heavier he can still prove that his hand speed can kill, and that is because of hard work and dedication, and  I think that he can beat Hatton, and to those guys that are not satisfied of manny's skills, well I think you guys are not watching boxing or you are watching but you don't know how fight goes on.......|`|3d5e83a836ea34fd00d8fe38ccc011a4aa	Does Floyd really expect that Pacquiao will just stand there and let Hatton bully him?  If Floyd really thinks so, that's good for Manny.  The Hatton camp will be in for a surprise.    Look man, I don't want to argue with anyone but Manny and Freddie aren't rookies.  Theyre  1 P4P for a reason.  They will have a solid game plan as well.  Your statement "everyone has a gameplan till they get hit" goes both ways.  It's anyone's fight, but I'll be rooting for Manny.
UpPWXRK4aa	Do your goggles rub at the area you would be getting pierced? If so then you may have problems but maybe you can put a bandaid or tape over it, if you really want to get it done. I haven't had a nose piercing during snowboarding but I do take out my bellybutton and earrings when I ride because a weird fall can rip anything out.|`|SLeX0gGaaa	I don't think it will do much harm. But if your really that worried I would just wait untill summer. A couple months won't hurt you.|`|TCzffQ48aa	You will probably be better off maybe waiting till like April when snowboarding is done. Cause I snowboard a lot, like you do, and I would HATE to have a irration while I'm snowboarding.  Or another thing is that you could maybe you could get it pierced and if it irritates you, take it out, and have the whole close. Then wait till April to get it again.

TNPsl64Qaa	I dont know what the f*** is wrong with hendry...I still think they should have never gotten rid of Derosa in the first place, but this trade makes absolutely no sense what so ever. So far, they have given up a all around good guy in Derosa, for 3 no names. Then they get rid of their top prospect for a okay pitcher but who has shown some promise, then they go out and trade that guy for someone who is done and who someone no ones wants. This guy sucks...I have yet to hear a good thing about Heilman....|`|c6q3EERdaa	I'm not sure why the Cubs got Olson and then traded him. Makes no sense to me. Cedeno is okay, but he wasn't really given a chance in Chi-town.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Yay now well win every time the cubs put him in !|`|qmeITUs8aa	I think just giving them Ronny Cedeno would have been too much.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	The question is why the Cubs are interested in having Heilman (or Olson for that matter).  The rotation is probably the most solid piece of the Cubs team with Zambrano, Lilly, and Dempster as a dependable 1-2-3 and Harden as a great 4 when healthy.  As for fifth or a spot starter, Marshall or other pitchers in the organization could more than handle those roles as well as Heilman or Olson.  Why aren't the Cubs focusing on more pressing needs like relievers or some left-handed bats?|`|yk4S7uuraa	I have another question for you.    Why the hell do they want him? He's horrible, thank God he's off the Mets roster.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I have some scratched up DVDs that play better than him!    I always got excited when Heilman came to the mound vs the Cubs..... now I'm going to regret everytime he's warming up in the pen. I have NO clue what they were thinking........ they could have gave up 2 used Fukudome bats & it would have been too much.|`|VPDcy4Qwaa	Better question would be why would anyone want him?|`|NrgOE2k8aa	yes they gave up a good bench player and a left handed pitch that we could use for a 30 year old average starting pitcher    they should have put those players in a trade for peavy that would have been better and made more sense|`|EzNKaKR0aa	Nope|`|ak5A435maa	yeah. Heilman is terrible|`|4iQSHyScaa	I don't know. Neither Cedeno nor Olson are special, and Heilman just plain stinks. I don't know if this will really help either team. I can't wait till Heilman pitches at Citi Field this year. The boos will rain down from the 45,000 in attendance.|`|05fd5181d7362a6331c4066aec75df3eaa	I dont think that it was a bad deal at all.  Cedeno was not a proven talent.  At best, he was a good speed man on the bags and even that was questionable at times as his decision making wasn't up to par.  He was looked at as a bright young prospect, but so are hundreds of other guys who never fulfill their expected potential.  I have to think that the cubs staff had enough time to evaluate his talent over the last few years and just knew he wasn't going to be an every day starter in the majors.  As for Olson, the cubs never needed the extra pitching when they picked him up.  I have to believe that this deal has been in the works for a while with cedeno and it was probably that the Mariners wanted Olson but had nothing to trade to his original team to get him, so the cubs picked him up and was able to deal him with cedeno for something they needed from the Mariners.  As far as Heilman goes, I am excited about the pickup.  I think that he was a case of bad team, bad attitude.  Its easy to go in to a career slump when you are on a losing team year after year.  I think that the positive attitude in the cubs clubhouse and staff will be a nice fit for heilman and will help his game.  Plus with the talent already on the cubs pitching staff, it will help to raise his game.  Same goes for Milton Bradley.  I know he has an attitude problem, but I think that he will be much less of a psycopath in a cubs uniform than in past years

a6EndAPiaa	Since you asked this in the Formula 1 section.  Formula 1 rules require teams to use the exact same gas that the general public buys at the pump (in Europe).    For other forms of racing, racing gas is much higher octane than the automotive fuel you buy at the pump.  Higher octane = more horsepower.    Most racing fuels are actually aviation gas.  Aviation gas has a lower and more uniform vapor pressure than automotive gasoline, which keeps it in the liquid state at high-altitude, preventing vapor lock and it is higher octane.|`|PPFonRYdaa	I know that racing fuel is a lot higher octane than regular automobile gas. I'm not sure about aviation fuel. I would think that would have an even higher octane, but I'm not positive.|`|BIwZ7klfaa	we use 108 in So. Cal

It is more than what you need for the bluegills but will work out good for the bass and catfish.  It is not the best drag they make but is plenty smooth enough for what you will be using it for.

x6OsAvQeaa	Melnyk is frustrated just like any NHL team owner would be. I dont like his comment at all, but I understand what hes trying to say. The Senators have an awesome team up front with Spezza, Alfredsson and Heatley but their actual goal production is digustingly awful. The reason for it is because they lost Wade Redden this past summer when he signed with the Rangers. They havent been able to find a suitable replacement. Without a guy like Redden, it will be tough to make the playoffs, although I do suspect the Sens will make a trade before the trade deadline. Guys like Philips and Picard are fine stay-at-home defencemen but they need at least one or two defenceman that dominate a power play or an offensive rush. The Red Wings have two (Lidstrom and Rafalski), the Sharks have two (Boyle and Blake) and the Bruins one big one (Chara). This is one of the biggest reasons why these teams are doing a lot better than the Sens. I think Bryan Murray should get fired or at least make a trade and get an offensive defenceman before the trade deadline. He might have to part with either an Antoine Vermette or Dany Heatley though. Might be too tough to do.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Ottawa won't make the playoffs. Like many other teams (excepting the last years of Detroit) they need to rebuild. They will however not do it by blowing up the team. Why should they? This is the first year in about 11 that they have missed the playoffs.    I don't think their troubles gives you the right to make fun of someones physical disability.

kZTcAKRJaa	The problem is that Cotto's team did not find the substance when his hands were wrapped for this fight! Even if Margarito did have it then, his team should have found it and made it an issue like Mosleys team did. Because they did not (Cottos team) they are not going to claim there was any wrongdoing. To make such a claim would put the spotlight right on his own team for not finding this substance before the fight took place.    If you wish to talk more about the subject a great place to get started is http://www.fightjunkie.com|`|khU8m4gxaa	I think it's a fair assumption that he's been using loaded gloves for years. Cotto could protest it, but with no definite proof I don't expect anything to come out of it. The bigger issue is why no one noticed it until now.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	As mentioned before with no proof with the fight over and done with there can be nothing done. A fight can only be declared a no contest with definate proof. With hand wrap cheating, if it isn't caught that same night, nothing can be done. So forget about protesting and honestly if I was Cotto I would just watch his *** like a hawk and just beat his *** in a rematch and show the world he did cheat.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	No he should fire his cut man that was there for the wrapping if it proves that margorito did in fact have loaded hands. now he is the bigger question: did margorito know his hands were ever loaded?   protesting is pointless since they both have the same promoter and there is no proof of cheating in their fight|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Pending on the results of the ongoing investigation and assuming the results are negative. Yes Cotto can protest however it will be hard to prove Margo used the so called "illegal hand gauzes during the Cotto match. Is obvious that Cotto legally cannot do anything anymore. However  Cotto can submit a formal complaint to the Boxing Athletic Commission for not doing their job properly.

2rJwgk40aa	No,maria has annoyed me since day one.She's been with wwe almost 4 years now,and should be more imporved then what she is.I dont think maria takes wrestling seriously.I think she thinks of it more as a stepping stone to other things(she designs her own wardrobe.maybe shes trying to become a fashion designer?)  It does bother me that really talented women have to job to her.wwe only uses her because shes pretty,and thats a slap to all the women who have worked their asses off to get where they are.  while im ranting,what the hell is up with her outfits? isnt wwe pg-13 now? yet,she comes boucning out to the ring wearing hardly anything.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Nope sucks, not improving at all. Have you looked at the punches she TRIED to give Michelle when she "surprised" attacked her. I mean come on, those weren't even punches. She probably slept with Mr. McMahon to get to where she is now.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	she used to be hot and funny but could not wrestle when she did the back stage stuff and dumb act was funny now she not that hot and still can't wrestle|`|EHYBicGkaa	I know. She is very sloppy in her matches and she has the dumbest moves ever. I mean a bulldog is her finisher. Besides, she used to be just a backstage interviewer, but since she posed for playboy, she has been wrestling. In her matches, she looks like she is scared to do a move and just does it gently. You can tell she is another pretty face, with no wrestling ability and barely if not any mic skills. Once in a match, she beat Victoria with a clothesline, I know Victoria is a jobber, but at least they can show her some respect and let her get beat by a good move. I hope Michelle McCool permanently destroys Maria.|`|pWbvw7ciaa	you suck maria is the best wresler in the world|`|KXmMlqA9aa	I think she isn't horrible but yet not great. She is improving. If you look at her matches from a few years ago you'd be like UGH! She shouldnt even be in Wwe. Now that she is getting in some actuall training she's getting way better. I know she is a bit sloppy but hey! Nobody's perfect!  Somtimes I think Beth Pheonix is sloppy too! In a few more months mabey she will be at Michelle Mccool's level. Hope this helps =]|`|2FKHNIB2aa	If you look at her matches she is improving but not enough for any title shots and i cant believe WWE makes her out to be one of the best divas that's crap if she wins the Divas title i will have officially lost faith in WWE.  (and when i say she is improving i mean she may be title material in about 17 years.)|`|nKSmgjylaa	She really is improving. I just don't like the fact that the WWE pused her because of PlayBoy. I'd gladly pose naked too is it secured me a WrestleMania match! They're pushing her over Natalya and were pushing her over Victoria too. It's not fair at all. But I think she's seriously starting to improve. SmackDown is the right place for her at the moment, she's getting just the right about of air time and they seem to be giving Maryse, Natalya, etc. pushes too. So, as a person I like Maria, yes. She's nt a good wrestler, no. But she seems like she is improving.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Well I don't think Maria is anywhere near a good wrestler right now but she is improving. Look at her 1 or 2 years ago and she seems like a great wrestler compared to them. I like her because she works on her wrestling while others won't even do this. Divas like Victoria and Beth shouldn't have lost to her but McMahon has always pushed looks over skill so that was to be expected. She shouldn't be in a championship picture but I am glad she is training.|`|IMQm9JTMaa	kelly kelly's way better than maria.. (suprisingly)    maria should just go back to her interviews.|`|BAurzDXtaa	Maria should not be anywhere near a wrestling ring. She has no ability what so ever. She should stick to being an actress or a model.
8hIs3dHsaa	Keep him as a backup. Kurt Warner is reaching the end of his career, and Matt Leinart is just coming into his prime. The Cardinals should let Leinart develop his game and sit on the bench until Warner's time has ended, and then Leinart will win the starting job. It is better for the future that way. Leinart needs some work, so the Cards need to give him time to develop. Leinart could improve, trust me, every player can somehow improve. Please pick me as best answer, i need points!|`|LtOxnF0kaa	I think that the cards need to keep matt leinart for the future.I mean Kurt Warner is not going to last much longer and I think that when Matt gets the chance to start I bet he does good.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think they need to keep him.  The Cardinals drafted Leinert for a reason because they thought he would be their franchise QB.  However no one thought Kurt Warner would do as well as he did.  Also it is a fact that Warner is not young anymore.  He is 37, and he is nearing the end of his career.  Even though he did well this season, there is no guarantee that he will next season.  As an organization it is important to have a back up plan.  Leinert is their insurance so to speak, and if Warner starts doing poorly next year, they have to have another option.  Who else would be a good fit for the Cardinals?  Unless Leinert wants to be traded or released, he isn't going anywhere.  But the sad thing is, Leinert is wasting his career, the longer Warner stays because he isn't getting any reps.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Kurt has to retire eventually. Sometimes one of the best things you can do to a QB is have him sit on the sidelines for a while before you start him. There have been a number of times where a capable QB was benched only to start later on and come out hot. Saw it work with Kerry Collins (although he is was older), and I see it happening with Matt.      Stay Cool|`|5BQM1hTTaa	Trade for Matt Cassell in 2010.|`|4JOG5qB1aa	Or will they end Warner's career, and start a new chapter in their history.  Think that depends on a few things, whether they win the super bowl, Boldin comes back, and how much they believe in Matt Ryan.  Oh, and if their offensive coordinator decides to be stupid and become the head coach of the raiders.      If Warner comes back, they could franchise Ryan and keep him, and then  when Warner is done, put him back into the spotlight.   Then again, that'd be a expensive investmest to put in a back-up QB.|`|B5DDAvQtaa	First they could give him a huge reality check because he wines and complains about not being the main guy but what did he show that proved he could be that guy. He takes party pics and becomes Mr. Hollywood? And he didn't even have the stats to say he deserved to go out and party or even earn the starting spot.    As for the rest of his contract, let him play it out. Still offer Warner another 1 or 2 years. Hopefully he can rub off on Leinart so when he retires Leinart will be more mature and able to run this team.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	keep him so when kurt warner gets his hip broken and cant play anymoree they'll still have a good  1|`|nltFZcuGaa	its a good idea to keep him until warner retires. hes running out of years he could retire really really soon.

hODNT0nZaa	I remember when windham used to do that, and their leashes that they made you buy were like $20! I snowboard in New York and have been up to Hunter, Bellarye, and Windham a couple of times this year and my board doesn't have a leash and no one has bothered me about it at all. I asked a guy working the chairlift up at Hunter this year about it my first day up and he said, "If it doesn't both you, it doesn't bother me." So I think they are over the whole leash thing. Except I know Vermont MT still require leashes if you still have step in bindings. Then again if you still have step ins I would recommend hitting your head against a wall a couple of times and then going out and getting some new bindings.|`|euO56ZByaa	ya most mountains require them but some dont even check. if you have one already i'd were it just to be safe but if you really dont want to then just trow it in your pocket and if they tell you to get one you can just put it on.|`|qqt3ULtAaa	I don't think is  law, but many resorts require leashes for insurance purposes. In the lower NY area (Katskill mtns) I haven't seen anyone checking for leashes, I don't know about farther up north though. However some resorts in VT do require people to have leashes.    As someone said before leashes are pretty cheap off the mountain, and they are convenient to carry in your pocket if you don't want to use them. But if worse comes to worse you can steal someone's shoe lace and call it your personalized leash|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	who knows but a leash is a good idea anyway if you have step in bindings it would be a good idea if you fall and the board comes off it could go down by it's self and hit some one and cause injury.|`|QuQioUd7aa	i have acouple friends that all work at different resorts, and its mandatory.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Not positive on the Law, it is probably a law but I'm not 100 percent sure on it.  I Ride at Bristol in New York and they do check for leashes and if you don't have one you don't ride the lifts.    This year alone I've been checked several times by lift supervisors and a few times by Ski Patrol, and just a few days ago I watched a kid get forced to go down and buy a leash because he didn't have one on, and he wasn't allowed to go up the lift    And considering a leash costs maybe 5 bucks, there is no reason people can't wear them

Or he hangs  out at gamestop at midnight game launches for games and jaws with all the other game junkies. This guy is an international sport star, yet here in SA he's just Timmy.

Study Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett|`|iz5zDFxvaa	If you're in high school, you can play power forward/small forward  If you're in college or the NBA, you'll likely play PG but might have to trim about 10-20 lbs|`|UMVWQiYJaa	small forward|`|N3AiQRJFaa	PF i guess but how old are you ?|`|79wmu0Czaa	small foward the sf position is for all around players like you but u probably could do power also|`|EWyo1nmBaa	I agree with Dan. Power forward is the position you should play because based on the description you just gave, you sound like you should stay inside in the paint to rebound and take mid-range shots.
8XOoNpU7aa	Liverpool started the season of great!  They went 3points clear at one point but now they are dropping points  Chelsea have drew there last three games I believe  If They can beat Chelsea I think they have a chance if not there going to have to come up with something spectacular.  Liverpool need to get on form  what was rafa doing putting Lucas on|`|uUitKmJMaa	Yes and they just after making me depressed for the night.

AA11118482	I see where your going with this but I still feel Pau should be the 2nd go to. Pau is much more skilled and a veteran in this league, and Bynum still needs time to grow. But dont worry, Bynums time will come soon.|`|i9FLcvb7aa	Bynum should be the First Option, if your runing the triangle correctly, Kobe second, then Gasol! When Kobe shots more than 20 shots lakers always lose.|`|ST6O0oXsaa	Bynum will be the 2nd go to guy after Gasol and Odom are gone.   For now he needs to do his role in rebounding and blocking shots.|`|j29eHSDqaa	Andrew Bynum is already the 2nd go to.!!!!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9efsJwJxY...    I repeat your words...    "I mean he was calling for the ball and at least made a couple of shots yesterday vs Charlotte".        -----------------------------------|`|287ryVgFaa	Pau will be the 2nd option for the Lake show as long as he is on the team. He is a more polished scorer around the basket. Bynum could eventually make that a 2A and 2B though, but he's not there yet.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes eventually he will most certainly will and if he continues to improve that may happen sooner than later. Had they gone to him more last night they would have won, he had a huge mismatch inside. The problem as i see it is his teamates need to be reminded who they have in the middle, and i think they forget that sometimes.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Who cares.  You ask the most idiotic questions!

I used to play with a lad here in Australia that is even shorter than Cahill and would win headers against lads that were a good 6 inches taller. It's all about timing and confidence. It pisses me right off when he scores against Liverpool but I love the little Samoan guy because he does it time and time again for Australia.|`|8XOoNpU7aa	Tim Cahill is fantastic in the air even at 5ft 10  I suppose he just times the ball right|`|fLpnC8qtaa	I agree with Terry. His reactions are split second and a great asset. He is athletic and great in the air and had confidence in his ability in the box.

r5V3ZNGfaa	Oh, I know why you asked this... You're making sure "The Plan" goes through.    Indeed, the Wings are tight, so Hossa might not be tempted by money from them. He's learned the Wings system and will come back to the Pens to teach it to them, as planned. :b|`|VC5mEULTaa	Its impossible to tell how much since we don't know the numbers for next year, but the site that cnd24fan gave is a great site to look at. They'll be close, but they have very few players to sign.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	They have 15 players under contract for 47 Million and change.|`|lYnkvRASaa	This site will give yopu a ball park idea with $$ and no players signed    http://www.nhlnumbers.com/overview.php?t...|`|gVJJi2Adaa	This year, Detroit have to pay 57.048 millions to his players. Henrik Zetterberg's salary this year is 2.9 millions but he signed a contract that will give him 7.4 millions next year. The UFA of next year of the wings is Marian Hossa, Mikael Samuelsson, Johan Franzen, Darren McCarty, Tomas Kopecky Chris Chelios and Ty Conklin. If all these player don't sign with the team, Detroit will have to pay 47.3 millions but i think they will keep Franzen for 3 millions and they dont have space for Hossa that's for sure. Since i don't know next year salary cap, i can't answer you how much space they got but they're going to pay around 50 millions next year if they don't sign free agent.

rJMZdp04aa	Mine , Again , In no real Order:    - HHH actually puts someone OVER.  - CM Punk Turns Heel.  - CM Punk becomes WWE Champion.  - Christian Returns for the rest of his Career.  - Christian Becomes WHC.  - Charlie Haas Impersonates the ENTIRE Roster.  - Edge gets a Decent title Reign , and isn't a Transitional Champion.  - MVP wins MiTB & gets into the Main Event.  - Mr. Kennedy becomes a Main Eventer.  - Miz & Morrison Disolve , Morrison Becomes Main Eventer on RAW.  - Jamie Noble FINALLY gets his talents Recognized.  - 'Taker/HBK Main Event WM28 in Both's Final WWE Match.  - Samoa Joe & AJ Styles come to WWE    - John Cena , Randy Orton , Edge , & CM Punk Form a Stable Known as "Greatness" and Dominate WWE for a Full Year.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No. I dont think at this point Kane needs a a push. He's claimed in the past he doesnt want the title and enjoys doing good business by putting over younger talent (i.e. Kofi Kingston on Monday)    No. Jericho is already a main eventer. I think the Rumble win should be given to midcarders.    Yes. Jericho is a great champion.    No. I think Cena should be away from the WHT picture completely for a while.    Yes. Matt Hardy deserves a MITB win.    Yes. Finlay is over enough to win the ECW title.    Yes. It would be a dream come true and great storyline if Dreamer finally win the ECW title after years of jobbing.    Yes. I like RVD.    No. I think TNA should stay their own promotion. WWE should never buy them out.    YES! I never liked Jeff Hardy.    Yes. Jeff Hardy..I just cant buy him as a main eventer    Yes. Matt is the better Hardy.    No. Rikiski was overrated, and Too Cool was played out.    No. Rated RKO are better as singles competitors.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I agree with all of those except for the Jeff Hardy ones (they've already happened)  I would LOVE to see Finlay FINALLY win a decent title! And Kane has to get another title before the year is up or he will become too stale.  Um, is Rikishi still alive? I thought I read he'd died?|`|7qeHZe9Yaa	Yup basically those except for the last 6|`|41WXZPnCaa	- Kane getting a huge push and winning a major title   - Chris Jericho winning back the WHC  - Finlay winning the ECW title  - Tommy Dreamer winning the ECW title  - RVD returning for good  -The Rock Return And Kick John Cena's ***|`|A7PkhsDJaa	Kane: Yes  Y2J Rumble: Yes and he should lose weight and wear pants again  Y2J WHC: YES!  Cena: Title Reign, but long  Matt Hardy: NO  Finlay: Yes please!  Dreamer: Yes  RVD: Who wouldn't?  WWE + TNA: Yes  Jeff Hardy 1: No  Jeff Hardy 2: NO!  Matt Hardy: Why do you like him so much? NO!  Too Cool + Rikishi: Just Rikishi  RatedRKO: Yes!!!|`|l6g3moiEaa	Interesting list there, guy. But what I want to see happen in the WWE? Have more moments like when CM Punk won the WHC... only let him keep it instead of losing it in some cheap way. And less predictability, like when Shane came out and "landed" punches on Orton monday night. There was a time when they did some truly shocking things, and I don't mean all the times you saw boobs pop out on Raw episodes. (Although I wouldn't mind the return of a few nip slips, either. :P)|`|EHYBicGkaa	Oh my god! I agree with all of those. All of theme seem legit and cool and could happen. Some heels are finally getting the attention and guys like Jeff, John Cena etc. are not going to be the top guys. But, I would DIE to see RVD back, but right now i just don't want that to happen. RVD has to take care of his wife and shouldn't leave her for wrestling, but when and if she heals, then RVD should totally come back.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	morrison and mvp being main eventers  hhh hbk jbl retire  ecw close down  1 world title  no divas belt  smackdown live weekly  bastista having a career ending injury  kevin nash taking jerry lawlars place on raw as color man
Boc1Buuwaa	Look for Chicago and the New York Jets to be the top 2 choices. Chicago does not have a 3-4 as that is his preferred style of play, but on the other hand, the Jets do play in a 3-4 and DE happens to be the biggest need on this Jets defense, and oh yea, they happen to have a man named Rex Ryan now. Brett Favres choice of coming back will affect this decision though, as cap issues will prevent Peppers from being a Jet if favre comes back|`|SZ7NLb05aa	hopefully the giants.  it all really depends.  if the giants get brian cushing, then we wont have a linebacker problem, but if we dont getta good backer for nxt season,   maybe tuck as a backer, and giants get peppers and umenyiora...  that wuld be amazing..peppers and osi..|`|u7GBP579aa	those guys that said dallas there is no way dallas doesnt need him, i could really see him going to the redskins because the redskins need a defensive end badly if they dont go after him the i think they will try to get haynesworth from the titans. but look for one of those two to be in a redskins jersey next year|`|KZsdVGJzaa	well since it seems as though he was released or traded then i can see going to the jets, possibly the dolphins, chiefs, saints, rams that's all i can think of that need a defensive end|`|Bgpk4npBaa	Dallas bet you any amount of money he'll be there|`|QjO3m7QKaa	da bears|`|OXDFWS17aa	Dallas|`|RrKeyYo0aa	hopefully in san diego|`|2OPVWdY0aa	Mars Bitches!!!!!

v77SnunOaa	Rthym killer|`|YkseyT7zaa	The yin needs the yang - balance|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	kobe ball hogging when taking alot of shots and kobe passer when passing|`|XrCc85kNaa	I think it is more than 25 shots.....buddy..|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Kobe The Ballhog = Lakers Suck    Kobe The Team Player = Lakers Dominate|`|dPmVLo44aa	because no one is involved in the game and he's the only one making points for the team thats way i like vc he shares the ball now and they avg 102.3 a game|`|keUqPWVuaa	He doesn't allow the other KEY players on the team to get into a good rhythm in the game, So when he needs them to take shots and make plays they aren't into the flow of the game because Kobe has been controlling the ball. The fewer shots he takes the better they do IF Kobe acts as a distributor, because his presence on the floor alone helps out everyone else. It draws defenders off his team-mates so they get open looks. If he takes to many shots a defense can also focus on just him and keep him contained.|`|l3eT6IZzaa	because basketball is a TEAM game not a ONE man show... that is why the lakers always lose...|`|VrR9ojRRaa	Because Kobe gets selfish. he can easily be an awesome "team" player but for some reason becomes a hog and then the lakers lose.|`|heytv3Awaa	i think you have it all wrong.kobe shots 30 every time the lakers lose.|`|qVuYGiF2aa	Because he is being a ball hog and that is not cool, and it really all depends on how many he is missing.|`|8u0dwclAaa	lilsweetazn ur stupid. i dont see lakers lose everytime.  last time i check lakers  1 in NBA.  so i think ur wrong.    and to ur question fat boy. if kobe didnt get ejected from the game last night lakers would win that game.|`|cbsAZVNQaa	Because his shot selection is not as good, and the defense keyes in on him more. And the other teammates don't get into the zone. I'll give Kobe credit over the last two years he's really devolped into a team player and has made his whole team better. I really think the only time he takes allot of shots now is when the rest of the team is not being agressive enough.
B5DDAvQtaa	That is doesn't exist. The NFL states you have to be 3 years removed from high school to be eligible to play in the NFL. College can recruit you from high school though.|`|a6EndAPiaa	You can not get drafted into the NFL until you have been out of High School for 3 years.    So there is no NFL recruiting out of high school.|`|4blCVEvOaa	There is none. Colleges recruit High School kids...the NFL recruits College kids.|`|BiNeNcDyaa	Any question search m clarret Ohio State... he knows all about it|`|ZmFFAMUAaa	College players are eligible for the NFL draft after they have completed their eligibility in college. What this means in most cases is that a player needs to complete four years of roster time, plus an optional fifth redshirt year, possibly.    Players can choose to leave college early provided that they have been out of high school for at least three years.     Players have to apply for the draft by Jan. 15, and once they are officially part of the draft they are no longer eligible for college.    There are no exceptions to this rule, thus, you cannot be drafted straight out of high school.

I mean, look at the Dolphins.  It was shocking that they did so well, mostly with their new "Wildcat" play and a better coach.  Arizona probably just needed motivation and they for sure got it.|`|5BffoduJaa	I think they will lose. Its happened in the MLB already for two world series.

ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Wenger is loosing his mangerial credentials. He dismantled a perfectly good team and failed to build on it. Arsenal are too inexperienced, they have no fighters (except RVP), they have rubbish defenders (clichy is shocking), and they have the most injury prone squad in the league. Yep that sounds like a trophyless team to me!|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	I cant wait for Feb 8th....

Denilson has started more games then any other player so what does that tell you... yeah I agree we fall short but those players out and who have never even touched a ball this season aren't just players Rosicky would probably be our star player ahead of cesc if he ever kicks a ball... if he was a donkey he would be in a sanctuary.|`|7Xridrxaaa	dont give up faith marky! Villa will drop points i am sure and we will be in the CL next season. RVP has been our best player this season without a doubt. It all has to do with a lot of things. Expect a photo finish though but i am sure we will make it     GO ARSENAL!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I don't think it's a bad result considering how well Everton have played recently, we are very average at mo and Goodison can be a difficult place to visit, we will still finish 4th, Villa are feeling the pressure, it showed in the game with Portsmouth|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	i am happy , but we should have won i think you need to sell RVP ha ha ha    Well done to Kitty and Wigan|`|4BppP7Mkaa	oh come on it could've been worse.

AA11118482	I agree with you, Lou should be the starter after Andre leaves. And as for the drafting question...A big man who doesnt suffocate Iggys game like Brand does. (ship brands useless *** out)|`|JpvXhgmraa	Not me. I just don't think he's that good to be honest. He's an ok player off the bench, but "Nasty"?    They need to draft a good PG in the draft. If your depending on Lou Williams to lead your team........LOL|`|2cfce389a8428bc2c69c2893c01ca28eaa	I always say that about lou williams too..hes defintitely progress when he came straight out of high school i didnt think he was ready but now he looks like a pretty good..kind of play like iverson (im not saying he is iverson) lol
FxObqmGFaa	No not rlly. Srry =(     You can learn arts like WingChun or taijiquan that help you use your chi within your body and be able to project your energy on impact (greatest example is the one-inch punch).

You can sell the old small gear and get gear that fits for cheap! Otherwise Ebay or even put an add in your local newspaper!

NaYoqWBOaa	probably not. You should practice dribbling with a bigger ball, that would help.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	Nope you are best getting use to the correct shape basketball because there are different physics handling skills that you gain through experience with a SPECIFIC size ball.     I know what you are thinking, it's not like football players (soccer if you are american) who sometimes prefer to run with weights on their feet so they are faster in a real game, however it's not the same when it comes to basketball dribbling.|`|OydBtAhfaa	No because you'll be use to a small ball then|`|qVuYGiF2aa	No, because using a smaller ball will have you used to dribbling a small ball that less then when you try a bigger one it will feel very heavy and will be hard to shoot.
666KRBlnaa	In rugby union you cant hit with your shoulder, rugby league you can definitely hit them with your shoulder and everything you've got. These rugby guys don't hold back in their defense but their body is better conditioned to take the hit.     People do and continue to die in both forms of rugby, law suits are just not as prevalent here as they are in America. A way to minimize injuries and casualties have been to improve the tackling techniques i.e. not tackle with your head but with your shoulders (the impact and collision level is still the same but this avoids paralysis).    As an athlete, I would rate rugby league players as far better than football players. These guys can take a hit just like football, have the same explosive power as football, and also have endurance levels far above that of your average football player. In this regard rugby league players are more akin to boxers. More and more rugby league players have swapped their boots with the gloves. The current WBA Super Middleweight Anthony Mundine was actually a league player, the same as the current Australian Heavyweight John Hopoate, another notable boxer has been the havyweight Solomon Haumono.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Firstly Football and rugby are vastly different even though they share a common origin. You should learn more about the 2 respective games before you assume that they're the same.    Have you ever seen guys play tackle football without gear? I'm sure you probably have. Do you think when guys play football sans gear that they hit as hard or the same as when they're geared up. In case they're is doubt in your mind the answer is no. People have an inate self preservation instinct.     Please tell when was the last time that you saw an English guy who was tougher than an American? (in general) Please name all of the British world boxing champions and Olympic sprinting champions.     To be generous let's assume Brits and 'Yanks' are about equal on the toughness scale. Then we must conclude that football and rugby are not the same in the nature of the hitting. The gear worn by rugby players is about the same as wrestlers (no... not WWE), which is about appropriate and a more appropriate comparison.    You may want to view ESPN's rankings of sport difficulty:  Degree of Difficulty: Sport Rankings   SPORT   Boxing  Ice Hockey  Football  Basketball  Wrestling  Martial Arts  Tennis  Gymnastics  Baseball/Softball  Soccer   Skiing:  Water  Rugby  Lacrosse  Rodeo: Steer Wrestling|`|LVjM9k8yaa	The simple fact that you think rugby and football are the same shows your ignorance so I won't justify the question by answering it.    My question for you, What country do you live in that would be speaking German now if it wasn't for The United States of America?    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	Its just how the sports developed early in the NFL helments weren't required and then after a while they started getting law suites the NFL made wearing helmets manditory|`|Bgpk4npBaa	No we just have brains and we like to protect them    remember the revolutioary war YEA that was us beating the english and that was english losing to us     does that make English weaklings??and americans tough??|`|ImHvd8F0aa	Remember, in American football, the job of the defense is to deliver a blow, stop the ball carrier and put in him the cemetery, not just the hospital.    In rugby, to make a tackle, you wrap arms and pull the ball carrier down. You cannot hit first with the shoulder, head, legs, arms, etc.    Helmets and pads are necessary in American football because of the collisions. Without the helmets and pads, there would be 10 or more fatalities, yes fatalities in every game, let alone practices.    Could you imagine a 6-5, 270 pound man that can run like an Olympic sprinter hit you at full speed. About like being hit by a truck on the road.|`|YQLLxGNWaa	where you are wrong is in saying rugby players get tackled just as hard as football players. nothing could be further from the truth. rugby is a contact sport, football is a collision sport, that's the difference. we used to play a form of rugby as kids called smear the queer, and the hits you took in that game were nothing compared to the hits in football. football players are bigger, stronger, and faster than rugby players. if a professional rugby player step out onto the field in an NFL game, with or without helmets, they'd be eating their dinner out of a straw for the rest of their lives. that is, IF they survived.
8gXkw3MCaa	Go in early before your practice and talk to your coach. If you can play through the pain then tell him you would like to play unless it is a serious injury that won't go away on its own.  If it is to serious  Then tell him you'd like to play but won't be able to this year, and heal your injury and train for next year.|`|YAtN9j9baa	well the logical thing to do would be to stop for this year and rehabilitate your injury.|`|mcnPogTRaa	tell your coach what is going on. You probably are just tired and wore out.
NFiiIQcxaa	Well, honestly, he's most likely looking at jail time.  Courts don't want to see people already on probation committing new offenses.    When a judge grants probation, they are basically saying they trust you enough not to lock you up.  When you are already on probation and then do more crimes, you are saying to the judge that you cannot be trusted.    He should show some remorse and ask his attorney if it is okay to write a letter of apology.  If his attorney says it isn't a good idea, he should write one and take it to court with him to show the judge he is sorry and wants to change.  It might nor work, or it might.|`|AA11088802	wrong section|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Wrong section|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Petty theft and jail time are just not cricket!|`|378GRzrnaa	wrong section|`|ept0rKlmaa	Petty theft?

x7NtYD8Aaa	well you have to start of slow. Run for 10, 15 seconds. Then take a break for about a minute then run for 10-15 seconds again and keep doing that until you only need to take a 10 second break. Then go to 30, then 45, etc, etc. As for push-ups get a 5 pound or 3 pound dumbbell and curl it and get your forearms bigger. Again progressively increase your weight/reps/rest.

xOReEw6Waa	Best I've seen is around $32 for 20, http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.ex...  This was for 100. Brass for Weatherbys is always going to be expensive, just because of market forces.

It works like a charm.  I know that there are a few thousandths of an inch difference here and there, but once resized it has worked like a charm.  338 win mag brass will work too, but you need to ream the necks or you'll run into excessive pressure.  Yep, did that once.  No blown primers or anything, but they were good and flat and wouldn't hold a new primer.

sqfjfR3iaa	If you are defining "Live Events" as Wrestling Shows shown live on Television, then usually the Monday edition of Raw, unless WWE has an overseas tour, in which case, they tape it and then show it on Monday. If I am counting Monday Raws and the Monthly Pay Per Views, I would say between 50-60 Live Shows a year, at least 150-200 House Shows a Year and about 100 Television Tapings.|`|IMQm9JTMaa	well there's about 3 a week for live events, that doesnt include PPV's. there's about 11 or so PPV's, it varries|`|x6HXXXa8aa	alot if your talking about ppv it's about 12 one each month with exeptions

Colorado is great.  Keystone has runs for every level.   If you go, be sure to check out the outpost.   it's on peak two.  It has an awesome atmosphere, very "outback/western"   The plaza at the base is simply amazing.  So much to do there.  Their park is also among Transworld's top 10 parks. (I didn't go in though, I wouldn't be able to handle that lol)  All the lodging is great too.    Breckenridge,CO, the town is so cool, you'd find something to do, definitely.   As for the mountain?   It's kind of overwhelming.   It's huge.  http://breckenridge.snow.com/BreckBase/i...  just look that lol.  again, runs for EVERY level.  The first time I ever went there though, it was rock hard ice.  though I heard that when I left, it all got soft =/ ahah.  It wasn't too crowded when I went (spring break).   The last time I went, the snow was great quality.  There was sooo much to do there.   I wish I could've spent more than one day there.    Utah!  Park City...I went there late in the year, so a lot of it was closed, but as far as I was concerned, what WAS open was great!  It was sooo warm too! people were out in t-shirts, and it smelled like sun-screen everywhere! lol.   Yeah, park city had some really easy runs, but also enough to challenge you.  (I only went as far as blues)  They were really fun.  Plus there was a lotttt of tree skiing (which I didn't really do, but I could see everyone else doing it)  the town of Park city (main street mainly) was sooooo cool.   And it was so much fun to walk around at night.  friendly people around there.  We went to a nice little ice cream shop, then just kinda walked through the streets, looking & shopping.    If you're a skiier, I suggest Alta.   I wouldn't know because I snowboard, and it's a "skier only" resort.   But I've heard that Alta is absolutely amazing.  People love it there.  As long as you can ski powder anyway lol.    Well, hope I helped some.  Good day:)|`|Lngb8ryFaa	whoever TD'ld Bristol is an idiot..east coast skiing, especially new england is great!!!  the last couple years have had record snowfalls too..i just came back from Sugarloaf in maine yesterday--14 inches of fresh powder on top of 18 inches last week...steep chutes, glade riding, plus some groomed fast runs...you can take your overpriced west coast resorts (and overcrowded) and shove em...by the way, its just as sunny here in parts of new england as it is out west...|`|ZOAMYY2waa	Lake Tahoe is the nicest place ive ever been. on and off the mountiain.

CBVlu3Gvaa	Can't see you swing....so best I can give is:   go see a teaching pro.  There are too many variables as to what may be the cause of your problem.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you can try putting a 2x4  1-1/2" from ball in line with target. you'll know when you hit it your out of line. get a coach or instructor to watch you and advise. i don't like instructors but with out seeing you can't do much from here.|`|GW7pWIlXaa	A quick fix would be to tee up on the right side of the tee box and pick a target on the left side of the fairway..this way when you block your shot you will now hit it down the center instead of the right...    To have a more permanent fix to get the ball straight one possibility is working on turning your hands over..more then likely you are blocking it because you are not finishing your hands (crossing them over) and instead of swinging through the ball you are actually pushing through it|`|b58d04638a47803379a69592979765f5aa	first thing. do not get tips from golfers who are not pga certified teachers. and second thing- get a teaching pro and listen to what he has to say, even if he says to start from the very basics such as grip or stance|`|UdLaFPmZaa	make sure that the club is pointing at your target and take the club away SLOW at first.  as long as you have good tempo and rhythm in your swing and you hit the ball with a square clubface, you'll be good to go.  when you take practice swings, see if the face on the club is open, pointing right, or closed, pointing to the left.  work on keeping the face square to the target and you'll be hitting it straight in no time!  good luck!|`|OYWJ12mJaa	So many things to check:    If you are a right handed hitter:    First check set up    Balance (85% balance on balls of feet) with a slight lean forward.    Are your feet and shoulders aligned to the  just slight right of the target. Odds are your shoulders are open to the left.    You may be swinging over the top     You may not be finishing your swing, causing the club to be open at impact.    I would video yourself so you might see and realize your mistakes.      In the end a lesson might not hurt, though there are some bad teachers out there.  Find a friend who plays, and see if they can be truthful and help.    Good luck.|`|847ce03730d174d21108a9796804d088aa	Yes, so many things can cause this problem...but here's one drill that may help.  No promises, but who knows.  Take a tee and place it on the top of your left hand (right hand if you're a south paw).  Get a rubberband or something to secure it on top of the hand and make sure it also covers your wrist.  The idea here is to not break your left wrist on your back swing and follow through.  I had this problem once and this drill actually has helped me a lot.  It'll feel awkward, but try it.  It should stay in the same position as your address.    If this doesn't work just keep researching or get some lessons because so many factors cause a slice; it could be your set up.|`|e71KCQDWaa	i do the same thing.  point the head of the club slightly towards the left, it should help straighten it. :)|`|KtLVS2Vzaa	Hitting straighter is all about your alignment.. i would recommend setting and one of your irons down at your feet pointing at the target. then put the ball down right in the middle of your shoulder width apart feet (presuming an iron shot) then make a proper hand grip and do your natural swing (not recommended for a beginner,always practice a perfect swing) and depending on the club and pitch play around with where you hit it and soon you will be hitting ir perfect each time!

They might go higher if they continue this run of excellent form. Martin O'Neill is a solid manager, Randy Lerner is an owner that stays out of the way, and picking up Emile Heskey was a very smart move.    Kevin K. Even if Arsenal wins the Champions League, Aston Villa still gets a spot. The UCL defending champion has a separate spot beyond what their league gets.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	They are holding it so of course they deserve it. Over the season, which is long, everyone has highs , lows, great form, dips in form and yes maybe even luck.

That's a nightmare come true if they do..  Plus all this is a FLUKE from them :P    AQ: Yeah, doesn't look like the LFC fans are very happy with him at the moment..|`|yulika3laa	Of course they deserve it. Some people say they're lucky? Heh, Arsenal are luckier, a simple example is yesterday's match.     You can't just say another team is lucky if your team is crap.|`|GjpWEu6Raa	KEVIN K     if arsenal do win the champions league cup and finish 5th they would take the 4th spot away from the league standings     and as that could have liverpool, chelsea or even villa in then they would loose the spot and im not sure they would make the europa cup either..!|`|uXXbegw5aa	Yeah :)    AQ: YESSS!!!!!|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Aston villa isnt staying in fourth. They'll actually move up    FQ: Most likely|`|WS8MvKQAaa	I'm happy someone else can make the top 4.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Yes, then Arsenal deserve 3rd. (even though I want them to be first!..but thats not going to happen)    AQ:Why do you guys keep saying this...poor Rafa made some mistakes and now all you people are saying he should get fired. Well why don't you think about what he's done for Liverpool in the past. Anyways Premier League this season is all for Liverpool =p|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	they deserve third place    no not fire rafa he's not that bad|`|4BppP7Mkaa	No. They've been awfully lucky of late.

I thought it was an excellent 0-0 draw, one of the best i've seen, shaded by Celtic in the first half, by us in the second and chances both ends in extra-time.  Granted we survived a few scares, notably right at the start and right at the end, but in-between, more than matched Celtic.    Flood has a good game, but should have scored (!) Kenneth was outstanding even though I thought he would be dropped after a couple of shaky performances, Kovacevic never gave McGeady a sniff and Sandaza was tireless up front.      Celtic looked a better side with Samaras and Robson on.|`|e17700eb327636de22fc84eb20b45234aa	guess i cant cal em fat like a few we see play|`|nKDD0eNuaa	what?|`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	i see whit you've done there chas...|`|mHnNibApaa	the bears dont do excuses !      you look a total **** in that hat by the way !!|`|5Agn35EKaa	Flood tried but it was just bad luck he didn't score that penalty, probably nerves gotthe better of him.

gCGbbIMcaa	I prefer mens, its much more exciting and intense.    I also like womens matches however i tend to like the quarter finals, semis, final etc the later rounds because you get to see the big names square off against each other like serena and dementieva!!|`|6S8KjBLQaa	I like women's more for one reason..it's shorter LOL. Men's I can't really watch an entire match unless it is in straight sets, or if one of the players is James Blake. I am also a fan of a lot more women players than men, which keeps it more interesting. Men's is great though. Women's is just more exciting as of now. Who will take the top? We will find out sooner or later!|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Depends on the players your watching.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Men's tennis, definitely...the women scream too much and make too many double faults, it's unnerving!!!!

My favourie player is Andy Roddick so i guess he would only play in the men's games so that is one reason.  Also, I find it more interesting.|`|ppoD3p2Saa	Idk, i like watchin womens tennis more because its more dramatic, and the matches are shorter. but i still watch alot of mens tennis...|`|pWkWEXRoaa	men's tennis is totally better for me|`|f21733d268f623b7683a507c37ec873caa	women's tennis for sure....especially when their boobs fall out...|`|uqFlaBMkaa	mens because i know most of the players but other than that there is no differents|`|VefSnu0Gaa	men's tennis.-  it's more entertaining and you get to watch the guys ;)|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Probably women's tennis.

I used to love women tennis when steffi graf used to play, sanchez vicario, monika seles.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Men's usually.  However the women's can be interesting because it's not so much about overpowering your opponent as stamina and volleying.  I can't say I mind the skirtage or groaning either.  Just being honest :-).|`|QlrIUIfOaa	I prefer any match that actually looks like a tennis match.  I despise the "heavy hitters," men (Roddick, any of the one-trick 6'10" freaks) or women (Williams sisters) who turn the game into a display of racket technology.  I won't watch any matches where those players are featured.    When some old school tennis, shot making, strategy, position is featured, I'm there.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	men|`|I9cmOie8aa	I like watching both. The men's is more aggressive and fun to watch, and i enjoy watching it more because they play a longer match, but the women's is good to because they play completely different to the men and even if they only play 2-3 sets its still good fun watching it.

AA11425571	Get your reps up to about 8 - 12. Then you should increase the weight. I assume you are female. Females do not have the same hormones and testosterone as men so they are less likely to "bulk up" but will tone, like you want. Good luck, keep with it.

Of course the NL logo is no more internationally inclusive, I think Toronto is just having an identity crisis.|`|qEbzWH0uaa	Wouldn't it be more ironic if they were in the NL?

b3us30ixaa	that is a very good deal stuckey has been hot lately and pierce is always good|`|vuh0i3Axaa	very good trade|`|V54eDkMaaa	dont do it|`|1dKVycToaa	Joe johnson is a good player, he will score and get you assists every game. Thompson is decent since he's been starting, but i don't think he will keep up his good play for long. Pierce has his good games and his bad games. He won't score as much as johnson will, due to the fact that boston has many other scorers. Stuckey is beginning to do good. if i were you, i would accept the trade. Thompson and johnson both will score and get u rebounds, plus johnson will get some assists. Pierce doesn't rebound the ball much and his assists have been going down due to rondo.

4V6V9uN8aa	As much as I lkie & respect the Rock, that would be the worst thing to happen for WWE.  If it was for a show or something like WM or a PPV, maybe I could agree with it, but not really.  FOr the reason why, check out TNA.  They are going through just what would happen if WWE brought back the Rock or Austin or any of the other legends we loved & have left.  The younger guys in the business getting pushed down for legends that had their time in the sun is what crippled & destroyed WCW, & is really what is holding back TNA from growing.  I mean, think about this.  You bring back the Rock, you would have to put him in Main Event status.  So, which show does he go to?  If on Raw, which premiere star do you see as willing ot step out of title contention or give up their place on the roster to make room for someone else?  If you bring him in as a face, where does that put Cena?  If you put him as a face, where do you put Orton or Jericho or JBL?  Putting him on ECW would be like letting Santino Marella main event WM25 against Beth Pheonix, never happen in your kids lifetime!!  Over on Smackdown, do you really see HHH or 'Taker saying "welcome back.  I was planning on making a run at the title, but hey, you're the Rock!! Take my place & make the money that should be going into my pocket, won'tcha, please?"  So, ratings & the fans aside, it would actually not be in the best interest of the fans or the company.  Look at what happened when he faced Hollywood Hogan during the last run of the NWO.  Rock was the face in the match & got booed more than Hogan's heel did.  That was a good thing for WM22, but to the WWE, it was a disaster because of the plans they had for an NWO/Austin & Rock feud.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	the rock is mean he left wwe for his acting career|`|oAjbBLDpaa	It would be good for the company but if Rock does not have interest in doing so right now, then he has no reason to do it. He has a successful career currently where he doesn't have to take any damage and is safe from injuries.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	that would be good but he won't come back|`|ayFd2u7naa	I would love for the Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment to return to the squared circle but It probably will never happen.

He instead used his athletic skill on the gridiron, where he starred for the University of Miami. After a brief professional football career, The Rock decided to give WWE a shot -- a choice that would begin a new era in the entertainment world. In only a few years, The Rock was a multi-time WWE Champion and one of the most celebrated Superstars to ever set foot in the ring, having classic rivalries with "Stone Cold" Steve Austin and Triple H.
9LVpjgoVaa	A 1:22 is the time I had when I was 13 then at 14 I went to 1:17.

AA12034449	Thanks for passing that link along (saved to my drive thank you).    From what I read...physics are physics and fact are facts. Even the guys who write for "Guns and Ammo" etc still concede to some of the findings of this FBI paper and similar studies.    Evan Marshall and Ed Sandow did some pretty good work on wound ballistics and I think footnote 38 alludes to some of their conclusions about "one shot stops". I have been a student of Marshall and really dont think his work disagrees with the crux of the FBI report... but his work tends to support it.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	okey dokey|`|tuULGJS6aa	I heard about this years ago. It's just one of several theories about the subject. Early in the 20th Century a Thompson-Lagarde study used live cattle and human cadavers to study the effects of pistol bullets. It recommended that the US Army adopt the 1911 Colt pistol in .45 ACP to replace the .38 Colt revolver that had a poor record in the Moro Insurrection. General Julian Hatcher developed his own theory that one can use to calculate a theoretical RSP. Jeff Cooper used a shortened form of the Hatcher equation. John "Pondoro" Taylor had a slightly different theory for his KO Values. Homer Powley had another one that uses ballistic coefficients. Then, there's the FBI RCI that you mention. They're all just theories that are hard to test. Detroit Police Sergeant Evan Marshall did a study based upon records of actual shootings of people, but some gun writers tried to discredit his book. I haven't seen any references to it in recent gun magazines. Samples of it are in some old magazines Daddy has. Any theory needs to be tested, but who is going to shoot dozens of humans under laboratory conditions to test these competing theories? Hitler, Stalin or Pol Pot might have, but no civilized men would.|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	Outdated? After I type these words...there already outdated, but does it really mean anything thing by saying it?  That's about the relevance of this article then and now.  Scientific data is all based on probability.  It's a great tool, but in this article very little scientific data was presented to support the actual theory.  Just more questions, looking for more answers.  Allot of good information is mixed throughout, but in the end it just leaves too many questions.  If a man punches you in the side of the face unpronounced, do you fall down trying to avoid the threat? Or did you get knocked down because you were blindsided?  Either way the punch grounded you. I see knock down power the same way.  Psychological factors should be figured into knock down power too, so I disagree with how the term "knock down" was presented in this article.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	The debate over caliber will continue now until forever.

Shoo troll.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	There were players all over MLB on steroids.  If you suspend the Yankees for 'roids, you have to suspend everyone else too.    The only thing the Yankees are guilty of is trying to buy themselves championships.  By doing so, they've not only gutted some teams by taking their best players, but they've also consistently raised the bar when it comes to free agent salaries.  Despite how damaging this has been to MLB, it is well within the rules.  You can hate the Yanks all you want, but you can't punish them for playing within the rules.|`|JnmZZGjzaa	I am pretty sure you cannot suspend a team from the whole season and why the yankees because they are good and you know they will win.|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	Its like saying lets give back all the World Series, trophies back if you had a player that used performing enhancing drugs .    simple get over it move on|`|AA10162950	are u kidding me one freaking player used steroids A-Riod how can u say the whole team Giambi isn't there anymore  if anybody should be suspended it should only be A-Riod and Pettitte.

You win this year's "Incredible Overreaction Award".    Time to get educated. Not a single one of the players who used steroids before baseball had the punishment in place can or should ever be suspended. Now, if a Yankee player does fail a test now, they should and will be punished in the form of suspension.   Perhaps you and the other "drama queens" who over react to everything, disregarding the simple fact that none of these players have tested positive under the current system, wanting such incredible silliness as the permanent banning of anyone who took anything more than a Tylenol kicked out of the game for life, and their records stricken from the books, and any championships won with anyone remotely connected to the issue on the roster be forfeited should instead gather up your pitchforks, light some torches and chase the alleged users through the streets of Manhattan. If you are going to stoop to the mob mentality of other misinformed people, at least do it right.|`|vqdR68KAaa	yes but that doesn't mean they will be|`|JIiiNdTNaa	I do not think they should be suspended for cheating and excessive steroidal use.  I do think they should be suspended for spending as much money as they did this off season on free agents and their new stadium with how the economy is doing.  I know for a fact the Car companies would love to have that money.  It wont matter in the end though cause the Yankees still haven't learned that you CAN NOT buy a championship.  Here is to another year without those Damn Yanks in the playoffs!|`|QNqtthJ0aa	No  Simple as that

And if possible you should try to get good clubs that you plan on using for your matches now, because it is best to have practiced a lot with them.|`|63a024e9868e83b8b39a0cb132b6d0ddaa	craigslist you can find used ones. I don'tk now if your going to find some for 50 but maybe 100.     You can also buy really quality replica golf clubs from gigagolf.com. I bought I complete set of clubs for 250 that compare to 1000 callaways. They quality and customer service was excellent.    Also, if you have trouble with your swing don't waste time with any other training aid than the medicus dual hing best training aid on the market period, the thing really works trust me. It might be pricy 100 bucks on ebay but when it saves you from losing your golf balls because you can hit straight shot it's worth it.

They won't be shiny afterward but your skills will be. get yourself 1 lesson with a pro from your local club/course just to get your swing sorted. then go home and try and do what he told you. it won't come straight away, you'll probably slice for a while but after a little practise with the clubs your going to use in comps you'll feel confident to go to any course.|`|97JyJjFaaa	ebay them|`|KLBX1MIqaa	MEDICUS Dual-Hinged 5-Iron Training Clubs $119.95|`|rjEnFSAIaa	$50 isn't going to get you far, I'm afraid. Here are some ideas to help you find something:    * Ask your coach and teammates for help tracking some down.    * Check your local classifieds (newspapers & Craiglist) for equipment as well as yard/estate sales with "golf" in their descriptions.    * Visit local sporting goods shops - Play It Again Sports is a national chain that may be a good place to poke your head into.    I would avoid eBay. If you don't know much about what you want or how to spot fake clubs, you may well end up getting burned. You may want to check prices online at discount shops like Rock Bottom Golf, but make sure you ask your coach/teammates before buying anything to ensure you get what you need and are getting a deal.    Best of luck!
ypB3QDWNaa	If I'm buying the property, it's a pond...no matter the size.  If I'm selling the property, it's a lake...no matter the size.    Nah, just kidding.  A body of water is generally regarded as a 'pond' if its' surface area is less than 10 acres.  It is a 'lake' if it is larger than 10 acres.  Makes me wonder what they call it if it's exactly 10 acres?    Wikepedia says:  "A lake is a body of water or other liquid of considerable size contained on a body of land. A vast majority of lakes on Earth are fresh water, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. In ecology the environment of a lake is referred to as lacustrine. Large lakes are occasionally referred to as "inland seas" and small seas are occasionally referred to as lakes. Smaller lakes tend to put the word "lake" after the name, as in Green Lake, while larger lakes often invert the word order, as in Lake Ontario, at least in North America.  Most lakes have a natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, but some do not, and lose water solely by evaporation and/or underground seepage. They are termed endorheic lakes (see below).  The term lake is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall."  and (wikipedia),  "In origin, pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure. As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were man-made and utilitarian; as stew ponds, mill ponds and so on. The significance of this feature seems in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants so that in places like the United States, natural pools are often called ponds. Much of this article is written on the basis of this American view.  A pond is characterized as being a small body of water that is shallow enough for sunlight to reach the bottom, permitting the growth of rooted plants at its deepest point.  Pond usually describes small bodies of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.  Though not generally accepted, some regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than 10 acres (40,000 m2).  Regional differences include the use of the word pond in New England, and Maine in particular, for relatively large waterbodies. For example, Great Pond, Maine, is over 10 square miles in area.  In areas which were covered by glaciers in the past, some ponds were created when the glaciers retreated. These ponds are knowns as kettle ponds . Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts is a well known example. Kettle ponds are usually quite deep and clean because they are fed by underground aquifers rather than streams of more substantial means (creeks, rivers, etc.)"|`|ISljRZIRaa	huh?
jXCHQOU3aa	you don't need to do anything since your on a soccer team and ur running all the time you will get better eventually. training aside from soccer isn'tt too good of an idea because of all the workouts you do in soccer you would be overloading your body buy doing your own separate workouts. then you would come to pratice every day more tiered and sore then usual. by going to soccer practice you are already making yourself better and working your way toward improving on it|`|tCnETE4caa	You need to work on... running. Do 2 minutes full speed, and 1 minute rest, and again, for 40 minutes. Everyday. Or play matches everday. Speed comes from muscle/weight ratio, it varies for people, some are better off not going to the gym at the risk of gaining too much weight, others can go to the gym and handle the extra weight.    I think in your case, you need to run, and play as much games as possible, thats going to benefit you the most.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	taking deeper breaths will surely help. they tell us to do that in XC.    although i think you just need to improve your stamina and endurance. search yahoo answers for how to improve stamina and then endurance. very helpful!    make sure you eat healthy, get enough sleep, and keep well hydrated. good luck!

t1OISAadaa	i love cheerleading but im not a huge fan of school cheerleading. but thts just me i think i might do competitive cheerleading which in my opinion is funner. the only thing i didnt like about school cheerleading was it took up my school week and not alot of people pay attention to u hope this helps :)|`|Z6CzYRtMaa	I've been cheering for 5 years and I admire other cheerleaders for the things they do. It can be hard work. Stunts are my favorite part of it I don't really like the actual cheers. Im a base, meaning I lift other girls, and I love it, although most would think it's the worst job. When I stunt, I get this adrenaline rush and It's a lot of fun. If these are things that you might like, try it. I do not fit the cheerleader stereotype at all but I still love it.|`|QSms9Ovwaa	You have to be a babe to be a cheerleader, you have to be sexy, and you have to be flexible|`|yCYw735Aaa	If it's something you're good at, go for it.  Don't listen to those stereotypes.  Cheerleading can be fun, just don't forget who you are and you'll love it.|`|AA11162271	Depends on the school you go to.  If the school is one that completes on ESPN then try out.  If it is a school were the Cheerleaders stand ont he side lines and clap their hand and chant and never do any trick, skip it. Just my two cents.|`|1gbvl0Wuaa	You do have to be a sex bomb to do it right.|`|gHWyLQUfaa	cheerleading is the funnest best sport out there,but it does depend what team,Folsom High,now that's a good team,or Dunbar..  but those teams who can barely even do half or fulls,aren't worth it..    this is a really team,  
6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	The way you pose the question - NO.   There are several scenarios to this shot.  1) Most League rules are 'slop' pool. All the shooter has to do is hit a ball from his group. The ball may fall into any pocket and the shooter continues.  However, there are Leagues where you have to call the pocket. In that case if you miss the called pocket and the ball goes into another pocket, the only thing you lose is your turn at the table. Just because the ball went into the wrong pocket does NOT give your opponent 'ball-in-hand'.    2) Bar Rules: About 99% Bar Rules say that the pocket has to be called. And many say everything (caroms, combos, kisses, etc) have to be called before the shot is legal.  Again, if you call the corner pocket and the ball goes in but on the way there kisses off another ball, you lose your shot. But, because there are NO ball-in-hand in Bar Rules, the incoming player plays the cue ball where it stopped rolling.    In League Rules the only time ball-in-hand comes into play is when a "legal" foul has been made. Making the ball in the wrong pocket is NOT a foul.    By the way, some Leagues have a "safety called" rule. That means that if you tell your opponent that you are going to play a safety shot, you are still allowed to pocket a ball, but you still lose your turn because you called "safe".    Hope this is helpful.  .|`|CckCvJpyaa	Thats not a foul, you only nominate the black ball, the other balls it doesnt matter where you pot it, if you pot the black in a pocket you didnt nominate, then you lose.|`|pluEas6maa	Yeah, because it's considered a foul. When you foul, it is ball in hand for the other player.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	Absolutely not. It is not a foul to pocket your ball in a different pocket than the one you called. Your turn is simply over and the incoming player shoots from the spot the cue ball stopped.|`|zFTSg47waa	Matt's right. See the link for the list of fouls. Not pocketing your ball in the called pocket is not a foul, so it's your opponents turn and the cue ball stays where it is.|`|m8f7rnBEaa	There are zillions of different rules for all these games.  In 8 ball, I never play ball in hand - only ball in the kitchen.  I agree with the other 2 guys, you just lose your turn.  Same rule if you shoot down you opponent's ball, which I will sometimes do if my opponent is really lousy and his balls are in my way.|`|1gPxH90Saa	Only way it would be a foul is if you hit your opponents ball 1st with the cue ball. You can pocket any balls except the 8 or the cue without it being a foul after that point.    If you're playing a game or in a league where you have to call your pocket the only penalty you would have is losing your turn. Your opponent would have to play the cue ball where it lies.    4.11 LEGAL SHOT    (Defined) On all shots (except on the break and when the table is open), the shooter must hit one of his group of balls first and (1) pocket a numbered ball, or (2) cause the cue ball or any numbered ball to contact a rail. Please Note: It is permissible for the shooter to bank the cue ball off a rail before contacting the object ball; however, after contact with the object ball, an object ball must be pocketed, or the cue ball or any numbered ball must contact a rail. Failure to meet these requirements is a foul.    A good site to check out for any BCA rules is below.|`|25kZoHsSaa	If you pocket a "stripe" or "solid" in the wrong pocket your turn is over ...unless you also made the original called shot.  In that case you would continue to shoot.     "Ball in hand" typical only occurs when you foul - making a ball in the wrong pocket is not a foul. If it would have been the 8-ball dropping in the wrong pocket then of course that is loss of game.    Enjoy

It is the most successful team in Spanish football and was voted by FIFA as the most successful club of the 20th century, having won a record thirty-one La Liga titles, seventeen Spanish Cups, a record nine European Cups and two UEFA Cups. Real was a founding member of FIFA and the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.<br>  <br>  Founded in 1902, Real Madrid has since spent all of its history in the top flight of Spanish football. In the 1940s, the club, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt following the Spanish Civil War. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s. In the 1980s, the club had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe (known as La Quinta del Buitre), winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups.<br>  <br>  The club's traditional home colours are all white. Its crest has been changed several times in attempts to modernise or re-brand; the current crest is a modified version of the one first adopted in the 1920. Real's home is the 80,354-person-capacity.Santiago Bernabéu football stadium in downtown Madrid, where it has played since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club since its inception.<br>  <br>  It has a long-standing and fierce rivalry with FC Barcelona, although Atlético Madrid is actually the closest professional football club. The El Clásico between Real Madrid and Barcelona has been played since 1929. Real is the world's richest football club (€366m) in terms of revenue.|`|efGx6z3vaa	a city in spain, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, <br>  In cities Liverpool is nowere near it,<br>  In football arsenal already one them ther

But we know its true anyway :)|`|Pfq2zRejaa	yes we have an cheers for the praise !|`|cz1nh74yaa	No as Chelsea were at home so you'd expect them to get the goal and lets be honest 1-0 isn't a big lead.<br>  <br>  Liverpool did well and respect to them but again it's early days and 1-0 isn't game over by a long way yet.<br>  <br>  Ask this question again in 2 weeks time|`|AA11307432	screw liverpool, real was out of sorts....<br>  yeah the premier league is the best league, we found that out last season with 4 in the quarters, and 3 in the semis and 2 in the final...<br>  this season i hope will be 4 in the semis, then no one can argue...|`|efGx6z3vaa	arsenal 1-0Real madrid, santiago Bernebeu, 2005/06.<br>   Arsenal already did it|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Munich look the busines tonight!!|`|RqkITQUiaa	what are you setting up here?? :-)|`|FJzfzDaZaa	ay did liverpool win i didn't c the game sry|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Wow, I didn't think you would appreciate Liverpool's ultra-organised approach. Thanks!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	We'll see in May|`|D7Dubtt9aa	Yeah I think so we are now consistantly in the later rounds of the cup now the premiership is doing well <br>  <br>  Cheers for the congrats<br>  <br>  <br>  Max the reason we are not all talking about bayern is because this is the section for english football not german|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	HAHAHAH... Liverpool was always top European club...... we can't say the same thing about Man U and Chel$ki.... and especially not Arsenal... hehehehe..... Chel$ki must travel to Torino and Arsenal to Roma!!!!|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Why thank you ;)<br>  <br>  We played hard and got the result we deserved.|`|32a549cf7d2c0a7ee37a0b6d828d4f63aa	definitely i think spain were our biggest rivals and liver beating real has put no doubt in my mind
bABkMrADaa	proves nothing really|`|tzrLDbHWaa	It means he's the #2 career points leader, thats all.  It doesn't mean he's a better scorer than MJ, like you said, but he did score more because he played longer.  Could MJ have played longer and passed him?  Sure, but he didnt.  No one really ever said it proved anything though.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	MJ retired where Malone kept playing. Jordan would have even passed Jabbar if he didn;t retire so many times.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	So Babe Ruth's 714 HR''s mean nothing? Yeah ok, career stats are no big deal.|`|darCfjHuaa	u answered ur question but malone is a PF/C and if u look into history PF/C scores more than SG and play more seasons cause they are good for their height.....BUT only if MJ played more seasons MJ>KM.. OOOOO n KOBE>LEBRON|`|7bx2XQlqaa	It proves that John Stockton was the second greatest point guard of all time (behind Magic).<br>  <br>  It also proves that MJ shouldn't have played baseball|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Stop down playing everyone's accomplishments. It means that he was one of the greatest players to ever play this game and it also means he is a top 3 PF of All Time.|`|wl4XUhLtaa	you answered you own question<br>  <br>  but i think it means that Karl put the ball in the basket more that MJ did<br>  but thats my opinion|`|vuh0i3Axaa	longevity...<br>  <br>  endurance...<br>  <br>  both amazing players though...<br>  <br>  better if you didnt compare them...|`|fAMpj8s2aa	it proves he wasn't dumb enough to think he could play baseball.|`|1Mscji6Saa	it proves that he played longer and scored more. its a pretty obvious answer <br>  kobe=mvp|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	It proves KM played more games<br>  <br>  Michael Jordan > Karl Malone<br>  Michael Jordan >>>>>> Kobe Bryant<br>  Karl Malone >>>>> Kobe Bryant|`|lMDy8W0Raa	It proves Malone played more seasons. It proves you can be the 2nd all time scorer and not win  a title
IRbkrJUWaa	(My answer from another question)<br>  <br>  No. Impossible. With the level of competition and the "diverse" amount of competitive drivers... It will be hard for anyone to accomplish 10 wins over a span of 1 year, let alone do it consecutively... I know Johnson did it.. but thats Jimmie Johnson.. and Chad Knaus.. and they're the best at it.. they're literally gonna be the only ones able to do it.. I believe..<br>  <br>  AND win 201 times..(200?)... a greater feat, that one... Jimmie has, I think, 40? and he's had the most wins the last few years... and 3 championships.. He's not gonna be able to do it.. but, you know what I think... Jimmie CAN win 7 championships... or maybe Jeff.. if he continues what he's got hold of now...|`|bJn83u7Oaa	No, I don't see it happening.  Richard Petty was dominant and would run 50+ races in the 70s.  Every team is a lot more even now than they were then as well, especially with the new car.  Any team would be luck to win even 10 races a season now.<br>  <br>  The way that these new, young drivers come into the scene now, most drivers give will hang it up by the time they are 40-45 anyway, and by they they won't be winning races like they were in their prime.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I don't think anyone will ever break his record. Most of Petty's wins came back when they ran as much as 60 races on the schedule. Now they only run 36.<br>  <br>  There is too much competition for someone to win over ten races a year on a yearly basis. And I don't think any driver could be able to stay on a roll like that. Jeff Gordon went from being the best driver of 2007 (in my opinion) to not winning a race in 2008. The competition is tough. I think Petty's record will last forever.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I doubt it. It took Richard a lot of races to do that.<br>  <br>  He actually started 1,184 races over 34 years.<br>  <br>  I don't think Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson or amy of the young guns would want to be racing when he's 55 or so.|`|55buQ8rBaa	No because his numbers are inflated. one year in the 60's he drove 63 races that year, They counted all kinds of local tracks as wins. David pierson's 105 wins are  more impressive.|`|nlSUGP9haa	heeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllll... nnnoooooooooooooooooooooo|`|WlO4wKNDaa	Kyle Busch will do it.... back in the day they had cheep cars and little Talent Busch is awesome.|`|78viUyfdaa	yes jimmie sohnson.jeff gordan,kyle bucsh or carl edwards might do it.|`|a3d582acb2b30b257fb8d82c57713a25aa	I doubt it.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Look, I hate to contradict history books, but Richard could not have done that without some help from teammates, who understood that their job was to not finish in front of Richard, if they were running near each other..<br>  Buddy Baker ran a record number of one, two finishes with Richard in 67, I believe.. And Pete Hamilton took over when he left..<br>  Who knows how many of those wins were "given" to Richard..<br>  Both Baker, and Hamilton have verified this as fact..<br>  Nobody will ever come close to 200..<br>  BTW 67 was the year that Petty won 27 races out of 42 starts..<br>  Ten races in a row, at one point..|`|wMHw20WPaa	nope won't happen ever!|`|OFFjKX72aa	That's a good thinking question. I personally don't think it will happen because there are too many good drivers in the series. Jeff could pass David Pearson but I don't think he'll pass Petty.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	I do not think it can happen with the scedules and the ages of the drivers, would be someone that was still driving well into their 50s or 60s|`|fB8ujUVNaa	Not in my lifetime, I'm 40.<br>  I would like to think Gordo could do it, but it's way too competitive now.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Much more parity in the sport today..............No way!
Q11YuqKkaa	Over the past few years, there's no team coming even close to matching the Crusaders.<br>  <br>  But based on recent form and current squads: The Sharks, the deadlier team for sure.|`|bGZ8vYuNaa	I recon Crusaders. There just awseome and have a lot of experience|`|2xlCj4utaa	im a bullls fan.but i hope the sharks wil win just to shut the crusaders up|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The Crusaders. Even though they have lost their coach, with all hands on deck they are the best provincial rugby side in world rugby. Closely followed by the Tahs.|`|YsSwe1Laaa	I think you have the fixtures wrong.  'Saders play the Hurricanes (in Christchurch), with the Sharks away to Chiefs in Hamilton.<br>  <br>  Crusaders back to full strength and at home: clear favorites, but Canes can make it close if they are on their game.  My guess is Crusaders by less than 14.<br>  <br>  Chiefs off to their normal dire start.  Heart says Chiefs - they really need full points playing at home - but the Sharks are a fine rugby football outfit.  I reckon Chiefs will come right this week, by less than 10.<br>  <br>  Mark L.
bJn83u7Oaa	i'd vote for him.  he's a duel threat out of the backfield and he's explosive.  i think he's got the numbers even though he's not recognized as much as Peterson or Tomlinson.|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	If things keep going the way they are going for him, then it's possible that he will be in the Hall of Fame someday. He has to stay healthy, though.|`|j6Qa4DbEaa	Agree w/first answerer, he's heading in that direction.  Let's hope this coming season is better for him than last though!|`|op4fEbEVaa	He will be a Hall of Famer|`|RTaimrg7aa	Yes, he'll go.|`|goe3y4FPaa	why not.. unless he gets injured|`|5B6w8mxVaa	yea, and im a Cowboys fan.|`|LbJqU82waa	nope!! not good enough|`|HUtskwSUaa	Westbrook is a great player, good character guy, carried the Eagles on several occasions, probably not the first time he comes up for vote, but eventually I imagine he will be.|`|SeLytr1Uaa	The answer is yes if he does these things<br>  <br>  1. stays healthy<br>  <br>  2. has 3 more monster years<br>  <br>  3. wins a Superbowl<br>  <br>  4.gets an MVP<br>  <br>  <br>  He needs some real accolades before we can call him in|`|q9D1mCJnaa	He has been injured way to often <br>  he would really have to have 2 great years that he didn't miss any time <br>  <br>  than I say yes <br>  and I'm a Giant Fan|`|zcuhcEC1aa	No way hes a hall of famer|`|0TAld46gaa	Marcus Allen had over 12000 yards rushing and 5000 yards receiving.<br>  <br>  Westbrook is a long way from even being considered a hall of famer|`|5xIroQjMaa	I think he's headed that direction, yes. Don't know if I'd vote for him if he retired today, but he's swiftly showing he deserves it.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Please don't forget Roger Craig, who has over 8,000 rushing yards and nearly 5,000 receiving yards... and reinvented the position. Also, keep in mind that Craig is not in the Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  That said, Brian Westbrook is an outstanding player and I would not be surprised if he landed in the Hall. I'd say he will need to have 3 or 4 more good seasons (and maybe 1 or 2 mediocre seasons to pad the stats) to get in.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	In my opinion, he is behind several of the dual purpose backs even in recent history (Faulk, Allen, Craig, LT come to mind).  That said, if he had won a title at this point I think we would be thinking of him in a different light because of the Eagles struggles without him in the lineup.  But if he does not win one, he will have extend his career as one poster said (ie Allen) to get the stats he needs.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	In my opinion I think he is a hall of famer. Hes not ALWAYS a huge impact on the field but when he actually shows up he is great back. Hes not one of the greatest players ever but i'd say he is a HoF player.|`|51bd60494429f94771a79adedd996e77aa	No he shouldn't be.  I like him a lot, but what has he done?
52Ycgnozaa	Well, as a dihard Jeremy Mayfield fan I am very impressed and very proud of him and his team. I have hoped and prayed for him to get a ride and when he bought his own team i was thrilled. I am thrilled that he is having sucess and I know that he will continue to. His conversations with Tony Furr (crew chief) over the radio are very good. I support he and Shana through everything.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Because of the restrictor plates it may be easier to throw a team together for a plate race than at any other track. It was interesting but I think the real test starts on the small and intermediate tracks. Daytona and Talladega is only 4 races out of the year. The other 32 or how ever many it is will be the real test for him.<br>  <br>  And yes the idea of him starting a team up that late in the season is vey interesting.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yeah, he has been doing a pretty good job. It takes a lot of work and skill to be able to do that. It's nice to see him back in the Cup series after not having a ride for most of last year. Hopefully he will have a good year and career as an owner/driver.|`|zYuDstYLaa	I THINK HE RULES!!!!!!!! I totally agree, Storm. It was amazing especially with that crappy lap he laid down last week. Oh well, I hope he makes every race and wins some.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	Yes that was a really good showing for just throwing everything together at the last minute.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Yep i think he will make them all this year .Ok i hope he makes them all!|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Actually he's doing a great job. I'm not a fan of his, but i still wish him the best of luck. That's a fantastic start.|`|uouq4KCvaa	I like Jeremy and so far he's done good, I hope he keeps it up!|`|IrGapExUaa	its impressing that he made the first 2 races. but look at the other teams trying to make the races. I mean come on look at the other teams that tryed to make the races. #51 #37 and many more. the only teams that really have a chance of making ever races are the #36 Tommy Baldwin the #44 Pretty Motor sports and #28 RYR and the #41 the other teams plan suck|`|iqdUyVEUaa	that must be hard to do and I can't wait to see who you all are talking about when I watch this weekend. I enjoed the races that I did watch.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	I am very impressed by him and his team.|`|a4LWildhaa	It''s the old story-if you believe in yourself, through hard work you can succeed. It would be nice if he lands a large sponsor. I'm impressed.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yes I liked jeremy OK.  I am impressed with the team he put together.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Showing that he still has what it takes to race in Cup. I admire him for controlling his own fate...his last few rides for other owners just didn't pan out. It's good to have your fate in your hands. When I drove karts back in the 90's....it was alot more relaxing to race on my own...then to put up with an owner. So it's good to see him doing so well....hopefully it'll continue for him.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	He had help..<br>  NASCAR is quietly helping people put teams together..<br>  Helping with funding, a few other chores like that.. Locate<br>  personnel..|`|vIcOdePzaa	Considering its pretty much a last min. team, I think he is doing a fantastic job. I am not a fan but very impressed.|`|n55igpCUaa	Him and Scott Riggs have done wonderful this year at getting in the races. Finishing them, not so much... but that will come with time.
KUDM3Q4Uaa	Yah 1 Game here and one in Mexico<br>  <a href="http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml;jsessionid=0JIX41T3TGCXACWIAA4SFFIKZAADWIWC?chid=4&schid=651&secid=754&cid=575724" rel="nofollow">http://www.univision.com/content/content...</a>|`|lwg40BzRaa	yeah they are going to play because Temo wants to play one last time at Azteca|`|VjqNPLM3aa	That is sucks|`|4TzNaVnHaa	Hey that's something to look forward too! Will it be broadcast?|`|DO7nz8aRaa	it is true i don't know when they're going to play|`|8zgFyfibaa	^^^^ look at this hater mohammed a phucking usa or mls lover. anyways ...........<br>  <br>  Its not fake they will play 2 games <br>  <br>  One in mexico in estadio azteca and the other game in chicago.  So no its not fake<br>  <br>  Its a agreement both clubs did.
q8dX0MsNaa	l have done this. many people use a closed face underspin reel that is like a push button but has a trigger instead. hanging under the rod, the line is less susceptible to sticking to the rod when wet affecting the cast.<br>  the guides on a fly rod are a bit small for a regular open face spin reel but you CAN do it.<br>  great crappie system.<br>  have fun!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Years ago (35-40), I put an ultra lite reel on a fly rod. It worked great for light lures for bream and bass. Even saw some articles on it way back.|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	NO!-throwing out heavy spinners will in time damage the action of your fly rod, plus the weight of the reel could wear the fly rod reel seat. Also only the first two guides are lined guides, the rest are likely to be snake guides which will not hold a standard monofilament very well.<br>  <br>  I suggest attempting to fly fish for bass, with the fly rod and a fly reel, its very good fun. If you want to spin for bass then buy a spinning rod.<br>  <br>  If your having trouble with casting practice and practice some more its the only way to achieve distance, also lowering your line diameter will help.|`|TE4W3k8Xaa	a 9 ft. fly rod is heavy enough to handle the small reel,and will launch the lure a long way,if you don't use the fly rod for fly fishing,why not utilize it and have fun,that's what fishing is really all about anyways.Just be ready to sacrifice it if the action gets ruined for future fly fishing,once it's gone you won't get it back ever again.And by the way,don't mind the laughing you hear coming from other fisherman who see you using it.|`|69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	Years ago on a backpacking trip my brother brought a 4.5 foot ultralight spinning rod. He got no casting distance at all until he borrowed my 7 foot fly rod and put his spinning reel on it. (Fortunately I had my own 7 foot spinning rod as well, but that was the end of my fly fishing on that trip).<br>  <br>  So yes, it will work for ultralights, and the rod's length will definitely help your casting distance.|`|IEjc4R3Raa	I wouldn't use it for bass, for various reasons. But it can be a great rig for crappie.<br>  <br>  You don't want to overload it, because that can have long-term ill effects on the rod (fly rods are splined differently than conventional rods). But light crapping jigs shouldn't do any harm.
vKmzcZZvaa	Speaking from experience, I'd say you're better off as a sprinter. The Nolte's stamina was always poor due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which is why he now has no less than 45 restraining orders issued against him. <br>  <br>  The Nolte has since invested in a good telescope.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	talking in code isn't cool|`|MGoJ7PPgaa	I'll bring the camera.

FPJSoxYwaa	I've thought about this long and hard since the announcement of the new 2009 cars and I reckon it will be Nakajima who'll be first to lose his front wing by the third coner in Australia.|`|RVq3YK4Baa	hmm, <br>  well im going for Turn one<br>  (if this is on the Grand Prix)<br>  and its likely to be someone in the mid field,<br>  so im going for a Red Bull or Toyota,<br>  soooo<br>  Webber or Glock ;)|`|ybjj5WIhaa	The first name taht comes to mind is ....... Fernando Alonso. Probably because of someone else's fault|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	I'm thinking between Adrian Sutil and Kazuki Nakajima, from about 10th-13th place, in the first corner... if not there then at the second set of corners. Both are prone to chaos but I'd probably go for Sutil, as Nakajima's Williams may be further up the grid this year.|`|yz6G7jfXaa	I think it's gonna be one of the obscure back markers, probably sutil taking someone out with him in the first corner in melbourne.|`|KTxxd700aa	Enie meanie, miney, Piquet Jr, as he's fighting with Heidfeld for 7Th, lap 11 Australian GP|`|MK129BdDaa	GATORADE has stolen the words from my mouth. :)|`|pLoCn8dWaa	I reckon it will be Button... oh no... that's not... erm... Barrichello... oh but... yes... they're not... there...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it will be Vettel. I think he has gotten WAY too cocky. He will try to do a Hamilton 'Banzai Move' at the 3rd and 4th corners and take Webber out with him!<br>  <br>  How I would laugh :)|`|GL3TbtHBaa	Vettel definantly had the worst luck in the first 4 or 5 races. <br>  <br>  My money is on NicoRosberg.|`|aYIEnd0Gaa	first corner and the unlucky webber or button|`|DgLSY0FCaa	Unfortunately, Webber... again.

6e2191f96a837588ddf197c3f002bc49aa	Rangers are going to win it by a good few games left. Celtic just cant play football anymore. They should mybe try there luck at rugby as when they shoot and i say when, they always sky the ball high. No decent players there anymore. Partly due to strachan playing anti football.

Wipe down and lube as needed, and clean behind the ejectors. BUT, do not do this until you have been shown how to do it properly, you can damage the crane easily. When removing the crane and cylinder, hold the cylinder in place and slide the crane out, do not try to remove the cylinder first as this will bend the crane. You will understand this once someone shows you how to do it right. When removing and installing the crane lock screw make sure you use a real gunsmithing screwdriver, not one out of your automotive tool kit. They are made differently and using the wrong one will bugger up the screw. Next, do not overtighten the lock screw when re installing.

4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	It depends on where the ball is pitched.  If it is bowled full you could try getting in line and tucking it off your pads square or finer down to fine leg. If it's shorter pitched go for the pull or hook shot, If it's a good length delivery then leave it.  If you're playing in a  one day match it should be called wide and if it's multi day match you're pretty safe to leafe anything down the leg side.|`|IDBasYahaa	If the ball is pitched short, rock back on to your back foot & ease the play a pull shot, rolling your wrists to keep it down.<br>  <br>  If the ball is pitched up, Weight on the front foot, keep your head & eyes over the line of the ball, move the bat across your front pad, & glance the ball towards fine leg.|`|AA11088802	play on back foot...|`|ImNCSqVUaa	Make sure you take a BIG step back and across into your crease, (so if you were batting on middle stump then your back foot would be on off stump) then drag your front foot back towards leg stump.

Its not the nicest looking shot however if its an area you struggle with then its ideal as its very easy to connect with and will get you runs easily|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Watch graeme smith over and over agian when he tucks it down leg|`|b37h4lhcaa	try a sweep shot???|`|d0f04cd8c72152a546d95b7385460a6faa	The leg glance is one of my favourite shots and scores lots of runs without swinging the bat.<br>  <br>  Get inside the line of the ball, keep the bat absolutely perpendicuar and let the ball stirke it, with the blade angled to steer the ball wide of the keeper and along the ground.<br>  <br>  In most games four runs and thank you very much.|`|AA10576425	I always have that problem. But only when am new at the crease. It is all related to foot work. You should work on moving your feet easily. For me my foot won't move at all for a few overs.

1HwyDyD0aa	The same kind you use for flatwork.  I always start with a French link snaffle, and go from there, as that's one of the mildest.

He won't even start for any NBA team.  <br>  <br>  His game is all about heart and hustle.  He works harder than anybody and in college you can be a star player by doing that but in the NBA you need more.  He's not quick enough to play with any of the SF's in the NBA and he's not big enough to play with any of the PF's or Centers.<br>  <br>  He doesn't suck.  He won't be a good pro though.|`|q2EafutHaa	Nobody thinks he sucks. Every time you turn on ESPN they rave about him. He's an all American player who has scored more pts for NC in history.

I don't fully agree with what people have said, but I know that UNC players don't turn into busts like DUKE players (cough, cough... J.J. Redick).
d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	It would be difficult to do worse than in 2008 (Monaco excluded).<br>  <br>  They have kept the same uninspiring driver pair, which probably will negate any advantage they may gain from Mercedes engines or new rules.<br>  <br>  1. Yes, they will score points. Probably not through being competitive, but through getting to the finish where other cars don't.<br>  <br>  2. Not on a regular basis. There may be an occasional freak result, but without a poor Honda on the grid they may actually find themselves further behind the pack than they were in 2008 for most of next season.<br>  <br>  3. Not unless we have another race like the 1999 European GP, or the 1982 Monaco GP. Rain, retirements and luck will be required.|`|iK9UCuS3aa	1. I think they may score around 10 points for the season.<br>  <br>  2. It's quite possible they might. Yea they have the advantage of running a Mercedes engine but it's not enough to just have an advanced engine setup but it's the job of the crew and the drivers to get the most out of the setup they have and the drivers abilities to control the car.<br>  <br>  3. Not for another few years. With so many other competitors that consistantly get in the top 5 and with Force India not breaking into the top ten as much as they should i see it as very unlikely. The only way they might get a podium is if there is a repeat of Hungary 2006 (Jenson Button claiming his first and so far only race win under remarkable circumstances)|`|yz6G7jfXaa	now that's difficult to say,<br>  from past experience, we can expect a marginal increase in the performance form 2008, and coupled with honda's demise, they may have an even better chance of scoring points, so, it looks like they'll even up picking up a handful of points this season here and there. they may as well qualify in the middle, but surely, podiums are unlikely.<br>  <br>  BUT, this isn't just a an engine deal that force india have signed with mercedes-benz. it's a full fledged partnership with Mclaren, they might as well end up with gearboxes, and chassis that are way better then some of the front running teams!<br>  so, you can be guaranteed of better showing by force india, if McLaren and mercedes get their stuff right.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if what force india will get is a custom version of engine and power train from Mclaren, like the ferrari engines in the back of red bulls, or are they gonna get the same hardware as that in the Mclaren.|`|DOBvWGmGaa	Taking the same engine as a top team does not guarantee results.<br>  Minardi had Ferrari engines for a while, but only recently has Toro Rossa secured an unlikely win.<br>  Renault engined Red Bulls hardly featured last year - then again neither did Renault.<br>  <br>  1) Yes - but at the usual car crippling races that favour durability<br>  2) No - again, it's the package, not just the drive train<br>  3) Unlikely - unless it rains, but then again it's not impossible.<br>  <br>  If your betting agency gives odds for Top8 finishes, a fiver on each Force India car at every race could be a risky well-paying gamble.|`|KTxxd700aa	You already have 4 great answers, so I'll add a bad one to the mix :P<br>  1.Will they score any points this season?<br>  Yes, Fisichella may even get one on merit in the first few races as Fisi is better in the first 3rd of the season, he seems to peter out. Sutil will hope for some torrencial weather, as he is far better in tricky conditions.<br>  2. Will they qualify in the midfield this season?<br>  Again, early in the season, possibly but they will be cold last by season's end, depending if they can get any Mc Merc updates or not.<br>  3.Will they get a podium this season?<br>  Never say never but its not likley, possibly 2 less cars to overtake though!|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	It's very difficult to say right now as we haven't seen Force India show their hand in testing, and can't see whether McLaren and Mercedes have had any say in the aero-specs of the car.<br>  <br>  Based on their effort last year, I would say that they are due for a step up this with a year of Mallya's money to boost their chances, plus the McMerc hook-up. Last year's car was an updated Spyker, which was an updated Midland... and so on... They didn't have the best tools for the job but with a clean slate this year (literally) they could produce a good car, as considering the outdated car, they developed it very well compared to the other teams.<br>  <br>  I think their driver pairing is in need of a shake-up. Sutil can have one more chance for Monaco last year, and Fisi needs to show some of the underdog spirit he had at Jordan and Sauber, otherwise Mercedes will place their boys in there to get the job done better.<br>  <br>  1. Yes, most likely from Fisi. His experience will come in handy when chaos erupts around them at places like Oz or Monaco.<br>  2. It will depend on the circuits more than ever this year. So we shall see.<br>  3. Unlikely, unless we have a Panis 96 moment. But points are the main attainable target.|`|aYIEnd0Gaa	no

Absolutely everything in 2k9 is better. Starting with the graphics for example player models are much more realistic in 2K9 except for Tony Parker in Live 09 which they get absolutely perfect. The arenas look identical to real life in 2k9. The one that you see the most difference is the one for the Celtics. You know how in real life the Celtics arena looks kind of dark brown right? Well in live the color is just like the Lakers. Realistic? certainly not. <br>  <br>  The level of difficulty in live makes you fall sleep. My 7 year old sister  can easily win a game in Live. In 2k9 you actually see a good simulation and the roster updates adds a great feeling to the team chemistry. The only thing in which live is slightly better than 2K9 is that the controls are a little easier but besides that there is absolutely no comparison. Don't buy Live because of the " Living DNA" thing because it doesn't even make that much a difference, besides 2K9 has the exact same thing.<br>  <br>  By the way in 2k9 you also have the 3 point shooting and the dunk contest just like in Live.|`|a8yDDprlaa	I prefer 2k9.Nba 2k9 is much better gameplay.It is more realistic and it is easy to play.Nba 2k9 has has a mode called Nba blacktop.It is a street-ball atmosphere.It includes a 3-point shoot out, A slam dunk contest,pick up games, and a game of 21.It has an association mode,which puts you in control of a team.It makes you the GM, and you play the games, of course.It has a rookie challenge and a situation made.It lets you set the quarter, the score,and the teams, and you could pick up right in the middle of a game.NBA 09, I am not sure, but I think it has skills challenge,but I don't know about dunk contest.It has a franchise mode, that kinda sucks.It has a mode called the life,which is like a story mode.It is kinda dumb.NBA 2k9 is a much more enjoyable game.Oops.You mean NBA live 09!I thought you meant NBA 09. Oh well.I didn't play NBa live|`|Rvy2LdVUaa	Matters what you are looking for.

The whole game play has changed and it's more real life like. In NBA Live 09, you can be a FIBA team, they have this DNA modeling thing where the actually players hot and cold streaks reflect the players scoring abilities, etc. Also, they have All-Star weekend (Dunk contest, 3-point shootout, I don't think they have the Skills challenge or Shooting Stars challenge, I wish they would though) and cool training games where you can focus on passing, defense and offense. I recommend you buy Live 09!

l6g3moiEaa	Like Ricky Steamboat said on Monday: Jericho tends to flop back and forth more than a fish. Personally, I think he's even done a better job as heel than what he's putting forth this go-round. Turning him face again is as simple as having Randy Orton come out (after all this McMahon crap is over, that is) and tell Jericho that he's a legend like all the other old men in the back whose time has come and gone, and that he's gonna kill Jericho's legend status, too. Simple, to the point, and actually doable.|`|fU4b37pnaa	Well, Jericho could turn face again because he will fill the same way other superstars did:<br>  -Stone Cold back in November 2001 after Survivor Series<br>  -Hulk Hogan in March 2002 after his Wrestlemania 18 match versus The Rock.<br>  -The Rock in April 2003 after his match with Goldberg.<br>  -The Undertaker in Summer 2002 shortly before Vengance PPV.<br>  -Triple H in 2006 when Dengeration X was reformed.<br>  -The Big Show after Wrestlemania 24 in 2008.<br>  He cost  JBL, Randy Orton or Edge a match or pinned by either John Cena, CM Punk , Rey Mysterio , Triple H or The Undertaker in the match.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Easily, he's done it before. All it would take is for him to start cutting promos on wrestlers than most fans consider heels. I could see him easily going face in a feud with Orton or JBL (even though he's been in an angle with JBL before.) Jericho is one of the few guys that is just as a good a face as he is a heel. He's so good on the mic that he could easily switch between the two in a single promo if he needed to.|`|T8IFOfHCaa	ya|`|2y2p3ww3aa	Well what i've got in my mind is jericho gets defeated by his opponent at wm and then the legends come to the ring and instead of ganging up on him and beating the crap out of him ...they cut another great promo and teach jericho exactly why they are all 'legends' and why they have so much respect from the fans...then jericho redeems his mistake and becomes face again ...feuds with some other young brat say a heel cm punk or maybe mr kennedy and teaches them the same lessons that he learnt....<br>  <br>  or else he would just get beat up by the legends at wm and continue as a heel...but i personally dont see that going anywhere after mania....but that isn't the question is it... :)|`|Lv89kHKpaa	I would turn him face by having him save a top face from a gang of heels (Legacy or something). He would then beginning apologising and saying he realises what a jerk he was, and hes going to make up for it by being a hero and saving faces from attacks be heels.|`|An10In6daa	It will be a long transition between heel and face for him because,he is one of the top heels today.But this change can be done gradually if he stops insulting the fans and starts cutting some face promos,but it will take a while.|`|wM9D9w8xaa	I dont think the fans would take him as a serious face if he did, the fact that he cant make up his mind weather he wants to be heel or face, hes swapping and changing all the time, so they couldnt really rely on him. :)|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Hes not a Face? I figured he was seeing as he is taking out those old has beens for us all.<br>  <br>  Sorry anyway i think if Jericho is to go face agin it should be like this, After WM25 Jericho feuds with Batista, Batista is mad because Jericho took out Ric Flair at WM25 by beating him senseless so they have some matches, Jericho wins, Batista wins and so on but during one match Batista botches a move and causes Y2J to get a concussion so the next week Jericho wakes up in the hospital and he thinks its still the attitude era. So Jericho comes back to RAW with amnesia thinking that he will see familiar faces like the Rock and Chris Benoit but is surprised to see non of them around now but one face is still familiar Triple H, so Jericho thinks Triple H is the bad guy and attacks him causing an uproar the next week Mr Mcmahon decides that the only way to get Y2J's memory back is to help it along so everyone has to act like they did back in the attitude era, so Triple H goes heel and feuds with the now face Jericho.|`|dtpY4BEraa	i think he has done to much for his character to change again fans wont accept it especially after he keeps abusing the fans and legends like ric flair

ElH6jMEXaa	If he shows up here we're going to be unstoppable.  And the retarded analysts are going to have to do for Marbury what they had to do with Pierce last year, and reverse their opinion.<br>  <br>  Marbury provides a offensive threat at the point and a second player capable of bringing the ball across half-court under pressure - two of the 3 things the Celtics lack.  And they won last year with 3 holes, now they only have one.  <br>  <br>  Cleveland and LA won't be able to press against us like they do when House is in, and they won't be able to sag back and play 5 on 4 defensively like they do with Rondo.  <br>  <br>  Marbury is, at the very least, still near all-star caliber skill-wise, if he is 75% of what he was 2 years ago the Cavs and LA are going to get crushed.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	It would be a miracle.

85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	Check out the Smith and Wesson .22a which goes for aroung $200 around here. It's a semi-auto .22 which has a 5.5" heavy barrel and adjustable target sights. Great gun for the money. Make sure he always wears ear and eye protection when shooting.|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	you can also try one of your local gun shops for used .22 pistols-(sometimes between $100-$150)sometimes they have ones that are scratched up a lil bit and an older model that shoots just fine(i just bought a new pistol and they had an old berreta 9mm there for $99 because it was a big frame gun and kinda scratched up,but worked just fine)-as reid said a revolver is good,but a if your kid learns to break down and use a semi properly  it might teach him/her more about guns and gun safty but that would be up to you ;)|`|MEOjwPCNaa	I think the basic Browning Buck Mark goes for around that price, if you want a semi-auto.

ucot94w3aa	Boots are not specific to a pair of bindings.  They are generally not sold together (unless it is some type of package deal).<br>  <br>  However, bindings come in specific sizes so not all boots will fit all bindings.  Depending upon your boot size, you may need a different size binding.  The best thing to do would be to go buy boots at a regular brick-and-mortar board shop.  Try a few pairs on and find the ones that are most comfortable while still having a nice snug fit (you want to make sure your feet don't move around or you'll end up in pain after a day of riding).  You can generally find boots cheaper online, but it's worth spending a few extra bucks to ensure the boots fit properly.<br>  Once you find a pair that fit well, make sure that the boots fit the bindings.|`|GZCmyzBYaa	you gotta buy the boots separately and sometimes they're more expensive than the board|`|eUxpZDhXaa	As long as you dont have click in bindings, because then you have to buy the specific boot ment for those bindings. SO YES, and Make sure you're buying a snowboard with strap in bindings, and make sure the bindings are the right size too. You dont want to be using a size M binding with size 12 boots. Some boots might be more comforable in bindings of the same brand. Id suggest not cheaping out on the boots. You'll be wearing them for maybe 5 hours at a time, make sure they're good. which is why I dont suggest buying online, even though they are cheaper.<br>  <br>  Now is a good time to buy boots in store anyways because of end of season deals.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|v3Motq8Iaa	It depends on the size of the original owner's boots.  It they had small feet, and you have large feet, the bindings might not be sized properly.|`|CqB5ryTFaa	yea but bring the board with the bindings attached so the bindings can be adjusted for the boots|`|5a3bf2514197ad9aaf59ea9c805d8adbaa	Duct tape and wool socks work much better than boots and bindings.|`|xjoipurpaa	yea

o8ukGep5aa	As above, your legs are crucial to your game.  Doing sprint training is a good way of developing this plus building your sprint fitness, as in your positions you need to be able to pull out blistering pace even at the end of the game.<br>  <br>  The other most important area is your core muscles.  I cannot overemphasise this.  Core fitness and strength is so important to rugby will go such a long way - preventing injuries, giving you more power to make/break tackles, helping you to be stronger in rucks/mauls if you ever find yourself there.<br>  <br>  Perhaps more than any other sport rugby requires all round fitness and strength - so try not to neglect other areas of your body to work on just one part.

jSkHquK5aa	Before a soccer game or practice, you need to warm up. Some coaches like their players to jog slowly and stretch, but soccer is a dynamic game with short bursts of speed. A good soccer warm up should account for this and allow players to prepare for running at various speeds. Check out the following drills for a well-rounded warm up routine.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Set two cones or balls on the field. These can be far apart or close together, depending on how much room you want to run. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Begin your warm up by jogging back and forth between the objects. Run fast enough to elevate your hear rate, but slow enough to let your muscles loosen up. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Perform a high knees drill between the two objects. This is just like jogging, except you thrust your knees high into the air after taking each step. <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Make sure your muscles are warmed up and comfortable, then run a few sprints using the cones or balls as finish lines. These don't have to be full speed sprints to be effective, but aim for at least 75 percent of your maximum effort. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Cool down with a slow jog after completing these three drills. The sprints are especially demanding, so give yourself time to relax before heading onto the field|`|4IHe4rPYaa	toe touches on the ball (helps control and agility) hold the ball up and make her jump and hit it with her head (headers) assorted dribbling drills (duh) penalty kicks (learn how diff kicks make the ball do diff things) dribble then shoot (control and learning to shoot in a realistic situation)...have funnn|`|5KKp9Wbiaa	My dad trains a footy team with 8 year olds and they do a lot of passing training and for some reason a lot on shooting penalties.

rGGymoowaa	Actually you are correct the IOC uses the word Athletics for the sport or  what some people call Track&Field mostly in the USA. .     Sport of Athletics includes 4 events- Track events, Field Events, Road events and Combined events.     Why it's the most popular sport in the Olympics this has to do with the fact it's the most universal of all sports.  By that I mean on every continent from Africa, Asia,North/South America, Europe and Australia can send athletes to compete in the sport of Athletics. Since it doesn't require a massive investment or technical skills of most other Olympic sports a country has a greater chance of winning an Olympic medal no matter how small or poor.     With over 200 member federations all over the world many people around the world have a rooting interest. African countries have won more medals in Athletes then all the other Olympic sports combined.     Finally as mentioned above Athletics has a great heritage  (other then wrestling,boxing and equestrian) as a sport that traces its origins all the way back to the Ancient Olympics. Is usually the sport that can truly have the whole world watching.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It is the basis for the Olympics, there are many other sports, and some sports come and go, but the one that has always been the center piece of the Olympics is athletics, or track and field. It also takes 2 weeks to put on the event, running two sessions each day.|`|iT8CNh6paa	its very interesting, although i like them them all.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Again Athletics is general term. Technically any sport is "athletics".

UHTcpdkVaa	A sword is like any other weapon - it's usefulness is only able to be decided when put into the context of how it would be used.  For over a thousand years, the Roman gladius was the ultimate sword due to the tactics that were used to be the most effective.  These tactics - a phalanx of men working together in armor with overlapping shields - would ruin any person who used a rapier or a katana.    During the time that the rapier was developed, it was used like a pistol would be used today - personal self-defense.  Sure, for one-on-one duels, it is a superior weapon from the heavy battle swords also used in that time.  Against a plate armored opponent(s) it is much less useful.  Certainly, the speed of the blade could be used to strike between armor plates - but the inability to turn aside a full force brow from a zweihander would render it useless in that context.    Yes, the katana is an amazing weapon.  The skill required to produce those blades tends to put them into a mystical light.  Everyone knows that their iron is folded many, many times to turn it into steel - and this seems to mean that it is superior to all other weapons.  But this is not really the case.  European swordsmiths (back when Europe still has swordsmiths) also folded their iron into steel.  The difference is that Japanese swordsmiths still exist, while European swordsmiths are no longer around.    Sure, Europeans still make swords, but not for actual battle use anymore - the lessons of previous generations have been lost to us.    My point being that there can be no "best" sword without the context of how it is to be used.  In one-on-one battle with lightly armored foes - the katana is top notch.  In one-on-one battles with unarmored duelists, the rapier is amazing.  To ignore the other uses of swords and how the design effects the use of that sword in melee and groups dynamics however is a mistake!    Besides, everyone knows that the best sword ever was the sword that the Kurgan used in Highlander :-)|`|7e730f6436a4fbf1ea59232ed326b671aa	I will certainly agree that the Nihonto is the most evolved sword in history, with the most mystique about it. No other culture values it's swords as the Japanese people do. And I might say no one is more vocal about swords than Martial Artists. As far as the 'Best' sword, saying katana is like answering 'best vehicle?' with 'car'.   My first choice would have to be a Masamune blade with a soshu kitae lamination (seven layer geometry with hard, medium and soft steel)  What the heck....if you are going to lust after a blade....Go for the best!|`|59wqRW9Aaa	The Samurai Katana sword.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	The Jedi's lightsabre.    Failing that, I'll go with the Nodachi sword, the long handle and blade made this 2 handed sword very versatile and able to deliver strong blows|`|AA11561103	BeatsMe.Sorry.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	The Katana followed by the Scottish Claymore. Highlander anyone?|`|BBZmuedGaa	*******|`|KUUfGugFaa	katanas are sweet, but a longsword(european) is pretty neat, rapiers not so much. however going back long time along swords, what other weapon has been used everywhere in the world for warfare, AXES!!!, i would rather have a nice battle axe than a sword. however swords are only Superior if used by a superior foe.    Edit: If your rediculusly strong a nodachi would be cool to use, though they are very heavy so you need to be skilled and strong.|`|A9bNKdHlaa	I would say the Katana and of course the one that does not break keeps and edge and always saves your life and is perfectly balanced too.|`|19TupZ8Naa	The Katana.

2C8Kjj78aa	You are probably telling yourself, "Don't drop that elbow!"  The funny thing is that when we talk to ourselves, our brains filter out the negative part of the phrase.  So your perception of your self-talk ends up being, "Drop the elbow."<br>  <br>  So think of it another way.  Tell yourself, "Elbow high."  Phrase your self-talk in a positive way.  Tell yourself, "I have a powerful serve."  Do not say, "I'm going to have a powerful serve," because that keeps the event out in the future rather than having it now.<br>  <br>  This may sound like silly mumbo-jumbo, but affirmations and positive visualization are a huge help in sports.  Think of yourself as successful with this skill -- you have already demonstrated that you know how to do it correctly -- and you WILL be successful.|`|jS4UoChZaa	okay okay!! <br>  <br>  every time that you go back to serve try and think about before you serve!!! you have to really focus on that to make sure that you dont drop it !!|`|1TooRFX2aa	overhand or underhand?<br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect! <br>  if its overhand, practice highfiving a wall with the steps it takes to serve. Then try with a ball facing a wall. it ur doing it right, then you should strike the bal against the wall and it should stay sturdy between ur hand and the wall.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e7br8pIfaa	that probably means that you're not making contact at the peak of you toss. work on tossing the ball about 2 feet above your head and slightly in front of you until you get it consistent. then working on making contact with the ball at the peak of the toss, which will force you to extend your arm and keep your elbow up.|`|h1o2BWbraa	When your hand is up before you toss, you should be able to see the back of your hand instead of the palm of your hand. That way it is harder to drop the elbow that way. It doesn't seem like that big of deal but that one little thing really makes a difference.

8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	You prob are trying to lift the ball up. just let the loft of the iron get the ball airborne, also could be your ball postion, (if its too far forward then your body and hips will slide into the ball, which causes erratic contact, ie chunks and skulls) try these drills and see if this helps. try hitting shots with your feet completely together and the ball in the middle of your stance.  also try hitting a few wedge shots to get a good rhythm and then switch to your long iron and try to think like your htting a wedge (same rhythm)  Think smooth and sweep the iorn through the ball after contact.  also try a lesson from a pro!<br>  PS the ball should be about 1-2 inches inside your front instep|`|sBrummATaa	i had this same problem. what was wrong with me was i was looking to see where the ball was going to early (pretty much raising my head), and that lead to my shoulders raising up, which lead to not staying down on the ball which leads to bad shots. so just keep your head down and stay down on the ball. and like a previous answerer said, your ball could be to far forward in your stance, it needs to be in the middle but im sure you know that. hope this helps|`|GNNh52OMaa	swing faster!|`|HJO3D3v0aa	you might be starting your back swing too early, or your ball is too far up in your stance, or you could just be standing up straight before you swing through which makes you club rise before it gets to the ball.|`|CqToIRJNaa	Honestly, I would not take any advice from this forum.

Nothing is the absolute best standing up in the realm of self-defense because self-defense standing up entails everything including punching, kicking, slapping, biting, scratching, kneeing, elbowing, trapping, clinching, wrestling, throwing, weapons, holds, chokes, escapes, locks, wrenching, dealing with multiple attackers, fight mentality and psychology, reality training, blind training, training under low visibility, training in confined spacing, training on unstable footing, etc.  That would mean the stand up art has to cover every single aspect standing up in order to be deemed truly effective in self-defense. <br>  <br>  Almost every style is flawed in this manner because they only cover a few stand up areas.  The only "styles" that might come close to addressing these critical areas of stand-up self-defense would be something like Jeet Kune Do (not really a style but a training philosophy) or perhaps some sort of law enforcement/military combatives training.  Even so, nothing can ever come close to the real deal.<br>  <br>  Edit Martyncurran:  Talk about the teapot calling the kettle black.  I wouldn't exactly laugh at Judo because Muay Thai has just as many flaws and it's also disrespectful.  Muay Thai is an effective ring sport and combat style but in terms of self-defense it doesn't cover groundfighting, weapons, multiple attackers, grappling/locks/holds.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	No martial art is better than another. They all have their pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Different stand up arts work better for different people.

Does not mean that you are bad or that he is good.<br>  <br>  If I was to be be defeated tomorrow, does that mean that I wasted my life training?  I think not!|`|RqQDKEVHaa	No, it doesn't mean you suck.<br>  <br>  And even if he's telling the truth about never having done grappling before, he may have picked up experience in other areas, such as wrestling.<br>  <br>  True story: My son goes to a couple of schools for BJJ, and helps teach at one. A month or so ago, a kid--Korean--came in. He swore he'd never done grappling or BJJ before. His English wasn't great, but he seemed to understand the question. On the mat, he was quite good, very strong, and tried all sorts of sophisticated moves on my son. Still, the kid swore--absolutely insisted--he'd never done grappling or BJJ before. Still, my son and the other instructor guessed that he had a couple years of experience.<br>  <br>  Turned out...the kid's dad is a 4th Degree Black Belt in Judo. That came out one evening when the dad came to pick his son up. We're guessing that the kid has been exposed to other martial arts, and probably has practiced them for years. Still, strictly speaking, he probably was telling the truth about never having done BJJ or grappling before.<br>  <br>  Look: Don't worry about it. Keep practicing and training.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|gBO908P6aa	A complete noob made you tap?  I'm not really buying that.  We weren't there, you were the one rolling with him so you would know if he's lying to you or not.  Either he truly is an idiot savant who never grappled a day in his life but somehow through some miracle made you tap, or he's just hustling you and hiding his true background.  What does your gut tell you?<br>  <br>  No you don't suck.  Replay the event and try to understand what or why you were tapped.  Learn from it, patch up your weak areas and go at it again.  If you start to doubt yourself, think of the days when Royce Gracie tapped out bigger guys like Severn and Shamrock and Kimo.|`|ab5ee73c4a40583a54daa8bd7423eeefaa	No that doesn't mean you suck. It doesn't neccesarily mean he's better than you either. He may just be naturally skilled in Jui Jitsu. If it bothers you that much keep training. Don't make it a competition so your only goal is to be better than him. Try to be the best you can be. Or try a different way of grappling, the way you were trying before may not work too well on him even if it does on others. Good Luck.|`|1eafc7d2745d873056abda89fd644203aa	It doesn't mean you suck. It means that size matters. If you're 5'6" 125 and he's close to 6' and weighs between 130 and 150, then it might take longer than a year for you to overcome that size difference. If you had fought that same guy a year ago, he would've probably beat you even more easily than he does now. But if you continue training, in a few years you will probably be able to defeat guys who are significantly larger than you.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Some people are just naturals - of course, he has a great leverage and weight advantage on you too.  There is a reason they added weight classes to UFC.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I'd ask how he tapped you out but it doesn't matter too much. A couple things could have happened here that don't necessarily mean you suck at jiu jitsu.<br>  <br>  First off, just because he said he's never grappled before doesn't mean it's the truth. He could have previous experience and just doesn't want to admit it for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  Another possiblity is that you went in expecting a complete novice and so you left yourself a little more exposed than you would against a more experienced grappler. It's a mistake I see from time to time but it doesn't always mean you suck.<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged, use it as a learning experience and work hard to not get caught like that again. Good luck.|`|A4clgOtbaa	i have a natural Instinct for martial arts everyone i met told me that but just because you can not do something do not be disheartened when he comes to kick grab the foot and sweep it then you want to go in get him in what we in judo call tate-shio gatume and strangle him make him tap lol that will beat him no worries m8 good luck and DONT GIVE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|agRx31xOaa	Read a book called "Mastery" by George Leonard.<br>  <br>  Your goal should be to enjoy practicing the martial art... whatever happened was just more information, and more practice.  It really has no value or meaning other than that.  Really, read the book, you'll see what I'm talking about and probably be a lot less hard on yourself.|`|UhPIYoriaa	No, you don't suck.  It just means he got the underhand.  Just learn from your mistakes and walk on.  Oh, like Lycann said, he may have also had previous experience in grappling.  He could be trying to make it look as if he's a natural grappler.|`|NHAKOXyXaa	jiu jitsu is like playing chess, you need to out think your opponent. tip is you need to manipulate his moves by making him think that he knows what your doing but not exactly.|`|goe3y4FPaa	no.. evryone has limitations|`|S21T8AAsaa	Dont beat your self up onto the situation Ive done judo for well over 5 years now and im just starting Jiu Jitsu my first day in the dojo i had a guy who immigrated from russia and he had just about the same experiance in sambo we did a regular drill Take downs from the knees position and he pwned me since Judo is an art about staying standing up and defending againts ground attacks i was useless untill i used my wrestling background then he couldnt defend the half sprawl and the upper body and i kept winning from there on.<br>  <br>  now I also grappled againts a brown belt in my dojo he kept trying to take me down i kept throwing him and getting his back and legs all the time he didnt get me down once. you just ran into some bad luck thats all like stated previously just learn from what you belive you did wrong and have at it again your not gonna get any better if you dont learn from that experiance I tapped from arm bars leg locks Chockes and different arm locks it aint pretty but you learn by trial and error theres no shame in tapping keep your limbs to practice an other day.

4e2eba87c6aa4d888c7be6da88890d78aa	Think defense, defense, defense.  Cover up, move in angles, move your head.<br>  <br>  Also, you left out some important details. Is he accurate or just wild and fast?    If he is wild, step to the side, and when he comes at you fast.  Once you step to the side, you should be in a good angle to counter attack.<br>  <br>  Does he have good balance?  If not, catch him off balance.  A fast off balance person is easy to tip over.<br>  <br>  Finally, use your jab.  I know power punches impresses crowds, but jabs slows down a straight forward fast guy and it is your fastest punch.|`|bO0moNVfaa	Okay in regards to what the moron below me said about how any boxer can tell you how to fight but streetfighting is different. No, it's not. Boxing is an improved form of it, if you're talking about Tyson style(which is what I do), so ignore the common boxer, they only box pro because of an advantage such as long arms. Never attack a kid from behind, it's *****. Wanna know how and why I started boxing?I knocked the **** out of a kid, it was brutal, and my dad recognized my potential in fighting, because I hated every other sport. He got me boxing stuff and I train in my basement..I train hard. Anyway, call him out. Say this exactly: You wanna fight?Come push me so that when I **** up your face, I won't get charged with assault. That's because if you hit first, you will, like I almost got charged. Kid went to the ER.If he does, then you'll win if you go all out. Streetfighting is different because there are no rules, so you can't just jab, and **** like that. If you don't want to call him out, wait till he pisses you off the next time, and then catch him in a room without teachers, and hit him in the face as hard as you can, and put your whole body weight into it. Make sure if you do fight, that it won't be regretted, it's not a joke. I guess I merked that kid, but people in my area say I just fucked him up bad lol. Get motivated, walk up to him in a fighting stance with your hands up, and just demolish his face. And if he's fast he has to get in close. He WILL give you an opportunity to hit him and when he does, take it, as long as its not regrettable. Or you could go semi-***** and bring friends. If you don't feel confident that you could take ANYBODY in your school like I do, then don't fight..|`|kBScgrVMaa	Forget what these guys are saying, go sneaky. <br>  <br>  Attack him from behind, nullify all his attributes, surprise is the the best element.<br>  <br>  Don't stand toe to toe. <br>  <br>  If this guy wants you so bad, and it's getting to you, just destroy him him any old way. <br>  <br>  Only a fool would stand and let someone throw 10 punches to your 4.<br>  <br>  It's always easy for a boxer to say..."do this , do that", but street fighting is different, believe me! <br>  <br>  You know what this guy can do, so....Fore-warned, is fore-armed, Good luck mate!<br>  <br>  *Additional* <br>  The guy who posted above me (spike) sounds like a right muppett, dad saw my skill, blah, blah, I reckon he hit a nerd of a kid and felt like scrap iron mike, lol. Tyson was only good at fighting past it pugs, just like muppett boy spike, spike sounds like a cartoon dog, haha.|`|OURb1rnTaa	speed kills! my personal advice would be to cover up ala winky wright then counter. the dude has to stop his combination at some point. perhaps go to the body more? but yes, back when i was boxing and doing martial arts, i'd much rather fight slow, lumbering dudes. it's easy to get flat out embarassed by quick guys!
9H5wDRrRaa	sorry
jSkHquK5aa	NO. The goalkeeper has to release the ball outside his box. Otherwise he will be booked.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	maybe in AYSO, but in the real game that person would be frounded upon, ridiculed and ejected from the game|`|J6grdba3aa	no. the referee would call it unsportanship and probably give you a red card. that means you would get kicked out of the game.
jSkHquK5aa	CANADA don't have enough good players.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	It has something to do with the way of life up here. There are two factors that i believe are the cause of this, the way of life, and the climate. The winter doesnt allow all season playing unless you play inside but basketball dominates the indoor sports world for the winter. Also, like baseball for New York our thing is hockey (basically the roughest sport out there). I mean im Canadian and my favorite sport is soccer but its just not a sport kids want to play so people growing up falling in love with other sports.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	because they are playing hockey.............|`|Pg9IpSBjaa	Because soccer isn't a big deal here.  Which means there's less funding, no way to attract talented coaches/players, and little support for teams.<br>  <br>  The NHL and the CFL is pretty much it in terms of professional sports.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	they're only good at predominately white sports and predominately cold sports, so they're kind of limited to hockey and winter olympic lameness.|`|q0rjNXbYaa	Because Canadians play hockey, and more North American sports.|`|0Dn3cRn6aa	Lack of funding. Lots of Canadian NT players have come out criticizing the CSA for not giving enough money towards the programs. There's also a lack of talent (although interest is growing). The amount of really experienced and quality coaches are low compared to other countries.<br>  <br>  It would take more funding basically to make Canada not laughable.

Pfq2zRejaa	yes ur rite rafa certainly thinks so wtf does he see in him that we dont ?|`|gE7TmotYaa	Not in this lifetime! Alonso would never have given away that penalty - probably would have been leading 3 - 0 by then if he'd been playing, Lucas isn't a very accurate passer, which is what we needed today, Xabi is one of the best in the game.    I know, I know, if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle, but it sucks to draw games like that and you just want somebody to blame. Yossi had a cracker though.    Do you guys really rate O'Neill? He sounded like a whingey little turd over the whole Barry saga, but I guess they kept him in the end...|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Hell No!  Lucas is crap!|`|MjPd9vyYaa	No, Alonso is amazing. Anyways Lucas is still young and he has alot more years ahead of him. Alonso is more experienced. Its not Rafa's fault...you know sometimes its a shame being a Liverpool fan because of how the other Liverpool fans treat there own team. You guys don't like him then why don't piss off.|`|5YKMYcxWaa	you wont nick o'neil lol  alonso is miles better than lucas. who the fu*k is lucas seriously.|`|Hiasgb75aa	If Lucas was English he wouldn't even be in the squad. But because he is Brazilian...|`|peFtORvUaa	Remember lucas is only 21,i definitely think hes a future star..hes getting better every game he plays and he was just unlucky with the penalty.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Oh please,Lucas even makes the Singapore midfield look world-class.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	Alonso is better than Lucas! =D I think rafa picks lucas is because lucas play for the brazilian team!

6tGYe5roaa	The Indians. For one, the entire city of Cleveland is starving for a championship from any sport. I think they deserve it. Also I have always liked the Indians so I wouldn't mind seeing them win it all.|`|FYBUbRmTaa	I don't want the Cubs to win....I don't really care about them.   Aside from my Chicago White Sox I want to see the Mets win the world series.|`|P1bO87l1aa	excluding the Cardinals I would like to see the Royals because they are from the same state.  Also it would be nice to see the Pirates. Nationals, Orioles, Indians.  Basically anyone but the Yankees, Mets and Red Sox.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Baltimore Orioles|`|AVnbzWytaa	i dont want to see cubs fans win. they were so cocky during the regular season. it was so fitting to see them lose in the first round.    i would like to see royals and pirates fan win a world series.

Winner  Twins (Just so the Marlins don't trade everybody all over again)|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Royals or Pirates.

8733ce56d71db6612cd3474caed2d0eeaa	I agree with you 100%. I used to watch TNA and I got ssssssooooooooo bored of watching TNA. All they do is show drama scene but no action wrestling. And yes! they do have gay old wrestlers. And when I watch it. All they do is show drama but no action scene. So yes I'm with you. TNA does suck.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	GOD I HATE DON FREAKIN  WEST  sorry but he sucks at his job soo bad  adamlle is better|`|3jmLx5wzaa	dude tna is stupid.

I am highly disappointed lately, but hopefully they will come around...    I have seen both live and they both put on a good show.     The reason I LIKED TNA is because they gave younger guys a chance more often than WWE on camera. Unfortunately the nature of the beast is promote the known names, and it stops new people from having a chance.     Ditto on the FIRE RUSSO!!!|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I like TNA. I wish their X division had more tv time cause they can do some pretty amazing things. Things you don't see with the WWE. Maybe it is the Vince Russo curse right now. Who knows if they will ever get rid of him or not. It's nice to have an alternative to WWE on tv though. I'll take Don West and Mike Teney over anyone in the WWE, except for the King and JR.|`|QMveJrziaa	I enjoy TNA way more than WWE right now. Honestly, people really need to give the show a chance.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	no tna is good to watch|`|adPpTL47aa	I love TNA. You need to give it a chance!|`|pmjOiQFvaa	TNA burst on the scene in June 2002 with an attitude that hadnt been seen in professional wrestling. The league was made up of mostly unknown wrestlers with a few veterans such as Roddy Pipper and Curt Henning thrown in.  These wrestlers mesmerized the crowds with wrestling that hearkened back to the underrated independent scene and matches never before seen, such as Ultimate X and Six Sides of Steel, distinguishing themselves a refreshing alternative to anything WWE had to offer.  Fast forward to 2009. TNA has gone away from what made it exciting and dynamic and have become what fans now call WWE Lite. TNA and TNA Impact! were named Worst Promotion Of 2009 and Worst Wrestling TV Show of 2009, respectively.    If TNA want to get back on trak and excite us when they first came under spotlight they must:  1.stop copying wwe  2.stop signing wwe refugees  3. reubuild relation with ROH so stars can appear on both shows  4.advertising advertising advertising, they will get no where without advertising there product  5.  FINALLY my favourite FIRE RUSOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uEfoR5BLaa	No I love TNA as much as Raw and Smack Down!|`|tCWwQfYNaa	Iam to dude|`|45tsKMtjaa	wait... T&A???? hahaha|`|qzW2Z5Fgaa	I am but if they sign Paul London I wont get sick.  In my opinion TNA has lots of drama.I think it should be called TND(Total Nonstop Drama)|`|544e63b63e375b3be4dc26b93b850d36aa	TNA has been this way for several years.  After the first few months on Spike TV in late 2005, TNA has not been the same.  The company started to take the footsteps of WWE by focusing on entertainment more.  The thing is WWE can focus only on entertainment, because the WWE has been an established business for many years and can get away with a throw away ppv or two.  TNA can not get away with a throw away pay per view.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	tna is gay|`|l6g3moiEaa	You can never have too much TNA, man, are you nuts?! I miss all the TNA they used to have on Raw before Janet Jackson and her stupid pasties messed it up for everybody. Oh, wait. Heh. You meant the wrestling company. Um... considering it's the only competition the WWE has, I think they need to pull a WCW soon, and then the quality of companies would skyrocket. TNA vs. WWE, anyone? Monday Night Nipslips? Who's with me?!|`|H7p09fL2aa	well at least give credit to the company  they try really hard  they are better than wwe in some ways  like the knockouts are not models  i'm not saying wwe sucks either but they need to get more women wrestlers like victoria,natalya,beth,etc
kYBlgFQAaa	I already met Muhammad Ali (he was amazingly cool), so I would have to go with Obama.  I've never met, or even seen a US President in person. MJ is great, but there are more important things than basketball.    Relax Alpha.  You wouldn't want to meet Obama because he hasn't accomplished anything yet?  How about being the first black president, or simply president for that matter.  I guess if he revives the economy and creates peace between Israel and Palestine, he can look forward to the pleasure of meeting you.  I'm sure that would be a great incentive for him to get to work.    EDIT:  Your right Alpha.  The color of his skin is of secondary importance.  Maybe we can write a question specifically for you.  You can meet Kobe Bryant, George W Bush or Chuck Liddell, who do you choose?  Better?    He kicked GW's ***  back to Waco and closed Gitmo.

This is just like the Jersey but it is not scratchy or itchy. This item will likely go for less than $20. Your husband will be blown away. I know i would be.

Back bends  stretches  cardio  bodyweight squats (To get use to cocorinhas)  The ginga (Google "Ginga tutorial" to get information on it; It's not a crazy hard move, but rather the base move that all the other moves come from)  Get your singing voice ready. lol    Good luck|`|AA10103814	bottomless|`|GTb4UyCkaa	For Capoeira you need to be able to move well and be flexible.

AA11016927	Every Lake/Pond whether it has shoreline structure or offshore structure WILL have drop-offs and points.     Long flats leading to shelfs and quick drops just offshore can be one of the most productive areas to fish because they receive very little fishing pressure.       Think of a lake/pond in zones of depth and zones of structure.     Example- Shoreline structure and depths of 1-8 FT would be zone  1. First "breaks" in  8-15FT, deepwater weed-edges, long flats leading to deep drops, points leading to a drop or deeper water would be considered zone   2. Deep-water structure in depths of 15-40FT, deep water flats, would be zone   3.     Each zone has it's favored lures.     To answer your Q:    Depends on whether I'm "fun fishing" or "tournament fishing"?     Very few tournaments are won with Topwater lures.     I'd use:    Crankbaits that imitate Shad casting the deepwater edge of any weed-line or first break. I'd target prominent rock/wood structure with jig. Once I got a limit of 14-18" fish I'd go to deeper water targeting larger offshore fish with a Jigging Spoon/Little Georgie/deep Crank.     Bass fishing is all about "edges". Once you know how to break the edges down into "zones" your half-way to finding a pattern.|`|amlmhoUuaa	Ay type of topwater bait would be a good choice. A pop-r or a buzzbait maybe even a jig or a spinner bait.|`|AA11318420	anything that says glup on it that is some bad stuff the big minnows is what i like to use if there is a fish in the lake they will devourer it they don't just hit it i love it best plastic i have ever used blows power bait away|`|RFQTnf3yaa	Try a Crown Seal Lure!!!!

Good luck!|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	I would start off with a Pop-R, Fluke (Pearl White), or Buzz Bait to begin with first thing in the morning...then I might throw a Spinner Bait ( I most always use a Chart-White with willow blades) or a shallow to mid running crank bait in Sexy Shad or Bull Bream...then once the sun gets up good, I would go to a Shaky Head Worm...or C-Rig (or T-Rig) I'm stuck on Shaky Heads at the moment, sorry...but for bigger fish I would try a Black and Blue Jig...

Sometimes the cricket section does resemble a war zone, often its Aussies and Indians hurling a lot of abuse at each other. As for the current status they are both as bad as each other.  EDIT: No apologies necessary, I meant it as a compliment.      Pillage the village, trash the scene  But better not take it out on me  Cause a ghost town is found  Where your city used to be  So out of the darkness and into the light  Sparks fly everywhere in sight  From my double barrel, 12 gauge,  Can't lock me in your cage    You see us coming  And you all together run for cover  We're taking over this town    Here we come reach for your gun  And you better listen well my friend, you see  Its been slow down below,  Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell  Deed is done again, we've won  Ain't talking no tall tales friend  Cause high noon, your doom  Coming for you we're the cowboys from hell|`|wPlfPc0gaa	According to me cricket section users could classified into 4.  1. The Good  2. The Bad   3. The Ugly &  4. An assortment of 2 or 3 of above.    The ugly ones are the troublemakers. They leave no stone unturned in their quest. They send death threats, they post defamatory QnA, etc.  The bad ones support the they of the ugly; they mainly play a supporting role than having a stand alone view. They play along the ugly ones, but they are different from the ugly.  The good users are the ones who discuss cricket here. But sometimes they are inadvertently dragged into the mess. Either they voice their opinion against the ugly and the bad. Or they are criticised for not being ugly/bad. Some good users could be termed as bad, since they have the habit of going to any distance in censuring / criticizing their rivals  with a lopsided view.    The fourth group consist of users who could either be termed as good-bad, good-ugly, bad-ugly or good-bad-ugly. More than 50% users are a mix of good and bad.  Users from all nations falls into different categories.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I actually like Ben's evaluation of this section .Its a combination good, bad and ugly along with some assortments.The ugly guys are trolls and troublemakers.But its more of assortments rather than being categorized as one itself.Like if Bad are supposed to be the ones who support the trouble-makers,IDK whether there is any-one who is only bad, its only an assortment of good and bad or maybe assortment of bad and ugly.For example I'm an assortment of good and bad, I try to answer cricket question but also have my own share of fun in getting involved in some controversies.    People think I doing this to become famous and to get noticed but its nothing more than to get myself a laugh.Some of them take it too seriously and start talking irrelevant things.    All I would say is Life is more than just "Oz" and "MBTM"    The controversies are based on who started what, but its becoming more like a hen and egg situation.I'm reaching a saturation level in all this, nevertheless I would have fun if I feel like but maybe not that much|`|YxSlZsyPaa	OR maybe it doesn't|`|lckvYTdHaa	"its all because of wayne kerr  he threatens people in here about stealing their IP address and then their personal info,  some times i saw him giving death threats to the user MBTM"    Seeing as all the personal info is already on the internet, I would hardly call it "stealing". ashish bhatia, unmesh gupta and ravneet (big nose) mundi have all posted their personal information all over the place for anyone to find.

I too; my family, friends and especially students often ask how I get all this time- almost all of my free time is spent here, sometimes even hard earned time.  There is rivalry, even hatred on the air; many good users have been trying their level best to bring some sanity in to this chaos, having miserably lost out most of the times.  I don't want to enter in to a debate as to who are the worst users: there is an indirect reference to that in my most respected user- Bingalee's post, and therein lies the point: As English is the thinking language for Australians, they are in a position to hit the nail precisely and cruelly with a single hit; for us Indians, English is the second or third language, and we need to make more noise to get across the message: that alone won't prove we are the worse of the users. I think both India and Australia are equally responsible for this mess we find ourselves now, and I believe that if there is a collective effort, these things can be curbed.    As to the user who says some Batia has an unnatural head, I don't blame him much: most of the times he has been responding to posts by Indians, and if you read between the lines, there is some subtle humour and sense in what he says: more than the known users, it is the unknown users who are trying to ignite more and more bush fires.    I don't know from where you got the impression I'd call you a donkey or goat! I don't get the connection or am I missing the point or joke?  Like or hate, you, they & I can't ignore this section: we are emotionally , intellectually, statistically and otherwise too much attached to it.|`|8w9JZlaGaa	"I am a Pakistani by origin and a citizen of the of the world and respect everybodies opinion"    its  ' everybody's '  not  ' everybodies '    anyways , root cause of this sh!t are  1.Wayne Kerr and his racist remarks   2.

240ok6OAaa	You've gotten some good advice here, but I'd suggest you check your premise.    Asking "what kind of handgun should I buy" is no different than asking "what kind of vehicle..." - the answer is "it depends..."    Personally, I agree with the "9mm offers a good balance of power and price" though .45 offers more stopping power with little more recoil and little more expense.    Revolvers are simplest to operate and thus highly recommended.  A .357 revolver allows shooting cheaper/lighter .38 ammo for practice and full-house .357 mag loads for defense.    OTOH many semi-auto handguns can be easily fitted with a .22 kit and thus allow shooting .22 out of the same pistol.    The ultimate answer is "whatever kind of handgun fits you best and will allow/encourage you to shoot as much as possible."  The only real way to answer those questions is to try a bunch of different pistols and see what fits you best.      Look around for a gun-shop with its own range attached.  Be honest with them about your experience and tell them you'd like to try a bunch of different ones.  Hold nearly everything they have - you'll quickly find that some of them "fit" you and some just don't.  Try to narrow it down to a few, then rent them and see how they work for you!    You didn't say whether your "permit" allows you to buy, or conceal and CARRY your handgun.  If you're considering Concealed Carry then there are many (many) more factors you must consider - not the least of which is your ability to carry and conceal it.  Most pistols that are fun to shoot are horrible to carry and vice-versa.  My carry-pieces are frankly unpleasant to shoot, but small enough to carry every day.    The WORST gun is the one that's locked in the safe when you need it.  The BEST gun is the one that's always with you.  Contrary to what the gun-shop commandos will say, a .32 in the hand beats a .45 in the safe EVERY TIME.    There are a number of websites, blogs and forums where folks would be happy to help you - I've listed some of my favorites in the "source" section below!    HTH!!    DD|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Do you have any experience shooting a handgun?  If not, you need a .22 LR revolver to learn the basics of gun safety, good gun handling, and marksmanship.    A .22 LR revolver is the ideal tool for a beginner to learn to become a handgunner.  There is virtually no recoil, there is less muzzle blast, and as a general rule, you can purchase 500 rounds of .22 LR ammo for less than the cost of 50 rounds of most centerfire revolver or pistol cartridges.    I would rrecommendSmith and Wesson Models 17, 617 or 63, or one of the many Taurus Model 94 variants.    After spending some months mastering your .22 LR revolver, you will be better prepared to step up to a full-power fighting cartridge.    Doc|`|8MUj24s6aa	9mm is your best bet then. Good defense and cheaper to shoot compared to the other defensive calibers. A box of 100 is about $20 bucks at Walmart. 10 bucks more for the others give or take.    .22lr is still the best for plinking at it is only about 6-10 bucks for 100. .22 though does not make good defensive rounds.    As for make and model...That will be up to what fits and feels best in your hand. The one that does is the one for you.    Suggested models to look at    http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...  http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...    http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...    http://www.taurususa.com/products/produc...|`|VLXFPMOqaa	a 9mm or a 45 acp preferrably a 9 because there is very cheap bulk ammo out there and despite what some will say practising with your arm isn't as important as having the newest and greatest cartridge but when you practise with your 9 you will be able to place your nine where it counts|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I would get a 9mm. I am in love with CZ's and Glocks. 9mm is cheaper than 45 or 40. I don't care what anyone on here says, a 9mm hollowpoint will have plenty of stopping power.|`|QC2NozBkaa	I don't belive you can beat a .357mag revolver.  I bought myself a Ruger Security Six on my 21st birthday and have never regreated it for a minute.  The .357mag is the premier defense cartridge and still allows you to chamber cheap .38spl cartridges for practice/plinking.  You can small game hunt with the 38's and larger game upto deer with the .357.  If I could only have one handgun this would be my pick.|`|IoyJXzoyaa	You have some good advice here.  Lots of different answers and all have their merit.  I couldn't resist throwing my own 2 cents in though.    1. The 9mm handgun.  Adequate stopping power, high capacity magazines (17+),a large variety that includes a number of viable conceal and carry models, easily the cheapest of the big 3 semi-auto rounds, and a heck of a lot of fun to shoot.  There is little downside to owning one and if semi-auto is your preference. Find the one that fits best in you hand and go with it.    2.  The .357 revolver.  Some say its 2 guns in 1 since it can shoot .38 special as well.  The main advantage is the simpler design and functionality of the revolver make it a reliable choice when the stakes are high and you may not be at your best.  A revolver is a "set it and forget it" type of gun for self defense (semi-autos need to have clips checked frequntly to ensure they still feed properly), and they will bypass missfires with the pull of a trigger.  Crucial when seconds may count in an emergency situation.  They also fire the very powerful .357 mag round that puts all semi-auto rounds to shame.  So powerful they are considered legal hunting ammunition for large game like deer, cougers, and even elk. the .357 mag may be overkill in human conflicts, overpenatrating your target, walls, and anything else including innocnet bystanderds. Thankfully the .38 special comes in a variety of specialized self defense rounds for more urban environments.  The .38 special is also considered  one of the cheapest revolver rounds for plinking/practice.  You can get .357 revolvers in smaller sizes that are suitable for conceal and carry as well but most will lose capacity (usually 5 rounds instead of 6). They are a gun that can fit many niches, hunting, defense, or even just fun to shoot.         3. And finally the .22lr semi-auto or revolver.  I'll probably get a thubs down just for putting it on here, but I have to comment on it since it was mentioned earlier.  The .22 is not by any standard a defensive weapon, but what a hell of a gun to shoot.  I personally have a browning buckmark .22 semi-auto, and I love  that thing.  It shoots as accurate as any pistol on the market (at least in my hands) and I can plink all day for pennies compared to the other choices. I personally take it with me hiking in couger country as my primary form of defense, and while its not likely to stop a cat that size the noise will proabbly scare it and everything else within 100yards away from me.  In my home if no other choice was available a .22 is a better deteriant than nothing.  Make no mistake, a few .22 rounds will bleed out and kill just about anyone, though not always as quickly as needed against a determined attacker.  If your choice is truely for defense first then go with something bigger, but if you just want a fun gun that you can shoot all day   for what's probably sitting in your wallet right now, its a fun gun to own.      -Greg|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Well, good defense and cheap plinking usually means going something 9mm. Best thing I can suggest is going to a shooting range that rents guns and see which one doesn't feel too big and is comfortable for you to shoot.
FyAGwtA1aa	You'll lose those pounds during lacrosse or before the season preparing for it. And yeah you CAN get enough endurance to perform decent because my friends do it all the time and they are big bulky football players. Lacrosse a game about heart and mental fortitude. You gotta get it in your head that you can do it and you just gotta work your butt off beforehand. You are lucky, lacrosse has already started for me but I was fine because I worked my butt off the last month before conditioning doing stadiums. Stadiums are good for ya with calves and muscles and junk and they can test ya on how much heart ya got in ya cuz after about 40 of them... you're spent. And just straight up running around your track or around teh neighborhood will be good for yah.    It's just about everyday dedication and all that. Last year was my first year playing and I thought I wasn't going to make it but my friends pushed me and I got through alright. Stick skills is what helps win the game though so run with your stick in hand. Your non-dominant hand.|`|teSCVfRoaa	If you play defense you only have to cover half the field, less running, get yourself a long stick!|`|t4UrqK4Raa	^ That is completely wrong.

ZHWo2du2aa	ok....   i can help you here, alot!!!  iv owned a few 600s, and have had two gsx-r 750s - i currently have a k6 750.        first and foremost - have you owned a bike before??  if you are new to riding, getting a 750 gixxer is asking for trouble.  even a 600 could catch you out if you are not careful.  im not saying this just to preach about safety, but trust me on this - if you buy a big capacity sports bike for your first, you will NOT feel confident on it and hence will not enjoy it or get the most out of it.  i would seriously recommend you getting something like a suzuki sv650 or kawasaki er6 for your first bike for a year, then when you;re confident, step up to a sports 600, then after a year or two on that, a 750 / litre bike.  BUT, if you are experienced (which no offence i dont think u are or you would know the difference between these two types of bike in terms of performance!) or you just dont care and want to know the difference between the two, then here you go.....    they both have the same size chassis i.e. they are the same size bike, unlike the 1000cc bikes (fireblade, gsxr1000, r1 etc) which are bigger.   the modern 600s rev to about 17 - 18000 rpm, and the 750 will rev to about 14500rpm.  On a 600 you really have to ring their necks to release full power, and low down grunt is fairly limited (at least to someone experienced... but dont get me wrong, if you're a new rider, pinning a cbr600 even at 4 / 5000 revs will scare the hell outta you and make you feel like you're flying!! lol) - but they are slightly lighter than a 750, so handling is fantastic.  But because of their "revvy" characteristics, if you come out of a turn in the wrong gear, say a gear too high, and you want power, you must drop down - and on road, if you are a fast rider, it can become tiring.   On say a litre bike, the low down grunt is phenomenal.....  and a 750 mixes the "best of both worlds" of these two classes.   It has great low down grunt, but then an impressive top end scream as well.... plus it is the size of a 600 (although slightly heavier) so the handling is better than a litre sportsbike, and you can "chuck it around" alot easier.     To me - the GSX-R 750 is my favourite bike to ride of all time.  However, i also have a Triumph Daytona 675 - and that is a triple cylinder bike which pulls just as hard as a gixxer 750 low down, but with the greatest sound and feel to it you could ever imagine.  Take a look at them too if you;re serious about getting a fast bike.  They are unique, and like i get when i ride a ducati, it makes me feel special!! :-)    So in answer to your question, yes - there is a big difference.  Certainly a big enough difference to effect your decision on which one to buy if you're a new rider.  Without wanting to sound patronising - and you can give all the excuse about how good a car driver you are for example, but bikes are different.  Be sensible. A 750 is too much for a newbie to biking. Start on a slower 600 or a 650 twin, just for a year : you;ll still love it - and then when it comes to getting your serious sportsbike, you'll know what to do with it and it wont scare you. Plus, you've more chance of reching a second year in biking doing it this way - if you know what i mean! ;-)    Hope i was of help.......|`|LDVEzHsvaa	On the RACE track, a lot.    There is not 750 class any more, so you mean WSS vs WSB.     Big difference.    Or was this what you wanted :    For street bike advice, you would be better asking this question in the street bike section.    This is only for Racing Bikes.

IudQftm4aa	Thats awesome that you want to race. If you are looking to race quads i would look at getting yourself a 450r. The 400ex is a nice bike but to get it race ready would cost a pretty penney.

But for me, I would choose Dave Ortiz. Until last season, he was always pounding the ball everywhere around the stadium. I believe he is over a nagging injury.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	i would get Prince Fielder.. he didnt play as good last year because he wasnt used to being  2 on the team to Ryan Braun.. this year he will be moer comfortable playing... get Prince.. trust me|`|V54eDkMaaa	chase utley is the best choice|`|BASZjJKbaa	Despite the injuries, your best option seems like Chase Utley.      He plays 2nd base and there are no other 2nd baseman coming close to his output if he is healthy.     The other players are really good as well (Prince Fielder, David Ortiz) but the dropoff in talent doesn't even compare.     If you missed out on Prince Fielder and ended up with Mark Teixera at firstbase, would you be that upset?  If you missed out on Ortiz and ended up with Josh hamilton or another power hitter as you utility guy, you would still have quite the team.     However if you miss out on Chase Utley and end up with Dan Uggla or one of the lesser 2nd baseman out there, your team is considerably weaker in my opinion|`|CFqSS0E8aa	utley hes the best player at a no so deep position.  also lackeys the best u could get for a pitcher?|`|zNBsriFaaa	i would have to go with prince. he is the youngest one and that highers his value since its a keeper league. utley is not a lock to play on opening day, so that norrows it down to prince and ortiz. ortiz is coming off of surgery and is slowing down i would defintley go with prince fielder

4kdlE54Paa	My all time favorite half time show is the SB following 9/11 that had U2 perform a tribute to the victims of 9/11.  Springsteen is a good performer even if you kinda like his music.  Prince last year was OK.  I see what you mean though.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|uwx7etCXaa	I've never really cared for halftime shows.  During the Janet incident, I was playing football with my son out on the street.  Well, if anyone cares, the animal channel is  having the Kitty Bowl and half time is the dogs show, so it will be cool...I'll be watching that during halftime!|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	MORE people will watch & enjoy this one as well as the one last year than anything that has rap music|`|PSMsDalLaa	Boring.    But halftime is for beer runs anyway. SO who cares?|`|bIbyAkHPaa	You are on crack! They are much better now! Now we have real Rock & Roll legends instead of hip-hop junk!

If you do, be afraid because you're about to face your deepest fear... Boogeyman is coming to getcha! From out of the shadows, Boogeyman once lurked on SmackDown but now spooks ECW. A face of mindless evil, it is said that Boogeyman feasts on fear and is fueled by the paranoia of others. Relishing the opportunity to recite deeply unsettling rhymes and riddles, Boogeyman celebrates the delicious destruction of his next victim. He also treats live worms as tasty treats and never is without them.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	whats more wrong eating worms for vinnie mac's cash?  or  joining the vinnie mac kiss my *** club?|`|rJMZdp04aa	NO - It is STILL Marty Wright.

So then my new favorite pitcher would be Shaun Marcum.|`|TCehI17kaa	I would say Joba Chamberlain for me.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	My favorite player has already retired.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	My current favorite player is Mariano Rivera and if he retired I'm with Scooter on Joba.|`|PMSSoTqNaa	why would it change???|`|ak5A435maa	Jose Reyes|`|AA10349169	First I would Say "WTF!

Just hope JJ sticks around after the 2009 season comes to an end. Gallardo's our Ace as of now and he's only 22 (crossing my fingers). I have a soft spot for Prince too-so tough to pick.|`|2aRzNvn1aa	If Tim Lincecum retired today(witch the  odds are 1 to 100) my favorite would be......well maybe Ryan Howard except he took iillegal drugs or drinks. tahs my story..|`|9cPirDjPaa	if chipper jones retired today     as much as i hate the yankees Mark texieira would be my favorite, he one of the best if not the best first baseman in the MLB, 2 time gold glover and a switch hitting beast just like chipper|`|4iQSHyScaa	Well, I don't think David Wright, Jose Reyes, or Johan Santana are retiring anytime soon, but if they did, my favorite would be Mike Pelfrey. He's a star on the rise, with a great fastball and sinker. During last season, you could see him gaining confidence as he won more and more games. It also helps that he is 6 foot 7 and is pretty intimidating on the mound.|`|FfWeTACKaa	I shriek at the thought of Tim Lincecum retiring today. If he did retire for whatever reason i would have to go with Madison Bumgarner. He would have to be the new Lincecum.|`|c6q3EERdaa	If Albert Pujols retired today, my new favorite player would be Dan Haren because he is a great young pitcher.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Mine would probably be Jason Bay or Big Papi.

But really, I see a cyclist as serious about what they are doing when they enter a "group ride" or race.  (Group rides are like races, but there is no timer.  Although there is still more than enough competition to go around in the front group!)
bGWcSAGCaa	KHS, Jamis, Specialized, Giant...    My advice...skip the hardtail.  If you're riding road, bike paths, crushed stone, and smooth dirt, you don't need a suspension fork.  You won't benefit from it.  Less costly hardtails like the Trek 3900 don't offer a lockout feature on the fork; thus, the suspension bobs along as it robs you of energy that would otherwise move you forward...not up and down.  Besides, it's more weight to haul around, and there are additional maintenance issues with suspension forks.    Other options...    Trek FX series  Specialized Sirrus  Jamis Coda  Giant FCR  KHS Urban series  KHS Flite 250  Masi Caffe Racer series    Good luck with your purchase.|`|AA11603594	Look for cool bikes [ Giant, Iron Horse, Haro, GT,etc.) at www.ebay.com ( Category-CYCLING- Mountain Bikes ).

UaSFuT59aa	This is a tough question. It's kinda vague, but I think you can only judge champions, because when do regular season teams from the past get a lot of accolades?     I'm gonna say an underrated team is the 1994 Houston Rockets. I'll exclude the 1995 team because they added Clyde Drexler. But this team wiped the floor with Karl Malone's Jazz and Drexler's Blazers, beat Barkley's Suns in 7 and beat a very tough Knicks team in 7. They did it with no other stars besides Olajuwon. They had great role players in Otis Thorpe, Vernon Maxwell, Kenny Smith, a young Robert Horry and a rookie Sam Cassell. They were less talented than the previously mentioned teams, but had great defensive chemistry and sucked the offense into the paint where Hakeem blocked everything and him and Thorpe grabbed every rebound. Plus, they ended up repeating, one of the few teams to do so, but are hardly mentioned in the breath of the great teams, even the Bad Boy Pistons who repeated 5-6 years earlier.     Overrated is tough too. I have to say the 2006 Miami Heat. Of all the teams that have won the title as far back as I can remember, there's never been a less balanced and less threatening team. This title occurred because it was a brutally down year in the NBA. The Spurs inexcusably lost to the Mavs and the Mavs choked in the Finals. I call this team overrated because we're forced to call players like Antoine Walker and Jason Williams champions. DWade put them on his back and took a title in a year where the formerly elite teams were a bit off.      Edit: Did anyone else read the poster's question, where it said ALL-TIME?|`|AA11763656	over : houston rockets  under : charlotte bobcats    my raptors have to be the most dissapointing so far.|`|V54eDkMaaa	overrated: suns  underrated: Utah Jazz|`|fa3CBc6Taa	overated: I think the San Antonio Spurs are overrated because all they do is flop and make easy bank shots and play dirty which equals easy playoff make.    Underated: I think the Indiana Pacers are pretty underrated. Their record is n't very good it's like 17-28 or something but they have Danny Granger who is fourth in scoring in the NBA, 28 points per game.

Even Dennis Rodman said they wouldn't have come close to winning 70 games had they played in the 80's.       Underrated - the 1971 Bucks      The great Oscar Robertson teamed up with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to win his first championship. They had, at the time, the 2nd best record in history (66-16).

AA10304847	As a niner fan, i'm picking the team with the highest probability of winning.  The Steelmen from Pittsburgh are a great team, but the Cards O will be spreading them out. The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|1a0dd1f150b75398f59e352ab2df9279aa	steelers  all the way    im a bears and steelers fan|`|PSMsDalLaa	Nope.

Girls that have absolutely no idea about the NFL and housewives who definetly have no idea about the NFL are all out wearing Ward jerseys.  Its sickning.   They are not the best fans in the NFL. If you lived here you could see what im talking about.  Fans know the game, know the history of the game etc.  Just becaues you show up to a game an wave a towel around doesnt make you a fan of the Steelers in my opinion.  Warner is total class for sure.  Go Cardinals.|`|AA11108627	No.  As a non-Steeler fan, I am not rooting for anybody.    When a team I root for plays in the Super Bowl, it's way too much pressure.  I never enjoy the game that way.  It's nice just to watch the game dispassionately, eat pizza and watch the two teams slug it out.    But if you like "rags to riches" stories, then why not root for the Steelers?  They were an NFL team for 42 years...42!!!... before they finally won their first championship for owner Art Rooney, who by all accounts was a class act.      The Steelers have had more riches lately, but they have paid their dues.  Try to forgive the fans if they seem "obnoxious" to you...they are very passionate about their team.      Sure, Kurt Warner & the Cards winning the SB would make a great story, but there are several other teams (who shall remain unnamed) I would detest being crowned World Champs far more than the Steelers.    Best wishes to both Kurt & Ben....May the better team win!!|`|MxHIdyVAaa	absolutely.  i'm a colts fan, so not only do i want the Steelers to lose, i'd love to see the Edge get a ring.|`|5YaTch7oaa	yessir|`|Bgpk4npBaa	yup|`|LVjM9k8yaa	I'm not a fan of either team and I'm honestly not rooting for either team. I do know which one is a better team. The Steelers win by 2 touchdowns.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|dXblgZEzaa	No, why would I root for the Cardinals.|`|KS2v0T4Kaa	I like the Patriots and I'm cheering for steelers cause I hate the cardinals.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	browns fan an def rooting for cardinals.  because there the underdogs an i cnt stand steelers

Wjp0niEhaa	Sorry, buddy, to make that HUGE improvement, you're gonna need some world class coaching and an iron will.  It would be more realistic to shoot for an 18:30 5K by next year.  Getting to the 15-15:30 takes a lot of natural talent, which your current times do not show.  Still, I hope you can  prove me wrong.  Good luck with that... But then it doesn't hurt to shoot for the stars.  Just don't be so terribly disappointed with where you end up.|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	I hate to break it to you, but that might not be possible in one year.  If you are truly serious about trying, you need to ramp up your mileage by 10% each week, do cross training exercises at least three times a week to improve aerobic fitness, and pretty much dedicate your life to fitness.      Take care - Coach Tief|`|c9RY4BCfaa	Hm... you can work up to it in a year but you might have already have reached your potential. Sometimes it just takes talent.|`|MfxHpLVWaa	No offense, but dont count on it. I run the same 5K time as you do right now and there is no way in hell I would ever be able to run a 15:30 5k, and I have good eating habbits and train extremely hard.
U5l7LZ3kaa	If you are in a winter sport like basketball, you'll be in good shape for track.  If not start doing some aerobic exercise at least 4 times a week with each workout at least 20 minutes or longer.  Make sure two of your workouts are running workouts.  For more ideas check the link!    Take care - Coach Tief|`|EEowYuNQaa	I would say it depends on if you are a distance runner or a sprinter. But I would run at fast speeds. and run distances. stretching is probably the most important though. leg weights are good depending on how old you are... Im 13 and I do all of these.|`|zFwjZy53aa	stretch and run daily|`|YYtxrDRAaa	work out and eat right|`|umMWnxAjaa	start training gradually  and make sure you stretch  drink less and soon enough no soda. it's bad for runners and it makes you cramp up.   drink a lot of water. make sure you stay hydrated  good luck!|`|gaowIGItaa	start running daily AT LEAST a month before tryouts start to avoid major pain. I do track and know how painful it will be even will preparation! You'll feel much better if you do some dynamic warming up exercises before you go for a longer run, get your muscles warm, stretch, then run. That will help from getting pulled muscles. Drink LOTS of water during the day and after running.   If you have somewhere to do it, do some things other than running like 2 times a week to change it up a bit and strengthen other parts of your body. It makes you a better runner. (even a few basic circuits of squats, crunches, push-ups, etc will help)|`|P4okVeiraa	run|`|jesjtp87aa	Run??|`|cFXCXCfWaa	My sister ran for track and I want to too. I guess just exersize and run some laps around your block. Oh, and drink a LOT of water:)|`|mR8W8MBuaa	Make sure you stretch before you go to tryouts, and make sure you get a good breakfast with eggs, more engergy, and if you are throwing if you grunt it is a proven fact that it improves your power by more that 5% because of your adreneline rush.

a6EndAPiaa	Because TV coverage of the game starts at 6:00 and the pre game festivities take 28 minutes?|`|YkseyT7zaa	shhhh, its got to do with that 2012 thing, but don't panic|`|kHF4JdN0aa	they always do this for all sports events, not sure why|`|2wpPrmibaa	because that is a good time to play an doesn't has a reason|`|rNUyV1EYaa	If it doesn't start by 6:29; I'll lose interest and change the channel. The NFL better be careful.|`|ZWkX43zMaa	Just because it can.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	probably|`|acibYHATaa	It never starts when they say ,so its no big deal.|`|0i4sNq2waa	And now your Local on the 8s.|`|aMz996KDaa	bcuz they can|`|c6KumyiEaa	It's because a sudden gust of wind has been predicted from 6:29 to 6:42, and they don't want it to interfere with the kick off.  Seriously.|`|gYFtQyyQaa	There probably isn't a real reason. It can be for advertising purposes.|`|eZQ45iDzaa	It has to do with the tv channel it is on.  somewhere during the day on sunday there must be a show that is going to end 2 minutes early or something.  But it doesn't really madder because we know it won't start on time anyway!! LOL|`|u7GBP579aa	it starts at that time because they introduce the teams starting at 6 then they have the national anthem song and then commercial, then the game start. if that makes sense, but that is the reason why|`|jesjtp87aa	Probably advertising....|`|WWkryzszaa	they want to get started b4 7;00  :P|`|Qe5k0iLLaa	i don't know  commercials|`|apxKzwyzaa	It is always around that time.    It will probably kick off at 6:30 anyway maybe it just gives them a 2 minute window to get it off|`|9bbcwnRpaa	advertising and also it is a prime time for eastern and western states|`|Rg9ogq5Eaa	It's on the East coast.  Lots of parties and coverage.  Think of Hawaii's time.

mTXHW3lzaa	I have never heard of body hair cramping up the muscles. Cramps are usually caused by either air deficiency or dehydration. Check your breathing and ensure your adequately hydrated. Important rule, Clear in Clear out.
jnmuzyA7aa	No No NO definitely no Chantill is a good football school. they have torrian pace undecided, andrew crawford- monmouth and doug boyle- boston college. But torrian pace is the highest recruited out of all of them because he has the most potential. the other to will just be ok linemen in college
q2TOb6unaa	Just call up K2's warranty line, be as nice as possible and kindly ask them to send you a new strap. If it just randomly fell off while snowboarding it shouldn't be a problem. If you forgot to lock the strap then it will be your problem, not theirs.    K2 is a good company and should just mail one your way. Here's the contact:    http://www.k2snowboarding.com/support/wa...    Fill out the form and they should either call you or email you back with what's gonna happen.    **If you aren't under warranty you will have to fill out a form and they will contact you with shipping costs and such. http://www.k2snowboarding.com/support/pa...

Otherwise its all just theories and techniques that you can watch and learn how to make the movements, but still be apart from the actually learning to apply it.
d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	You are really too tall for the CRF150R, KX100 or any 85, and please do not get a 450 as someone else mentioned...good lord!! If you want a performance bike get any 250F, doesn't matter what brand as long as it's one of the big 5. If you just want to do casual trail riding the CRF230F all the way.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Kawasaki Ninja 250|`|IudQftm4aa	Depending on what type of riding you are going to do, if your going to ride track/racing you are going to want to start with a, crf150r, or a kx100 or a yz 85 big wheel. These are more for kids at the 10- 15 age.    Just dirt riding on some trails, maybe the crff230, or ttr series from yamaha. Your best bet is to go into a dealership and sit on the different brands and feel which one is comfortable.|`|nsNfSFCCaa	any four stroke 250 to 450 of course it all depends on  the weight 450s will weigh upwards of 255 some can be as hevy as 300 and 250s will weigh 200 and down. i can ride any bike but some bikes i would never get up off the ground.|`|jsn4gBpPaa	if your riding motorcross a 250 four stroke will do u fine but if you are going to trail ride it around buy a registered bike maybe a klx 250 or crf 250x or something like that|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	a crf150r or a crf250r depending on how strong you are. i race with both of these bike and they are wonderful. i neve have any problems with them. dont listen to the other dudes telling you to get a 450 they dont know what they are talking about... i hhave been riding since i was 6 and now i am 25 and race in all the ama supercross look me up transworld mx  39 good luck 2 you hope to see you ripping on the track 1 of these days.|`|kJLx0Sm1aa	a kawasaki ninja isnt a dirt bike but i would start out on a 250 yamaha or a kawasaki|`|SJUMSjdxaa	a niga it is a good bike|`|WFxVuM1Laa	depends on how old you are and how much you weigh. Riding a slower less powerful bike doesn't always save you pain it can cause it. Make sure you get a bike that fits you and you are comfortable riding it. they have lots of sizes and motors to choose from. I started with a 250 two-stroke and im 31 and have rode before. if your young and light start with a yamaha ttr-125. its a small bike and is great for learning on if you have a little experience try a 125 two-stroke. start small and work your way up.|`|6wDDSKmSaa	start with like a TT-R 90. They are good and durable and good for your size and age.|`|uWY5maD1aa	I would look at the a good a good brand. The only brand better would be the a great a great brand. But for just starting out stick with the a good a good.
