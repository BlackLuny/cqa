This morning when school started [around 7:30] I felt like I had a piece of hair on my right thumb,so I just kind of brushed at it. Later in the day I noticed its numb. You know like that feeling when you sit on your foot for too long? Kind of like that. Im in 8th grade, I don't write a lot in school. Also Im right handed. I didn't hit it and I have no type of scratch or cut on it. Nothing is cutting off my circulation. It has gotten worse over the day. It starts at the knuckle part and goes all the way up, but its only on the top half, the bottom is fine. What could be wrong?

It was purely the number "7787" written in bright red letters with a tinge of blood red at the bottom left hand corner on a stark white background.      An additional note was the 8 was slightly lower than the 3 7's and from the bottom left hand corner the 8 began to run like dripping red paint...slowly.      eventually a panting spider with sharp legs appeared that moved from right to left across the top slowly, carefully avoiding the numbers, the spider was black and yellow...looked like a real spider, but made panting noises, no web.      also, after the first couple months i had this dream there were chime sounds very non-harmoniously in the background.      help please.

20090130153337AAGB7mF	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Isnt this awesome for us smokers?	Cigarettes, according to China’s tobacco authorities, are an excellent way to prevent ulcers. They also reduce the risk of Parkinson’s disease, relieve schizophrenia, boost your brain cells, speed up your thinking, improve your reactions and increase your working efficiency.      Pay no attention to those lung cancer warnings - they’re nonsense. You’re more likely to get cancer from cooking smoke! Those are the words of wisdom from China’s state-owned tobacco monopoly, the world’s most successful cigarette-marketing agency. With annual sales of 1.8 trillion cigarettes, the Chinese are responsible for nearly 1/3 of all cigarettes smoked on the whole planet.      The official website of the tobacco monopoly claims cigarettes are a kind of miracle drug: solving your health problems, helping your lifestyle, strengthening the equality of women, and even eliminating loneliness and depression. “Smoking removes your troubles and worries,” says a 37-year-old female magazine editor, quoted approvingly on the website. “Holding a cigarette is like having a walking stick in your hand, giving you support. “Quitting smoking would bring you misery, shortening your life.” Such statements are widely believed in China.      2/3 of Chinese men are smokers, and surveys show that approx. 90% believe their habit has little effect on their health, or is good for them. Even in China’s medical community, 60% of male doctors are smokers. No wonder Western tobacco companies are drooling over the Chinese market of 360 million smokers.      This week, a group of Canadian experts went to China in an effort to convince Chinese smokers of more realistic effects of smoking. They distributed anti-smoking posters, visited cancer patients, showed the graphic warnings on Canadian cigarette packs, and lectured on how the anti-smoking campaign has reduced Canada’s lung-cancer rate. They face a struggle in China, a country where the tobacco industry provides 60 million jobs and 10% of national tax revenue.      “In China today, the economy comes first and everything else is secondary, including health care,” Dr. Jean Couture, a Quebec surgeon, said. “You wonder if anyone in the government is conscious of how great the smoking problem is. There’s no public education program. The Chinese anti-smoking association is very weak and has almost no money. Within 20 years, China could have the majority of all smoking deaths in the world.” Couture leads anti-smoking campaigns in 4 Chinese provinces, and has been involved with China’s smoking problem since 1990.      As Canadians distributed posters at a hospital, they saw a number of people smoking in the hospital. A hospital shop was openly selling cigarettes. While smoking rates have fallen sharply in Canada in the past two decades, the rate in China is still rising. The number of Chinese smokers is growing by 3 million a year, despite an estimated 1.3 million tobacco-related deaths annually.      Chinese cigarettes are cheap — as little as 30 cents a pack — and the health warnings are hidden in small print on the sides of the packages. Though cigarette advertising is technically illegal, tobacco companies are allowed to promote their corporate names. Children can easily buy cigarettes at Chinese shops, despite an official ban on sales to those under 18. Money, money, money.

I've told my aunt once or twice about it, she thinks it's because of "teen drama" and the "puberty" thing. Any-who, I lie to my aunt. But I lie about pain. I tell my aunt I need to take some pain pills for headaches, backaches, and neck aches, even though I don't need it [most the time]. I'm not really sure why I do this, but I do. I take pills behind her back. Also when I do this, I take to much of the pills [even though I know how much your supposed to take]. Like if I take Asprin and the bottle says to take 2, I take 3-5. I do this alot. It started about a week ago, even though I've been depressed since.............August. I think the reason why I'm doing this because I need something to get out my feelings. Because I stopped cutting myself about 2 weeks ago. So I think I'm doing this because I need something else to get my feelings out. And 'yes' I do have a consular. I'm seeing her next week. I want to move my seasons to every week instead of every two weeks. I'm just asking "Do you thing it's bad that I'm doing this"?

20090130161809AAXQMnI	Health;Diet & Fitness	TheDailyPlate.Com Questions. It won't let me use the forum, plus another question about calorie tracking?	1st question - When I try to use the forum it tells me to log in, and I do, and then it takes me to my plate, so I click forum and then it takes me back to the log in page, and it keeps doing that no matter how many times I've tried.    2nd question - You know the place on your plate (near the bottom) where it says Recent Consumption Totals: (Then it says This Month)    On mine it says I've eaten 37,449. But have I gained weight? I don't think it autimatically deletes the calories your body burns by itself (by breathing and whatnot) does it?     And what are net cals? Should I end up with 0 at the end of the day?    THANKS    Feel free to add me on there!
20090130161242AAII8uq	Health;Diet & Fitness	If I've counted calories, and it added up that 37,449 cals a month, does that mean I've gained weight? PLZHELP?	I've been using TheDailyPlate.com. If you don't know what that is, it's a website where you can track your foods and it keeps track of all the calories, and fat, and carbs and stuff like that.       It says I've eaten 37, 449 calories this month. But the body burns calories automatically, right? So I haven't gained weight, it just added up everything I've eaten and didn't delete the cals that my body burned on it's own.      What do you think?

What is the strict set of guidelines and laws that both psychologists and psychiatrists must adhere to, and where can I find them online? Is there a code of ethics, and if so, it is mandatory, or just highly suggested? Do laws exist on a federal level, or do they differ by state? And if the laws are so binding, how come cruel treatments such as reparative/conversion therapy exist (which minors can be forced into against their will)?    Please, I need answers.  Thanks!

20090130160147AAso0eu	Health;Mental Health	Can you help me? Make sense of this?	It's regarding a guy I thought I liked hanging out with.   We are mutual friends with benefits.   We met last weekend.       It seems we just annoy each other now.    It all started with the fact that he always on me kissing me , squeezing me - holding my head - I feel smothered. All he wants to do is kiss me 24/7 and it is driving me crazy.   All he wants to do is hug me a million times over in bed that is driving me crazy. He is constantly on me - it's driving me crazy and stressing me out to no end.      I really need to breath and get space - I mean this is not normal. It's F & CK%IN nuts if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I love affection - but this is insane. I have to push him away and say can I get my space please!!       Then he pissed got off at me when I burp or make my funny faces while talking or listening to him- i'm just a funny giggle girl who loves to laugh and be goofy no matter what - life is short.       I hate when he kisses me and his nose is running on me. ewwww Gross.       The last straw ( and I don't get this one) was when I was driving him to work as he don't have a car. I said "can you please phone this mechanic shop for directions for me? - I'm driving right now and want to stay safe". He refused to make the call saying the didn't care too.    I siad: "Come on, I"m giving you a ride to work - all you have to do is get directions for me on a cell phone".    He refused. So He got out of my car a block early per his request.      He fuc&*kin drives me nuts.      What should I do?    Any opinions?       P.s. I disoverd today the sex sucks. It's not worth taking my pants off as it only lasts a few minutes. how selfish he is. I don't even get off - but he does. It's not worth the risk of pregnancy and or my time -  I told him my thoughts on his performance.       Thanks,   Jen

My symptoms are :      -Extreme pain in the location of left ovary      -Pain in lower back      -Yesterday I had slight spotting (brown blood .. only slight)      -Nerve pain down my left leg and my left arm         I'm sitting here awake so scared. When i look up my symptoms they all point towards ovarian cancer. I'm 22 years old.      I know a girl I went to school with who got ovarian cancer which is making me more anxious. Do i have the symptoms of it?      Any advice helpful      Has anyone who has had ovulation pain felt like this?      I went to the gyn last tuesday. When he pressed certain places in my lower back it really hurt. He said he had to do investigations to find out what was wrong. This scared me. He got the nurse to take autoimmune blood work and other blood work. I don't know why and told me to come back for a scan.      I only got these pains in the past 6/7 mths surely if i got ovulation pain I would of had it since I got my periods. The pain does seem to happen mid month which was when the slight spotting was. However the back pain can last for a couple of weeks. I'm scared there is something wrong with me. Would the blood tests pick anything serious up.      Please help me. I suffer from an anxiety disorder and this doesn't help at all (and no I am not imagining these pains)

Heres what happens: My finger tips get really tender, and start to flake at first..then they start peeling and where they have peeled its all red (this is currently where they're at right now actually)....then they start to get really hard on the ends and continue to peel...this goes on for about 1-2 months. Then it goes away for about a month, sometimes only a couple weeks, and right when I think my fingers are healing, it comes back again. My mom said that this used to happen to her too, she asked her doctor but he didn't know what it was.....any ideas?       Also, it started on only my four fingers on my left hand (hasn't gotten to the thumb), but now its spread to my thumb on my right hand..and every time when it goes away, the next time it returns it seems to be even worse.      Btw, I'm 16 (17 in two months), if that helps any.      Thanks in advance for the input, I really appreciate it!

I went to the doctors and got tested for chlamidia and ghonoreah, (results came back negative) when being asked questions by the doctor about if i had ever had gay sex, or used syringes i said i hadnt cause i never have. He said I was highly unlikely to have AIDS or Hep A/B/C. However, I am the sort of person that worries, and I know that some people get flu like symptoms 2-4 weeks after first contracting it. Since about 3 days after to now, I've had a mucusy throat at some point nearly everyday. So I'm just wondering, am i being paranoid? Or could this be a symptom.

20090130183422AACQ71S	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	During cancer treatment, is it normal to be so mean?	My father was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (ext) in Dec 2008. After his 1st treatment, he was also given radiation treatment to the brain. He is now coming up on his 3rd round of chemo and has 3 more to go. I understand and have read about the stages of emotion - guilt, anger, sadness... but the only emotion that he has been showing is complete meanness. His whole demeanor and personality is different. He has  become very selfish and demanding things at that moment, having no patience at all. If he doesn't get what he wants he basically throws a fit like a 5 year old, sometime in public. Something that my father would never do! He doesn't listen or follow simple rules during chemo like - no large crowds, stay well rested, take it easy, no driving (because he had radiation to the brain), wash hands excessively.... all the little extra things that need to be done during chemo treatments. He is being very stubborn and is basically doing what he wants even though he knows its not a wise decision. All of these things have been advised by his doctor and his family. We are with him 24-7 because we do not trust that he won't drive off or fall. He is also having a real hard time differentiating dream and reality. He won't even sleep when he's clearly tired. It's the weirdest thing!!! We just want to know if anyone out there can relate to this situation. Is this this how he is just dealing with his illness, or not dealing with it? Is this anger and attitude from his medication? Is this normal?

Today I went to the doctor to get my blood test results and was a little shocked by my cholesterol levels.   My total cholesterol was 222, my LDL was 160, and my HDL was 52, and my triglycerides were 48. I'm supposed to go back in 3 months to get rechecked with some diet adjustments- My boyfriend and I recently moved in together (he is from a Hispanic family, and his mom loves cooking so most of our meals do contain red meat, or are fried, and very FATTY) Or we eat out.   As i don't gain weight haha i just assumed i wouldn't/didn't have a problem.    I was wondering what types of food are good to eat? My doctor went over a few with me, or foods that i should cut out! haha but could someone else give me some advice as to what I could eat! I am not a picky eater- i do prefer vegetarian or white meat foods (chicken if I am totally craving meat)...   Also what types of foods contain saturated fats? Those are the bad ones right? AND can my good cholesterol ever be TOO high? THANKS IN ADVANCE!!! I appreciate this!

20090130191922AAXVucU	Health;Diet & Fitness	... Eating disorders?	I've always have had major body image issues. My eating habits are not normal. I'm fourteen years old. Last year I used to look at pro-anorexia websites and would eat very little. I even purged a couple times and exercised excessively. I got down to 105 lbs and then gained it back over the summer. I never eat at school, but when I get home I eat junk food. My mom used to make me a lunch but I'd throw it out at school. People would ask me why I never ate and I said I was too lazy to make a lunch. I feel like I'm better than everyone else who eats at school. I don't know why. I eat snacks and candies our teacher occasionally give us, but I never eat lunch. My best friend at school is very thin and tall. She always talks about being fat and wanting to go anorexic even though she always eats and doesn't know much about eating disorders. She has poor self-esstem, which rubs off on me sometimes. I'm actually overconfident with everything else, but my body. Now I eat whenever and snack all the time even though I feel bad about it. Except at school. I want to lose more weight. A girl at school said something last week about me "getting bigger." That bothered me. I've never talked about this with anyone and I don't even know what the point of this "question" was. I just want to know if you think there's something wrong with me?

So I purchased this one, as it seems like more safer and provides a long term benefit.      What are your thoughts?

I'm originally from South Florida and I've been in and out of dental offices for the majority of my life.  My oral state and condition is average to above average.  In the past, I took the time to have all metal fillings removed and replaced with bonding.  In October of 2008, I visited a new and very modern dental office for the first time in almost 4 years.  To my surprise, the technology in dentistry has improved immensely but after a thorough and competent check up, I came up with three new and minor to moderate cavities that if left untreated, I would need a root canal procedure performed in all three.      Never fully knowing what a root canal procedure entails, I went on to do my own due diligence online.  After several articles, YouTube videos and pro and con arguments, I decided that root canals are not for me if in fact I still need them.  I'm also not too fond of the recommended "extraction" that most Holistic/Biological practitioners suggest.  I know for a fact that the ADA and dental community is still in heavy debate and disagreeance with issues regarding Fluoride, root canals etc..  Can anyone recommend an open minded and level headed Holistic/Biological dentist in the suggested area?  Please include your experience and personal thoughts.  I'm just tired of dentists coming off as used car salesmen.

Well, i do a lot of computer work, been going to the eyedoc getting different contacts over the past month, i feel a sharp pain in my eye at times, but lately theres this hurrendous sharp, almost like someones shocking, the top of my head.  When its not shocking me every 4 or 5 seconds, the pain in that one spot on the top of my head is still there.  As i am typing this, they are zaps of pain in one spot, if i raise my eyebrows it gets worse, or if i touch that area of my head, even the hair moving on my head causes it to trigger more episodes, making it very hard to sleep at night.  Ive had plenty of pain meds, no luck, when the pain triggers, it can travel toward my ear, and the right side of my head.  Should i go see a doc asap, or will this pass due to the chronic migraines?  Ive never had this problem before, im a 26 year old male.  Oh, and my right ear rings very loud especially noticeable at night.  Thanks.

I have been sick for about 3 1/2 days and I suffer fever, hot flashes, stuffy/runny nose, congestion, headache, pale skin, sore throat, and sometimes stomach aches.   I think this is a little more than a cold, my friend has it and he suffers the same things and both of us had about a 99 degree temperature for 2 days then it shot up to 101 degrees.      Anyway, when I have a fever, I actually feel fine, but when I don't have a fever, I am absolutely miserable!      I have had walking Pneumonia before but I only had congestion and a fever.      Can someone please explain and tell me what I might be diagnosed with?

He asked how I was and I was fine. Then they put an IV in my hand, it didn't hurt. Then hooked up two needle things to it.It was like sleep medicine, but I never went to sleep. They only got to do one tooth. My heart rate went from 72-181 in an hour.  Then he had to stop. All I remember was the dentist saying stay with us, Jessica, your going to have to breath slower. Thats better. It was really weird. So now I have an appointment for a heart doctor Thursday at 215.    -Anyone know whats wrong?  dentist said there could be something wrong with my heart, or i could have  a nerve problem[ he called it something but i can't remember]

20090130185828AAonzQM	Health;Mental Health	Do you regret going on medications?	I see a therapist for depression and a mess of anxiety issues. I first went knowing the possibility I might need medications was there. I'm starting to not be so pessimistic and critical all the time; but I can't get rid of my chronically depressed attitude. Even when I don't have a lot going on and should be relaxed; something always is bothering me and I'm unhappy.       I didn't want to have to go on the medications. But my life right now is not "living." I honestly hate my life and the main goals of my day is just to get through the day. I don't know why I feel this bad but I do. I'm considering asking my therapist about medications and if he'll refer me to a psychiatrist.       For those of you who've tried anti-depressants, how did they work for you? Did you regret taking them or did they help you? It seems like if I ask a question about anti-depressants on here, someone will freak out and tell me not to do it, start praying,  and how medications  will ruin my life.
20090130190002AAjxeLx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Do I have Staph in my nose?	5 years ago, i had a scab like thing in my nose.  Since then, it has been off and on, lasting a couple weeks at at time.  it starts out with this small red bump on the outside of my nostril that feels like a sore/pimple, but then the skin inside my nostril feels like a scab. I don't think it actually is a scab,because when I have picked at it, its more like yellowy dried up skin.  I know this is gross.  Lately it has been happening more frequently so I went to the dermatologist.  They did a culture for Staph. I haven't heard the results yet, but this time the scabbiness is further back in my nostril, and covering a bigger area.  I poked around back there to feel the extent, and my nostril started to bleed.  I am concerned if this is staph, can it spread to my brain? and if its not staph,, what else could it be??

It's not just stomach problems but a chain reaction of problems but no matter what I do it won't go away... 3 weeks ago I thought I couldn't go to the bathroom ( 2) and then I had really bad gas problems. I do have a eating disorder but I started to eat again and it still proceeded with the pains. Went to the Hospital and they just recognized the disorder and not the pains. I did some research and all I got was that it could be a ovarian cyst or I'm feeling early signs of pregnancy ( I took a test but I think it was way too early for me to take it and the results weren't correct.) Last night my husband and I were lying down and I kept feeling a "thump" like a baby  pushing or kicking inside. My husband put his hand where I was moving and he said that he felt it moving around. Now I'm worried I'm pregnant or that was just gas traveling around. I'm going to the doctors on Monday but I just wanted to know what everyone thinks about it....    Symptoms:from the beginning to present  *Bloating  *Constipation  *Severe headaches  *joint and muscle pain (sore)  *dizzy nausea

There appears to be a small tear of he annulus associated with the disc protrusion. there is minimal encroachment on the right neural foramen." now im not a dr but uhhh hello its right there in print! well no thanks to him i know why been hurting so bad and have had to endure the pain for weeks now. also the dr. NEVER ONCE physically examined me in anyway shape or form. so im wondering if this would qualify for a malpractice suit or not? anyone help would be appreciated.

Does anyone have ideas I can use to stop myself when the urges hit?       I'm not dabbling, persay, in bulimia. My heath has been shot, one major reason I want to stop this (my potassium's usually in the 2's, etc). This is important because I don't purge every other day, even every day. I purge all day. Every day. 20, 30, + times a day. It's going to be a major, major change to just stop, and it's what I want and need to do.

THEY LIVED IN CHINA FOR FIVE YEARS!! THEY ARE THE MOST NON RACIST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD"   pshh first off, i'm not chinese. second, i bet those five years in china made them hate all asians. i dont know what to do to please these parents. they never seem to accept me. its driving me into depression      lately people call me bi-polar because of how i act. for months i would be happy go lucky and skip around. then one incident, where someone would point out how i look or make fun of my race, or the parents say something about me not allowed to come over, i crash and for months i go into this extreme depression stage. it gets pretty dangerous in those months. one time i was stupid enough to cut myself one night when the whole world seems to be spinning out of control, and the whole world starts to spin away from me. i cant grasp onto things fast enough and every parent seems to be making prejudice judments on me. racism, ruined my life.      i am guessing that i am in my depressing stages and now i see no hope. all i see is more regections and lonlieness. is there really no hope? my parents even seem to have lost intrest in me. i am wearing an invisible cloak, and no one can see me, even if i took off my cloak and rub my butt into their faces, i am completely invisible to them. they always tell me "you're my best friend" "i'm not racist" "i'm just busy" "hey, remember i did that for you??" "look, i cant spend all my time with you" "hey, bye"      they always try to prove themselves to be my friend. with words. no action needed there friend, just say that you're my friend and i guess that means you are :)      sigh, that knife looks pretty good in my throat

I turned around and saw a really tiny spider there, screamed and then ran out of the room into my bedroom. This happens basically everytime I see a spider. If it's even a picture I freeze up and maybe start crying. I've been scared of them since I took a magazine out of our old letterbox and there was a massive Red-Back spider on it.

20090130194850AALq3RS	Health;Mental Health	I feel so different and misunderstood?	i kno that millions of people say nobody understands them bt in my case its pretty true. and the people that do understand me stay quiet and ill never be able to talk with them. im not normal, i understand that completely. i have the knowlage to graduate highchool now but instead im failing every class. i make decisions to quickly and change my mid too much. i feel practically dead, i never talk {seriously, today i probably spoke a total of 50 words which were mostly to teachers} and im always so tired i can barely move even after sleeping 15 hours. i look like every other loser on the outside but on the inside im dying in pain. its hard to remember the last time i was happy, it was a few months ago and it was prolly caused by too much caffiene. the last time i actually smiled {not fake} was a few weeks ago and it was because somebody realized how depressed i was and hugged me {the first time anyone ever noticed me, let alone notice im sad}. i have 1 friend, i used to have 2 but the other one told me that they hate me for something i didnt do {i didnt mind so i geuss they were never really a good friend}. my other friend that i still have is nice and somewhat understanding but sometimes shes too caught up in her own little world to notice i practically have a gun to my head. ive pretty much cut myself off from the whole world, i dont answer my texts or phone calls {now i dont even check to see who its from}. i spend all my time that im not in school in my room on my laptop or huddled up in a corner. i honestly curl up in a little ball and just sit there for hours. i KNOW that is not normal for a 13 year old girl{ please dont say "your only 13 you have a lot more to live for" because i dont, i honestly have no purpose in my life and do not have a future}. i hate feeling like this. no one seems to understand, actually no one ever even cares enough to listen. what do i do? {cant tell my parents for reasons id rather not share and i cant tell a therapist or doctor because then my parents would find out}

20090130201717AA3Dy6Y	Health;Diet & Fitness	I've seen many people (friends, relatives...) who've lost weight by changing their eating habits alone...?	...but they never exercised (i.e., didn't go to the gym, didn't do cardio, etc.) ... They simply changed their eating habits. And this worked for them, I've seen it with my own eyes.      So, how true can it possibly be that the key to losing weight and being healthy lies in BOTH proper diet and exercise?      I want to shed a few lbs. (about 5 to 10) before the Winter coats can't hide me anymore, and I don't have the time for gym, so I was wondering if I could pull it off with just better eating habits alone. I mean, I've actually seen people do this, is this a healthy way to lose weight?      I'd appreciate any thoughts on this, particularly if you've had personal experiences with weight issues. THANK YOU SO MUCH! :o)      . .. . xoxo . .. .      -?-?-?-?-?-?-?-

I'm naturally a nervous person. and sometimes i wake up at 4 or 3 am in the morning for no reason and i have trouble sleeping. one more thing is that i'm very paranoid. I'm not sure if it's anxiety cause the doctor just quickly assumed it's anxiety. Are all of these symptoms normal for it? I just want to be sure to put my mind at ease. thanks.

20090130203753AAGCfMv	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I help keep my boyfriend from losing more weight?	He's not losing it on purpose. He was a crack baby, and this made his metabolism crazy. He has to eat 2-3 times what a normal person does just to keep weight on, and even then he's bony (more so than you would guess by his weight.) He wishes he could gain a lot of weight.      Now his dad has become out of work, and they have trouble affording food. He still eats a bit more than a normal person, but he's dropping weight quickly. In the past 2 months he went from about 145-150 pounds to 130 or so. He's 5'10". It's starting to scare even me, and I like skinny guys. I'm afraid if he loses much more he will have health problems. I already bring him extra food when I go see him, but I was wondering if there were any supplements that could help him? Please don't suggest lifting weights; exercise is not his thing, and he already does a lot of physical work helping his friend build things.
20090130203418AAXCxaM	Health;Mental Health	I'm having really bad anxiety...?	For the past couple years i've been a mess. I think i'm having anxiety problems. When it gets bad i get extremely stressed, my mind races and i can't control all of the negative thoughts that go through my mind. I feel like i'm having a million thoughts all at once. it literally drives me insane. i cry for hours on end, my heart races, my leg shakes, and i feel like a complete mess. this leads to me feeling like i don't even care what happens to me anymore. i don't care if i die, i don't care about anything. my OCD also gets worse. it's not bad to begin with, but the little things i feel like i absolutely HAVE to do drive me even more insane. everything just gets worse.      I started going to a psychiatrist two years ago when it wasn't SO bad. He told me to do deep breathing exercises, eat better foods, exercise, yoga, even sitting in a quiet dark room. when none of that worked i stopped going to the psych. and pretty much turned to pills and weed. While i was high everything was better because i didn't have to think about anything. I've been off drugs for almost a year and everything is worse. these "anxiety attacks" are making me nuts. i have them almost every day, even during school and even end up missing class sometimes. i feel kind of depressed because of it as well.      now my mom wants me to go to a new psychiatrist. I'm fine with that. she wants to see if i can be prescribed medication for it since nothing seems to be working. has anyone ever gone on medication for anything like this? do you regret it? has it helped? all answers welcome. thanks.

I look at them one way, then reverse them, and they look identical. Not even the slightest difference.   Well of course I am not going to waste another few hundred dollars on contacts again. I have my last 2 pairs and either need to try something different to get them in, or just toss em.   I read all the Q's and A's and ggogled for tutorials and such, and also had a friend with contacts help me with no luck.   My contacts are colored, does this mean they are bigger/more difficult to put in?   And please no "keep trying" help, the keep-trying method clearly doesn't work. Of all the Q's and people I've seen, it looks like noone has spendt more than 40 minutes getting them in their first time, where I have spendt about 15 hours so far.   So I need any different methods someone might have tried and worked.   Anyway, thanks for trying to help me!!

20090130193648AAPmgQq	Health;Mental Health	Should I continue my daughters medication?	My daughter has been seeing a counselor for 6 months.  This week she saw a psychiatrist who placed her on Zoloft.  When I last spoke to her counselor we discussed that I would call him after the appointment and talk about the medication she was placed on and how I felt about starting it.  I have never had her on anything in the past and am unsure now.  I called her counselor and we have had some bad weather and long story short, he didn't call back.  My daughter (age 11) was insistent to start the medication immediately.  She has anxiety disorder, OCD, PTSD and social anxiety disorder.  She has worries constantly that interfere with school, bedtime and playtime.  She has certain rituals that prevent her from doing normal things in a timely manner.  Long story short, she wanted the medicine to make the worries go away.  We started it and now I am sick to stomach because I really don't know too much about this medication.        Anyone have any experience with the Zoloft?  She has been through so much and she just wants to get better, as do I, but I don't know if this is the right thing to do.  I would have felt better had I been able to talk to her counselor.  We won't see him until the 2/11.  Is it okay to continue the medication until then?

My sister is 22 and she has always had not so great cramps and now this time she says that she was a week late but just started her period and she says it hurts and she slept like for hours today and then she told me that using tampons helps the pain more than not using tampons. She says it feels like her bottom and the "other area" hurt and there is alot of pressure and that it feels like it radiates down to her legs too. I know it sounds normal, I used to have them pretty bad myself too but she says that she feels like relly heavy from her waist down to her feet. The last time she was sexually active was about a month ago. Anyone have any imput on if this sounds like MORE than just a menstrual period?

20090130203731AAK2jgY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	My hands shake uncontrollably?	This has been happening for a long time, but I haven't really paid attention to it until a few months ago.      When I rest my hand on a table and lift my fingers - they shake. Sometimes it's just a little, and other times it's really bad. My pinky seems to be the worst - it jerks a lot when in this position.      It does it with both hands, no matter where I am. When I'm speaking in front of a crowd, they shake even more, but I know that's just from nerves.   But when I'm at home, relaxed and calm, they still shake.      My toes do the same thing. If I place my foot on the floor and lift my toes, they tremble and sometimes jerk/curl and uncurl.      This also happens when my hands/feet are held in the air.      I also have horrible balance, but I'm not sure if that's related or not.      Any ideas on why this happens?

20090130195131AANqZhh	Health;Mental Health	How can I stop being so nervous and embarrassed? I just want to be myself.?	Every day I wake up, I tell myself that it's going to be a good day and that I shouldn't care what my classmates think of me. This usually helps a little, but not enough. I'm the kind of student who's quiet during school because I like to get things done and I like to avoid a lot of attention. I'm usually very talkative, but with smaller groups. As soon as I have to speak in front of others or as soon as I have everyone's attention in some way, even if it's just from laughing loudly, my face turns beat red. I'm told that my face turns red all the time. Along with my face turning red, I sweat in the palms and armpits. It's disgusting, I know. I've looked for several cures and have tried drysol and other products, but they have a very small effect on me.  Sometimes it's really easy for me to joke around about this problem, but most times it makes me very insecure and depressed. I have read several articles on how to survive social anxiety and I've even tried talking to my doctor about it. I asked him what might be wrong and he said, "You have social anxiety, but there's nothing that we can do for you." I feel lost and I'm not sure how I can stop feeling so nervous all the time. This is my senior year and I want it to be as great as it can be, but I feel that because of everything listed about, it's just a mess. I know that deep down I want to be outgoing and I want to myself because I hate this, but I'm not finding ways that I can show it. What should I do?

20090130195132AAkFxOr	Health;Men's Health	Emma bovary syndrome?	i am a 17 year old gay boy. i have no problem with being gay, so don't say that it's my issue. i had to read the book madame bovary for school, and as i was reading, i kept crying. not because the story was sad, but because i am in so many ways emma bovary. i think like her. everything she feels in the book, i felt in my life, and i could seriously see myself growing up to be just like her. living in a fantasy world, borrowing money, and killing myself. i am so unhappy with myself. and so lonely. my parents are middle class people who do buy me lots of stuff, but it's not enough. i want to change my whole style now, and i only got two shirts, so i only went to school two days this week. hopefully they'll buy me more shirts this weekend. i need shoes, and pants, and a scarf. i need so much stuff. when i think about it, i want to pull my hair off and scream. i want luxury so much, i want to be only surrounded by beauty. i refuse to use cheap stuff, and when i go to the store, i buy the most expensive shampoos and cleansers, just because they're expensive. now the other day i saw a boy with guess jeans at school and i just want to hang myself. i am soooooo jealous and so bitter and full of hatred for everyone whose life is better than mine. is this a serious disorder? what is it called? what is it called when a person is really materialistic and obsessed with luxury? i do know a lot of people love luxury, but i actually cried myself to sleep for weeks because i can only go to tim hortons to buy my coffee in the morning, because the starbucks is really far, and tim hortons is cheaper than starbucks.

20090130202436AASqXxh	Health;Mental Health	I quit taking my bipolar meds 2 weeks ago, is this why i feel so bad?	Ok so, I stopped taking my bipolar medication 2 weeks and 3 weeks ago (2 meds) Lamictal I quit first, and Topamax a week later. I felt like crap before and I feel worse now. Nobody knows that I stopped not even my best friend or family. I didn't tell anyone because 1 my dad says i'm a ***** without them, and 2 because it would lead to unnecessary concern and worry. I've been feeling depressed worse than ever, like all I want to do is sleep or cry. I never sleep, and going to work (even though I like my job) has become such a chore and hassle that I want to quit my job but can't because I need the money. I was dizzy from lack of sleep today so I decided i needed to take the day off from work. I'm working a minimum wage job 5 days a week from 6:15am to 8:45am and again same job from 3:15 to 6:00. Could my lack of ambition and terrible feelings be cause by the fact that I stopped taking my meds? Also should I tell my doc when I see him wednesday that I stopped? I know he's going to try to convince me to go back on them. Uhg Idk what to do.
