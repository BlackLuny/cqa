44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	The new lithium Ion battery that is in your IPod doens't really require that. It use to be that if the particles weren't constantly charged they "died" and no longer accepted a charge. So not running it dead and recharging it would eventually give the battery a "memory" as they called it. It would start charging certain particles and ignoring others which would cause there demise. <br>  <br>  That just isn't the case with the new battery. It remembers where it last got charged to particle wise and starts there... it doesn't go back to square one and go all the way up. So it will last alot longer and you can charge it at any time in the life of the device and it makes no difference. That is one of the reasons Ipods are so superior to every other MP3 player.|`|r8HAHhgkaa	In the old days you used to need to break in batteries in order to get the most life out of them. That meant running them down until they died the first time and completly recharging them. However because the ipod touch uses a lithium ion battery there is no need for this sort of break in period. The best way to make your ipod touch last longer is to turn off wifi when you arent using it. Same goes for the screen. Both those things use more battery

AA11056614	It's simply 2 conductor wire. Look in any electronics/hi-fi store for "speaker wire". The main feature is that it is coded in some way (e.g. coloured conductor, mark on one side of the insulation, colour of the insulation) to allow you to retain polarity. Use wire no smaller in thickness than the existing wire. <br>  <br>  You simply wire a suitable length of "speaker wire" on the end of your existing wire (or splice it in the middle if there is some form of proprietary connector). Make sure the polarity is the same on all channels. For example, if there is a brass and silver wire on the existing wire, be sure the extension is wired the same way (or marked side to brass, or whatever works). You won't do any damage if polarity is wrong, but bass will be weakened.
sYZ6IPWjaa	I chose the BlackBerry Curve 8900 (Javelin) over the BlackBerry Bold. The first thing was that the Bold is not available on T-Mobile, which is the carrier I am using. Also, I like the smaller form factor of the Curve 8900 and the better camera and more internal memory. The lack of 3G doesn't really bother me too much, as the EDGE web browsing is pretty speedy on the device.

jLTDqVHsaa	You'd have to get an NTSC camcorder to play the old tapes.<br>  <br>  It's not really region-specific coding, it's that they are two different formats.  NTSC is 29.97 frames per second, PAL is 25, and the number of lines is different.  They are incompatible formats.<br>  <br>  Where are you planning to watch the tapes?  The US or UK?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Good point, pureinsomniac.  Certainly, if the camera lets you change the setting, that's by far the easiest way to do it.  My guess is that it does not, but then again, I don't have a JVC.<br>  <br>  So, recap.  If you can get your hands on an NTSC camera and most of your shooting is done in the US so that you're watching it on US TVs or in other countries using NTSC, I'd consider getting a new NTSC camera and selling the PAL one if the camera indeed does not let you select the format (especially if you haven't recorded many PAL tapes).<br>  <br>  If the camera can be switched, then hey, all good, no problems.  Now, if you're in the UK and plan on watching all your stuff on UK TVs or other countries that use PAL, then certainly keep the PAL camera and consider some sort of conversion if you need to use or watch your NTSC tapes for any reason.  A cheap NTSC camera might also be a good idea if you have many tapes, just so you can use it as a deck instead of maybe paying to have the tapes transferred.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the current camera's functions and your needs.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	before you get to carried away , go through your settings and set the recording format to ntsc , that should be all you have to do , these video's are all made in the same factory , and the only difference will be the default settings , change it and all should be honky dory<br>  if you need the recordings , make sure you FireWire them accross and render the video in your prefered format

s390P1EGaa	Laptops and PC's are the same thing, personal computers. I would guess that Bullet Software says that you can not play it on a laptop, because some laptops do not have the highest components to play a game like that smoothly. <br>  <br>  I would confirm that the "replacement" is actually the game you want, and I would wait for that "replacement" before doing anything with the disk you have know. <br>  <br>  I would not get stressed over poor management by Bullet Software, you should voice your opinion, but making it harder on yourself is not worth it.
eac8411737600cb69167ca52e369872faa	Honestly it would be cheaper to buy a new one.  You can send it in to Olympus for an estimate for repairs, and nine times out of ten they will give you a trade in deal.  They do charge to send the camera in for the repair estimate, I think I paid 40 and they were unable to fix it and they made me some fairly decent offers and cameras with the same specs.|`|486125b0dbda750eed3268dcf28b7ca0aa	I had a Pentax digital type similar to the 300 model you have.  It did the same thing, but it was not dropped, to my knowledge.<br>  <br>  I tried fresh batteries, jiggling it, etc.  but no luck.  Sent it in to be repaired and they could not fix it.<br>  <br>  If you have the paper work, contact Olympus for advice.  Digital cameras are so affordable, it may be time to invest in a new one.  Sorry I wasn't much help.

Q0aktda7aa	Hi Ivan,<br>  <br>  to answer your question it all depends on what you like. If you like ds games and like music, Then the Dsi would be good. but, if you want a stand alone music player and you can deal with not as fun of games then the ipod touch is good for you. It just all depends on what you like.|`|f1d3G8sXaa	The iPod touch for sure. It's a iPod first of all meaning it has a great software and user interface for music and movies. But the great thing about it is it has wi fi that's super fast, a touch screen, and now sweet games!<br>  <br>  The ds is good too. It does have a bunch of games but they are all at least like twenty bucks for a good one. The iPod touch has good ges for two bucks. In my opinion the iPod touch is great.

AA10394504	I have the pink Verizon RAZR and I love it.  I usually don't have to charge my phone for at least 4 days and I never turn it off.  I only use it about 45 to 60 minutes a day and I bought the extra memory chip for my phone so I could store a ton of music and pictures.|`|AA10800599	The only thing that makes the RAZR different is its outward shape.<br>  The memory, etc. are pretty much the same across the board.|`|AA11498376	I have one.

Also, each STORE only gets and x amount. So you have to wait until Nintendo releases/sells more to your country. <br>  <br>  What people do is buy one and when there are none left, they sell it for more that 3x the regular price. THEY ARE EVIL!!!!<br>  <br>  I believe that is why the stores say "only one per house."|`|170b7e2476f78e0c5b6737427b428500aa	Try ebay!|`|98768422e3c1c320ecf6783988a02f2faa	All of them are around that price right now, because those are pre-orders and they are coming out with a really high-priced package, and will ship on the 18th.

Wii's are flying off the shelves, if you must have one as soon as possible it will cost you around 700 dollars, but if you can wait a few months you can save a couple hundred.

c40ded0db56f653b4fbede341549b9aeaa	If u will read the info below ur doubts will be complerely & fully cleared:<br>   GSM and CDMA are the two most popular mobile communication technologies.<br>  Both technologies have the same goal: to divide the Radio signals among multiple users so that each of them use signals to make & receive calls as well as other data.<br>  <br>  GSM : It does it by cutting up the channel into time slices. Each user of the channel takes turns to transmit and receive signals. In reality, only one person is actually using the channel at a specific moment. This is similar to time-sharing on a large computer server.<br>  <br>  CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) on the other hand spreads the voice over very wide channel.<br>  <br>  For simple understanding, imagine a UN party where couples from different countries are invited. In GSM, each couple takes turns talking. They talk for a short time and then stop to let another couple talk. As there is never more than one person speaking in the room, no one has to worry about being heard over the background noise. In CDMA, each couple talks at the same time; however they all use different languages. Because (we assume) that none of the listeners understand any other language than that of their partner, the background noise does not create any problem.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages of GSM<br>  <br>  ? Transmission interferes with some electronics, especially certain audio amplifiers. <br>  ?Intellectual property is concentrated among a few industry participants, creating barriers to entry for new entrants and limiting competition among phone manufacturers. <br>  ?GSM has a fixed maximum cell site range of 35 km, which is imposed by technical limitations.<br>  <br>   Advantages of CDMA<br>  <br>  ?Capacity is CDMA's biggest asset. It can accommodate more users per MHz of bandwidth than any other technology. <br>  ?CDMA has no built-in limit to the number of  users using network at the same moment of time. <br>  ?CDMA uses precise clocks that do not limit the distance a tower can cover.<br>  ?CDMA consumes less power and covers large areas so cell size in CDMA is larger. <br>  ?CDMA is able to produce a reasonable call with bad signal levels. <br>  ?CDMA reduces chances of dropped calls. <br>  <br>   Disadvantages of CDMA<br>  <br>  ?The coverage area shrinks under load. As the number of subscribers present at a place goes up, the range of that site goes down. <br>  ?Because CDMA towers interfere with themselves, they are normally installed on much shorter towers. Because of this, CDMA may not perform well in hilly terrain. <br>  ?Currently CDMA covers a smaller portion of the world as compared to GSM which has more subcribers and is in more countries overall worldwide.

fcd606fc1ae79a6d6564aa4b13510a3faa	No. A Podcast is just a recording of a radio show or other audio content in MP3 format that is distributed over the internet. You can download podcasts from various websites. You can then play them back using your computer or MP3 player or even burn them on to CD and listen to them on any CD player. If you use iTunes software it's very easy to find podcasts you are interested in and download them. But there are other "podcast client" programs available too.

You can also do it by typing the name of the podcast in the search bar. I recommend Pottercast and Mugglecast if you are a harry potter fan. They're fantastic!

zXycmh40aa	Seriously, the best place is going to be eBay.  There are sellers who sell nothing but accessories like data cables over there.

Allora..in genere nel momento in cui sottoscrivi un piano tariffario ti rimane finché tu, di tua spontanea iniziativa, non decida di cambiarlo. Anche se, per esempio, hai ancora un piano vecchio che non risulta più attivabile ti rimane ugualmente e non si subiscono neppure aumenti, rimane invariato. Infatti chi aveva un piano già prima dell'avvento dell'euro e non lo ha mai cambiato, il gestore ha applicato la precisa conversione (ad es. un sms di 300 lire lo hanno portato a 0,15 cent) e così anche per le tariffe di conversazione. <br>  E' così sia per tim e vodafone e mi stupisce che wind non applichi lo stesso metodo!<br>  Io ho diverse schede, tra cui anche una wind con lo stesso tuo piano "wind 10". Quindi devo attendermi un aumento nei prossimi mesi? <br>  Vedi, bisogna verificare il regolamento di wind..finora gli altri gestori non applicano un criterio simile però se wind ha stabilito i suoi criteri neanche l'associazione consumatori può farci nulla..l'unico svantaggio per wind è la notevole concorrenza perché se metterà in pratica questa cosa si vedrà di conseguenza diminuire notevolmente i suoi clienti. <br>  Alla fine chi decreta il loro successo sono gli utenti finali,noi consumatori, e giustamente ci si orienterà verso tariffe sempre più vantaggiose e competitive.<br>  Ottima segnalazione,bellissima domanda che serve a rendere tutti più vigili e attenti.

Watch. Burn. All from your Mac or PC.  You’ve spent time and money building that CD collection. Give it the respect it deserves by importing it to iTunes.

9348ed33233076ea31666978b1520775aa	Ok, Guido, here is an answer that I put down recently.  See if this works, but do me a favor...have your personal iPod empty when you go to your friends place so that you don't have the stuff overlapping.  Also, realize that music that is copyright protected by apple will only be usabe if your friend authorizes you onto his account.  The new amount of computers that can be authorized is 5, not 3 anymore.  Good luck and maybe have your friend rip the purchased stuff so that you can "legally" move it to your computer.  Lastly, this is an XP thing, so if you have Vista, don't know if it works...<br>  <br>  1)Plug in the old iPod. (Your friend's iPod on your computer)<br>  2)Go to Start button at lower left hand corner of computer screen<br>  3)Go to My Computer<br>  4)Go to Tools menu<br>  5)Go to Folder Options<br>  6)Go to View<br>  7)Click the button "Show Hidden Files"<br>  8)Click on the old iPod<br>  9)View music folders which are folders labled "F" folders. (Starts with F00, then moves up depending upon how many songs you have on the iPod, personally I went up to F48 with 7000+ songs.  Not bragging, know people that have 20,000+ songs)<br>  10) Open up the files and double click on the individual songs, or try as I have to open the complete folder and they will play in i-tunes.  Haven't had much luck trying to open all songs at once.<br>  11) Understand that these files aren't in a particular order, so you will need to open them all.|`|4e28681b8e72c28b50d5709f70bdd749aa	You can try doing that manually.  That is don't sync it but manually move the songs between the ipod and computer.  The problem you will run into though is that itunes purchased songs are protected and your computer will not be authorized to play your friends songs. The titles will show up but they won't play. <br>  <br>  itunes allows you to authorize  at least 3 computers to play songs on one account.|`|bf02f2f0bef6ab8759f52b2f5e77ca9aaa	there's program that lets you upload songs from your iPod to your computer, but I'm pretty sure that what you're talking about doing is illegal.

zXycmh40aa	MPEG-4 Part 14, formally ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003, is a multimedia container format standard specified as a part of MPEG-4. It is most commonly used to store digital audio and digital video streams, especially those defined by MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles and still images. Like most modern container formats, MPEG-4 Part 14 allows streaming over the Internet. The official filename extension for MPEG-4 Part 14 files is .mp4, thus the container format is often referred to simply as MP4. Devices that play .mp4 files are referred to as MP4 players.

zXycmh40aa	Tripods are used for both still and motion photography. A tripod of some sort is often necessary for professional photography as well as certain video uses; HDTV video in particular, due to peculiarities inherent in the MPEG-2 algorithms used, tends to be almost unwatchable without some sort of stabilization. Tripods are also used to support small to medium-sized telescopes, large firearms, and similar applications.|`|AA12323486	Well, I've never heard of getting a tripod head stuck on a camera.  Is it the kind of tripod head that you can remove from the tripod?  Well, anyway, try all the usual methods you'd use to unstick a jar lid.  Use rubber gloves to increase your grip, maybe a rubber jar gripper, rubber bands, etc.  Make sure you're turning the correct direction.  You don't want to be making it tighter. Maybe use a vise grip type of wrench on the tripod head (not your camera!).  Get someone else to help you.<br>  <br>  If you just cut it off, then the mount bolt will be stuck in your camera, and you won't be able to use any other tripod.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a5ce0a4cc50f85aee48d7eb8f23e4154aa	I wish I could give you better advice....but you definitely don't want to harm the camera!  I'm sure you've tried all the obvious methods of removing it.  I assume you have a tripod that screws directly into the bottom of the camera.  If I were you, I'd take it to a repair shop.  If you cut the head off, how will you remove the bolt from the camera?<br>  <br>  I would suggest you get a tripod head with a quick release plate the next time.  Not only does it make it easier to put on and take off the camera, but you can leave the plate on the camera all the time...even when hand holding!

Acid Pro is another program for producing, it is a lot cheaper (if you can't find it for free), but it lets you do things like sample beats and vocals whereas it is difficult to do with Fruity Loops. If you mess around with Acid Pro and read up on it, then you can make some pretty professional sounding stuff. But yeah Pro Tools is amazing, it's almost impossible to get it for free though.

zXycmh40aa	An air conditioner (AC) is used to reduce the temperature of the air.  A compressed refrigerant is decompressed, which lowers the temperature.  Air is forced through the coils containing this cold refrigerant.  Next, the refrigerant is compressed again on the other side of the AC (towards outside).  These coils become hot.  Air is forced through them to cool off the hot refrigerant and the process starts all over again.|`|n2CqcE8haa	Dry mode is used for dehumidifying the room or to make the room less humid.

I'll just cover the loose ends.<br>  <br>  <br>  a. This is kind of in the "grey area" between illegal and not.  Since you're only giving the songs to one person, it is OK but not that great.   <br>  <br>    PS I should note that for songs bought off iTunes:<br>       -can betransferredd to five other people, under Apple's sharing policy,<br>       -will not work on someone else's computer unless:<br>            -they are iTunes Plus, or<br>            -they are first burned to a CD and then re-imported into iTunes (to remove the copy protection),<br>            - the buyer knows your Appleaccountt and password.<br>  <br>  b. No, you wouldn't need to erase them.<br>  <br>  c.  This one depends.  If you sell it with the songs on it thru iTunes, the seller would be limited to either erasing them, or manually managing his music (which is a pain).<br>  <br>  A better way would be to "enable disc use" on the iPod (this will not work if it is a Touch)...<br>  Then drag all the songs on, using Windows Explorer.  <br>  The buyer can then put the songs into their iTunes Library just as easily.

NKWI02KTaa	You should be fine with the 256mb if you have no plans to play online or download demos/game content. A game takes up around 3-8 mb. Just depends how far you get in a game. Some games only take up 1mb of space. The most I've had on a game without download able content (DLC) was Halo 3 which was 8mb for the gamesave.  So you should be fine.  But once you feel like/do upgrade to Xbox Live. Then I recommend buying a hard drive for your system because Xbox Live offers some great features.(Movies,Demos, Arcade Games, Game Content[TONS OF IT]) <br>  But you can also install games to your hard drive which doesn't make your disc drive spin.(The game is still inside your Xbox for legal purposes. Which doesn't heat your system up as much and saves the wear and tear on your disc drive. This reduces your chances of getting RROD(Red Ring of Death) Which is a hardware malfunction and you have to send your xbox in for repair. But for your gameing the Xbox Arcade system should be just fine. Plenty of space for regualar game saves.  Best of Luck.  Any other questions.?

The Wii has been on the market for a little over two years now, but demand is still very high, and a lot of stores go through their shipments the day they receive them.<br>  <br>  If you want to guarantee yourself a Wii, call up all the major stores within an hour's drive or so (Best Buys, Walmarts, GameStops, Targets, etc...), and ask them when they're getting their next shipment in.<br>  <br>  Then plan to get there, that day, as early as you can get there - before they open would be ideal.<br>  <br>  That is how I got my Wii shortly after it launched, and how I got Wii Fit a few days after it launched.<br>  <br>  That said, I was at a Walmart the other day, and they had a couple Wiis on the floor in their video game display.  So your mileage may vary.|`|3pLv7KBvaa	It was true somewhat but it is alot easier getting a wii. just call local gamestop,walmart,target, eb, toysrus  eb/gamestop are the same store and same company now.<br>  <br>  check these store people dont know to much about that sell video games<br>  <br>  sears<br>  kmart|`|l8xi0rkvaa	sometimes there sold out like i go to walmart all the time and since the wii came out they dont have it anymore but u can play it try gamestop they probably do|`|AA11540246	False.|`|3d2ce992f7a4d06120c7b88f85ef2ee1aa	I'd say not true, I was in walmart one day and bought one...I didn't go there specifically for the wii either....maybe in some parts of the country its different...on a side note I am not impressed with the wii, its just a gamecube with motion controllers.|`|1d4e0e45453512158e7c2dc21d0bb0c9aa	Nope it requires a background check, two types of identification, and lots of money. No really though if you find a Wii for sale get it. Thats all there is to it, though they are on a major shortage still.|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	I don't know what you're talking about. I went on the Thanksgiving early bird sale, and I got it easily. Keep in mind, that this day was big for Christmas shopping.

xBCxKxCtaa	If you are using HDMI cables to connect to your DVD player, then no sound will transfer through the DVD speakers.  If this is the case, then you have to buy an additional xbox adapter to gain anything better than stereo sound when using HDMI.  If you have inputs anywhere on the television for the red and white audio cables, bypass the DVD player and plug in direct just to see if you get any sound.  Then you can eliminate whether or not it's the console.  If you aren't using HDMI and are plugging in through your DVD player, make sure that the video input that you are plugging into matches the audio input.  For example, if your video is plugged into the "Input 1" set of jacks, make sure that the audio inputs correlate to "Input 1" as well.<br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse and none of this has helped, you can find a stereo with the red and white inputs in order to test the console's ability to send an audio signal.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|cwNYmxDMaa	Make sure that your white and red cables are plugged into the appropriate inputs.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	Conventional, alkaline batteries have a shelf life of about 9 years when stored at room temperatures so I'd say puttng them in a freezer or fridge wasn't a "really good idea".  Your intuition is right.  How much longer do you need to store one?  It more effort than it's worth.  Nor will storing a battery in a fridge or freezer charge it in any fashion at all.  Storing a battery in a fridge or freezer doens't kill them.  The cold temperature slows down the chemical reaction that produces the electric current.  You have to let the battery warm up to room temperature before using it.  This will take a couple of hours so you can't just grab one out of the cooler and use it.|`|mymTKvJraa	no it presserves their lives!:D|`|OiT5SJM8aa	Main problem with doing this is condensation.. <br>  <br>  Batteries will not loose their capacity as fast when the temperature is low.

Turn the console back on.<br>  <br>  Turn off the console, and then disconnect any accessories that are connected. For example, disconnect any Xbox 360 controllers, Xbox 360 Memory Units, and the Xbox 360 Hard Drive.<br>   With the accessories disconnected, restart the console to see whether the problem still occurs. This can help you determine whether the console or an accessory is experiencing the problem.<br>   If you determine that an accessory is consistently causing the error, try borrowing another accessory of the same type and testing again using that accessory.<br>  If you continue to experience this problem, contact Xbox Customer Service.

But if you want internet, YouTube, email, contacts lists, music, videos, directions, weather and a bunch of other stuff like that, get the Touch. <br>  <br>  As to reviews, the older versions of the touches get better reviews that the new ones. You can check them out in my sources.<br>  <br>  I hope this info helped.|`|rU5Wkh49aa	For me personaly, the iPod Nano because its small (not too small like the shuffle) which you can see the songs your playing and has other features which some don't.|`|TjLHnuh3aa	The big one<br>  |`|GExoGGTiaa	my sansa view ipod with 8gig was good lol|`|bribxhsdaa	A touch is good because its Flash memory.

I can't give you step-by-step instructions for Windows because I'm on an iMac, but when you connect your camera and open the program, you should see that it recognises the files as different types.  Make sure you have the latest version of FinePix viewer.  You can download copies from www.fujifilm.com in their support section, and at the same time make sure you have the latest firmware for your camera, usb utilities etc etc.<br>  <br>  If you have an iMac, iPhoto will automatically load the movies in the same way it loads the photos.

Rip the video to a file your computer and editor can deal with. You did not tell us which computer or editor you are using.<br>  <br>  5) When the ripping is done, quit HandBrake and launch the video editor. Drag the ripped video file to the Collections or Log/Capture or Clips area of the editor - or directly to the timeline.<br>  <br>  6) Edit. Cut the bad parts, add titles, scene transitions... it is easy to do.

VMVW3E7Aaa	That wouldn't be much of an upgrade at all.<br>  <br>  Your 8 megapixels are plenty enough, they are not the problem.<br>  <br>  Your problem is a lens with the biggest possible aperture of f/4, which gets even worse as you use the zoom.<br>  The IS isn't going to improve that any at all.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off with with an f2.8 lens, even if it was the shorter 70-200mm one. If you bought the L lens, you'd have the speed you need, plus the quality to allow you to zoom in.<br>  Add a 1.4x converter, and you'd still have f4.0 all the way through the zoom, plus a 360mm equivalent lens.|`|IY9JolQ4aa	Any lens that has that much range will be slow and inadequate for sports. Look into getting a long lens with a aperture of 2.8

When you click on something to have it play on itunes it has a memory on the computer of where it is located so it can go and access it. <br>  <br>  With that said you might be able to load it off the external. Go to file, click on add folder to library or add file to library, find your device in the "find" menu, click on it, find those file on that device and select it for itunes in your menu. Let it load... put it on a playlist if that required and plug your ipod in. <br>  <br>  Hope it works.

I'm guessing they are AVI format... that is what video's typically are. Ipods don't support AVI so no they won't load. <br>  <br>  You'll have to go and either find a freeware program to convert them to MP4 the format that ipod supports. There are tons of them out there. Some are complex... some are add videos to them and push convert. <br>  <br>  Just go to google and type in AVI to MP4 convert... lots of options will come up. I have one program I use but it is discontinued and complex so maybe a new one is the best course of action.

bqdDRCeDaa	Sure. You will need the account number from alltell and then go into verizon and say you want to port in a number. Tell them the number and the account number and it will change over. Be aware that when he does this his contract with alltell will be cancelled. The number will still be in your name, everything will stay the same only the number will be the alltell number instead of the verizon number.
