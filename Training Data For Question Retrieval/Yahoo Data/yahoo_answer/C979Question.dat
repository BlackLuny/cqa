Sto facendo un corso di nuoto  in una psicina comunale vicino dove abito, e mi piacerebbe andare con il mio ragazzo qualche olta la domenica o nel week end o comunque un giorno che siamo liberi  insieme a farci una nuotata.   La mia piscina è aperta anche la domenica, ma nn fanno venire anche lui con me perchè non è iscritto.   Volevo sapere se conoscete di piscine a roma che fano anche pagare ad ingresso e dove si può andare anche se nn iscritti, al massimo facendo una tessirina per assicurazioni  che credo sia obligatoria.   D'estate la mia piscina organizza queste cose, ti fa fare una tessirina a 5 euro per l'assicurazione e poi quando vai paghi 5 euro e stai tutta la mattina.   Esiste qualche piscina che fa cose simili anche di inverno a roma?

20080809212944AAzcIfe	Sports;Swimming & Diving	Dubbio sul futuro, uno sport che mi ha cresciuto.	è da quando sono bambino che faccio nuoto,e la mia famiglia ha diciamo sfornato solo nuotatori.    per chi conosce questo sport sa quanti sacrifici si fanno, quante volte si deve negare agli amici l'uscita e quante volte non si ha il tempo di studiare, di andare alle feste. fino ad un età di 10/11 anni nuotavo regolarmente facendo agonistica, poi ho mollato, perchè ci siamo trasferiti e non ero interessato allo sport, poi ripresi e rilasciai, l'andazzo continuò per un paio di anni fino a che a 13 anni decisi di intraprendere con decisione questo sport. Il mio allenatore era mio padre ed era veramente stressante, ora non ci parliamo più (o quasi) perchè ho smesso di nuotare ora a 15 anni definitivamente.   Al momento ho molti problemi perchè le 5 ore giornaliere sprecate per nuotare si sono svuotate, e non so come riempirle, la cosa che più mi piacerebbe è praticare la pallavolo, il mio grande sogno. solo che ho paura di essere in ritardo, avendo nuotato da sempre so che sto facendo una cavolata, sono 1m85cm e un fisico invidiabile, e per la mia tecnica natatoria(essendoci cresciuto in acqua) sarei un vero talento, non voglio ricominciare a nuotare, ma vorrei capire perchè mi sembra di sbagliare tutto, mi sembra di rincorrere un sogno gia perso in partenza. Dalla famiglia non ho nessun aiuto, e tornare a nuotare sarebe come una resa, proprio ora ci sono le olimpiadi e guardandole mi viene nostalgia,fin troppa e mi sento male, malissimo al solo guardare che anchio se ci avessi messo la testa e il cuore potevo essere li, solo quello mancava il cuore. Ora ho paura se iniziassi potrei arrivare alle prossime olimpiadi scalando la vetta da zero, ma se sbagliassi un'altra volta, se un'altra volta mi ritrovassi senza il coraggio di stringere i denti e di massacrarmi per qualche decimo, solo per arrivare a fare 25s e 70c piuttosto che 26s. Sto sprecando il mio tempo oppure è solo qualcosa che passerà, ora chiedo solo qualcuno che può aiutarmi in questa situazione, qualcuno che c'è passato ho ha avuto una storia simile, qualcuno più grande che mi possa guidare. senza il nuoto mi sento una goccia nel mare, ma con il nuoto mi sento un mare senza gocce.

20090204161936AAZR8Y0	Sports;Football (American)	When will people realize that the only reason the Patriots went 16-0 last season was because they cheated?	Although there is no evidence to supposed my claim, and only facts to prove that I am just a hateful idiot, I will not let the fact that they were caught in a game they were going to win anyway go.      There is the main fact that the league cracked down the entire season to make sure that it doesn't happen again, and even changed it to where coaches send the signals to a defensive player's helmet during that season. I totally ignore this fact, for I would rather be stuck in a haze of constant stupidity, than to admit that the Patriots are just a good team.      Now any time someone mentions the Patriots on Y!A in a question, I respond by stating that they cheat, even though the issue is in the past and there is no reason for me to think that they still do.       Another reason why they only win is because Bill Belichick descendant of Merlin the wizard.      Does anyone else know that they only win because of cheating and magic?

20090204130158AAh67VR	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Climbing	Grivel G12 crampons problems?	This year I was elected gear officer of the climbing club I'm in. And when the club came back I was told that several pairs of the crampons that were given out failed and were given to me broken. These were the 12 point technical crampons Grivel G12.      The common fault seems to be in the spring. Seems as we're a college club every year there's always beginners using the club gear. Which means it can be used wrong.      Anyone any ideas if this is a common problem with the crampons, or what might have caused it? My suspicion is that they're just not maintained properly. A few links for crampon maintenance would be nice.      My idea is to print out a sheets on how to properly maintain gear and try get it passed on to the next gear officer. And get the gear taken care of properly year to year. That is if I can find simple enough guides on how to look after the stuff.

20090204162132AAr4LhR	Sports;Football (American)	Do you think the Arizona Cardinals could repeat?	Next season and make it back to the Super Bowl?   God I hope they can, just as long as they get to keep Warner for at least one more year even though they want two more out of him.      I think they can make it without Edgerrin James, and it looks like they have a good chance of resigning Boldin since Larry Fitzgerald is man enough to let his income drop so his organization can do better.      I've always been a Cardinals fan, they were always second to the Broncos, but living in Arizona it's always easier to follow your home team.      The Arizona Cardinals stole my heart this year no matter how lame that may sound, I just want them to get what they deserve, and that's the Lombardi Trophy.

20090204180001AAVRDL7	Sports;Wrestling	EWA: The VERY LAST episode! (WQ inside)?	Welcome fans to the VERY LAST episode of Extreme Wrestling Entertainment!       Let's start the show with our first event:       Event#1: The Chairman of Extreme Wrestling Association is in the ring to start the show. "Ladies and Gentlemen, tonight is NOT a good night for EWA. And it is not a good night for EWA's Champions. Let's bring out EWA's World Tag Team Champions, Cryme Tyme." (Cryme Tyme comes to the ring) "Cryme Tyme, as of right now you 2 have been striped of your Tag Team Titles. But, you 2 are not the only Wrestlers. Tonight, 1 by 1 I will vacate every Championship on EWA! LET'S START THE SHOW TONIGHT WITH A TAG TEAM MATCH. The former Tag Team Champs, Cryme Tyme will go against X-Pac and Kane!"       Match#1: Cryme Tyme vs Kane/X-Pac       Event#2: "Let's bring out the Womens Champion The Glamazon, BETH PHEONIX!" (Beth enters the ring) "Beth, surrender your title to me please." Beth tells the Chairman that she will not give up her belt without a fight. (The Kongterage enters the ring and Beth is put in a Handicap match)       Match#2: HANDICAP MATCH!       Beth Pheonix (c) vs Awesome Kong/Rihisha Sieed/Rhaka Khan       After the match: Awesome Kong hands the Womens title to the Chairman and leaves the ring.       Event#3: The Hardcore Champion, Gangrel is being attacked by Rhodes/Dibiase/Randy Orton. Former Champion, Eugene makes the save and this turns into a 2 on 3 BRAWL!       Match#3: HANDICAP MATCH!       Cody Rhodes/Ted Dibiase/Randy Orton (c) vs Eugene/Gangrel (c)       Event#4: The Chairman asks Gangrel if he can please come to the ring and surrender the Hardcore Title. Gangrel does not come to the ring, instead coming to the ring is are Gangrel's Tag Partners, Edge and Christian with the Hardcore Title. The team hands the belt to the Chairman and the Chairman tells Edge and Christian that they have a Tag Team match right now against Jesse and Festus!       Match#4: Edge/Christian vs Jesse/Festus       Event#5: The United States Champion, Sheik Bashir comes to the ring. Bashir begins to speak, but is interupted by the Chairman who asks Bashir to surrender the U.S Title. Bashir begins to speak again, but this time is interupted by the EWA Cruiserweight Champion, Tajiri. Then the Chairman gets an idea. He puts Sheik Bashir and Tajiri in a 1 on 1 match and the winner will be crowned "Cruiserweight of EWA"! He takes their belts from them and this match gets started!       MAIN EVENT: Sheik Bashir vs Tajiri       The winner of this match will become the very 1st "Cruiserweight of EWA"!       Event#6: The World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton makes his entrance to the ring followed by members of The Legacy, Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase. The Champion speaks: "So, this is how it is? I become the EWA World Heavyweight Champion, just to have it taken away from me without a title defense? Huh, that's just like our Chairman to hand us titles then just take them away with no hard feelings? That's not gonna fly with me and it's not gonna fly with Rhodes/Dibiase either. So, get out here right now and maybe I won't have to drag your lifeless body out here and punt..you...in the head!" (the Chairman makes his way to the ring)       The Chairman says: "Randy Orton, I've given you what you wanted on this show. To make you happy, but what do you do? You threaten to kick my head off is that what you said? Well, Randy I've got something to say to you. Either you give me that Championship right now, or you will be carried out of EWA and spend the rest of the night IN JAIL for threatening me!"       Orton thinks about it for a second, then takes a glance at Rhodes, then Dibiase. Rhodes/Dibiase grab the Chairman and Orton gives him a slap to the face. (the Chairman falls) Rhodes/Dibiase get him to his feet and Orton hits the Chairman with the RKO! (Orton then drops the belt to the floor, then him/Rhodes/Dibiase leave the ring) Securaty comes to the ring to escourt them out. The show goes off the air for the FINAL TIME!          Give the FINAL EPISODE of EWA a rating and answer the WQ below.          WQ: How do you think The Undertaker's appearence on WWE RAW next week will mean?

This man simply dominated the 2008 postseason (despite playing in 2009, it was the 2008 Cardinals who went to SB XLIII so go figure) and is already being called the greatest receiver since Jerry Rice by many experts.      Even before the postseason, he was considered a top 5 WR for the past few years. Now, he is argubly the greatest active WR in the NFL. On top of that, he doesn't feature any negative charactistics in his personality, notorious in talented WRs, as demonstrated by Moss, Owens, Ocho Cinco, Burress, Steve Smith and others.

For whatever reason, either boredom, burn-out or too many other responsibilities in life, I simply stopped taking classes and stopped practicing.      I am thinking of getting back into Tae Kwon Do again, but I know that before I do, I will get myself back into "black belt shape" and practice my forms again and stetch and practice my moves.      My question is this?  If I went back to "school" again as a black belt, would I have to PAY to take classes?  I had a housemate several years ago that was a 3rd dan black belt in TKD, and he suggested that I get back into it...but he mentioned paying for it.  Where I took instructions for 7 years, the rule was, once you got to black belt, you were expected to teach and help with classes and in return, your tuition was free from that point on.      So, the question is.  As black belts, are any of you still PAYING to attend your martial arts schools?

My current record was 2:34, but I wish to train so hard within these days left so that I can easily go faster than 2:30.      Any techniques for during the race, I'm real scared cus the people I'm racing are all the fastest people in year 9. Their times are ranging from 2:24 to 2:47 approx. Some of them keep the same pace througout the whole 800 meters, so they basically run it. Another person is a really fast short and long distance runner with extreme stamina, most of the usually pass the people at the front of the race during the final stretch.      I heard that people should go faster at the 2nd lap rather than the first, but sometimes idk why, but when once or twice I get tired, I loose the momentum rly fast and lack energy making it hard to pump my hands.      I'm not a really fast short- distant runner nowadays. Btw I'm a really fast breast stroke SWIMMER, idk if training breast stroke will help my 800 meters race.... Erghhh...I'm damn nervous.      Btw, how about training methods, what and how should I train most? Any workout routines that would quickly boost my ability in 800 meters? How about running stairs?      PLS HELP ME!

His whole story was about perseverance and not quitting and he barely had it. Now it just seems like Triple H will win it back at Wrestlemania and have it for another eight or nine months. What did you think?

20090204231335AAuKyzM	Sports;Wrestling	Trish stratus vs lita overall who was better?	ill give my opinion      I bieleve trish was better overall.      Explanation:   lita as we all know was miles ahead of trish when the two battles it out in the early days lita was practicly at her best in her early career. Then she broke her neck and things changed. trish had improved by a mile while lita was out of action lita came back after her neck injury and she was still a good wrestler and probably still ahead of trish but after nyr05 lita went downfall and trish was still improving rapidly as u can see lita in her late career was a terrible wrestler and did not do any high flying moves at all      concluion      lita>>>>>>>>>>>>>trish (early years)      Lita>=trish (mid years)      trish>>>>>>>>>>>lita (late years)

I am all for this and this is the right move. The AFL have also made a couple of other slight interpretation changes which I think is spot on the mark.      A few of you will groan because there have been a few more tweaks to the rules, but the 'spear tackle' interpretation changing and the harder stance on high contact make the game a HELL OF A LOT safer!!      I also totally agree with the AFL, giving the umpires the green light to refer abuse from any player straight to the tribunal.      It protects the umpire more, so we can get on with our job with the game and then we dont have to put up with d*ckheads who keep groaning about a missed free kick from 10 minutes ago.

Mike Antoni was basically ran out of Phoenix because his team do not play solid   defense, you had two to the best player come in and showed incredible offense at will.     Do you think Antoni or the Knicks should take a little more pride in their defense,      Do you think players will start coming in the MSG like a Dwayne Wade and just start to score at will? or will we see other teams best player scoring 50 plus points a game against the Knicks in their own crib.

20090205035430AAdx22y	Sports;Cricket	Anyone for some Cricket Jokes?	Anyone for some cricket jokes?   1: A friend asked George, "Tell me, is your daughter's fiancee a good catch?"   "Good catch?" answered George. "Dammit, he's the best fielder we've got in the side!"       2: In a local match, the umpire was being jeered and heckled unmercifully from the crowd. At length he walked over to the boundary and sat down next to his chief critic. "What are you doing?" asked the spectator. "Well," said the umpire,"it seems you get the best view from here."       3: The captain of a team says to the Umpire,    "My players want to know if there is a penalty for thinking."    The Umpire says, "No."    The captain says, "Well we think you're a dropkick, then."      4: The Devils challenged the Angels to a game of cricket.    "But we've got all the cricketers," said the Angels.    "Yes. But we've got all the umpires!" exclaimed The Devils.      5: During the match, the fieldsman positioned just behind the umpire kept trying to distract the batsman as the ball was bowled to him.    Several appeals for l.b.w were turned down, and finally the umpire turned to the fieldsman and said sternly: "I've been watching you for the last twenty minutes."   "I thought so," came the reply, "I could tell you weren't watching the game!"       6: It was the after-lunch session, and the next batsman in hadn't left the bar. When it was his turn to bat he confessed to the captain that he could see three of everything.   'Well,' said the captain, 'when you get out to the wicket just hit the middle ball'    The batsman made his way to the middle and was bowled first ball.    'What happened?' asked the captain. 'Did you play the wrong ball?'    'No, the wrong bowler!'      7: The bowlers were getting a lot of stick from the opposing opening pair. The captain decided a new player should have a bowl. He handed the ball to the young man with the advice, 'Keep the ball well up.'    'Don't worry,' was the chirpy reply. 'I know his weakness.'    He bowled four balls and everyone cleared the boundary.    'I see what you mean,' said the captain. 'He's got a weakness for sixes.'
20090205032921AAt1mEv	Sports;Auto Racing;Other - Auto Racing	I Know Who The Stig Is, But Do You Agree?	If you think about the stig is not the driver but the suit itself.   You hear the UK hosts say that they put the stig back in the box when its not racing round the track.   Does this sound reasonable or just a weird theory?      But then again not exactly knowing who wears the stig suit is half the fun and mystery of the stig itself. So in a way we have always known the stigs identity, a white suit.

20090205024250AAdnGxP	Sports;Running	This is my plan of winning the 800 meters race? Any opinions?	Well, with most of the ideas I found out, these are my personal thoughts:-      I have 5 steps, starting from the 1st part of the race to the last-      1.Go pretty fast at the start and stay behind the first person (Use the first person as a wind shield).      2. (The turn)- Cut in towards the lane that is nearest to the semi- circle of the field. Light sprint during the turn.      3. Continue following the 1st runner right next or behind, (use the first runner as a wind shield), Same steady running pace during the str8 run towards the 1st 400 meters, use this time to regenerate energy, run in long strides, keep body- hard as steel.      4. Run real speedy at the next 400 meters. (Overtake as many people as possible, perhaps exept the leader. Then at the last final 150 meters stretch (The final corner), explode it, passing the 1st person as fast as I possibly can (The guy in front would already be tiered out from the wind), don't think of anything but the gold medal and the honor & respect I'll gain after winning the race, then dash pass the finish line (Yellin' for more power).

Now that Keane has left Healy is starting for them and he even scored last night to put sunderland in the lead!       Is it me or just a coincidence because my theory is Keane only bought him so he couldn't play at his best for Northern Ireland by getting no club matches!

20090205055649AA04UuM	Sports;Cycling	Recommend Bicycle / Bike ￡800 - ￡1000?	Could you recommend a bike for me?       My price range is around ￡800-￡1000.       I'll be mainly riding on the road (approx 10 miles a day), however I would like to be able to take it off road during the weekends - nothing major just cycling on the heathlands / woodlands.       I would like Hydraulic Disc brakes, and front suspension which I can lock out would be an advantage.        Thanks for your help!       Michael
