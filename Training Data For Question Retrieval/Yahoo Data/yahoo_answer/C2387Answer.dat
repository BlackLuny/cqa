HCWkdk4naa	the MAT is verbal analogies, so it requires strong vocab skills.  the GRE has a persuasive essay writing section, math section, and a verbal section that is also largely vocabulary.  if you are good at 8th grade math and writing short persuasive essays, then the GRE will be a better bet.  if you fear math and don't want to write the essays, take the MAT.    The GRE has the advantage a being accepted almost anywhere, but fewer schools will take the MAT.    good luck with your nursing studies

I have a GED and believe me its not as hard as you think. I only completed 9th grade and didn't get my GED until i was 20 and had no problems. And im really bad at math I was in algebra for 3 years and didn't understand it and kept failing it no matter how hard i tried I just don't get math! but you only have to have a 450 to pass the test. oh yea i did not study for it or take any classes i just went in and took it. If i can pass it anyone can believe me
AA10176626	Zach:    This isn't meant to be mean or rude, but "good luck". We'd all like to go to college debt-free, but for the vast majority of students, that is not an option. Last year, the average bachelor's graduate left school with $21,000 in student debt.    You're complicating matters - you want to go to a pricey out-of-state school and pay 40-120% more than other students are paying for that same education. The bad news is that the financial aid system does not reward students who opt for more expensive colleges - your aid eligibility is pretty much the same whether you go to "El Cheapo College" down the block, or "Ritzy University" five states over. Remember - financial aid money is taxpayer money - and the taxpayers aren't really that anxious to actualize your dreams - we're just willing to help you get AN education.    I'm just laying this out for you, even though it's not what you want to hear, and I'm hoping that you'll put your disappointment aside, and realize that you're going to have give all of this a lot more thought.    Out of state schools - especially out-of-state public schools - are really the domain of the wealthy - people who can afford the much higher prices. I answer variations on this question several hundred times a year, and I always use a car analogy. I'd love to drive a Ferrari, but I can't afford it. There is no "financial aid" that exists to help me make my dream come true. I can't even borrow enough to drive a Ferrari, because my income wouldn't support the monthly payment on the loan. I have Honda money, and I drive a Honda. If you have Honda money, you should be seriously considering a Honda College.     I understand that you want to drive (attend) a "Ferrari College" and that you think there are all kinds of benefits to driving that Ferrari (and maybe there are), but if you can't afford it, you have to be realistic about your options.    The federal government is far and away the largest provider of financial aid to college students. They will not give you more money because you want to attend an out-of-state school. You will qualify for the same amount of federal financial aid if you go to UK as you would at UV or UM - so that's not going to help make your dream come true.    States offer financial aid, but almost every state I know of offers financial aid to its own residents as an incentive to "stay home". Florida  will give Florida residents money to attend a Florida school - New York with give New York residents money to attend one of their state schools. Michigan is not going to give a Kentucky resident money to come on up to Ann Arbor.    So you're left with two opportunities - money from the school itself, and scholarship funds. As you know, both of these sources are limited, and highly competitive. You mentioned your outstanding GPA and your good ACT score - your academics are extremely commendable. I'm not trying to throw cold water on your hopes for scholarships by pointing out that there are more than 16,000 high schools in the US - and that means there are more than 160,000 "Top 10" students graduating this year. A lot of those students have very high GPAs and good test scores. A lot of those students apply to the elite public universities like UV and UM.    To compete effectively for good scholarships, you will need more than just good grades and test scores - you will need "extras" that help you stand out from other outstanding students.     Have you been engaged in extracurriculars? Have you dedicated yourself to community service? Have you had a good job for a while now? Don't think about the scholarship competition like the moron's round of American Idol, where they get all these delusional people who can't hum, let alone sing. Think about the competition as you, a talented singer, and 3000 other very talented singers, too. What are you going to do to make yourself rise above those other talented scholarship applicants? And believe me, there are plenty of them.    Talk to your counselor. He/she has lots of information about scholarships, and they have experience with former students from your high school who did or did not get into your target schools. Sit down with mom and dad and talk about financial realities. You can't wish them away by what you hope for - you have to accept what mom and dad can afford to do for you. Sit down with yourself and think long and hard about how to justify (let alone pay for) an education that will cost you a lot more than your friends, and a lot more than almost everyone else in your college classroom.    The introduction to psychology class at UV is not 40% better than the class at UK. If you are determined to attend an out-of-state school, think about some less-elite school where your application will make you a big fish - there are plenty of high quality schools out there that don't cost as much, and that don't attract applications from thousands of other Top 10s, like you.    Good luck!|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	Notanyone is correct.    However, I want to point out that if your family is low income, there are private colleges where you may just get enough money. If you can get that ACT to 32 (or try the SATs) you would qualify for merit aid at many schools, and that combined with some need based aid may work well. You'll need to apply to college where you would be a top applicant.    Check out the website collegeconfidential.com which has lots of info on schools giving good merit aid.

If it's just that your voice is lost go prepared to have the students lead the class and you can facilitate a good discussion, debate.  Come up with a topic that they can debate/discuss - if this can not be applied to your subject have your lesson plans done via powerpoint, on an overhead projector, or on the board.|`|NirBfNfMaa	If you don't feel well, then by all means cancel.

I am so tired (or hungry, or whatever else) I need a snack and a nap in the library before my next class. I still have six hours to go. Pleaseeee."

AA10023710	If you are actually unable to teach - if you can't use that time in any positive way, despite your lack of voice - then you should cancel. I don't think you'd have much choice on that one. But if your students have an assignment due next class, make sure they know that 1) it's still due that day and 2) if they have any questions about it, they should contact you via email (or etc.)    But if you can use that class time in a positive way - make it a lab session or something - then I'd hold class.     But missing it for a genuine illness that would prevent you from teaching isn't frivolous.

The atomic number tells us how many   protons there is in a nucleus of an  element's atom.    so this element has 13 protons (this   element is Aluminium if we look at the   Periodic Table).        *Atoms are neutral. Protons have a charge  of plus 1 and electrons have a charge of  negative 1. In an atom they must balance out  so there'll be an equal number of electrons to  protons.    so this element has 13 electrons.        *The mass number is how heavy the atom  is in atomic mass units so it tell us how   many protons and neutrons there are. We  already know how many protons the atom has  so all we have to do is subtract the atomic   number from the mass number    so this element has 27- 13 = 14 neutrons.                      :D|`|RCoeyHLYaa	13 protons, 14 neutrons, 13 electrons, you dumb ****

Easy to get in and move to another place. However, demand is low because so easy to do. Most people just go to a 2 year school and try to find that. Wages, not very good. Probably bring home a 1000 at best most small private places each pay check.    Dental Assistant  Stable. Easy to get in and move to another place. Demand is very low. Considering don't need a degree. Some dentist just do on the job training.     Eye Doctor  IMO, stable, and profitable. Easy to get into, and not much required resource wise. Not a bad choose if you can put the resournces into it.    Massage Therapist  Probably the safest to do. Doesn't take long to get certified, and easily can find a job somewhere like a spa, hospital, cruise resort etc. Downside, unless you open your own spot, not highly profitable. But at the same time, not much cost to give a massage.    Between the two, I would go with eye doctor just based on stability and earning potential.|`|BXI2zWlmaa	Being an optometrist sounds like a great idea, so long as you are prepared for all the rigors of medical school.  If you don't have the time or money to become a doctor, you might want to think about becoming an optician.  Opticians make more money than dental assistants, and they work with optometrists to help people get glasses, contacts, eye medications, etc., and do eye exams.  There is always demand for opticians!
4KtPFzz5aa	Theme: Disorder    The feud is the subject of the very first words of the play. The Prologue says, "Two households, both alike in dignity, / In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, / From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, / Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean" (Prologue 1-4). The key word is "civil," and the phrase "civil blood" is a paradox. Citzens of a town ought to be civil; that is, they ought to show respect for one another and get along. But too often, they aren't. They engage in civil wars and shed "civil blood," which wouldn't happen if they were really civil.  http://www.clicknotes.com/romeo/Feud.htm...    Another key theme of the play is the tragic consequences of civil disorder. The opening scene clearly establishes the disorder in Verona by presenting the quarrel of the servants, who belong to the opposing houses of the Montagues and the Capulets.  Both of these deaths were indirectly caused by the civil disorder between the Montagues and Capulets. If Romeo and Juliet had been able to openly profess their love, they would not have become tragic heroes.  http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    Hatred:  In a prologue to Act I, an actor called the chorus recites a sonnet in which he describes the bitter hatred separating the Montagues and Capulets (residents of Verona, a city in northern Italy about 65 miles west of Venice and the Adriatic coast) and identifies Romeo and Juliet as lovers who had the misfortune to be born into warring families: From forth the fatal loins of these two foes [the Montagues and the Capulets] / A pair of star-crossd lovers take their life" (5-6).    So deep is the enmity between the two families that the friends of the Montagues and the friends of the Capulets are also enemies. In the first scene of Act I, two servants of the Capulets, Sampson and Gregory, encounter two servants of the Montagues, Abraham and Balthasar, on a street. Sampson places his thumb between his teeth, then flicks it forward at the Montague servants. This insulting gesture carries the same meaning as an upturned middle finger in modern America. Verbal insults follow and swords cross. Tybalt, a belligerent Capulet ally, lashes out at Benvolio, a friend of Romeo Montague, for attempting to make peace, saying: . . . Peace! I hate the word, / As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee" (1. 1. 52-53).   http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xRome...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Love and hate are usually thought of as opposites, but in Romeo and Juliet, love and hate are two sides of the same coin, as two children from warring families (the Capulets and the Montagues) turn their hatred of each other into an insatiable passion. Their families conflict constantly threatens to turn Romeo and Juliets love into hate. Ultimately, the hatred between their two families propels the lovers towards their tragic deaths.     "Wisely and slow  they stumble that run fast," a priest warns an impetuous young lover in Romeo and Juliet. But nobody spends much time pausing to think in Romeo and Juliet. Passionate love and passionate hatred propel the characters to immediate action which causes disorder. Fate may have a hand in the deaths of Romeo and Juliet  who both commit suicide rather than live without each other  but so does rashness, haste, and disorder.    From Shmoop/Romeo and Juliet
hgbfzGSMaa	I think your math teacher wants to impress upon you the importance of handing in your work on time.  It does seem a little more strict than what our school system does.  But, it's much better (from a parent's standpoint anyway) to find out right away, than to wait until it happens repeatedly.  It's much easier to nip it in the bud, than to try to deal with a problem that's been allowed to develop over a period of time.  Also, this will help ensure that your grades do not suffer.      I have often found out at mid-term that my son wasn't doing well or had failed to turn in papers.  I feel really let down that the school waited through weeks of it happening to let me know.  His grades suffered and we had to work really hard to get out of that hole.      Just turn it in on time from now on! :)  Good Luck!|`|AA11618168	Do your homework on time and this is a non-issue.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Don't be a victim-if your parents understand your side-its ok. Blow him off but realize that hes a tight fisted teacher and figure out how to deal with him. I do think hes overboard but if your stuck with him then you have to figure him out in order to get your grade-he has it, its yours and you need it. My daughter had a Biology teacher like that. two kids talked by her during a test-he said she did too, so he gave he a zero. First he judged her by the others-second, my daughter isn't a liar nor a bad student. She has had all A's (USA) since KINDERGARTEN! Shes in High School too- he's sent good students to saturday school and has lied to the parents. I don't like liars so I got her in another class this second half. She did have to deal with him till the end of first half though. All your life you will meett what I call "toads"-people can be weird and grumpy. In my opinion, teachers should help, not hinder. Some do. Good luck, but realize that sometimes you have to go around the hill or learn how to climb it.

The only way you can avoid it, is just always do your maths homework on time. Well at least your parents understand.|`|S1Q1mVgJaa	That is a bit odd that he did that after one missed assignment but not unheard of. The teacher is probably just feeling under-appreciated and is attempting to work a bit of his frustration out. This isn't to say your not at fault, but simply to explain his other wise slightly rash reaction.  High/Middle school teachers often do not get kind of gratitude they deserve, this makes some of them a bit bitter and unpleasant in the process is to thank him for his thoughtfulness and explain that you are concerned with your education and merely became overwhelmed with everything going on. It is also possible that your teacher is one of the few humans on earth that genuinely cares about a total stranger, in witch case you should drop to your knees and thank what ever higher power you believe in that you were able to meet one in person.  The best way to get on his good side (and gain a little leniency). I know it seams like a bit of trouble to go through just to be able to turn in an assignment a little late but its just as much for him as it is for you (he's a person, and should at least be shown a bit of kindness). But all of this could just be for nothing and he could have just been sending out letter out to every one who missed an assignment in the last week and it was just a spot of bad luck on your part, but that's life for ya.      p.s.

6NbFy1KPaa	Here's the deal....A GED qualifies you to gain admittance into college.  Now depending on how well you scored will dictate what colleges will consider you.  If you passed in the 300's you should probably look into community college entry.  Do well there and you can transfer into a senior college to pursue a bachelors degree.  If you didn't do so well but you're really interested in a trade look into the certificate programs offered through the community colleges.  Their training is much more thorough and respected by industry.    But whatever you decide, understand that when you passed your GED you basically provided yourself with a clean slate.  You can now pursue anything you want as long as you apply yourself.  If you have personal challenges and limitations, that's kool as long as you understand that now you have a new opportunity to maximize you full potential.  DO YOUR VERY BEST!  The world is waiting for you.    Congratulations and Good Luck

AA10369174	At the elementary level, Some teachers of  English Language group the 26 letters in the  alphabets into 2 groups. i.e, 5 vowels and 21 consonants. So, the letter 'H', though silent, is classified as a consonant.    But, as you go deeper into Phonics, you  discover that vowel sounds are pronounced with your mouth wide open while most consonant are pronounced with either  closed lips or with your tongue pressed against your hard palate or  against your teeth.    The Letter 'H' falls into this category, hence, it is described as a consonant sound.     Secondly, when you form a word, you would need at least a vowel to complete it. But you cannot form a word by combining consonant letters and letter 'H'.    I hope you are ok now.|`|qnL2JYihaa	Because when the 'h' is sounded, it is clearly a consonant.  When it is not sounded (like in 'hour') then it is still not a vowel.|`|cfx2fXGcaa	It literally is all to do with the greeks. That's why whenever you say ''an [something beginning with h]'' you use 'an' because although it's not a vowel, it is treated like one... kind of like the letter 'y'
KXXTAi5Daa	Look at it this way, did Gene have opportunity, capability and intent?    Gene obviously had the opportunity to shake the limb, he resisted, but this could seriously hurt your case.  Gene was in the same area as the tree.  He knew Finny was on a higher branch and he knew how to make him fall.    Gene had the capability to shake the limb, again, resisted.  Because he was at the truck of the tree, try to prove that the limb would have been too high for Gene to pull on.  If Gene is not able to reach the limb from where he was standing, then he would not have been able to make Finny fall.    Next you have to prove that Gene did not have the intent to hurt Finny.  Thought the thought may have crossed his mind, in the end, his conscience took over and he did the right thing.    Remember also, that the prosecution would have to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Your best way of proving reasonable doubt would be to point out that Gene was not high enough up the tree trunk to shake the branch,a nd that even outstretched, he still would not have been able to reach.    I have no idea if this is what you're looking for.  I'm just bored and thought I might help.

We really don't care that you don't want to do it; we know kids are lazy.  But if you aren't made to practice the skills you were supposed to learn, you won't actually learn anything.  Someday you'll be grateful you got a free education where the teachers actually cared enough to make sure you learned something.

One implication is that markets will always clear.

aGzh5e7Haa	Statistically, the tallest people in the world, as measured by country are the Dutch. The average height for all adults for the Netherlands is 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m). This great leap in height is a huge change for Holland, where about 100 years ago, 25% of men who attempted to join the army were rejected as being too short, less than 62 inches (1.57 m) tall.     There are taller people belonging to certain populations within countries. This is especially true of the Maasai people, who live in parts of Tanzania and Kenya. But as a whole, the citizens living in the Netherlands are on average, the tallest people. Even people who have immigrated to the Netherlands from other parts of the world are taller on average than their racial groups in their countries of origin.    Standing next to the Dutch, almost shoulder to shoulder, are the Danes. Average height in Denmark is 6 feet (1.83 m). Americans, who once were the tallest people, have fallen in stature and are on average about 5 feet, 10 inches (1.78 m).|`|UQYurvnYaa	yao ming|`|8ACdEaC5aa	yo momma|`|bmEOXy8Naa	Ukrainian Leonid Stadnik[=    its crazy!! =D|`|PlxxEvtVaa	Actually the tallest LIVING person (male) is Xi Shun.

79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	It's not an american thing, it's an Internet thing. An 'Internet troll' (or just 'troll' for short) is a person who goes onto Internet discussion boards such as Yahoo Answers, but rather than posting anything interesting, useful or productive, they go there for no other purpose than to post stupid, offensive, demeaning remarks in an effort to disrupt proper discussion and annoy the other users. For example, imagine the following hypothetical series of posts in a thread:    User 1: Can someone help me out here? I'm supposed to differentiate e^((x^2)/2) for an assignment, how do I go about it?  User 2: You have to use the chain rule. (x^2)/2=0.5x^2, the derivative of that is 0.5x, the derivative of e^x is just e^x, so you take (e^x)*0.5x or 0.5xe^x or (xe^x)/2 for your answer.  User 3: No, that's wrong. The derivative of x^2 is 2x, so the derivative of 0.5x^2 is just x, meaning that your answer is xe^x.  User 4: OMG LOL WUT A BUNCH OF NERDS I BET UR ALL GAY LMAO I HAD SEX WIF UR MOTHER LAS NITE    Can you guess which one would be the troll? If you said 'the fourth one', you're right! Trolls can often be seen accusing others of having homosexual tendencies, claiming to have had sexual intercourse with other people's female parents, boasting about their own intelligence (despite seldom possessing any) and sexual ability (despite seldom possessing any of that either), accusing people of being 'nerds' as if it's an insult or something, claiming to be 'more popular at school' than other people, talking about how 'the Internet doesn't really matter' and how everyone else needs to 'get a life' and so on. They have no concept of fair play under any circumstances, and will use any power within their reach in a pathetic attempt to assert primitive, ape-like, alpha male dominance over other Internet users. You can read more about trolls here:  http://www.flayme.com/troll/|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	The definition has gotten vague with time and overuse, but it originated in usenet newsgroups.  They were the earliest type of online forum and they worked like an e-mail thread.  Each new response to a message was attached to the previous message and carried the same subject line with "RE:" in front of it.  A troll is someone who posts a hateful or inflammatory message just to get a lot of responses, causing the offending subject line to be repeated every time.  Experienced users know better than to fall for this, but there are always newbies who try to argue with trolls, unwittingly causing the original message to be repeated every time.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Go on - Search for questions on yahoo - and type in your question.

The second sentence is correct because the "it" is inspiring you to want to dance.

CICCXKeRaa	Yes, I've have times where I have felt like that. When I was in high school I was so preoccupied by what I couldn't do (fit in), what I didn't have (what I thought everybody else had) and was so caught up in my poor me attitude that I didn't give much energy to my studies. I failed classes in subjects that I knew much more in, I ignored what teachers had to say to me and allowed myself to get so depressed, all under the guise that I would figure out some way to get people to think that I was cool and would somehow, someday just fit in. The biggest thing I would change is I would play sports, I wouldn't let my fears of what people thought of me get in the way of me doing the one thing that I genuinely loved to do and wanted with all my heart to do.

On the form, I had to put down 6 subjects I wanted to choose, in case there wasn't enough places.    Double science in my school is the same as single, but with mods 3&4 in addition. Triple is the same as single, mods 3&4, and mods 5&6, only put together into one subject. Triple science may require for you to drop ONE options. Only take Triple science if you got higher than a 6b in KS3 because it is rather challenging, and I got a 7c.    I hope this all makes sense to you, cos it doesn't really to me! :L|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	Individual schools decide how many GCSE's you can take so ask your school.|`|Tq98g20raa	triple only counts as 1 and in our school double is compulsory im doing french math english language and literature triple science gcse pe geography and history and music as an extra|`|vl0HWTDJaa	There's no legal limit, it just depends on the school. You could technically do any number of extra ones outside of school if you wanted. I think you need to ask your tutor about science because again it sounds like it might depend on the school. At my school, for instance, it was assumed that most people would do double but people who weren't very academic did single instead and choosing triple counted as one option. It does seem a bit strange that you'd only get one real option if you do triple science.|`|SvBueAVFaa	i wouldnt think it'd count towards your three options.  well; it doesnt at my school.|`|o2Ak4Uw2aa	I'm not sure, I am in the M A T group, which means I also have the opportunity to do more GCSE's than other students.

For example, at my school, I had to take a gnvq in ICT which was the equivalent to 4 GCSE's, but had less choices. It meant that I only studied 9 subjects, but came out with 12 gcse's    If your sciences are not compulsory, they will count towards your 3 options.|`|kSYtcENRaa	the question is not how many can you take, its how many should be taken.    the more GCSE's you do. the less time you will spend on the others, the increased risk of you failing (D-G)     some GCSE's are equivalent to 2, such as business studies.

After that, you can choose about 4 other subjects (music, geography, history) - but it may depend on the school - for example, in my school, we are forced to choose at least one language as a subject. It is usually 11 GCSEs in Yr10 and 11, but if you do any GCSEs earlier, they don't count towards that limit.  As far as I know (as there are different examining boards), there are only 3 modules for each science - you're supposed to take triple science (you do all three) but if that is too difficult for you, you are entered for double science (you won't be able to get A*, but it is easier to get something like a B).

Normally you don't calculate highest common factors with variables.  But even if c is a variable, the product of 4 and c will still be divisible by all of the factors of 4.    The factors of 4 are: 1, 2, and 4.      So depending on what the other number is, your answer could be 4 if the second number is divisible by 4 (ex. if the other number is 8)    Your answer could be 2 if the other number is divisible by 2, but not by 4 (ex. if the other number is 6)    Your answer could be 1 if the second number is not divisible by 2 or 4 (ex. if the other number is 7)|`|32ac678fb32061f1ae71fda812cb7afdaa	no idea but u can try websites like homework help where they have questions asked like that and other people may be able to help

dPULl5hjaa	he rhombicuboctahedron, or small rhombicuboctahedron, is an Archimedean solid with eight triangular and eighteen square faces. There are 24 identical vertices, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each. Note that six of the squares only share vertices with the triangles while the other twelve share an edge. The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry, like the cube and octahedron. Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, although its faces are not really true trapezoids.    The name rhombicuboctahedron refers to the fact that 12 of the square faces lie in the same planes as the 12 faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which is dual to the cuboctahedron. Great rhombicuboctahedron is an alternative name for a truncated cuboctahedron, whose faces are parallel to those of the (small) rhombicuboctahedron.    It can also be called a cantellated cube or a cantellated octahedron from truncation operations of the uniform polyhedron.
mhFpZT3laa	I think the biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:  1) Community Service  2) Medically related volunteering/work  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)    Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.    1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.    2) A moderately well known school.  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.    3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.    4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.    5)If you want to get into academic medicine, I strongly recommend some form of teaching or tutoring.  Showing that you have an interest in teaching and academia is best done through these sort of activities. They are also very likely to give you some excellent talking points about being a life long learner. Overall, teaching is just a great extra curricular, and it will probably help you relate to interviewers (many who are academic physicians).|`|1222934eb4a1550f62a11a8f057ae622aa	Dina if your going to be a doctor you need to do your own research

gb9REJN4aa	That kind of word is called an acronym.|`|dPULl5hjaa	A mnemonic device (pronounced "neh-mon-ik") is a memory aid. Commonly met mnemonics are often verbal, something such as a very short poem or a special word used to help a person remember something, particularly lists, but may be visual, kinesthetic or auditory. Mnemonics rely on associations between easy-to-remember constructs which can be related back to the data that is to be remembered. This is based on the principle that the human mind much more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, sexual or humorous or otherwise meaningful information than arbitrary sequences.    The word mnemonic is derived from the Ancient Greek word ?? mnemonikos ("of memory") and is related to Mnemosyne ("remembrance"), the name of the goddess of memory in Greek mythology. Both of these words refer back to  mnema ("remembrance").[1] Mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the Art of Memory.    The major assumption in antiquity was that there are two sorts of memory: the "natural" memory and the "artificial" memory. The former is inborn, and is the one that everyone uses every day. The artificial memory is one that is trained through learning and practicing a variety of mnemonic techniques. The latter can be used to perform feats of memory that are quite extraordinary, impossible to carry out using the natural memory alone.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	If the result is a word itself, like, say, "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard), that is an acronym.

lzEuuseJaa	Go back to school. Try to get back into the school you were at, unless there was a really big scene or bad problems, you probably can. (I would imagine your parents are still obligated by contract for the rest of the year's tuition even if you drop out.)     If you dropped out on principle, rethink it. Who wins if your life is screwed up?  Not you! If you can't re-enroll at your last school, go to public school, or if you're academic and there is a program available for bright high school students, enroll at a community college. Take the GED as a last resort and only if you're planning to enroll in community college when you turn 18, or at least an alternative school / work program now. (The GED might be harder than you think, so be sure to read up on it.)    If you're in the US, I don't think you can legally decide to drop out in most states before 18 now. Did your parents give their permission?    You did not think through your decision as well as you should have or you would have had a plan, you are obviously a smart kid. That's OK, you're young. But you need to fix this right away before you become complacent and screw up your life. Once you're out of school for awhile, it's hard to mentally get back into it.     Where I live (LA), DJing is a great job with high pay -- but extremely competitive and there seems to be just a few favorites. (I've hired djs for parties and private school dances.) Much of the work is earned through word of mouth and knowing the right people and being a great sales person. It really doesn't seem to be something one can just step into and make enough money.     There are a zillion great artists out there, and once again, self-promotion is often the key to success above actual talent. That's tough at 17. Give yourself time, go to college, let your talent mature.    Give yourself the best chance at succeeding. You deserve more than a minimum wage job, and you'll need a college education to get that. Even jobs that really shouldn't require college now do because there are plenty of college grads applying for those jobs and they'll get upper hand.     You need to fix your situation quickly. You're smart enough to know that a bad decision made at 17 shouldn't be the foundation for your future.    Good luck!|`|PcSxOrcvaa	Go get your GED!

oaSKF7Vmaa	for the first question , i would say that stories aren't just stories. they can hold important lessons and history that we can learn from in them. they teach us how to use our imaginations as well as understand reality. also , depending on the story, it can help you cope with a problem or an event that had just occurred, they can show you how bad things can happen to anyone , or that no matter what you'll have someone there to love you.   And for the second answer , im not quite sure because i have never read the play or  book , so i cant really help you with that. but i hope i helped you otherwise|`|K4UmeHyQaa	hahaha x  Lol i dd that life is never palnned and that stories always follow the same structure =) x    teehee

xKcphGWIaa	1. A WAN is generally slow. If we compare that to a LAN, we said that Ethernet could run up to 1000 Mbs, currently, certainly in South Africa, the fastest WAN is 155 Mbs, so you can see in a LAN we can talk up to 1000 Mbs whereas in a WAN, at the moment, currently, today in South Africa, we can only take, literally a 10th of the speed.    2. WAN's are expensive. If we look at the path of telecommunications, we need to connect two offices, one in Pretoria and one in Johannesburg together - it 's an expensive operation even for a slow line.    One of the differences between a WAN (Wide Area Network) and a LAN (Local Area Network) is the set-up cost. WAN generally are to connect remote offices and when we talk about remote offices we generally refer to the remote offices as those that are outside the campus. For example, if we have an office in Pretoria and we have an office in Cape Town, these are remote offices. There is no chance that we can connect the LAN between Cape Town and Pretoria. In a LAN we connect local offices whereas in a WAN we can connect remote offices.|`|QtJ0cKjGaa	1) WAN is for an organization; LAN is for a home or to connect a couple of computers:    2) WAN is more faster and quite secure than LAN|`|pWA3gybAaa	what they are totally different, one is regional the other is inside a building      Wide Area Network hooks up cities    Local Area Network hooks up people in building|`|QO6Abf0iaa	WAN,he's faster|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Which one gets me on the Internet... WAN.  That one wins.  Everytime.    The factors that I put into play when I decided on my network choice (FiOS) were:  1) Upload speed.  Any Yahoo can download fast, what's important is your Upload speed.  2) Download speed.  3) Shared or unique connection.  4) Price.  5) Availability.    I've been on dial-ups, DSLs, cable, satellite and ISDNs.  Nothing beats fiber optics.      Yet.
AA11942204	No, you could take introductory courses in psychology and religion without any other preparation.|`|FhyYpuiUaa	This question makes no sense to me?     If you are already in college, you shouldn't have to have to be in a certain degree program to take other courses (unless the course is restricted to only those in the degree program).     If you want to study psychology and religion, do a double major.  Or, major in one and minor in the other.

That is to say they will provide for you when you are older - the more you have the better off you'll be, or at least the more chance there is that they will survive to adulthood.

Have 1 that is your biological child and adopt the rest.  If I had the money and room I would adopt like 10 kids.|`|d4XNA63xaa	I believe the following is a very important factor. Women in LEDC's need to be more educated. They need to be taught about contraception and helped with family planning. This means women will be more literate and this will raise their aspirations. Therefore, women will be more likely to want to carry out a career and will no longer be able to have a large number of children. Also, if medical care improves this will lower infant mortality meaning families have less children as they believe they have to have a lot of children in order to have at least one that survives. (:

Grow up.|`|nG9nxMySaa	staying at community college for a full two years (60 credits usually) is a really good idea if money is a concern. the difference between community college courses and the first two years at university is pretty small. you will save a lot of money and if your grades are good, you will be able to get in to the school of your choice. check out some of the schools you are interested in and find out what credits will transfer. that way you wont waste your time taking classes that wont count for anything.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Well if its just a money issue, you should just transfer. I learned that community college and a larger university are not much different in price at all.|`|556n6Neoaa	depends what your lkooking for. are you paying any or all? is so- community for sure. if not, the you could jump to university. are you going to live on campus if you go to university? if so, then go right away. you can acclimate and it would be a better transition. if your staying at home, then do community college.|`|k0ROELduaa	Have you at least decided what university you would like to attend? Getting your general ed classes out of the way at a community college is a fantastic idea and can save you a lot of money. But I would suggest talking with an advisor (at either your current school or the school you wish to attend). They can tell you which of your credits will transfer and apply toward your degree once you get to the university.    I am a student at MU and I have definitely learned that it is better to be safe than sorry. I have made the mistake of taking summer classes at a community college and then finding out after I returned to the University in the fall, that there were better classes to take that would have worked for my degree (now I just have 6 extra hours of electives that wont do me much good).    An advisor can help you fill out a graduation plan and decide if it would be in your best interest to stay where you are or go ahead and transfer.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Need more info.  If you have a financial limitation the knock out as many credits as you can at the CC and transfer.  Make sure to check with any schools you are planning on transferring to and cofirm their credit transfer policy.

AA12272744	An A in regular US history is better. It's definitely better for your GPA, which counts a LOT more than the   of AP classes you take. Don't take hard classes just because the name of the class "looks good" on your transcript. What matters is the grade. And if the harder version of the class is hurting you, I would recommend taking the easier class.    It's kind of like with recommendations. Which looks better for law school: A stellar recommendation from your professor, or an average recommendation from a judge you interned for? Even though it was a "judge" who wrote your recommendation, which a law school would find impressive, the recommendation is not going to help you that much because the judge who wrote it only gave you an average recommendation. But if you have a great recommendation from a professor, even though he's not in the legal field, it looks great for you because the person who wrote your rec knows you're a hard worker and wrote good things about you.    So anyway, about the AP class, I would probably transfer out. But it's up to you-- if you work harder and study with friends, you could definitely get an A.    I hope that helps!

mFf8CqAraa	You're absolutely right and "hand over hand" is actually how it originated.    The original expression was hand over hand, which was chiefly nautical and referred literally to rope work: climbing a rope, or pulling something in with a rope, would be "climbing it hand over hand," that is, with each hand brought over the other.    The form hand over fist, instead of the original hand over hand, is an obvious and natural variant (close your hand around a rope and you do, indeed, make a fist).     As to WHEN these terms appeared: The literal use of hand over hand is recorded in English by the middle of the eighteenth century. The figurative use, and the hand over fist form (in all senses), appear by the early nineteenth century.     The 'making money hand over fist' figurative use is a clear allusion to grabbing handfuls of money and pocketing it. This is later, but not much later, in Seba Smith's The life and writings of Major Jack Downing, 1833:    "They... clawed the money off of his table, hand over fist."      I've listed a site for information on the origin, but you've clearly got it pegged. =) Good thinking!|`|RmKBeVjOaa	Most likely a naval term, the hauling of a rope is done "hand over fist". Originally indicated slow steady progress, as in bringing two ships together via ropes, but has taken on an insinuation of great speed, when used referring to the making or spending money.

Some very strict schools may have sign-in requirements -- you have to sign out and state where you are going, and then sign in when you return, but 99.99% of the schools recognize that, at 18, you are an adult and are responsible for yourself.    If you don't have a car, learn to love your bicycle, or memorize the bus system routes. Or make friends with someone who has a car :-)  Taxies are sometimes available in larger metropolitan areas, but they can be very expensive. In New York, Chicago, Washington, DC and Boston, you also have the subway/transit system.

1khVEE6oaa	It's an analogy.  She relies on her computer like a chef relies on his oven.  It's a comparison to show a similarity in how she uses and relies on her computer.    It's not a metaphor because she didn't say something like, "all men are pigs".      An idiom is a phrase that people use to convey meaning, but that, when it is broken down into elements or words that are viewed individually, it makes no sense.  For example, if I found myself in a difficult situation, I might say, "I am in a pickle" and you would know I meant a difficult situation, but if you just look at the phrase it seems ridiculous because I am not ACTUALLY in a pickle.  Either way, it is NOT an idiom.    It's not a simile because she doesn't say her computer is like another object.      She's describing her relationship with her computer by comparing it to the relationship between a chef and his oven.  That's why it's an analogy.      BY THE WAY, THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION!   Things are not both similes and metaphors.  There are different terms because the words have different definitions.  And no, a simile is not a form of a metaphor; although they are both forms of comparison.  As are analogies, which is the correct answer.  An analogy always has the format:  ______ is to ________ as ________ is to ________.  The word "as" sometimes throws people off making them mistake analogies for similes, but because analogies compare relationships and similes compare two unlike things that share some common characteristic they are different!|`|MuN1xzlnaa	If it we're me, I would choose Analogy.|`|Td8rp1sEaa	I think it is a metaphor and an analogy.|`|uzYHWdgPaa	Its an analogy and a simile.  simile because its using as, and a simile uses like or as in its comparison.

nSMizwOqaa	All of my financial aid is based off the estimated cost for the semester. It first goes to paying the bills from the university, and after that I get the rest of the money. From that money I use it to pay the house bill for my fraternity. So yes, financial aid does pay for you housing.|`|AA11556445	In a nutshell: Textbooks, yes; Beer, no.     The world of financial aid can be confusing. Many students miss out on serious opportunities to reduce the expense of college because they are not sure how to find financial aid or what expenses might be covered by it.     Cost of Attendance     Federal financial aid is calculated based on a few different areas of expense: tuition, room and board (or equivalent cost of living for students living off campus), books and other academic expenses, such as a personal computer, and transportation. These factors, added together, represent the total cost of a student's college attendance. If you have a dependent, or a disability with related costs, or if you will be studying abroad, these also come under consideration when financial aid is calculated. Collectively, this is known as the Cost of Attendance (COA).     Financial need is determined by the COA, minus the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), which is determined by a set formula applied to the information on your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Each college uses this information to come up with a financial aid package. Some colleges are able to provide more aid than others; a few colleges meet all of a student's demonstrated financial need. The difference may be made up with loans and third-party scholarships    Edit:    Link:  http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/does...

1khVEE6oaa	Power plants work pretty much the same way, by using heat from a reaction to boil water (in the boiler), so that it turns to steam, turns a turbine using the movement of the steam, which is connected to a generator that makes the electricity.  The transformer takes the energy from the generator and sends it in the electrical wires to the cities where people can use it.  The cooling tower turns the steam back into water so that it can be reused by the power plant instead of escaping into the atmosphere.    This is how nuclear, solar, and coal power plants work.  The only difference is the source of heat!|`|06da0acef0ef561a9e28c4c4aee9904faa	boiler boils water to steam    steam drives the turbine    turbine turns the generator to make electricity    transformer changes the voltage to a much higher voltage to pass through the national grid/power lines    cooling tower turns the steam back to water to avoid putting large amounts of boiling hot steam straight into the atmosphere|`|rSyxRklVaa	A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser; this is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different fuel sources. Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy.    Almost all coal, nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal electric, and waste incineration plants, as well as many natural gas power plants are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. The waste heat from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam, in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency.    Such power stations are most usually constructed on a very large scale and designed for continuous operation.

OWfdLgyRaa	GCSEs don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things, so choose what you enjoy; it's your A-Levels which count mostly, though, obviously, it does help if you have studied a subject at GCSE level should you go on to take that subject at A-Level.    I don't know what the other subjects involve as I haven't taken them, but GCSE Business Studies will be helpful if you want to be a financial adviser as you can learn more about the business background and it does involve a fair bit of maths (though not a lot). You get to learn about marketing, methods of production, different types of businesses e.g. franchise, PLC, LTD, partnership, factors to consider when making business decisions, external influences, different types of stakeholders, business objectives.....etc. For more about what to expect, click on the following link and scroll down to 'Subject Content':    http://store.aqa.org.uk/qual/pdf/AQA-313...    You definitely have 2 exams to do, if you're with AQA, maybe 3 if your school opts to do a 3rd exam instead of coursework, which is about setting up your own business (not literally), choosing a location, reasons for that location, deciding on pricing strategies, ways of marketing and then an evaluation.    GCSE Psychology is very interesting and quite boring at the same time because you study experiments carried out in different areas of psychology, but you have to memorise all these studies for the exams. If the exam board is OCR, there is:     -social psychology (social influence, which is: conformity & obedience, and environment and behaviour, which is personal space and territory)  -bio-psychology (Stress, sex and gender)    -developmental psychology (Attachment & Child Development)  -cognitive psychology (memory & perception)  -Behavioural psychology (Phobias & aggression)  -Individual differences (intelligence and prejudice)    You also cover methodology and ethics of experiments as well as doing coursework (worth 20%) in the form of planning and conducting your own experiment concerning 1 area of psychology that you've studied. There are 2 exams at the end of the course, which are both 1 hour and 15 minutes each and this combined is worth 80% of your final grade.    Psychology might help a tiny bit if you want to be a lawyer, as you sometimes have to question the validity to witnesses' version of events in a crime, but for law, the most important thing is to get a good grade at GCSE English Language and Literature (and maths) as this is the most basic stepping stone for progressing onto A-Levels and subsequently, university courses.    GCSE History would probably help more than psychology because it is an essay subject and it would be beneficial if you went on to do A-Level history, as a good grade in this will demonstrate to universities that you have good communication skills, can construct a logical and coherent argument and that you have well-developed analytical skills, all of which are important to have to study any law course.    Sorry that I haven't really given a balanced view, but I hope that helps in some way.|`|Mmvm5pQOaa	Well i took history at GCSE's and its really good the course is intresting and, but it is a lot of writing...very good choice  (defo for a career in law)    I did busines as well i found it boring but never had the concentration and messed about alot got a C in the end might enjoy it if you have a passion for it    As for Phycholology i do it now for A level and it is VERY good brilliant out of the three a-levels i took it is the best i think it would probably be as intreseting at GCSE and alot easier so you cant lose =P      Peace Out|`|Lq4WIshiaa	Majoring in psychology is only good if you plan to continue your education with a graduate program of some sort; either a Master's program in couseling, family therapy or school psychology; or if you plan to pursue your doctorate in clinical psychology earning a PhD. Both a Master's and Doctoral programs require an enormous outlay of time and money, with the later costing more, since it is the longer and tougher program. Since I've no clue as to if you even want to persue one of these options, I won't now go into detail as to what you need to do to get into one of them.For now, though, know that you can do very little with only a degree in psych., and earn very little money as well.|`|nq9ZSHXraa	Hmm probably history or psychology
bf22c95447f9e45803ffe5391acb44a8aa	A levels are put into 4 groups by universities. Group 1: all science subjects, which include maths, psychology & sports. Group 2: English subjects, including history, geography etc Group 3: Main bulk of A levels. Group 4: general studies, critical thinking, media and some business/travel courses.    Universities look at the difficulty of subjects you are doing when making you an offer, that's why you might see the course requirements are for example 260-320 points. To receive an offer of 260 points you would probably need at least 1 Group 1 subject in your a levels, where someone else with all group 3 or 4 subjects would be asked for 320 points.    I would select psychology over geography, however you already have selected a good solid mix so really its personal preference on that one. GL|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	My son is currently taking his A levels.  He is taking Maths, Biology, Chemistry and an enforced subject of general Studies which he is ignoring in order to spend more time on Maths!    The sciences are where the future is.  Forget the bloody stupid media studies BS!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	A Levels are just points to get in to Uni.     Do easy A levels and you'll get higher grades so you'll get more Ucas points.    Uni only asks for Maths, English and sometimes science in GCSE.   (C or above)    Also, Depends on what you want to do after.     I do psychology. Its alot to remember but its ok :)    By the way... It's silly doing ALL difficult subjects because you'll loose intrest and not get very good grades.|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	it depends what you like: this is what i'm taking  - Law, English Lit, English Lang and Photography|`|vJ6GI7oIaa	Depends on what you want to do. Universities will love Spanish - few do a language. I'm doing maths and chemistry, and I'm finding maths quite easy. My teacher isn't great for chemistry, but it's supposed to be one of the most difficult ones, and I'm finding it quite difficult. It's about getting the vocab right, on top of having to know absolutely everything in detail.  One of the most common A Levels is psychology, and I can tell you it's useless. People think it'll take them to psychiatry, but you study medicine at uni for that. It's a soft subject that a lot of people take because it's "interesting" and "easy" - it's useless. So, it's better to take geography, although it's not regarded as a great A Level. Why not do something like biology to compliment the chemistry? Originally I was going to do English Language, biology, maths and economics, but was told not to because there's not much point doing different ones and only one science. So think about what you want to do in life, and pick your A Levels accordingly. But I can assure you psychology is a waste of time! A lot of my friends regret doing it.|`|AA11678263	Hi Rosie,    You should try to choose things that will demonstrate the skills you need for your desired university course/career path.  That can be wider than you think!  It's a good idea to choose things you like as you will do better if you are interested.  Don't be tempted to choose "easy" subjects, as universities/employers will recognise this, and also the lack of similarity between that and your desired path.    I studied Psychology at uni, and to get there I chose Sociology, English Lit, History, and IT (my school didn't offer Psychology A-Level).  I said IT was important as it equipped me to design programmes for research, and use statistical software, Sociology and History helped me to understand people and where they'd come from/what they'd lived through, and English was important for report writing.  If you can validate your choices like that, you're well on your way.    Choose things you enjoy.  Maths and Chemistry will be well respected, and having a second language is a good way to prove yourself well-rounded, plus a great skill to have in life!  Psychology was amazing at degree level, so I imagine the A-Level would be fascinating.|`|20DkFIQ7aa	eeek they sound like tough subjects.  I agree with the answer above, they are just points to get into Uni.  If you have the ability to ace all these subjects then go for it!  Or at least take four to make life a little easier.    If you know what you want to do at uni, for example maths, then make sure you have maths, but then pick subjects you know you will do well in, so you get the points for Uni (an A in communication studies will be considered better than a C in geography for example).  I took maths and it is pretty tough! I got an A for GCSE and am hoping to get a B for A level, but not without lots of work!  I also took drama, which is like my easy subject where i can chill out and know i am garunteed an A! lol  Also, if you are looking to do well for Uni, make sure you get pleanty of work experience in, as that will look very good on your application.    Best of luck|`|85cf419cd1e3f93a6041239a56a0e3a5aa	choose the ones that intrest you, or if u know wat u wanna do in uni something related to that.  i say spanish maths psycology|`|uIXpjxTpaa	I've taken Chemistry and Psychology however i only carried on with psychology into A2.  Chemistry i used to really love, it became one of the things i hated most, the simplest way to explain the course is by saying its all memory work, you just have to remember scientific terms and structures etc and in the exam just transfer it onto the paper. The exam boards of chemistry are very picky about the words us, u have to use specific words if you are to get the mark for that question. An upside to chemistry is the coursework in AS we did a titration it was a lot of fun so if you enjoy that sort of thing chemistry is perfect for you.    Psychology on the other hand is similar with the memory work but it involves essays and lots of studies. They actually changed the syllabus this year an made it slightly easier. It all about knowing your terminology then being able to apply it to one of the studies learn with evidence. I find very interesting even though A2 is much harder it is very interesting and i would go as far as saying it allows you to see the world through different eyes.    Hope this helps :)|`|xcYwzoYbaa	choose want you want and likebut also things that are relevant to your future career path. i am choosing politics, philosophy, history and either eng lit/lang|`|OWfdLgyRaa	It depends what university course you want to take. That seems like a good combination, which keeps your options open as you have a language(which is highly regarded), a science, maths (which is always useful for any university course and highly respected), a humanity and a social science.    I'm being a bit hypocritical here, as psychology is one the A-Level subjects I'm going to take (currently doing GCSE Psychology), but it is seen as a soft subject by universities as it doesn't test your understanding, it just requires you have to have a good memory so that you can regurgitate everything you've memorized for the exam.      What are you thinking of doing at university? If you want to do veterinary science or anything medicine-related e.g. psychiatry, then they'll require you to have 2 A-Level sciences (mainly biology and chemistry), in which case, it'd probably be best to replace either psychology/geography. It ultimately depends on what you most enjoy, but if you have a career in mind, then have a look at the universities you're thinking of applying to and see what the entry requirements are for that particular course.|`|JX2Kmgr1aa	You might want to have a look at the Which A-Levels guide to picking A-Levels as it has guidance about what different A-Levels are good for:    http://www.whichalevels.org/picking-a-le...

The GIBRS toothpaste advertisement used a male voice over because they felt it would make the audience feel like they could trust it.  They used an attractive woman to demonstrate the product because most people are naturally attracted to beautiful people, and they are more likely to pay attention to what an attractive woman is saying and doing.  Most advertisements use celebrities to endorse products because they will appeal to a wider audience, and increase sales.

siQhjTkkaa	Hello  To check out subject choices for a Psychology degree, have a look at http://www.connexions-direct.com/jobs4u/  - add psychology to the search box for an overview of this professional area.  Select the further details link for information on entry routes and contact details for professional bodies.  Often subjects are not specified at A level although sometimes a science A level may be required; applicants should be numerate and capable of handling scientific concepts.    If you are hope to become a professional psychologist in education, industry or a clinical setting, for example, you need to make sure that your degree is accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS) for the Graduate Basis for Registration (GBR).  If a course has not been accedited for GBR, then the graduate must complete either a conversion course or BPSs qualifying examination to be eligible for BPS-accredited postgraduate training.  Have a look at the BPS website at http://www.bps.org.uk/ for more detail on routes into psychology.    To find out about entry requirements for specific courses, see the UCAS website: http://ucas.com/students/coursesearch/.   Select psychology, either as a single subject or as a combined option, for the course list.   Click on any university of interest for more details, including entry requirements (often these are general entry requirements, but sometimes they will be course specific).  If you still have queries, contact the university admissions office for clarification.

However most the top uni's require 3 academic subjects. ie, History or English.    When it comes to joint course i know that Nottingham offers a ' Pyschology and Cognitive Neuroscience' course but for this you must have a science, but most uni's have their own combinations you can do, but you have to find out throught the uni rather then UCAS.  Hope this answers your question :)  sorry for its length tho.
ykeDRhjeaa	chic -> that's your "chick" most prolly means.. that's your girl.. or there's your girl coming.    also chic =    a classy, sophisticated manner, much like audrey hepburn. it is classy, glamorous, without being a pushover, and without being flashy. its an element of class.     but i;m guessn.. thats your chick = that;s your girl?    hope it helps|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Chic (pronounced "sheek") means fashionable, but that doesn't seem to fit the way they used it in a sentence.

LwywrSRkaa	Do triple award science if you can I do it myself and I love it! They are good options, do well in your maths and English as well. What really matters is your A-levels and so far you have a good combination of GCSE's. Try get A/B's in all subjects and a pass in everything else! If you can do peer mentoring at school then do so, they look for skills like that. Oh btw my friends do GCSE history and you learn a great deal about medicine so you might want to consider that... It's true you don't really need stuff like health and social care that is more if you want to be a midwife.|`|QMAqzpKEaa	Well you definitely need Sciences and you are studying those by law. Maths and English are necessary, which will also be compulsory subjects to you in the UK. Childcare is a wise option, as you will come across children as a doctor and ICT is great as it is necessary to keep up with technology and to show that you are computer literate for most jobs now.   If you like History then why not? How about a language, such as Spanish? You may wish to travel in the future and youmay come across patients who speak it. That is just a suggestion  I think the choices that you are making are great. Don't worry. Just work really hard.  If you want to study medicine in University then you should work extra hard at Biology, Chemistry and Maths and pick them at AS Level.  Then you can apply for Medicine through UCAS and look at where the best degrees are offered in the UK. Just take things one step at a time.|`|AA12061823	Triple Science would be better... is childcare the same as Health and Social Care??|`|35TBlt0caa	they're good...all the ones you need to be a doctor are essential anyway, so don't worry :)...it's the a-level options you'll have to start thinking about      good luck with your gcses :)|`|e5ZaMxigaa	please don't take child care or any double award, i did health and social care as i wanted to become a learning disability's helper, and its rubbish, its honestly a waste of time, and wont help you at all, its just a big doss also are you set on being a doctor ? you really just need sciences and no option subject so just be broad with your options, just in case, my opinions have completely changed since year 9 and you might find that as well|`|1iOsKZvIaa	I'd say:  A Language - it always helps!  Health + Social Care - if your school does it.  =]  And whatever else you want to do!|`|hQi8CsHPaa	Ok, firstly, it totally depends where you want to study. I can promise you this though; medicine is one of the most competitive courses, alongside Dentistry, Economics and Law - so you have to remember that you are fighting for a place against people who go to public ad private school :).    Secondly, don't listen to people who say that your GCSEs don't count. Initially, the don't But for competitive courses, your A in GCSE French could be the difference between yourself getting a place for medicine or the girl who was sat next to you in the interview room.     For medicine you ideally need Triple award science -- this looks better on your application. Next you need more academic subjects. Childcare and ICT are NOT academic, and for a lot of institutions it could result in an automatic 'unsuccessful'. Although your history is a fantastic choice. You will need your English Language/Literature and maths for whatever course you choose though. A foreign language looks amazing on your application, so choose one of these if it is possible, (plus, languages are an easy A at GCSE standard :D) then just choose courses which you enjoy but prove you to be intelligent; Geography, history, religion, modern languages and other 'traditional' subjects are all good ideas.

It's true we don't know what we've got until its gone,  but we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.    Love is the shortest distance between hearts.    Life and love are like hide and seek.   People spend their whole lives looking for love,   but when they finally forget to look for it, they find it.    See there's this place in me where your fingerprints still rest,   your kisses still linger, and your whispers softly echo.   It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me.    The bad things in life open your eyes to the good  things you weren't paying attention to before.    If you love someone,   do not put their name in a heart because hearts can be broken,   instead put their name in a circle,   because circles go on forever.

The more people you have on your side the quicker your life will stop being a living hell. You must be strong and ride this thing out, it will pass. Just work on yourself, join school clubs, volunteer for charity events or create your own. Just remember people are bullies because they have low self esteem. Whatever you do don't try to make friends with her, just be polite to her when it is necessary. Start now by keeping a log of your progress on how you made it through another day and any other extra stuff you did to improve yourself.

AA10176626	Janet:    The Obama administration is committed to spending a great deal of the stimulus money on revitalizing the entire education system, from pre-K to college.  The plan passed by the House of Representatives, yesterday, will provide more than $150 billion in government spending over the next 2 years - an amount that more than doubles the Department of Education's current budget.    For college students, the most immediate impact of that particular stimulus package would be an increase in Pell Grant funding. If the plan remains as written, the Pell award will go up by $500 for the 2009-2010 academic year.    Remember - the Senate still must vote on its own version of the package, so none of this is written in stone.    The administration also sees their banking stimulus moves as a way to restart the educational lending market. That's not part of this bill, but it's part of other plans that are making their way across Capitol Hill.    Unfortunately, the college financing 'mess' is so multi-facted that there are no simple solutions. Critics want to point at tuition and college costs and argue that they've been rising far faster than inflation, but those same critics would have a difficult time finding colleges that have become "rich" off of their higher fees.     The reality is that colleges have always relied heavily on government or private subsidies (depending on whether they are public or private schools) to defray the actual cost of running campuses of those sizes and providing the education that they do. One consequence of the tax cut mania of the last several years is that the states have been providing less money to their own educational systems, and the "end uers" (the students) have been forced to pay more of their own true cost. That means soaring college tuition - and it also spreads all across the campus. When a school needs to self-fund more of its own dormitory building projects, more of those costs have to be passed on directly to the students.    It's a bad situation all the way around, because students and parents need to borrow more, and the banks have so royally screwed up the lending system that educational lending has ground to a halt. None of this is going to be "fixed" over night - and real progress probably won't be noticeable for several years.    You're on the right track when you point to fiscal policies of past administrations. There is an argument, and it's not necessarily an unreasonable one, that college should be reserved for those who can actually afford it. Further, the argument goes, those who can afford it should pay the actual cost of the education, and not expect the rest of us to grossly subsidize the higher education system.    We do have a situation in this country where hundreds of thousands of students a year are making financially irresponsible college choices. Rather than worrying about what they can actually afford, far too many students want to know where their "financial aid" is, so that they can attend some expensive, out-of-state university. Many of those students "manage" by taking out educational loans that they can not possibly hope to repay. I just answered another question from someone who wants to know how the stimulus package will help him with his $80,000 student loan. It's fair to ask why anyone attended a school that he could only afford by borrowing $80,000.    Will the package help with financial aid? Yes, but not overwhelmingly so. The administration wants to promote higher education, but they want to promote responsible use of the system. Hopefully, the private educational lending marketplace will be revitalized, so that students can borrow reasonably, and the Pell funding will be increased to help students from economically disadvantaged families afford to attend college at all.    On the other hand, if you're wondering "Will the Obama Administration make changes to the educational system that will allow all students the freedom to attend the college of their dreams, regardless of cost?", or "Will the Obama Administration pass laws that cut the Cost of Attendance in half so that everyone can afford college?", then I'm afraid that the answer to these types of questions is "no".    I hope that helped you with your thinking. Good luck!

He was seen as a very influential character in town and everyone else looked up to him.   What was it that stopped him from signing away his name at the end of the play? It would have saved his own life, but what would it have done for those who refused to lie about their guilt? Would he have still been considered a great man had he lied to save his life, or is he great because he did the responsible thing and told the truth?    In contrast, what about Abigail or Parris?    Good luck!|`|eJwAZEyZaa	if you are refering to the crucifiction of jesus christ then i would say that jesus had greatness and also had to be crucified as part of the responsibilty as a result of his greatness , also spiderman "with great power comes great responsibility"    hope this helped|`|9uqIrLCaaa	When we're looking at The Crucible, the characters that hold power are supposed to be responsible.  Proctor is a great example because he is considered "great," he holds power in the town, and eventually he accepts responsibility.  He's not happy to accept his fate of refusing to sign his name, but he knows he can't sign.  In a sense, he's taking responsibility for his actions of messing with Abigail and his wife.  He knows he needs to fix the problem and does what he must do.|`|iqsw1kQPaa	I think u need to tell her how u feel about her

NwbgvzfXaa	Assuming a single line that is horizontal, one 180o angle is above the line and one 180o angle is below the line.   Therefore, using inductive reasoning to make a conjecture, we could say that for every line, there are two non-overlapping angles.   So for 'n' lines, there are '2n' non-overlapping angles.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	well not sure if this is helpful, I am sure you know this already. if you have non parallel lines they will eventually overlap if stretched to infinity. I guess that would make 99 % of all possible angles overlapping.

1khVEE6oaa	What a bizarre question.  I kind of get how Obama and King are related, but what on earth does Noah have to do with anything?  Anyway...    Obama, although he claims to be a moderate, is clearly a radical leftist liberal.  His influences include domestic terrorist William Ayers, racist "pastor" Jeremiah Wright, and radical Marxist philosopher Saul Alinsky.  He also has ties to crooked Chicago businessmen like Tony Rezko.  However, the media chose to ignore most of these connections during the campaign.  Additionally, Obama is the most inexperienced president of all time.  While he was in the Illinois State Senate, he spent most of his time just voting "present" and not actually taking a position.  He spent the majority of his time in the US Senate doing nothing but running for president.    Martin Luther King, Jr. was an amazing man.  However, some arguments against him include an extra-marital affair at one point in his life.  Also, some other civil rights leaders (most notably Malcolm X) claimed that King was not militant and divisive enough to bring about real change.    As for Noah...um, what?  According to the Bible, Noah was the only righteous man in the world.  That's why God chose to save just him and his famlily.  He built an ark and put animals on it.  Um...that's basically all there is to say about Noah.  It's hard to make arguments against someone who was supposedly the only righteous man in the world.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	With Noah, perhaps, you can approach it from how do we know that you really got a message and you are not a bit nutty.

FqRaTTPpaa	There are some courses that all universities require, no matter where you go or what your degree will be, such as Speech, English, and some sort of math (Im sure you know if you're taking the liberal arts track or the science/engineering track - liberal arts majors have to take college algebra, engineers have to take calculus).    These are classes that can usually be very easily transferred, and they'll let you get a head start on the REAL classes in your major once you officially start college.  I would definitely recommend getting them out of the way as soon as possible.|`|G4wEL4qoaa	They care about the harder ones, like AP Calc, BC Calc, AP Stats, AP Gov, AP Euro.  They take that you took these harder courses into consideration when they look at your GPA.  They also look to see if you challenged yourself.  However, if it is just a elective that gets credit like psychology or sociology, they won't really care.

wbO7iyHMaa	This is one of the easiest CLEP tests I've taken....at least it was for me.  A lot of people seem to feel the same way, but there are also people who find it very difficult.  It depends how well read you are and how good you are at comprehending literary passages.  It isn't a test that you can really study for, either you understand literature when you read it or you don't.  Reading through the REA guide will give you some idea of what types of literary passages you can expect to see.  If you are fairly well read and good at understanding literature, you will probably do just fine.  My only suggestion would be to brush up on the literary devices, because there were a fair amount of questions about those on the CLEP test that I took.  Here is a link to information that will help you with that part of the test:    http://mrbraiman.home.att.net/lit.htm    Good luck!

KVkU6WSpaa	You need 2 equations. We will assume that X is the percentage of gas, and Y is the percentage of substitute fuel, and we will use whole numbers to make it simpler.    1) X + Y = 100, the sum of both percentages = 100%  2) 136X + 39Y = 100(X+Y), the total price should average 100 cents ($1)    First, simplify the second equation:    a) 136X + 39Y = 100(X+Y)  b) 136X + 39Y = 100X + 100Y  c) 36X - 61Y = 0    Now, multiply the first equation by 36, so that you can subtract the 2 equations (the Subtraction method)    1) 36X + 36Y = 3600  2) 36X - 61Y = 0    Now, subtract the 2 equations to get:    -------------------------------  97Y = 3600, which solves to (approximately):    Y = 37.1134,  This is the percentage of the substitute fuel.    100 - Y = 62.8866, This is the percentage of gasoline.    To check,     ($1.36 x .62886) + ($0.39 x .371134) = $1.00 (with slight rounding errors).    Hope this helps!

g8vI1IqBaa	Biology, chemistry and maths are very hard. Chemistry is said to be the hardest A-level, but many suggest that maths is. Biology is often just pure facts that need to be remembered, making it also very hard.    I do English language and literature combined, and I'm finding it OK. English literature is more respected that combined, but combined is more respected than language. I wouldn't say it's necessarily hard- the workload is fairly small, seeing as it's only coursework, and then maybe an essay a week as exam practice. What you DO need is natural ability. It's no use continuing with it if you get, say, a C at GCSE.     Good luck with your choices. Just remember, the pressure won't be on English, it will be on Chemistry, biology and maths, if anything.     By the way, I take Biology, chemistry, english combined and art (and my sleep pattern has adapted from 7AM- 11PM to 7AM- 1AM due to the workload).|`|i3YLBkYwaa	I'm doing English Language, and my friends do Literature...

Though the phrase may have originated in sports, it could have its roots in local elections settled by voice vote in rural England. These elections, associated with great noise, came to be called shoutings. There is no proof of this, but perhaps some candidate or observer of the day was so sure of the outcome of a shouting that he remarked it's all over but the shouting and the phrase passed into popular usage.

Its relaxing, it can inspire, motivate (eye of the tiger while running :) ) some lyrics can help to solve problems, or bring about awareness of a global issue (BOB Marley's There's a War), some music makes other problems more relate - able.

YrdUWtSCaa	Across time and place, what it means to be African-American derives from an array of experiences. Stephanie Allenwho teaches English at the University of Marylandexamines this theme in her collection of short stories.     The settings range from 19th-century New England to modern-day Florida. Theyre narrated in first, third, and even second person. The protagonists are young and old, male and female. Race is always a player.     In Souvenir, black college students Gail and Cille take a road trip to Florida and get lost in an area still mired in Jim Crow beliefs. When a store clerk gives Cille a hard time on a purchase, Gail studies a shelf of mammy figurines. Captivated by their existencepitch-black people, bug-eyed things with head rags and red polka-dotted aprons and wet grins wide as the Mississippiand bitter over her friends treatment, she steals one.     In Mud Show, George Mattie has been hired to guide H.C. Hutherfords American Floating Circus from New York to Connecticut. The manager, Cheffal, wants to push the performers and animals beyond their limits to reach the next town early. Cheffal demands that Mattie find a shortcut through the woodsa path that leads to disaster, with Mattie taking the fall.     The stories have simple plots and read quickly. Allen deftly manipulates time through flashbacks and builds characters through the skillful use of dialect, point of view, and detailed, sensitive descriptions: The halo of fine, raisin-brown hair that always pulled loose from her braids floated around her head.     While the theme throughout is the African-American experience, A Place Between Stations can appeal to anyone.

Float through the internet or a library and you'll probably cover most of what you will in class anyhow.  <br>  <br>  I took Latin too.  It's vocab in a different language.  Latin isn't like a speaking language (at least not until you're well beyond what you'll get in high school).  Think of it as just learning the roots to English.  Each and every word looks like what it should mean, like 'terra' and earth (terrestrial).  There's a link to every single word in the english language, and outside of conjugating sentences, it really only is a matter of remembering words.  Don't sweat Latin.  <br>  <br>  Community service can be just about anything too, it doesn't necessarily require you to spend hours of your day outside or somewhere else.  Have a friendly dog that plays well with others?  Go to a shelter and volunteer to walk and wash the other dogs.  They'll get some playtime in, your dog will do the same AND you'll get your hours in.  Live in/near a major city?  I have a clean-up on my block every Sunday morning/afternoon...most of these people aren't even from my neighborhood.  <br>  <br>  And fear is a good thing.  No one ever did anything exceptional when they were bored, relaxing or well-within their comfort zone.|`|6z2Yz50Uaa	Well since you have a study hall, that will definitely lighten the load at least a little bit.  If you're in sports teams, or if you have a job after school, that could definitely make it more difficult.  Otherwise, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  As far as community service goes, it depends what your interests are.  If you have a community center or something along those lines in your area, then they should have some volunteer work you could do, and probably in different areas of interest.  Otherwise, if you ask a teacher or guidance counselor or principal, they might have a few ideas.  Community work is everywhere. =]]
RXUTusPoaa	It would be best to ask your doctor about whether or not you have ADD/ ADHD.   I have similasr issue, in that I cant focus on my readings for very long or if I force myself to do that, then I cant remember what I read. I know I dont have ADHD because I'm not hyper, and I dont get bored easily and I am generally focused.   I figured out that a large part of the problem was that what I was studying was not motivating me; and also, when I was anxious about some other issues that also affected wheter I could retain information.  It's also good to check out what type of learner you are: such as a visual learner , aural, social, or verbal learner. This can greatly influence what you will remember when you study. For example, I am a visual learner, so when I draw charts of my notes, or diagrams from things, then I remmeber them a lot better.  I will leave you with a link to assess for yourself whether or not you have ADD/ ADHD (but it's still good to ask your doc if you're not sure)  http://www.helpguide.org/mental/adhd_add...    And this is a link that can help you determine what type of learner you are so you can study and remember better  http://www.learning-styles-online.com/    Hope that helps.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	Make sure your environment is quiet for reading. You are probably getting distracted by your surroundings, right?     It's possible your mind just doesn't stay active by visual stimuli. I have a very hard time connecting things I hear to memory but if I see them I can remember for weeks, and if I do it myself I remember it forever. My mind is just a lot better at remembering physical actions/sights than things I hear. Like at meetings here at work I fall asleep because my mind gets bored to tears only listening. Could be the same way for you and reading...

rieUFeMAaa	my dear everything is possible in life if only you have the will and determination. now am not saying this because i think its just nice to say it. am only saying this because i can relate to you. back in high school, i applied to so many universities and not for once was i accepted into any of them. hence, i proceeded to go to community college and start from the base. meaning i took elementary classes in math and english and slowly worked my way to college level classes. guess what. after three years i have finally been admitted to the university of illinois at chicago to major in biology. so you see my dear, just keep working hard and very thing will successfully fall into place.|`|AA11942204	The answer to your question is yes you can.

d5e3g4LEaa	Oh tough decision.  I also have my BA in English, but my MA is in Cross Cultural Education.  With your MA in English you will be able to teach high school English and college level English/Literature classes.  Elementary school normally requires a multiple subject credential (at least in CA).  Preschool generally requires a ton of child development classes.  Are do doing a dual program when you obtain you masters and a teaching credential at the same time, or do you still have another year and a half of classes for your credential?|`|jFXBQ8oMaa	You should check your state requirements on becoming an early childhood teacher.  In Massachusetts you can have your transcript evaluated to see if you have any courses that are in child development.  If you don't, you can take 6 courses to be early childhood certified.      The first course to start with is Chid Growth and Development.      Good luck on your new exciting career!

1e7f641bc9616493bba775e4233ce60daa	The easiest way out of, into, or through just about everything in life is preparation.  That's the key. It's just easier.     Studying eliminates the tension and stress of not being prepared.  It eliminates the need for excuses and it diminishes worry. Again, it's just easier!     Not studying is the hardest choice. It goes against the flow of life. It's stressful. It's incredibly time consuming and it's often expensive.  It's also voting against yourself. Why vote against yourself anyway? What the heck is the point of that?     Think about it. People who don't study often spend more time talking and worrying about not studying than they would actually getting the job done. Take the easy way out and prepare yourself.|`|CEsvUFAHaa	I always think to myself "If I mess this up I will never leave home/go to uni/have my career of choice"    Works every time ;)|`|AA11942204	Don't want to study?

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	Technically it shouldn't-- if your grade should just be the sum of the scores you get on tests, paper, homework, etc... On the other hand your teacher is the one doing the grading, is only human, and their opinion of what you are capable of doing academically may be influenced by your behavior. For eample if your professor sees you as a Bart Simpsonesque C student they might assume your putting in C work and give you that grade accordingly when you turn in a paper--cause you know if a teacher has 120 papers to grade they're not going to read that carefully...    Actually here's a real world example from my college days:    I take a course with one professor and get an A-. I take another course with that professor where the grade is based on four papers. My first paper is OK, nothing to write home about. I get an A-. My next paper is great. A-. The paper after that is lousy. A-. The last one: A-. You can guess what grade I got in the class...|`|JrC2KGOQaa	Yes.  In-class participation does not mean acting out.  By doing so, you compromise the other students' chance for a quality education, since the teacher has to focus on dealing with you.  For being selfish, the teacher will not be inspired to give you a good recommendation, which makes you less desirable for college admittance.  In addition, colleges are more competitive than ever, and do check things like "permanent record cards".

This is a generalization and while these devices are very popular and will probably remain so, it isn't true for  humanity.  As an example, I cite the motor vehicle.<br>  <br>  The motor vehicle is more than a mode of transportation to many.  It is also used as a status symbol or a source of recreation.  Is this not true of electronic gadgets?  However, we have to ask ourselves, "Are we slaves to our cars?"  No, vehicles serve us, they make our life easier and more convenient, but with the exception of a very small segment of society, we do not devote our lives to them.<br>  <br>  There is an operational aspect to consider also, cost of use.  The present economy is described as being a recession.  What happens when a recession occurs?  People cut back on use of things that have become luxuries in their lives.<br>  <br>  Not too many months ago, gasoline was averaging $4.00 a gallon.  What happened?  Demand dropped off significantly as people began using vehicles less.  Once demand began dropping, so did the cost of operating a vehicle.  While our economy is in the so-called 'tank', companies who service the electronic devices will try to maintain profit levels, which mean price increases for both equipment and services.<br>  <br>  As these prices climb, enough people will eventually begin cutting back on their purchases and use.  Once this economizing reaches a significant level, then the manufacturers and service organizations will begin rolling back their pricing structure to attract more buyers and users.<br>  <br>  From the above, we can infer that use of such things is cyclical.  They reach high points and then economic (and other) factors cause use to drop off.  Since the use of these things run in cycles, then our so-called slavery to them is limited by economics, there is a controlling factor to our addiction.<br>  <br>  (hope this will give you some ideas).|`|AA11461043	well do you agree with the statement? or disagree?

That means it's "an honor" (the h is silent), but "a UFO" (because it's pronounced yoo eff oh)."    if using this rule, "a ewe" would be correct because it's pronounced (yoo - Y sound, not a vowel sound).|`|15a3bfcb11c2859f067ec1b1d56cc0baaa	It's a ewe.

BUT if you just hang on a year or two longer you can go to uni, get a degree and then a decent job so you never have to go home again if you don't want to.

OeRzlZPnaa	When I was applying towards college, alot of people I know would actually take both tests because some of them found the ACTs easier and some of them found the SATs easier. Which helped them, because if they did better on one than the other it'd make them look better than if they had just taken the one that they did worse at. While colleges don't recommend that you take both, and they don't actually penalize you for it either it's purely optional. It can improve your chances if for some reason you do alot better on the ACTs than you do on the SATs.

hggAFCCIaa	technically, if you're not AT the airport...it's more correct to say "i TOOK my mother to the airport"  or "i WILL TAKE my mother to the airport".  you bring something to yourself and take it away.  in the same regard...unless you're at the vet, you TAKE your dog...or TOOK him yesterday.|`|ugRN86bYaa	No,it's not correct|`|VGmZ1gmuaa	brought|`|eBwICYUMaa	the first one should be brought second one is right  brought is past tense and bring is present  but you would probably need to add and -ing to the end   ex; i m bringng my mother to the airport|`|AA11357056	Actually, "took" might be a better choice for both sentences.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	Both are correct. Bring is present tense. Brought is past tense.|`|pWO6Bu9Laa	The proper way to say both sentences would be:    "I am bringing my mother to the airport."  "I took my dog to the vet yesterday."    but yes "bring" is present tense and "brought" is past tense.  So the girl above me is half correct.

TWKIuTEyaa	At the moment there are no specific national requirements for the position of teaching assistant, whether special needs or mainstream.    Each school will decide what it wants (and what it willpay, and what will be required of the assistant) when it advertises.    If you want to maximise your chances then by all means take further courses, but it would be just as good to start applying for local jobs (and, perhaps, gaining experience by volunteering at local special schools). Experience is, at present, more valuable than formal academic qualifications for such a post. You will be able to increase your qualifications by attending courses etc whilst working as a teaching assistant: this is encouraged nowadays.    If you are considering going to university (and academically capable of doing so) then you would be far better to consider a career as a teacher. Teaching assistant pay (there is no national scale) is extremely poor, and many are paid 'pro rata' (that is, they only receive payment for the hours they do).Some teaching assistants are not even paid for school holidays.
jH1SA4wjaa	2nd|`|ykeDRhjeaa	the 2nd one is corect    since if you want to join the two sentences, which has been attempted in the first part, you need a linking word.    a linking work is a word that joins 2 sentences. so either you let the 2 sentences apart, that is in 2 separate sentences, or if you join them, throw in a linking word,    for example for the first part to be correct, it should have been written something like this:    Marmalade is considered a royal treat and it has been popular a long time.    again, this is just an idea.    hope this helps :)

2lQ8DJAcaa	The term rockfish when used in reference to fish can be confusing. Depending on regional dialect, the word can refer to any species of fish which lives in rocks, such as sculpins, or it can be used in a discussion of the specific genus Sebastes, which is native to Pacific waters. Striped bass are also known as rockfish, especially along the Eastern coast of the United States. This taxonomic confusion leads most people to refer to fish with a more precise name, to eliminate mistaken identities.    Members of the order Scorpaeniforms are sometimes classified as rockfish. These fish all posses rayed fins, and they are often brightly striped and very bold, considering the small size of many individual species. Their coloration allows them to blend in well with rocks and coral. There are upwards of 20 families in this order of fish, which leaves a great deal of room for biodiversity.|`|ZM7zrAfWaa	rockfish (rkfsh)  n. pl. rockfish or rockfishes   1.

When gender is unspecified in the singular, the he/his/him forms are used, and 'everyone' is definitely sigular.

If you really want to go to UCLA move to California, establish residency for a year. <br>  You can either just work or volunteer or do something like CCC at Lake Tahoe:<br>  <a href="http://www.ccc.ca.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccc.ca.gov/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ccc.ca.gov/DISTRICT/TAHOE/tahoe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccc.ca.gov/DISTRICT/TAHOE/tah...</a><br>  Then go to a JC near UCLA like Santa Monica Junior College.  JC students are able to cross enroll in one UC course per semester at JC rates.

That will help with the engineering part.<br>  <br>  And business courses often help, no matter what field you're interested in.<br>  <br>  And if your school does clubs, then see if they have one related to what you're looking in to.|`|miulNODzaa	I would try and take a music theory course. music history is good too.

bC0KRacHaa	You just have to be very firm with these kids.  Be consistent with rules, be prepared on day one to know what behaviour the principal expects and what consequences are appropriate.  Be kind and fair and respect the students but do NOT allow any disrespect from them.  Maintain control of the classroom and you'll be fine.  Just remember that these kids have troubled pasts, that's why they're there.  That's never their own fault, so be compassionate but know that the best thing for them is to learn that they have to follow rules and procedures.  Maybe ask if you can sub at the school, or observe an experienced teacher in action before you make a decision so you know what you are getting into.

Instead of seeing to it that their kids work harder (that's too much work, right?) they would prefer the education system to come down to their level instead?    And I think it's perfectly OK to make a 64 the minimum grade....I mean, come on now. If your kid is BARELY passing, don't you have other issues to deal with??    It's been proven that over the last few decades the education system has already been "downgrading" their standards so that American children could look as though they were "catching" up to the rest of the world. So technically speaking, we're already working at a lower expectation level....and now folks want to bring it down even lower. Scary.|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	Money or discounts should not factor in to your child's education in my opinion.

A's can still be earned in a difficult high school (an oxymoron in the first place).   The kids simply need to work a bit harder.   It's not like they are working harder to pick more beans or pluck more chickens.  It's a constructive investment in their own minds.

On the other hand, those who work hard at a job they love and consider salary to be secondary, are sometimes the most successful.

Do you possess certain skills needed for the course? Which ones?   Any work experience you have, and any skills you gained while doing it? For example:     Working to deadlines   Diplomacy   Problem solving   Using initiative   Communication skills   When you write your personal statement remember the following:     Organise your material so it is an informative and interesting read   Write clearly and try not to pack in too much information   Only write things that you are prepared to talk about at an interview   Don't repeat material already on the application form   Think about the impression you want to give   Don't describe what courses you are doing now   Don't ramble or fill in space with irrelevant information    Don't forget to sound interesting

ssQb7bB3aa	Last minute learning for a health exam is difficult, unless you have a photographic memory. The reason for this is there is a lot of new unfamiliar vocab (as you know by now) and there are lots of unrelated things you have to remember - after a little while, it feels a bit like trying to memorize the volumes of yellow pages.    A more useful way to do this would be:-  1. Start going through your notes early in the term  2. You need to go through the work more than once, sometimes 3 times or 5 times. (It's not like maths, where you can get by if you just remember a few formulae)  3. You have to test your knowledge by asking yourself what you learned the night before, 3 nights before etc etc    Not sure if there is an easier way with health, because of the huge volumes of seemingly unrelated information that one has to learn. It gets better with time though.

WZa6GhS3aa	Yes you can improve your handwriting it just takes practice.  Also ive found if i slant my hand like writing side wards i write neater than writing with the pen straight forward if that makes sense half of it is how you position the pen ( how you hold it)  You can take hand writing classes just ask your teacher|`|KcVBmhLmaa	well, i dnt think that it is something that people are born with. If u want to improve your handwriting what u have to do is start practicing writing neatly at all times, be it at times, when you are writing a phone number or taking notes, always put up that practice of always writing neat. And wen ever writing notes, wen u've got sufficient time for writing it, what u have to do is take your own time relax and try writing very neatly and perfectly. When u do this on a constant basis your gonna feel an amazing difference.   what's gonna happen is that wen u keep writing neatly nd slowly (ALWAYS) you are gonna end up naturally write neatly and u gain your speed in writing neatly.

Pell grants are free and don't have to be paid back.  Find a college you can attend for less than this amount ($1,290.00) per semester.  Your local community college will be perfect.

KtZhbPpfaa	If youre really smart than no for any of them, if youre just smart then english and history shouldn't give you too much of a problem.  The others might, but then again everybody is different.    probably a good idea to take the classes without the credits, you'll get more of you're moneys worth in my opinion if you spend the money only on the actual college courses for credits    I am just speaking from my own experience|`|AeJbSuNNaa	I took AP Chem, AP Physics C, AP Calc, AP Spanish, and the rest honors classes my junior year...    My year end grades were all A's and I think one B, maybe two... It depends on what you can handle; we all can handle different course loads. Try it out and see what happens. You can always drop a course.    Edit: I took AP Stat my senior year and hated it... I found it overwhelmingly boring, but that's just my opinion.     Colleges enjoy seeing AP classes, and I didn't send in my scores on AP U.S. Government and Politics... You don't have to take the AP Exam. It's the same as taking it and not sending in your scores...|`|vkeuaEHiaa	I don't think that 3 AP courses will be too much for you if you truly want to dedicate yourself to it. I took 4 weighted classes last year (my junior year) and I managed to get all As.     Currently I am taking a Dual Enrollment class for US History, but I am not paying for the college credits. It is a weighted class, however, and it has raised my GPA. So I say that taking the class without paying for the credits will benefit you.    And at my school, AP English is pretty much just like regular English. You probably won't find many surprises there.|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	yes, yes and yes|`|xWj2oBnyaa	Never overwhelm yourself with work.

That's why I'm only taking highly advanced classes for physics and math because I know that I will have an occupation in those fields.  When the time comes for a career in your field of interest, you will be more prepared if you focused more on 1 or 2 classes rather than stressing over 4-5.|`|oR9ZODGtaa	Chemistry is the hardest of all of them.

L2ngturyaa	A Masters Degree was the best thing I ever did for myself. I was seven years into teaching and had experiences to bring to the classes and I understood more of the course work with some experience in the classroom. I could ask questions of the professors and get good feedback on my "What would you do if...." questions. There was not a lot of extra salary, but more prestige. I was asked to mentor new teachers and given more responsiblity which built my self esteem and helped me with working with colleagues. I definitely recommend the Masters degree, good luck!|`|DGbu2x7Faa	For a brief moment it padded my pocketbook, until the recent pay cuts.  It was also necessary for National Certification, and= more money.    I have since quit teaching, too many hours, not enough money, No support and just feed up with having to play the politically correct game.  The kids are brats and need to have their lovely little butts beaten along with there uninterested parents.  No I am not jaded - just feed up with the poorly run institution and it is a pity because the kids loose.|`|b375eaa19dd6c56e9909e7ba789daa39aa	It will not help you cope with any students. It will not get you big bucks. It will not make you "smarter" -   But it will make you more employable and more credible in your field.     Aside from that, you will be studying in more detail, use your education more wisely and if you are really up for it, you can go for your doctorate. Again, no big bucks in the future, but it will get you to a level that very few achieve.   If you feel children are a pain in the neck, maybe you need to pursue another venue for a job. Children are children, they all need love even when they are the least lovable. If you are not willing to do that, then education of children may not be for you. Think about it carefully. You will be teaching the next generation, possibly your very own children. These are the kids who will vote for your next president, will take care of you when you are old (let's hope!), will lead your country. If you want to participate in making the world a better place, then education is the place for you.   Good luck!|`|37f312fb8959d2d2845fc055c613bc48aa	It definitely helped a lot, but it is no substitute for being in the trenches and learning from experienced teachers.

5mjzCKh7aa	In second grade my teacher had us do a traveling lesson that lasted a week. We made passports and studied the weather. Our destination was Hawaii so we learned about the island and little things like that. I think she even did a brief "beach/swimming safety" lesson.... like always make sure there's a lifegaurd, etc.  Oh we made hula skirts and did the hula lol. At the end of the week we had a big party outside with little kiddie pools and she bought all kinds of fruit for us to snack on.      I'm a junior in highschool now and still remember it.  Maybe you could do something like that?|`|bFy46sxzaa	What if you tried to incorporate all of the ideas together. For example, a family of (or one) insect(s) is trying to plan a trip. As a group, the students have to decide where they want to go, what kind of weather the place will have (i.e. Colorado - snow, skiing, etc; Hawaii - surfing, swimming, playing in the sand, etc), and what kind of food is found there (Hawaii - lots of fruits, mention a luau, etc); the students would have to think about what they should and should not eat (nutrition). They could make a booklet showing the insect's trip and all of the friends (other insects) he/she makes along the way.    I hope this helps and Good Luck! I hope you'll love teaching as much as I do! :)|`|WdmmUGfcaa	Dinosaurs are always a hit at any grade.  You could learn 5 one each day.  Use the big vocabulary, kids love that.  So do adults.

hggAFCCIaa	Most writing manuals nowadays are urging people not to use that salutation. Instead, when you don't know your recipient's name, write "Dear Sir or Madam:" or (more formally) "Sir or Madam:" If you know that both men and women are recipients, you can use "Ladies and Gentlemen." In a simplified letter style, you can skip the salutation altogether and write a single line in ALL CAPS announcing the subject of your message.  -- Authority: The Gregg Reference Manual by William A. Sabin. 9th Edition. McGraw-Hill: New York. 2001. p. 367.     The NYPL Writer's Guide says that the trend is to use a "to" line, as in "To the head of the Park Department:"  -- Authority: New York Public Library Writer's Guide to Style and Usage HarperCollins: New York. 1994. Cited with permission. p. 210     --HOWEVER--  if you still chose to use it, follow this rule (capitalize first letter, follow w/ colon):  Rule 10: Capitalize the first word of the greeting and the salutation in a letter.  Dear Nancy,     My dear cousins,    To whom it may concern:  ,  Greetings to the staff,   Sincerely,    Yours truly,     With deepest sympathy,    From a true friend always,|`|ugRN86bYaa	To whom it may concern:    only capitalize the first word; colon at the end|`|50Ty7VRYaa	To whom it may concern,|`|hoOU6HDbaa	To whom it may concern    (do not need a punctuation at the end)

TNTFomKeaa	I think your resume looks good. It's very clear that you're strong academically, have got as much experience as you could while you were in school and done quite a lot of extra-curricular activities. It was also a good idea to list your skills in addition to your experience because it highlights them and helps the employer look past the inexperience. At the end of the day, you're a recent college grad and you can't be expected to have 10 years in the industry and employers know that.

Signals need to have words to descibe them so that someone who is unfamiliar with the signal can be taught.  Feelings are sometimes hard to put in to words and a lot of times there are no words to describe wholy what you're feeling; however, i think it's important to express your feelings in words to others.  if you're upset, someone might be able to tell from how you're acting that you are upset...but would probably not know WHY without words of explanation.

6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I'm an English major and the job market is rough. I've decided to go back to school to get a teaching degree b/c it's the best job sector right now. For English majors there aren't much options anymore. If you love the creative arts I suggest getting an MFA you will be able to teach at community colleges, have your own editing business, and potentially start a press. This experience will help you land some marketing jobs or positions on Arts/Culture non-profit or government sector positions.    You can also get your MA in English, that could also help you accomplish most of the goals, I previously mentioned. If you like the research side of education you obtain a master's in education and do more supervising work.     If you are done with education all together, there aren't a lot of options. A lot of publicity departments in major modern companies are cutting back, the likelihood of you getting a position as a Publication Direction is incredibly slime as those departments are being cut back.     You can try becoming a marketing/pr person but this position entails more of a business background now a days. You can look for good management positions in the private sector, that would be a good first shot.|`|W3FQ53FLaa	I'm a teacher and love my job.

I contacted the college I went to and set up a meeting with someone in the department.  This way, I can weigh my options in terms of career and if more schooling is necessary I can be on the right track.  I suggest you do the same.    If you don't love your job, life is too short to be miserable.

AA10176626	No, you don't, but.....    The lender will disburse your Stafford funds electronically, directly to your school.    When your school receives financial aid on your behalf, they will first use those funds to pay down any balance in your student account. Theoretically, that account represents any tuition or school fees that you owe, though for some students, there may be additional debts included in the student account, like a bookstore advance.    Once the school has received sufficient funds to pay off your entire balance, they will rebate the "overage" to you. It is very important to recognize that your financial aid is intended to cover your "Cost of Attendance", and not just your tuition - that's why financial aid almost always exceeds what you owe your school.    Cost of Attendance includes tuition, fees, books, room and board, and other education-related expenses, including transportation to and from school, and a computer allowance. All of those things are "legitimate" expenses that financial aid can be used to pay - so once the school has taken enough to pay the tuition and fees part, you will get the rest back, so that you can apply it to what you spent on books, or gas, or food, or a place to live.    You do not need to provide documentation of where your financial aid is spent, but do remember that you're not going to get "more" aid than the school thinks you need for your educational expenses. If you spend part of that aid on a spring break trip, happy hour, or a birthday present for dad, you're going to wind up having to come up with more money to pay for books and food and stuff like that.    I hope that helped - good luck!|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Sorry, you are out of luck. Federal Stafford loans are taken out by the University on your behalf and the funds are paid direclty to the school for tuition by the loaner. If there is any money remaining after tuition is paid, the money is given to you for school needs (it is not tracked though).       Sorry to tell you this as well, if the loan comes in and the tutiion is already paid by your grants then the funds will revert back to the loaning company.
THuRGnMGaa	First off, as with any interview, dress as you would going into a business job.  You need to dress nice, as in a suit or something along those lines.  You don't have to necessary wear a suit, but don't go in wearing jeans.  It is better to overdress than to under dress.  You can find many resources on what to wear on the internet.  I would also suggest researching online for different interview questions and how to create a good first impression.  I would also research the college and the job so that you are familiar with everything.  That will make you a little more calm.  The more prepared you are, the better.  I have never had a nursing interview, but I have had interviews.  I try a do as much research as I possibly can because I am very nervous for interviews.  Sorry I can't be more help, but go in there with confidence and show them that you really want it.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|8g51eBf1aa	For a university interview I say you can never go wrong with a suit. A suit coat, nice dress shirt, tie and pants for guys. And a dress with a jacket for girls. Just a suggestion though.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	All-black clothing is NOT a good idea.  Dress in your best, without looking like you belong at a formal "ball."|`|mGubEYTRaa	Business attire is always appropriate for any interview.  I don't think the colors matter, but if you are male, then definitely wear a tie, you'll look better than the doofus who shows up in casual clothes.    If you are female then wear a dress shirt with either a skirt, or nice office pants.     Don't stress!      Here are some common questions asked...     -Why do you want to attend this university?   -What is your strongest/weakest point?   -What have you done to prepare for college?   -What has been your greatest experience in high school?   -Tell me about yourself (focus on three things).   -Tell me about your involvement in extracurricular activities.   -What do you want to do in the future?   -If you could meet any important figure in the past or present, who would it be and what would you talk about?   -What accomplishments are you most proud of?|`|T1j73RZpaa	It matters because of course people judge you by apperence. If you go in wearing a stained sweatshirt & ripped sweatpants it can be a reflection that you don't take much pride in yourself, are lazy, & un-put-together which could be simillar to your work ethic. Dress professional. Trousers are good. I would wear black, white, or gray but don't look like your over doing it. & be yourself!!

I am not sure if you are suggesting that you feel like you should be exercising or not. If you feel you need it, you probably should start. But exercising does not necessarily mean going to a gym and working out till you drop. Mowing the lawn, sprinkling salt on the ice, snow shoveling, vacuuming your carpet, playing with a dog or cat, sex, grocery shopping, doing dishes... all these are forms of exercise.

I don't give advice to people unless they ask for it.  And many times not even if they ask for it, because most people asking for advice really aren't.  But that's another complicated story.  But especially someone who doesn't exercise is probably sick of people giving them unsolicited advice, and will likely do the opposite.    If I was concerned about someone who never exercises, I would find something fun to do with them.    1) Somebody to exercise with is important to continue doing it  2) Something enjoyable is important to continue doing it|`|yKAMnOWMaa	Go Excercise!!!|`|XbZIicftaa	To start!

JmfyyDMdaa	In my opinion, YES! I just started at the University of Phoenix online about a month ago. I'm a stay at home Marine wife, and I needed something to keep me busy since I cant work right now. I'm a hands on learner, and can't stand being lectured by instructors, it goes in one ear and out the other! I was very hesitant about online classes, but omg am I loving it! You're right about it being straight forward. For me, I take 2 classes every 9 weeks, so it sounds like a lot, but it's not. And the cool thing is, you can do it at any time, at your own pace.    I enjoy it a lot. Theres different guidelines, like you have to check in 3 times a week, respond to other students blogs so many times a week. I thought it was going to be a pain! but it's not, honestly. I would never go back to a regular campus!

From what you wrote, it sounds like you are an ideal candidate.     First, make sure the program is accredited. Going with online courses offered by a "traditional" college is a great idea. A good program will let you log into things as a guest to browse around a bit. A couple of questions to be asking:  *What is your teacher to student ratio? (lower the better, but it will probably be much higher than a traditional classroom).  *Who will answer my questions? Professor?  *When can I get assistance? Just during the school day? If that's when you'll be working, that's fine, but lots of online learners work in the evening and weekends. How do you get help then?  *What are the costs?     Questions to ask yourself:  *Can I stay on task without anyone checking on my progress?  *When I get stuck, do I typically try to figure things out before seeking assistance?  *Do I have reliable Internet access? (believe it or not, we have students with no internet who want to sign up for online learning!)  *I am disciplined with my time?    I hope you find a great fit for your needs!
kYptU4PSaa	A predicate adjective is an adjective that is used to predicate an    attribute of the subject.     Examples (English)     Roses are red.      An adjective following a linking verb that describes the subject, such as 'roses are red'     The predicate adjective can  (more often doesn't in our present day language) change places with the subject.  'Red are roses'|`|KPHZmcQuaa	a linking verb, otherwise known as a "copula"    Cheers!|`|kfQAmCT0aa	Predicate Adjective (Describes subject.)    I am ready.  David is happy.  Ellen is sad.     The above sentences can be reversed, thus:  Ready am I.  Happy is David  Sad is Ellen    While the previous sentences are unlikely, they are possible. The predicate adjective can change places with the subject.

AA10176626	sps:    Unfortunately, no one can answer this question for you on the basis of the information that you have provided. The details that you have mentioned would certainly suggest that this is a household with "exceptional need", but that would be impossible to determine for sure, unless you complete the entire FAFSA application.    There are many factors that determine financial aid eligibility - if aid could be determined by income and car ownership alone, the FAFSA would be two questions long. In reality, the FAFSA is about 100 questions long, and all of that information is considered in determining an applicant's aid eligibility.    To qualify for Pell Grant assistance, an applicant must be a US citizen, or eligible non-citizen, they must hold a high school degree, or an accepted equivalent, and they must be attending an eligible institution of higher education as a fully-accepted student, working towards a degree or certificate. An applicant is not eligible for Pell funding if they already hold a bachelor's degree or certificate from some other educational program.    As you can see, the rules are complicated, and you and your son will have to complete the FAFSA in order to determine what forms of aid your son might be eligible to receive. When the FAFSA is submitted to the Department of Education, the Department will compute an EFC (Expected Family Contribution) index score, and that score will be sent to the financial aid office at your son's college or university.    Once the aid office receives your son's score, they will attempt to match him up with any aid programs that he is eligible for. They will prepare an "aid offer letter", detailing that aid, and telling your son how he can go about accepting it.    Don't forget - the Pell Grant maximum is $4731 for this year (it may go up $500 next year). That money is paid directly to the school, and it must be used to pay for tuition, school fees, books, and other education-related expenses.    I hope this information helped you - and I'd also like to recommend the Department of Education booklet that I've linked to below. This booklet explains the entire financial aid system, and will tell you all about the different types of aid, how much is available, how to apply, and who is eligible to receive it.     Good luck!|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Go to the library and ask for a copy of the 'college blue book' ...It has thousands of grants and scholarships listed

AA10176626	Maria:    When your financial aid was processed, your school should have sent you an "aid offer letter", detailing the amount of aid that you had been awarded for this entire school year. The aid offer letter would have identified the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), and the amount of TAP aid that you would be receiving.    If you want to verify that your TAP assistance was properly processed by the state's Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC), you can visit this page: https://web1.hesc.org/hescpub/main?targe...    where you can log into your account and view your TAP status (see the menu bar on the left hand side of the page).    Here's what the HESC has to say about the disbursement of TAP awards:    "Your school will see your information on a roster listing students that have received an award for attendance at that school. The school must verify your eligibility and certify your award. The TAP funds will be sent to the school, usually within three to five weeks, after the school certifies your eligibility with New York State."    The site also explains that it IS possible that a student may receive a different amount from their school than the amount that was originally estimated by the TAP program, because your school is required to verify certain types of information that you provided to TAP.    If you can verify your TAP award at the website that I linked to, up above, I would strongly recommend that you call the HESC Customer Communication Center at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372). Explain your problem to the representative at that number, and ask them what they can do to help you get your problem resolved.    Good luck - I hope that helps you.

Oq6pxX3jaa	To all of you who tell him not to blame the teachers... SHUT UP!!! You don't go here, so you don't know. It's horrible.     You're right, our teachers do suck. We should definitely go talk to Stiles or something, because it's pretty sad that we only know like two phrases after a year and a half of Italian.  We shouldn't be in class. We would benefit far more from an independent study. Maybe we should go ask about it.  As for El Spocko... He is just molto grasso! I don't even know what to say. It's like this school is getting dumber.  Lets go talk to Stiles tomorroww to see if there's a way around this.|`|5jINw4PGaa	I feel bad for you. You should just study on your own. I mean if your teachers aren't teaching you, it doesn't make sense that you allow them to keep ruining your life.|`|FOsd9DP6aa	Don't tell him to not blame the teachers. It does make a difference.    In year 9, I had a brilliant teacher for Maths and got a level 8 in my SATs and am therefore predicted an A*. However, for year 10 we got given a new subject teacher and she was terrible. She didn't connect with us on our level, treated us incredibly unfairly and often made up stories about us to senior members of staff. Thankfully, we got our brilliant teacher back in Year 11 but, unfortunately, the damage had been done. I just got my mock results back and I got a C. On average a student increases a grade by the time it comes to results day and therefore, I'll be lucky to get an A.    I agree, some of it is down to the student but some of the stuff, you can't learn off your own back. So my advice would be talk to a senior member of staff, don't be rude, and explain how you feel you're losing out. As much as they deny it, I'm so sure that we got Mr R. back because we complained about Mrs B.      Plus, it DOESN'T hurt to revise anything you don't understand or getting a text book out and working from that. Some of it is off your own back, but I completely understand what you're talking out.    Good luck :)|`|LaoHGCQHaa	ummm lets see u need to pay attention more hello and if that doesnt work than ur just dumb and mental hope it gives you hell|`|K5uoaetaaa	OK here is a newsflash - teachers are not expected to have control over the students.  They are expected to plan the lessons, teach the kids, mark the work etc.  The kids (in your case 'young adults') are supposed to control themselves!  Teachers become demotivated because they tire of casting pearls before swine; i.e. trying to teach uninterested rowdy spoilt brats who mostly have no interest in learning.|`|7iknxD3Saa	You can start with "stop blaming your teachers"|`|R9XtFyxgaa	Just rely on yourself..Study on your own in your free time if your teachers are no help...you should also inform them on their teaching skills.|`|LpbDMyZkaa	Wow, your school looks just like the Brazilian School, no control of the students, not learning too much...

4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	This question reminds me of one of my favorite Calvin and Hobbes cartoons.  Calvin was daydreaming about dinosaurs when the teacher called on him to answer a question.  She said, "What state do you live in?" and he replied "Denial."  She sighed and said, "I can't argue with that."    "Zoning out" is another colloquial term for it.|`|sjOelwhhaa	Around here, we say "zoned out"  (LOL, not "zorbed", but perhaps related).|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	Daydreaming  In a trance|`|y6Ae19Itaa	yes, daydreaming or in a trance.

That term was made up by a friend of mine, it would be great if you started using it and it spread around.  I think it is an awesome term.  Other uses include "I am feeling a little zorby."  and "Have you ever seen anyone zorb so hard?".

But business, engineering, physics, or chemistry then yes.|`|xIowgWL7aa	If you consider the possible connections you might make, the people you will come into contact with and the quality of the education you will receive, then yes, it is worth it. However, just because you graduate from a pricey college, it does not guarantee success. There are a lot of Ivy League grads out there who are just doing okay.     Also, do you have the money or are you going to have to take out lots and lots of student loans?     And what do you plan to major in? Not every department at an expensive university is stellular. Some cheaper schools are known for having better departments in certain subjects. So a lot depends on what you plan to major in and what you plan to do with it.    In the end, its not where you start, but where you end up. So if you really don't think the pricey undergrad program is worth it, you might want to save some money and spend it on a better grad program.

You have a long life to live and you have some time to try different things. While I understand you wanting to be a vet, I am not so sure that you have the ability to withstand the huge amount of science and math that you are going to have to take. This is not saying that you are not intelligent enough to do it, but that right now you don't have the fortitude.    What about looking at a different option right now? Many trade schools or tech schools offer veterinary technician certifications. You may want to go that route first. If you do become a tech, then you will have some distinct advantages when you do decide to go to vet school. You will know if you really like the work and you will have had a vet as a role model and mentor. You will know a great deal about the job, which for you is pretty important because you learn by doing.    Another thing to consider is that if you had an IEP in high school, you are entitled to the same accommodations and modifications that you had on that IEP. Take your old IEP to the student services department. All sate college are required to  follow your IEP and provide you any assistance that you had  in high school.
SAgCy83Oaa	What is your overall percentage required to "pass" the course?  If your net "score" for 70% of your grade, then the "weighted" score for that is 47.6.  So, if the required percentage for "passing" is a 60.0, then you need at least a 45% on the exam.    Formula is:  (Required Final Percentage - 47.6%) / 0.3|`|zzPniswPaa	well you have 68% and 70% is course work. So take the 68% multipled (X) by 70% divided by 100, you get 47.6. So that's 47.6% out of 70% for coursework. So in order to pass this exam, you need 50%. So make that 50%, you need to get 15% out of 30% which is the total mark of your exam grade. To make this more understandable, all you need to do is get a 50% on the exam. If you get 50% then you'll end up with a 63% in that course. Good luck.

N9VN9bwfaa	Something is "distinctive" when it's different from all the other things that somebody might at first glance think are similar.  So, for example, if we're looking at a bunch of foods on a table, we can say that all of these over here are fruits: apples, peaches, raspberries, strawberries, bananas, oranges, and tangerines.  But that one over there is distinctive because it's a carrot.  A carrot is different and distinctive as a food because it's NOT a fruit.  It's a vegetable.  But you don't put a preposition after it, so you DON'T say something is "distinctive from" NOR do you say something is "distinctive of."  Those are just wrong.  Instead, you say that the funny, old carrot is DISTINCT FROM those other foods because it's a vegetable and not a fruit.  And it has to be "from" in that phrase because that's simply the preposition that's required after "distinct."  Those pairings of adjective plus preposition are called "collocations."  I teach those and a lot of other equally exciting (well, the students think they're incredibly boring) things in my classes for students of English to speakers of other languages.  I used to have a little book on them but I gave it to the local library, but all the same stuff is in my head anyway.  I never consulted the book.

TNTFomKeaa	No, it's not too late. As long as you have been going to class and you start working now then you will be fine. If there are particular things you're struggling with, go and see that subject teacher and ask for help.   Start thinking about revising. Make yourself a sensible timetable including revision, eating, sleeping, exercise, going to see friends, family time and any extra curricular activities you do.   For maths revision you can go back through your books and work through questions you haven't already done for homework. Actually you could do all of them because chances are you won't remember the answer. As far as I remember the answers are in the back of the book. If you get some questions wrong, go and talk to your teacher.  For French, there is a brilliant book that might really help you. It's called Upgrade Your French and it has lots of exercises to help you (I was getting a D in first year French uni until I got that book and then I got an A, it's magic). Also read as much as you can in French like magazines and short stories. Try to listen to French radio (you can get it online) or watch a French movie like Amelie (put subtitles on in French if you want).   I didn't take biology or chemistry so I can't help you so much with those subjects but if you talk to your teachers they will be happy to help and suggest techniques.  The important thing is not to worry too much, and make sure you give yourself plenty of time to do things you enjoy as well as studying. These are your AS levels. I got a D in one of my AS levels because I didn't start working until March of Year 13 and I got an A at A2. I had to retake everything which was a pain but I hope it helps you understand it's not the end of the world if you do badly. That said, you are clearly smart (you got great GCSE results) and motivated to work hard from now on.   Don't worry about what your friend's parents say. In Asian cultures education is very different to in England and people have different attitudes and ideas about studying. What works for your friend and her family does not have to be true for you. They are just trying to motivate her to work, that's all.  Make yourself a revision timetable. I promise it's the one thing that will make you feel much better about the whole thing and as an added bonus it will help you get As. Good luck, you are going to do great.

When smoking a marijuana cigarette of some sort, typically a hollowed-out cigar called a "blunt", two people can participate in the blowing of a shotgun. When the cigarette is nearly burned all the way through, the lit end is placed in one person's mouth, with his lips clenched tightly on the unburning end. Another person (or both) forms a tube with his or their hands, and the person with the cigarette in his mouth exhales forcefully, forcing the smoke into the other person's mouth. A shotgun is best "blown" not with a very short blunt, but with a longer one as there is less heat built up in the "blower's" mouth. The blunt must, however, be short enough that its airway is not too blocked and letting little smoke out.

A shy person may not look you in the eyes.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Eyes can be very expressive and they sometimes reveal a person's true feelings.

i5KeHwkEaa	You have a while for the deadline, but the key to getting the most help is to apply EARLY. The earlier you apply the quicker they can get you awarded and the more grants you can get. You don't want to wait until the middle or end, because it is a basically a first come first served basis. If you wait too long, the funds ( especially grants ) may already be wiped out, which in turn will make you have to take out mostly loans.|`|dWDaieBCaa	The deadline for applying for the fafsa is June 30, 2009 for the 2008-2009 school year.

7JLb2Uwbaa	If you meant to ask "do you believe that computers as a SOURCE of information in some future time can replace teachers in the classroom?, I would have to say "NO". If it boiled down to mere sources of information, then textbooks and reference books would have done that long ago. There is a huge difference twixt merely providing information and TEACHING. No mere computer can explain a difficult concept to a student with trouble comprehending and applying the raw information, and no computer can guide a person in the extrapolation of the core information presented into broader areas.|`|jI85GYGoaa	I think you have answered your own question here.

AA12063594	June 30, 2009 is the national date~    But in order to get priority decision you must submit in February. Check with your schools' financial aid offices to see.  If your mom/dad has not filed yet you can always estimate based on last years tax records and just correct when they do file.|`|AA10176626	There are a number of deadlines, but the only really important one is the "priority aid deadline" at your school.    Every school handles its own aid program, so every school establishes its own deadline, based on the amount of time that they need to get everything processed. You will need to check your admissions materials, or the school website, to determine the appropriate priority aid deadline that was established by your school.    When the priority aid deadline comes around, the school begins to process all of the aid applications that they have received. This is the point where the school begins to allocate the pool of funds that they have available. Some forms of financial aid - particularly the aid that comes directly from the school - is limited. That means that only students who beat the priority aid deadline will wind up being considered for those types of aid.    Once the aid has been allocated, the school will send "aid offer letters" to each student who applied for aid. Your letter will tell you what forms of aid you are eligible for, and the letter will also provide additional details on what you need to do if you want to accept the aid that you have been offered. In some cases it's as easy as checking a box and mailing it back, but in other cases, you'll  need to go online and set up a financial aid account, or choose a Stafford lender, and complete additional loan paperwork. Make sure you review that information carefully.    So - get out your admissions materials, or head over to the school website, and look for the priority aid deadline. That's the big one - and the one you really don't want to miss!    Good luck - I hope this helps.

Some schools give you summer aid based on the current aid year and some base it on the following aid year. In some cases the summer aid is just done by itself completely. Most schools consider full time in the summer 6 hours or more and part time 3 hours , but it varies. Either way , there is aid to help cover it.

BmrKFfYjaa	It makes me think of a joke.    Two whales, a male and a female, were swimming side by side in the ocean.    Suddenly, the male whale spots a ship in the distance. He   recognizes it as the whaling ship that killed his father.    Filled with anger, he says to his female companion, "That's the   ship that killed my father! Let's swim closer!"    When they were close enough, the male said, "Why don't we swim   under the ship and blow air through our blow holes and break the   ship into a million pieces? That will be sweet revenge." And the   female agreed to this.    So they each took a deep breath of air, swam under the ship, and   blew enormous amounts of air under the ship. The ship flew into the   air and crashed back to the sea and broke into a million pieces.    The pair of whales started to swim off when they realized that the   sailors were not dead, but clinging to pieces of wood and floating   in the ocean.    The male whale was furious and said to the female whale, "They're   still alive, but I've got another idea. Let's swim around and gulp   up all the sailors!"    That's when the female stopped swimming, looked at the male and   said, "Oh no... I agreed to the bl*w job but I'm NOT swallowing the   seamen."|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	burning calories|`|hggAFCCIaa	moving through water.  also going well.|`|x7vrxjcIaa	pis*ing|`|KPHZmcQuaa	sharks.  big ones.  and the mermaid from the little mermaid is floating about... in 20 mangled pieces.  and all around the sound of tiny mermaid screams echo in the deep, peaceful blue sea.    *sigh*|`|ugRN86bYaa	drowning|`|pwtrrMMIaa	I think of a pool, the Olympics, freestyle, butterfly and diving.|`|6nUnfrC7aa	I think "swimming."

Like Semester 1 might be a C.  But 2 should be higher and so on.  They'll definitely not like an A followed by a C if you can't provide a good explanation for it. Don't let your grade droop. that's fatal.    Your references mean a lot to the admissions office and so do your essays. Start figuring who you'll ask for reference letters.

In addition it depends on the type of college you are trying to get in. Chances are that it is a general college and that your biology class does not count for dual credit (mean for high school and college). Thus you will have to retake biology anyways once you proceed with your college career. Now as far as the gpa if you get A's in your honors classes they will reverse the effects of the C's so it will look better on transcripts. If you are Truly worried many high schools offer summer school that will take it's place. As far as the main question start applying junior year for colleges, because they will typically send you information though-out your years. And start applying for scholarships now, because as you come closer to graduation many of the scholarships will have already been applied for.

It was the best time of my life!! I highly recommend it. It has been five years since my first program and three since my summer program. so I am not sure if it has changed much. I know they added a whole new apartment complex since then. Each apartment has 2, 4, 6, or 8 people in it. Rent is a little more expensive when there are 2 or 4 versus 6 or 8. I recommend getting 6 people room. That way you will probably be friends with at least a couple of them. Rent is taken straight out of your paycheck so you don't really have to worry about bills. You do have to go grocery shopping and buy and cook your own food (another perk of having roommates is you can share that task). There isn't any tuition, because there isn't school. There are a few classes you can take, but I don't recommend them. They are kind of a waste of time, I would rather be going to Disney and playing than sitting in a class room. I had to do one for my internship because my college required. I was a seater at all the restaurants in the Grand Floridian Resort. I got lucky, I also knew people who were serving fries at Mcdonalds at Epcot. Most people who didn't like their experience didn't put anything in it. I was going to college for hospitality management and I let my bosses know that. They helped me work in all the areas, I got to shadow the managers, I got to work in the convention center, I got to meet and greet everyone in the resort. I gained extreme knowledge and contacts from my program. It's what you put in it is what you get out of it. Good Luck!!!!!!

If you ever get stressed, count to ten, put some music on and relax for a while and then carry on with your work (obviously not when you are in school). But if you are in school and you get stressed, try to block out the idiots in the class, or tell the teacher you can't concentrate.

However, it is also important to schedule time for yourself - time where you can relax (reading, computer games, drawing, listening to music... whatever works for you) or simply think. You need to be able to breathe! Work 24/7 will overwork your mind.    Remember that whilst things will change, it won't get any harder than this.

In small amounts, it's good for you because it pushes you to work hard and do your best. The problems come when you have too much stress  It is important to talk to someone you trust such as a family member, teacher or friend if you're feeling very stressed and worried. Don't be embarrassed to ask for support. You may want to make an appointment with your GP or school/college nurse or counselling service, especially if you're finding it difficult to eat or sleep properly.  To avoid exam stress make sure you're well prepared. Good planning is the key to success. Get your revision timetable drawn up and try to stick to it. Speak to your teachers to find out if there are past exam papers you can look at, to familiarise yourself with the layout and type of questions you'll be asked. Practise completing the exam paper in the set time limit so you're more confident on the day.  Make time in your day to relax - whether it's half an hour reading a book, or a long bath in the evening. You're more likely to do your best if you relax, and you learn better if you take regular breaks. A positive attitude helps as well. If you know you've done your best, that's all that matters - exams are not the be all and end all.  Sleep and food are vital. Your body needs them for energy so don't skip meals or stay up all night revising. It won't do you any good in the long run because by the time the exam comes, you won't have any energy and your concentration levels will be low. Get some physical exercise every day. This will help keep your mood positive and help you sleep. And help you beat exam stress.  I hope i have helped and please if you need someone to talk to you can email me ive been there and done that. you will be just fine.  x|`|ZFvaSlvLaa	Revision is your key to not getting stressed, because the more prepared you are, the less you'll worry. To do this effectively, I'd suggest working out exactly what you need to revise, then making a revision timetable. I know it sounds sad, but it really worked for me - it gives you some sense of satisfaction when you can tick things off, and if you're organised it'll make you feel better.    Other than that, you can't really combat the stress: you will have some stress throughout your GCSEs, unfortunately. All I can suggest is ignoring those who don't want to learn, and concentrating on your own work, perhaps asking the teacher after lessons if she can do something about those who are jeopardising their and your grades. Then try to remember that although they're important, they're not life and death: try to get early nights, and leave time aside for relaxing.    Good luck, and try not to stress too much!|`|5418463416e8caa309a081dd29995b76aa	To keep your stress levels down, try to revise in manageable time slots and make sure you have plenty of breaks so you can consider the things you are learning and take it all in. It helps to base your revision on a scenario or event as it can help to trigger your memory.    Imagine yourself in the exam to take away any apprehension.    Just remember that although your GCSE's are important to you they are only a snapshot of how you performed in a particular subject on a particular day - they are not always an accurate portrayal of your abilities! - Everyone will be equally nervous so you will not be the only one feeling worried.

The GMAT and GRE math are comparable, both testing basic highschool math, minus trig.  GMAT verbal has reading comp, critical reasoning, and sentence correction.  GRE verbal has reading comp, vocab, vocab, and more vocab.    the scoring of the essay sections is the same on both tests, but the scoring of the multiple choice parts is not.  the GMAT gives you a combined verbal and math score 200-800, while the GRE gives you two separate scores.    since the math is very similar, i advise my students to make their choice based on their verbal section strengths.  in any case, you should take practice tests of both to see which one you do better on.    good luck!|`|zYjrwJAlaa	I had to take the GMAT because I am going to Business School for my MBA which requires a GMAT.  If you have the option, take the GRE's.  That is a more general test.  The GMAT only has 3 sections (well I shouldn't use the word ONLY it was a long test)  Math, Reading comp and Writing.    Also, I highly recommend getting one of those Kaplan books.  I got one at Barnes and Noble, it's a great refresher.

xWj2oBnyaa	You need a new study habit, nothing much to it.    I found a site that can provide you with new habits:        *          Take responsibility for yourself        Recognize that in order to succeed you need to make decisions about your priorities,        your time, and your resources      *          Center yourself around your values and principles        Don't let friends and acquaintances dictate what you consider important      *          Put first things first        Follow up on the priorities you have set for yourself, and don't let others, or other interests, distract you from your goals      *          Discover your key productivity periods and places        Morning, afternoon, or evening?        Find spaces where you can be the most focused and productive.        Prioritize these for your most difficult study challenges      *          Consider yourself in a win-win situation        When you contribute your best to a class, you, your fellow students,        and even your teacher will benefit.        Your grade can then be one additional check on your performance      *          First understand others, then attempt to be understood        When you have an issue with an instructor (a questionable grade, an assignment deadline, etc.) put yourself in the instructor's place.        Now ask yourself how you can best make your argument given his/her situation      *          Look for better solutions to problems        For example, if you don't understand the course material, don't just re-read it.        Try something else! Consult with the professor, a tutor, an academic advisor, a classmate, a study group, or your school's study skills center      *          Look to continually challenge yourself|`|gdbeVf32aa	are you looking  for study techniques? well me too i have all As and a C is S.S. uh i hate our S.S. teacher! so tell me if u get any good tips!|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	think of it this way... u only got bad grades in the classes no one likes!     i got the same but now that im in computer classes (i like) im getting 80+|`|5f9hg9craa	Here is a tip  -Exercise 20 minutes before you sleep (improves memory and concentration)  -Eat a healthy breakfast before testing  -Feel good about yourself  -Enjoy life|`|jWjoPbdJaa	sometimes tests are hard and questions can throw you.. it justs means extra revision.. and there is always the option of resits!

If you really study very hard but still want better grades, then maybe you are not studying smart.   Just like you would warm up before physical activitiy you need to warm up your brain BEFORE you start to study, then pace your study.   Do NOT study for more than 1 1/2 hours at a time. After 1 1/2 hours you should take a break, and let your brain relax for about 1/2 hour. After this 1/2 hour you can study for another 1 1/2 hours maximum.  If you try to study longer, your brain will not be able to digest all the information you are giving it.

glgsDMyTaa	depends a lot on what kind of person you are. Are you adventurous would you like living in a culture very different from yours for several months?    what are your language skills. Since you did not mention having and other language skills I would say English would be the only one you speak.  Not knowing the native language well could make you feel isolated if you had few people to talk to for so long. Do you pick up on foreign languages quickly if so that might be enough.    Had a friend go to school Japan in 11th grade. They liked it and had many good experiences with it.    Recently my son met a girl at his high school from France and she was depressed because she did not know the language very well. My son learned how to ask her to dance in French and couple of other phrases, she was happy to have someone try to talk to her in her French but there were few other times that people did this. English is more widely spoken around the world but 3 of the countries you mentioned people would not speak it as well as their native tongue or at all.    if you are someone who can be comfortable doing new things, trying new foods and pick up on languages well you could go to any of the 4 places you mention Australiatralia would be the closest in culture and English is their language as well.|`|8c93186c89eae3970a667ce7c877b082aa	Come to South Africa!!! :) Its always warm and sunny.. only cold now and then and when it is im sure that it isnt as cold as america at all!

AA10176626	Unfortunately, there is no way to know for certain. Financial aid is not based on a formula, but rather the availability of funds at your school, and how many other students at your school have qualified for assistance.    The only form of federal aid that is directly determined by your EFC score is the Pell Grant, and an EFC of 1292 will qualify you for a Pell award. Based on last year's award schedule, 1292 would qualify you for an award of $3481, which would be paid directly to your school in two equal disbursements, one for the fall semester and one for the spring. The economic stimulus bill that is presently before the House of Representatives includes a possible $500 increase in Pell awards for next year - so your $3481 could wind up $3981, if everything goes smoothly.    You will also be eligible to borrow a maximum of $5500 from the Stafford lending program, if you are a first-year, dependent student.    Other than that, it's impossible to say how much school-funded aid you might qualify for, and whether your school will have sufficient funds to offer you the federal work-study program, or any other forms of aid. If you attend school in certain states, like New York California, Georgia or Florida, you will probably receive additional assistance, like the TAP, CalGrant, Hope, or Bright Futures program.    Once your school's priority aid deadline has arrived, your school will know just how many of the freshman and returning students will need aid, and they'll begin the process of allocating it to each individual student. They'll send you an "aid offer letter", detailing all of the money that they have available to you. Some schools are better than others at meeting need, but in the current economy, every school is experiencing far greater demand than they are used to, and that could well affect how much each school can afford to help their students. Some schools are cutting back on their 2009-2010 admissions classes, so they can continue to offer sufficient financial assistance.    Good luck - I hope this helped.

r3QbyYSSaa	"Nike was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting with a variety of attributes including a wreath or sash to crown a victor, an oinochoe and phiale (bowl and cup) for libations, a thymiaterion (incense burner), an altar, and a lyre for the celebration of victory in song.  In scenes of the Gigantomachia (War of the Giants) she often appears driving the chariot of Zeus. In mosaic art and coins Nike is often shown holding a palm branch as a symbol of victory."    "She is often seen represented in ancient works of art, especially together with other divinities, such as Zeus and Athena, and with conquering heroes whose horses she guides. In her appearance she resembles Athena, but has wings, and carries a palm or a wreath, and is engaged in raising a trophy, or in inscribing the victory of the conqueror on a shield."    So, it would seem that in different depictions, she is holding different things.    Answerer  1 found a different answer, also.     Why not make a list of the different types of depictions, and what she is holding in each?

FwuyxxoWaa	In some ways they are, but also it all depends on  the teaching. These days people are taught to pass the exams, and not to be able to apply the knowledge to real life situations, which means a lot of very bright people are sidelined because they didn't get as good grades in exams that are severely flawed. The coursework aspect is also just as necessary, but the teachers need to be more responsible about things, last year (I'm year 12 now) my History teacher lost my coursework folder twice (several other people's as well), and marked everyone's badly, (one of my pieces weren't actually submitted), meaning I didn't do as well as I should have. My Maths teacher moved her deadlline to a month before it was originally placed, meaning I couldn't make it any better, and because I didn't get a really good grade in that, she pretty much gave up on helping me (I got a B in both of these). Also they do not use relative mark schemes, they are fixed, so if everyone gets 90% and that is an A grade, everyone gets an A, but if that happened, then 90% is therefore the 'average' which is meant to be a C, this doesn't happen, which means the whole higher grades are undermined by the fact that everyone gets one.|`|Pg5sIrvYaa	Yes
Dh0JX2Onaa	" Bacon's Rebellion can be attributed to a myriad of causes, all of which led to dissent in the Virginia colony. Economic problems, such as declining tobacco prices, growing commercial competition from Maryland and the Carolinas, an increasingly restricted English market, and the rising prices from English manufactured goods (mercantilism) caused problems for the Virginians. There were heavy English losses in the latest series of naval wars with the Dutch and, closer to home, there were many problems caused by weather. Hailstorms, floods, dry spells, and hurricanes rocked the colony all in the course of a year and had a damaging effect on the colonists. These difficulties encouraged the colonists to find a scapegoat against whom they could vent their frustrations and place the blame for their misfortunes."|`|UtYOwE4Laa	The freeholders wanted the native americans to back off because apparently the native americans were getting all up in thr grill, but i think they just secretly wanted to expand further west. so bacon and his followers threw their hissy fit, and you know da rest.    love,  1 kid in my APUSH CLASS!!!!!!!!!! lolz

AA10176626	Jossy:    When you submit your FAFSA to the US Department of Education, they take all that information and plug it into a giant formula that is used to produce your EFC (Expected Family Contribution) score.    Hopefully, you told the Department (on your application) where you wanted that score sent, because the financial aid office at your school are the ones who need to see it. They'll use that score to determine what forms of aid you are eligible for.    A score of 121 is low, and identifies you as an aid applicant who demonstrates "exceptional need". Traditionally, that's been about one out of every three aid applicants, but with the economy the way it is now, I suspect that EFC scores are coming in a lot lower this year, and more students will demonstrate exceptional need.    Applicants with exceptional need qualify for a special class of federal student aid - the programs known as "need-based aid". It is not possible for anyone to tell you exactly which forms of aid your school will be able to award you, but that's because some forms of need-based aid are limited, and your school will have to determine which aid applicants they can afford to distribute those forms to.    You will qualify for a Pell Grant, regardless of how many other students at your school need aid, because the Pell program is unlimited. All students with "exceptional need" will receive a Pell award. A Pell is a gift of money from the government to help you pay for school. It is unclear exactly how much you will receive, because the House of Representatives is considering a bill, right now, that may increase the Pell awards for next year. However, based on this year's Pell schedule, a score of 121 would have qualified you for a grant of $4581, if you registered as a full-time student.    Pell funds are disbursed electronically, and directly to your school, where the money will be applied to your student account, and used to pay what you owe the school for tuition and college fees.    You may receive other forms of need-based aid, including other types of grants (like the FSEOG or the SMART grant), a subsidized Stafford loan, or the federal work-study program, which provides a part-time job that will enable you to earn a little extra money to help pay for school.    You will automatically qualify to borrow from the Stafford loan program. That's the best educational loan you can find anywhere, because the interest rates are low and fixed, your credit and your income don't matter, you don't need a cosigner, and you'll have 10 years to repay the loan. Your repayment obligation won't even begin until 6 months after you leave school. If you qualify for that "subsidized" form of the Stafford, which I mentioned earlier, the government will even pick up all of the interest on the loan, while you're in school.    When the "priority aid deadline" for your school has passed, the school will begin processing financial aid awards. They will send you an "aid offer letter" that explains the types of aid that they have available for you, and the letter will provide additional instructions on what you'll need to do in order to claim that assistance.    I hope this helped you - good luck!|`|AA12063594	I think that is your EFC number.  It is used to rate your financial need and whether you qualify for it.

yJSPecgoaa	Based on your SAT scores (and possibly your GPA, especially if you're on a 4-point scale) you have a shot at getting in.  Click on the link below to see how you compare to those who enrolled at Rutgers last year:  http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/ac...     Your chances of acceptance for next fall are limited more by your having missed the application deadline.  According to the Rutgers NB website, applications for entry Fall '09 were indeed due December 1, 2008. Nevertheless, they state in finer print: "Students who apply beyond the above priority deadline will be considered on a space-available basis."    I would contact the school admissions office to see what they say about applying this late in the game for the Fall of 2009.  Their number is  732-445-info (4636).  Good luck.|`|AA10023710	Your SATs and GPA are in the range for Rutgers NB. You do have a chance of getting in there, so you should apply.     Of course, as others have already said, you've missed the application deadline. That may impact your ability to get in. But call admission - do not email - and speak directly to someone there. Ask if you can still apply, and if you can, then do so, because you do stand a shot, and Rutgers NB is a good school.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	If you wanted to apply as a freshman to start school this fall, then you have missed the deadline which was December 1st.  You can apply now to start school next spring.  I suggest that in the meantime you should join a few activities.      When you are applying for a school,  only get the application deadlines off of that schools website.  Other websites are unreliable as the school may change its deadline and the other website may not know it.  Good luck in your future endeavors.

fMU93DkIaa	THIS IS SUCH A NICE THING TO SEND!  YOUR TEACHER WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE RECEIVED IT.   (EDITS ARE IN CAPS)   [[WORDS IN THESE ARE TO BE DELETED]]    I am not sure if you remember me, but you were my third grade teacher at Masgghjkhggsd Elementary in 2003.  Today, IN MY XTH GRADE CLASS  we had a "CHARACTER EDUCATION" presentation [[DELETEby a speaker about character education]]. [[DELETE He]] THE SPEAKER [[was]] [[talking]] TALKED about teacherS who [[made]]MAKE a difference [[in our life or stood out to us]], and I immediately thought of you.  You have to be my favorite teacher. I have so many fond memories from your class; like when Kate Dicamillo came to [[out]] school and you picked her up at the airport[[,]]. [[and when]] Wwe came in first thing in the morning she was sitting there with you talking[[,]] [[and how]] WE WERE SO LUCKY BECAUSE we got to talk to her before everyone else. Or when Tom, Maryanne, Allie and I use to write the newspaper, I think it we called it the Classroom Gazette. I also remember bringING home Twilight, and how everyone had to clean his cage, and if we were good we were able to take him out on the rug. I loved how we always had class meetings, and how you inspired all of us to read. You instilled a love for reading in all of us. Unfortunately now, I dont read as often because the books we are required to read for school arent something I particularly care for.  I loved how you made everything so enjoyable. For example, when we read the book Holes, we didnt just read it we did the play after the book, and I remember that I was the fortune teller.  I still have the letters that we wrote: [[that were]] "ten things that you admire about a person in the class." I remember going to the computer lab and writing it, and then when we got our letters, we were all so excited, and curious to know who ours was from. Still to this day I am not sure who mine was from. I loved how the days were so relaxing and how nothing was forced and when we were learning it didnt feel like learning.  I am not sure if it was your classroom or the positive energy you would give off but I think that I wrote the best poetry I have ever written that year. I cant thank you enough for all of the creativity you gave me. You were a perfect role model, and your enthusiasm rubbed off on me, to always be writing and reading, and most importantly my leadership.  Writers club was the best thing ever. I loved that club so much. Not only did it help me become a better writer, but reading the poems I wrote in front of an audience[[,]] has to contribute greatly to my confidence in public speaking.  The best book I have ever read was a diary written from Marie Antoinette point of view. I remember challenging myself to read that book and I loved it. I also remember another amazing book I read called Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli, that Tom was reading and you said you read it and loved it, so I just had to read that book.  Thank you so much for the amazing memories, leadership skills, love of reading, writing, giving me the tools to success, public speaking skills, and most of all being a great role model.  I hope that all is well, and that I hear from you soon.|`|Mumfvpuzaa	send away, but you have a lot of editing to do.  read it out loud and slowly and you will find your mistakes

TWKIuTEyaa	Metaphor.    A simile would be 'seasons are like celebrations'.    Bias would be e.g. 'seasons are as good as celebrations' or 'worse than celebrations'.    A loaded word means a word which carries implications. I suppose, in this context, one could consider 'celebrations' to be a loaded word, in that one does not celebrate bad things. But as seasons clearly are not celebrations in themselves, I consider 'metaphor' to be the correct answer.|`|3492c30e32a24dabde42de93307d7dc2aa	That's a metaphor.

What you can do first is try to discover what leader/leadership is. To me and many others it is the process of social influence in which one person is able to enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task. So what you can do is go around your school trying to find people who look like they could aid or support accomplishment of a common task. This person could be a principal, because they are responsible of running the school, and making needed possible changes. After school, or during lunch, sacrifice your time to talk to the school Principal or if possible any other kind of principal), and be as organized as possible.

I've known people who weren't accepted into medical school that then went on to try for dental school and were denied. The schools like to see dedication and passion. Go 100% for medical school, don't do the backup plan. Keep your GPA up, do well on the MCAT and then get some extracurriculars going. The admission committees love to see that you have been involved in volunteering, you have clinical experience, and research if you can. Good luck!
DCPWT4feaa	These are HIGHLY colloquial abbreviations, so they're not actual contractions.  Usually, you use an apostrophe to denote where letters are missing, but you tend to use only one in a single word.  If two are required, the apostrophe tends to go at the end, rather than the beginning.    So:    Enough becomes 'nuff.    Slamming becomes slammin'.    And becomes n'.    But given how highly non-standard these words are, there are no true rules for them, so it's generally accepted to simply abbreviate them rather than punctuate them.    Generally, reserve the apostrophe for truncating two words.    I am becomes I'm.    That is becomes that's, etc.    N that's nuff said!  :^D|`|EwFcQDGRaa	No apostrophe for "ya", but put apostrophe before the "n", making it   'n.|`|KmtBSSkgaa	Neither word requires an apostrophe.  Both of those examples are slang and by definition slang is an informal language.  If you WANTED to put in apostrophes, they would go in place of the missing letter.  so I suppose "n" would become "   'n'    ".  "ya" would actually be "  yo'   ".  Now you know where "yo" came from.  A more common use of apostrophes would be shortening a gerund.  Such as talkin' instead of talking, or dancin' instead of dancing.  also be aware that both of these are still considered spelling errors and bad grammar.  If you wish to display your good grammar, use the whole word.|`|44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	Since they aren't words, you wouldn't put an apostrophe anywhere.|`|WCvciOQCaa	Well, I don't usually put apostrophes on those shortened words, but if I were to do so, I would write 'n', as in Rock 'n' Roll...I wouldn't use any on ya...

Aetr4vamaa	It's reptiles that can't see you if you stand still.  If you ever go back in time and are around a dinosaur don't move.  The confusion may be that bulls don't differentiate color.   Bulls are color blind.  It is the motion of the red cape that excites them, not the specific color red. The color red is for the audience. It adds to the pageantry of the grand traditions of the Bullfight.|`|Rw2aM6B1aa	unless its blind of course it can|`|pg5AHNcdaa	yes it could|`|t92597C8aa	Yep..Just don't run, climb a tree
TNTFomKeaa	You haven't taken your GCSE's yet so here is a chance to prove people wrong. Make your C's B's. Make your B's A's. Start now by going to your teachers and getting help if you need it, then drawing up a revision timetable. Include all your subjects, eating, sleeping, seeing your friends, exercise...  The aim is to get onto the A-level courses that you want. 4 academic A-levels at A grade (5 if you can) with good extra-curricular activities, volunteering, leadership, Duke of Edinburgh. I'm not denying that it will be hard. Oxbridge is incredibly competitive. However, if you really want it enough then I think you could work hard enough to give yourself a chance.  Good luck.|`|FWOdlpx8aa	You would need 3 or more A levels at Grade A.    However getting into oxbridge is not the be all and end all...    There are plenty of other good university that do good degrees that will start you on a good career|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Definitely not a chance.  But you havent taken them yet!! STUDY STUDY STUDY!|`|AA11604732	With all those Cs?  Probably not|`|lg2RfcrQaa	With Cs and Bs? Not a chance.|`|7XIyslo5aa	Nah, doubt it.|`|19c8NIGHaa	hhmm probably not. I was predicted sorta of the same results and completeley excelled and got 2A* and 8As so go for it i'd just go for it and believe in yourself, i didnt but got those results. :)|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	you will need at least 8A* and the rest A's - no chance with C's or B's|`|SLFt8eHEaa	To be absolutely honest, probably not.  I went to Oxford and found that most people there, like me, had a mixture of A*s and As at GCSE.  A couple may have had the odd B but we're talking literally only 1 and C's were pretty much unheard of.  If you're going to stand up to competition when applying you will need to up your game.    Having said that, as the answer above pointed out, these are only predicted grades and it is by no means certain that you will achieve these.  If you really want to go to Oxbridge I would recommend that you study as hard as possible and immerse yourself in your studies up until your exams in order to get the best grades you can.  You never know what could happen!
kKZZTb3gaa	Okk..?    I love you. Thats all there is to it.  I think about you all the time, and when I start, I cant stop.  Sometimes loving you drives me crazy, but then I see your face, and I know its all worth it.  My heart has never felt this way.  Your the most beautiful person in my world, thank you for coming into my life.  I love you.    How is that?|`|90NzgbSsaa	well can you give more details on what you want in the note
0rfojt9Paa	No more than 5 bullet points per slide and each bullet point should not have more than 5-7 words. Also, remember that bullet points are capitalized and they do not end with a period (.).|`|nOJhZveGaa	I like to try to keep 5 words per line and at most 7 lines per slide.  You just need to highlight key points.  The people are there to listen to you and not there to read.  This ensures that the font is large enough so someone standing faraway can easily read.  Also, try to use a dark font on a light background.  The format depends on the person and what you are presenting.|`|NbDudZteaa	No more than 5 bulleted points per slide, and no more than 8 words per bullet point for a neat professional help. Hope this helps:-)
ztnP1mgfaa	Are you talking about a power point presentation or something? For power points, you should always just have short sentences or phrases on your slides. You should say much more than is actually on the slide yourself. The text on the slide is only so your audience can follow along with your main points, they should be listening to you, not reading.|`|f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	Please explain what you are asking more thoroughly.

TUOAUSAZaa	No, but why? Because they have no reason to. Why would the UK/Scottish government give you money if you're not going to benefit them in their own country. Look into scholarships offered in the US. Hope this helps, good luck. :-)

Oh and the 3 has to be under 2.|`|tLB8kHG7aa	52.89 times 3 = 158.67    52+52+52=156 (52x3)  0.89+0.89+0.89=2.67 (0.89x3)    156+2.69=158.67    Hope This Helps!|`|meK1OKVvaa	52.89 x 3    First multiply 3 x 9 =27, put the seven down and carry the 2 to above 8.  Then 3 x 8 = 24 plus the 2 which your carried over from before so it's 26. Put the 6 down in front of the 8 and carry the 2.  Then 2 x 3 = 6 plus the 2 carried over means 8. (there is nothing to carry over since it's not over 10.)  Now, 5 x 3 = 15 (because there's nowhere to carry the 1 to, put both digits of the 15 down. so you now have 15867. but you see on the 52.89 that there are two decimal places, so move over two decimal places from the right... so your final answer is 158.67|`|M4xRoW4baa	it would be like:    52.89  x3.00  _____    and then u calculate it  gosh.... i learned this years ago *sigh*

Contact schools that you are interested as far as further requirements.  If you have something like a PhD, they probally won't have educatuional tests for you.
