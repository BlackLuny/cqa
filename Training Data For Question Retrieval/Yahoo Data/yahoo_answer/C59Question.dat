20070713052508AAnJWHZ	Politics & Government;Immigration	Ho sempre avuto una curiosità :qualcuno di voi è in grado di darmi qualke kiarimento in proposito?	Salve a tutti, spesso in qualke servizio televisivo in cui hanno intervistato delle persone emigrate nel nostro paese o in altri paesi occidentali ke in generale provenivano da Africa, Asia o Europa dell'est, ho sentito molti di loro dire ke, x raggiungere il nostro continente, hanno dovuto spendere un bel po' di soldi. Ad esempio 5000 euro o anke di +. Questa è una bella somma e credo ke nei loro paesi originari sia veramente una cifra elevata da guadagnare. La mia curiosità è: come fanno a mettere insieme una cifra così elevata se nel loro paese lavorano a stento e comunque nn credo ke gli stipendi siano così elevati? Avendo 5 o 10 mila euro nn sarebbe + conveniente utilizzarli x aprirsi un'attività nel posto in cui abitano?     Se x caso c'è qualcuno ke ha vissuto qsta esperienza e avesse il piacere di voler rispondere alla mia domanda, gliene sarei grato.      ps: astenetevi dal rispondere in caso dobbiate esprimere opinioni razziste o discriminanti.   Grazie.

Ich war kürzlich in London und als Touri muss man sich natürlich die Wachabl?sung am Buckingham Palace antun. War auch soweit ganz nett - bis dann Kapelle Nummer zwei anmarschierte. Und statt der "God Save The Queen" - wie man es h?tte erwarten dürfen - erfreute man uns mit "Star Wars".   Da dr?ngte sich mir glatt die Frage auf a) wieso die moderne Musik spielen (wurde mir von Nebenstehenden erkl?rt) und b) wer eigentlich für die Liedauswahl zust?ndig ist (steht zur Beantwortung hier). Trifft der Kommandierende Offizier die Auswahl oder sitzt am Ende die Queen abends am Kamin und überlegt sich, wie sie ihre Landsleute am n?chsten Morgen qu?len kann?
20070719022927AAkSIhJ	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Dolce stil novo?	Riporto parte di un bellissimo articolo; perdonate la lunghezza, ma vale la pena leggerlo:      L'altro giorno il quotidiano che si fa chiamare “Libero” pubblicava un “racconto” di tal Francesco Borgonuovo, dal titolo “Arriva l'estate, fioriscono le stagiste”, illustrato da una pregnante foto di Monica Lewinsky. L'incipit è pura poesia: “Senti il fiato caldo dell'estate e sai che arriveranno, sarà una migrazione in grande stile. Come uccelletti leggiadri le stagiste planeranno, faranno il nido per un po’, giusto il tempo di svernare, e poi se ne torneranno via così com’ eran venute”. Il seguito è ancor più lirico: “Le uniche degne di titolo, quelle purissime e illibate, vengono direttamente dalle scuole, da dove s'attinge la linfa più dolce e saporita”. Che stia parlando di amori minorenni?

He's totally against it.      He's so negative and talks down to me like I'm a retarded.      He doesn't even hear my answers for his questions when I try to explain how I have things worked out.      He just repeats it in an immature sarcastic voice, like I said something really stupid.      He thinks he can control me still, but I'm a legalized adult when I'm 18      I've never had a problem with my dad until this situation arose, it really shows me how much faith he has in me.      Besides being dissapointed in his behavior, I'm also worried as to what he can do, in December, when my flight is scheduled and cab. These are expensive tickets and such, I'm freaking out that I might miss it or something because of him.      Can he do anything legally?   Can I call the cops if he physically blocks me form going?      What can he do?      And no, I'm not burning bridges, my mom is on my side... somewhat. And they've already told me they'd always let me back home if **** hit the fan.      I have everything plotted out, Job (2), School, Food, Liviing (Roommate), honestly, I've never been so prepared in my life. And on top of it, I'm moving close to family and friends, and they're all very very supportive and will show me right from wrong as I learn how to live without my parents..      I try to explain everything to him, he just won't listen.   I've given up with that.   Honestly, he's stooping down so low as to calling the people I'll be living with to try to convince them not to let me come.      Wow, I mean, he's my dad, I love him, I'll ALWAYS be his son, no matter where on the face of the Earth I may be. I know he cares but, wow, his behavior is disgusting. He treats me like I'm incapable of like a thought process. To be honest, if he's afraid of "loosing his son," maybe he shouldn't act this way.      Anyway, are my fears just? Can he do anything?

Officer Willy was the first to arrive and believing a robbery was in progress, began to quietly enter the residence with his service weapon drawn. At this moment Gene woke up and thinking a burglar was trying to gain entrance to his home grabbed an ornamental samari sword that hung on the wall that Sally’s husband had brought back from World War II and struck Officer Willy severing Willy’s right hand.

PALERMO - Un accordo tra mafia e massoneria per ritardare i processi ai boss: è quanto hanno scoperto i carabinieri di Trapani e Agrigento che questa notte hanno eseguito otto ordinanze di custodia cautelare nei confronti di persone accusate tra l'altro di corruzione in atti giudiziari e concorso esterno in associazione mafiosa.      A darne notizia fonti investigative, che hanno spiegato che fra le persone arrestate ci sono anche un agente della polizia di Stato, un ginecologo di Palermo e un dipendente del MINISTERO DELLA GIUSTIZIA impiegato in una cancelleria della Cassazione.      L'operazione, chiamata Hiram, scaturisce da indagini iniziate nel 2006 sulle cosche mafiose di Mazara del Vallo e Castelvetrano, nel Trapanese.      Fonti investigative hanno spiegato che a beneficiare dei ritardi dei processi, oltre che i boss, sarebbe stato anche il ginecologo palermitano, accusato di violenza sessuale.

Please real republicans explain to me why he should be protected when he is a proven cheat.

Why can't Human beings just put down the guns and stop the violence. Sure, we come from many different places in this world, but that's no reason to make fun of somebody else. Why? Because their skin colour is different than yours? Because they speak a different language? Because they have different beliefs? So what if they're different than you. They're just as important as you are.       Ah, let's talk about war. That little thing that's bothering Afghanistan, Iraq, Kashmir, Columbia, Tibet, Darfur, Nagaland, Sri Lanka, Chad, and other parts around the globe. Why do people fight? Why can't they just learn to appreciate eachother. can you believe that the War in Iraq started because George W. Bush wanted the oil there? How greedy is that ... I mean, seriously, do you honestly need it that badly?   IBut I won't make you answer all of those questions. I just want you to answer this: Do YOU think world peace is possible?

I recently had my electric disconnected for non-payment which open a can of worms. I paid the bill the next day to have it turned back on. With this happening I've noticed that 1/2 of her power is tied into my power and I'm paying for. I CAN NOT gain access to the breaker box since it is on HER side of the basement. I've notified the current landlord about this but he shows NO interest in this...All he cares about is RECEIVING RENT MONEY. He tells me that he will take care of it when she leaves (if she leaves). He stated that he will not renew her lease but that isn't until Jan 09. I notified the electric company and they tell me to take it up with the landlord. She has her own meter and breaker box. She is considered to be a single mother but has a drug problem, and she receives all kind of financial assistance. She has all kinds of people living there as well, as much as 7 to 8 people in a small 2 bedroom apartment. Any help is appreciated in this

20090305035401AAomvc0	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does Obama tell Americans one thing, yet does another?	Obama told us last week that we need to watch our spending in these tough economic times, he also said during his campaign that he is like "Every other American".      So he goes against both of those, Gets courtside seats to a Bulls game a few days ago... and NOW he buys a Swing set for his daughters.... NOT just a NORMAL SWING SET ...    http://www.rainbowplay.com/index.php/swi...    Swing Set : Cost = $3499 (with tax around $3900), Delivery $549 from South Carolina, Set-up $349 = Grand Total = $4798      Basketball Game = 2x Courtside Tickets $500, Steak Dinner before game $228, Programs/drink/etc during game $75, 2x Bulls Jerseys $200 = Grand Total = $993      So glad he can tell us 1 thing, yet he is comfortable NOT following his own example.      Wait, he is just like us... we all can blow $6000 on a swing set, and $1000 on a whim to go to a game.

He did, then he lessened the amount, then stopped paying, saying "take me to Court". I did. Court granted me sole legal and physical custody, with him having mandatory supervised visitation because of what happened to the children while at his home.       HE insists that HE did nothing wrong, that the 14 year old girl who is his new wife's foster daughter and molested our 5 year old son with our 4 year old daughter watching after they were left to sleep in her bedroom when the children would visit them, even though he and his wife knew about the girl's previous history of sexual abuse against her.       HE says he will pay his support IF I allow him to be supervised by non-professionals. I, my therapist and the children's therapists all agree that he does not need LESS supervision. He was Court Ordered to attend counseling to help him understand how to parent children who have been molested. He refuses to go.      I assigned my Child Support Order to the Dept of Child Support Services and they are not collecting it because HE has decided he shouldn't have to pay if he can not see his children on his own terms, what can be done?

I'm 18 and I just got pulled over for going 45 in a 25 today.  I want to request a hearing because honestly I don't want my parents finding out and my insurance sky rocketing.  Only problem is I got pulled over this past Saturday.  This time, the cop wrote on the ticket that he estimated AND used the radar, but he started to pull out way before I passed so I know he couldn't have used the radar.  He also wrote that I was going faster than I actually was...I checked when I saw him but I was going down a hill so it can be deceiving.  The most annoying part, I was driving my very young brothers one of whom had to use the bathroom really badly and I told this to the cop who said oh yeah I know your pain I have 3 boys myself, then slams me with a hundred dollar ticket AND tries to give me parenting advice...like really?  I want to request a hearing but I don't want to waste my time...please help?
20090304183808AAW9A3U	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What can I expect this time around?	Ok, here’s my situation      I’m 22 and I’ve gotten a lot of tickets since I started driving at 18…(Most of which, when I was when I was 18-19 and hanging with the wrong crowd, always trying to have fun…Since those years, it’s been the occasional street sweeping ticket or something to that nature…)      Anyhow, My license was suspended due to me not paying the tickets (I paid some…just not all of them ) due to various reasons…No job…Moving…Low Income or no job. Anyhow,  the night my last car was impounded for good…I received a suspended license ticket. I eventually missed that court date by mistake and forgot completely about the ticket until one night with a friend from high school…he got into an altercation and since I was out with him, my name was ran and I was taken to the drunk tank for the night. I get a court date to go to court (as of now, I’m thinking the warrant and everything is from a street sweeping ticket…) I find out the warrant is for a suspended license and I was looking at 6mths…But shortly before this, I looked up the tickets and found that I didn’t owe as much for my tickets to get my license back as I was thinking and this got me to go ahead and start working on getting my license back. Last I checked before that, It was like 3700 total but since then, I was garnished for 1800 of it. So now I have 3 tickets left…I begin to work on the tickets and take out another leaving me with two 700 dollar tickets left. All of this is before I go to court for the night out with my friend…       When I show up to court, here’s my status:      -Just paid a 500 dollar ticket holding my license…      -Have two 700 remaining.      Now I go to court and explained why I missed the first date and I guess the judge found it humorous and gave me until April to get my license back. The court date was in February. But during this time, I’m also looking for a apartment since I’m engaged and we’re looking to tie the knot soon… After the court date, I get approved for an apartment and now I have to scramble to try to get the money to move in (I couldn’t let it go..I was getting denied everywhere). So now, I’m saving for the apartment instead of paying on the tickets. I’ll be done  with the apartment business next check and that leaves me with two checks before court again with 1400 to go still…Pre-apartment approval, I could have knocked out one ticket a check but since I have these new found obligations, the amount I can pay is considerably lower now (more like $100 if I’m lucky…). With all that said…I’d like help answering the following?         By making as many small payments as I can, will that help me buy some more time to chip away at these tickets?      If I got a hardship license, could that help me in anyway?      Please help, I know this is pretty much self inflicted but any useful advice would be helpful…

Many of us are having $13 a week LESS withheld from our Federal Income Taxes on our paycheck. So, we see we are getting $13 a week more in our paycheck. But as I understand it, our tax liability has NOT been reduced by that $13 . So, next year when we file our taxes, we will not get back that $676 (13x52=676). this would apply to those who normally get a refund. If you normally pay in, you would have to pay an additional $676.         Is this right?

20090305045003AA0Utea	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	In do not know about the USA but here in the UK people call the police for nothing.?	In do not know about the USA but here in the UK people call the police for nothing. They go for their mobile phones like a gun fighter would go for their guns. It seems no matter how trivial a thing is the first thing some do is call the police. There is little wonder the police have no time to deal with real crimes we have so called adults who cannot sort themselves out and the police answer far too many domestic calls even when there is no domestic violence. Neighbours fall out and instead of being adult and sorting it out and make a compromise it blows up and the mobile is reached for and the police are called.   I have been their when people have been given so many chances to calm down but they push it and end up in the cells. It is high time many in our society took person responsibility for their own action and at time if it means keeping the peace and not falling out agree to disagree and even say sorry I’m wrong.   In the UK the police are everything from social workers to baby sitters (for adults) who should be mature enough to sort out issues without involving the police. But it’s a case of who can reach for the mobile the fastest and call the police.
20090305040934AA3QsoG	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Would I get flagged by the police for this?	7 years ago at the tender age of 17, I took a friend home after hanging out one night. his folks were out of town and he locked himself out of his house. I tried to help pry open a window and ended up breaking it slicing my hand open. So that we wouldn't get in trouble for breaking a window (and he was supposed to be grounded), he told his family that someone had tried to break in and he scared them off before they could get in. The family filed a police report and had finger prints done and all that Jazz.      Well then I grew up and got married and had babies. When you are in the hospital, they fingerprint you and the child for police records. Do you think I might be in danger of being flagged for that silly night I made a stupid decision? I was also fingerprinted when I got a job for a local school district a couple of years ago.

20070102063003AA2kE0I	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Voici ce que je viens de lire sur la toile. Que dites vous à propos ?	Depuis Paris, le FPI fait le procès de la politique de la France en Afrique      Contribution – Invité à participer à l’échange organisé par le Parti Communiste Fran?ais (PCF), le 30 novembre 2006 en Hexagone, sur le thème : ?Quelle politique de la France en Afrique ??, le Front Populaire ivoirien a dénoncé l’exploitation des Etats africains par l’ex-puissance colonisatrice. Ci-dessous, la contribution du FPI à ces assises du PCF ; contribution présentée par son Secrétaire national chargé des Relations Extérieures et de la Politique Etrangère, le Dr. Assoa Adou.   Le Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), de C?te d’Ivoire, voudrait, avant toute chose, remercier le Parti Communiste Fran?ais (PCF) d’avoir bien voulu l’associer à cet échange sur ?Quelle politique de la France en Afrique ??   Le FPI remercie le PCF d’autant plus que le FPI confesse que, pour débattre de cette question interne à la France, nul besoin n’était d’inviter des Africains et notamment des partis politiques africains, puisque, seule la France peut et doit définir sa politique en Afrique. Le FPI n’oublie pas, cependant, que la France a entretenu des relations particulières avec l’Afrique.    - L’Afrique a vécu la douloureuse période de l’esclavage et la France a participé à ce commerce.   - L’Afrique a connu la colonisation et la France était encore présente dans cette douloureuse histoire de l’Afrique.    - L’Afrique n’oublie pas que beaucoup de ses fils sont morts pour la libération de la France pendant les deux guerres mondiales.   - L’Afrique a lutté pour son indépendance et le FPI n’oublie pas que des Fran?ais étaient aux c?tés des leaders africains. Le FPI voudrait rappeler et saluer à sa juste valeur la contribution inestimable du Parti Communiste Fran?ais et de ses dirigeants d’alors (Raymond Barbé notamment), à la naissance du Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA), à Bamako, au Mali, en octobre 1946. Le FPI n’oublie pas non plus que c’est apparenté au PCF que le RDA, dirigé par le président Houphou?t-Boigny, a fait ses premiers pas de lutte pour l’émancipation des peuples africains, à l’Assemblée nationale fran?aise.   Par son invitation à des Africains pour échanger sur ?Quelle politique de la France en Afrique ??, le parti Communiste Fran?ais est donc fidèle à sa ligne politique d’émancipation des peuples africains. Le Front Populaire Ivoirien voudrait l’en remercier et l’en féliciter, comme il le remercie pour toutes ses prises de positions, dans la situation de crise que vit la C?te d’Ivoire, en faveur de la légalité républicaine incarnée par le pouvoir actuel.   Sur le thème ?Quelle politique de la France en Afrique??, Le FPI voudrait articuler sa contribution sur le cas spécifique de la C?te d’Ivoire, pays qui vit une situation de guerre depuis le 19 septembre 2002, et cela en trois points :       1) La politique actuelle de la France;   2) La crise ivoirienne et la France;   3) Les propositions du FPI.      1) La politique actuelle de la France en C?te d’Ivoire      Après la période de l’esclavage et l’age de la colonisation, la C?te d’Ivoire, ancien territoire fran?ais, a accédé à la souveraineté nationale et internationale le 07 ao?t 1960. Yves Guéna, dernier gouverneur (Haut-commissaire) de la C?te d’Ivoire, indique, dans son ouvrage ?Le temps des certitudes : 1940-1969? (1982, Flammarion), le cadre de l’indépendance des pays africains dont la C?te d’ivoire. En effet, l’auteur écrit, à la page 90 de son ouvrage-témoignage : ?… les relations entre la France et nos anciennes possessions avaient pour l’essentiel une trame sentimentale qui conserva sa solidité malgré les changements formels dans nos rapports?. Et l’auteur précise, à la même page : ?La Communauté, c’était le lien direct, auquel veillait Jacques Foccart, entre de Gaulle et les Houphou?t-Boigny, Senghor, Tsiranana, etc. C’est grace à ce contact permanent que, lors de l’accession, si rapide, de tous ces Etats à l’indépendance, s’ils gagnèrent leur souveraineté, ils ne cessèrent cependant d’accepter la suzeraineté du Général?. L’acceptation de cette suzeraineté du général de Gaulle et de la France s’est matérialisée à travers des accords. C’est ainsi que le 24 avril 1961, soit un peu plus de huit (8) mois après son accession à l’indépendance, la C?te d’Ivoire signe des accords de coopération avec la France, dont l’annexe II du chapitre IV dénommé accord de défense et de sécurité, signé en compagnie du Dahomey (actuel Bénin) et du Niger, stipule ce qui suit :       ?Article 1er – Les matières premières et produits classés stratégiques comprennent :   - Première catégorie : les hydrocarbures liquides ou gazeux;   - Deuxième catégorie : l’uranium, le thorium, le lithium, le béryllium, leurs minerais et composés?.   Et l’alinéa 2 de l’article 5 de cette annexe dispose ?En ce qui concerne ces mêmes matières et produits, la République de C?te d’Ivoire, la République du Dahomey et la République du Niger, pour les besoins de la défense, réservent par priorité leur vente à la République fran?aise après satisfaction des besoins de leur consommation interne, et s’approvisionnent par priorité auprès d’elle?.   Comme on le voit aisément, la C?te d’Ivoire, si elle a du pétrole, n’a pas le droit de le vendre, au plus offrant, sur le marché international sans l’accord de la France. De même, elle ne peut pas en acheter sur le marché international sans l’accord de la France. Il en va de même pour l’assistance militaire, comme l’indique l’alinéa 1 de l’article 3 du chapitre V dudit accord consacré à l’assistance technique militaire : ?La République de C?te d’Ivoire en vue d’assurer la standardisation des armements, s’adressera en priorité à la République fran?aise pour l’entretien et le renouvellement des matériels et équipements de ses forces armées?.   C’est dans le cadre de l’acceptation de cette suzeraineté du général de Gaulle et de la France que l’économie ivoirienne est la propriété de la France : le port d’Abidjan est une propriété d’une société fran?aise, le téléphone filaire est la propriété d’une société fran?aise, la distribution de l’eau potable en C?te d’ivoire est l’affaire d’une société fran?aise. Et si la production, la construction du réseau de distribution de l’énergie (courant électrique) et l’entretien des équipements restent l’affaire de la C?te d’Ivoire, la distribution et la commercialisation de l’énergie sont la propriété d’une société fran?aise. Tout, en C?te d’Ivoire, doit appartenir et appartient de fait à la France. Faut-il rappeler que le chapitre IX de ces accords de coopération, consacré à l’économie, aux finances et à la monnaie, stipule, en son article 15, qu’un compte dénommé ‘‘C?te d’Ivoire - droits de tirage’’ et logé au Trésor fran?ais, ?est crédité notamment de la contre-valeur des règlements en devises correspondant aux exportations, ainsi que des dons et prêts en devises que la République de C?te d’Ivoire obtiendrait de pays extérieurs à la zone franc ou d’organismes internationaux?, avant de préciser, en son article 36, que ?Les relations entre le Trésor fran?ais et le Trésor ivoirien restent régies par un Accord spécial?.   Voilà un bref résumé de la politique actuelle de la France en Afrique, notamment en C?te d’Ivoire. Ce résumé montre clairement que la politique de la France en Afrique, depuis la période de l’esclavage jusqu’à nos jours, loin d’être une politique d’aide au développement des Etats africains, loin d’être une politique d’appui à l’épanouissement des peuples africains, est une politique d’exploitation et de domination permanentes des pays africains, une politique d’asservissement des peuples africains, dont la ligne directrice est la grandeur de la France. Et aucun Etat africain des anciennes ?possessions? fran?aises ne doit remettre en cause cette politique de domination et d’exploitation des peuples africains. S’il ose, il sera l’objet d’ostracisme et d’humiliation de la part de la France, comme ce fut le cas de la Guinée d’Ahmed Sékou Touré, en 1958. Et la France mettra tout en ?uvre pour que cet Etat ne re?oive aucune aide de quelque pays que ce soit. C’est ce que confesse Yves Guéna dans son ouvrage déjà cité, lorsqu’il écrit, à la page 87 : ?A ce moment-là, l’écharde dans la Communauté, c’était la Guinée qui avait voté non au référendum et notre souci, l’aide qu’elle recevait des pays étrangers, ce qui pouvait séduire les territoires fidèles? ; parce que la réussite de la Guinée d’Ahmed Sékou Touré aurait nui à la grandeur de la France.      2) La France et la crise ivoirienne      La politique d’exploitation et d’asservissement de la France en C?te d’Ivoire ne posait aucun problème tant que le peuple, dans son ensemble, ignorait son expression et tant que les dirigeants qui l’ont acceptée, secrètement, demeuraient au pouvoir grace à l’appui de la France. Mais voici que, en octobre 2000, le peuple ivoirien, usant de son droit à l’autodétermination qu’a tout peuple (Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme), fait parvenir au pouvoir d’Etat des intellectuels soucieux de l’émancipation de leur peuple, du développement de leur pays et donc d’une gestion saine des ressources de ce pays. Ces intellectuels, dont la tête de file est Laurent Gbagbo, actuel président du pays, veulent ?gouverner autrement? en procédant à une ?refondation? de l’Etat de C?te d’Ivoire, tant au plan intérieur qu’au plan extérieur.    Au plan intérieur, le FPI veut approfondir la démocratie en donnant le pouvoir au peuple (collectivités locales) par une décentralisation ; assurer à tous un bien être par une Assurance Maladie Universelle (AMU) et la scolarisation gratuite de tous les enfants ivoiriens en age d’aller à l’école. Au plan extérieur, le FPI veut diversifier, dans l’intérêt du peuple ivoirien, les relations économiques de la C?te d’Ivoire, sans pour autant rompre les anciennes. Cette volonté de ‘‘gouverner autrement’’ et notamment la volonté de diversifier les relations économiques de la C?te d’Ivoire, qui procède d’une véritable révolution nationale démocratique et pacifique, est à l’origine de la guerre que vit le peuple ivoirien depuis plus de quatre longues et dures années. C’est pour cette raison que la France n’a pas voulu actionner, au début de la guerre, les accords de défense qui la lient à la C?te d’Ivoire en prétextant un conflit ivoiro-ivoirien, accords déclarés caduques de fait par la France elle-même, par la voix de sa ministre de la défense, Alliot-Marie. Et pourtant, dans ce conflit qualifié d’ivoiro-ivoirien, la France n’a pas voulu inviter, lors de la table ronde de Linas-Marcoussis, les dirigeants de l’Etat de C?te d’Ivoire agressé. Comment peut-on imaginer résoudre un conflit entre un Etat et ?sa? rébellion en écartant des discussions l’Etat agressé ? La France a réussi ce coup de génie parce qu’elle ne veut pas des dirigeants ivoiriens qu’elle soup?onne d’indépendantistes, comme au bon vieux temps de la lutte des peuples africains pour leur indépendance. Cela explique pourquoi la France, prétextant la mort regrettable de soldats fran?ais à Bouaké, a tué, en novembre 2004, des manifestants ivoiriens aux mains nues dont le seul crime est la défense de leur pays. Cela explique pourquoi la France veut absolument installer, à la présidence de la République en C?te d’Ivoire, un homme lige qu’elle peut manipuler à sa guise. C’est également ce qui explique pourquoi la France, au regard de son projet de résolution 1721, veut absolument une C?te d’Ivoire sans Constitution, comme si la Constitution fran?aise devait encore avoir cours en C?te d’Ivoire, comme du temps de l’Empire fran?ais ou de la Communauté fran?aise, avec un statut particulier pour les indigènes que seraient toujours les Ivoiriens. C’est également ce qui explique pourquoi la politique de la France en Afrique s’applique selon le système de ?deux poids, deux mesures?. En effet, dans des anciennes ?possessions? fran?aises d’Afrique (Burkina Faso, République centrafricaine, République du Congo, etc.), des candidats sont écartés de l’élection présidentielle sans que la France ne réagisse. Dans d’autres Etats africains, des Africains sont expulsés parce que non-nationaux de ces Etats, sans que ces Etats soient taxés de xénophobes. Et pourtant, c’est l’élimination de certains candidats qui est reprochée au président ivoirien qui n’est pas responsable de cette situation, puisque n’étant pas au pouvoir au moment des faits. Et le peuple ivoirien, qui accueille sur son territoire plus de 26% de sa population en termes de non-nationaux est taxé de xénophobe.   Mais, les dirigeants ivoiriens rejettent, ici et maintenant, la suzeraineté de la France et du président Chirac. Chirac n’est pas de Gaulle et Gbagbo n’est pas Houphou?t-Boigny. Et le peuple fran?ais au nom duquel le président Chirac définit et applique sa politique de la France en C?te d’Ivoire, doit le savoir : la C?te d’Ivoire et le peuple ivoirien ne veulent plus de comportements paternalistes de la part des dirigeants fran?ais, et les Ivoiriens n’acceptent plus la suzeraineté de la France et n’adopteront plus, en conséquence, des comportements de sujétion. Alors, quelle politique de la France en Afrique en général et en C?te d’Ivoire en particulier ?      3) Les propositions du Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI)      Pour le FPI, et cela a été dit plus haut, il appartient à la France et à la France seule de définir sa politique en Afrique. Toutefois, le Front Populaire Ivoirien voudrait affirmer haut et fort que tout peuple a droit à l’autodétermination, au respect et au bonheur. Et même si le général de Gaulle a appris à tous qu’un pays n’a pas d’amis, un pays n’a que des intérêts, le FPI voudrait dire que la France a le droit de choisir ses amis dans le respect de ses intérêts. Elle n’est point obligée d’aider un pays, et toute amitié peut être rompue si au moins une des parties n’y trouve plus ses intérêts, comme ce fut le cas de l’amitié franco-algérienne. Personne n’en voudra à la France de ne pas aider un pays comme la C?te d’Ivoire, car l’aide n’est pas obligée.   Mais, si le peuple fran?ais le veut, la France, ce pays qui se veut le pays des libertés des hommes et des femmes, de l’égalité des hommes et des peuples, et de la fraternité entre les peuples, peut accompagner, sur le chemin de leur émancipation, les peuples du monde en général et les peuples africains en particulier. Mais cela doit se faire sans coercition et dans le respect des peuples, suivant le principe de l’égalité entre les Etats et le principe d’avantages réciproques. Et cette politique de la France en Afrique, il appartient au peuple fran?ais de l’indiquer, de fa?on souveraine, à ses dirigeants. Toutefois, pour le FPI, les Fran?ais doivent comprendre que depuis 1960, la C?te d’Ivoire a privilégié sa coopération avec la France, mais le tête-à-tête de 46 ans n’a pas permis à la C?te d’Ivoire d’accéder au stade de pays industrialisé malgré ses énormes potentialités en ressources naturelles et en ressources humaines. Sans donc renier cette amitié historique franco-ivoirienne, le FPI estime que la C?te d’Ivoire doit diversifier ses partenaires internationaux, et la France n’a pas d’autres choix que de l’accepter. Par ailleurs, pour le FPI, la France doit soutenir les démocraties naissantes en Afrique, et laisser l’Afrique prendre son destin en main en renon?ant à la vassalisation des Chefs d’Etat africains, pour résoudre le problème du sous-développement et mettre fin à ces spectacles odieux de candidats à l’immigration qui se noient en mer, ou chassés comme des bêtes de somme sur les barbelés des frontières hispano-marocaines et d’ailleurs.    C’est en ces termes que la France et le peuple fran?ais peuvent aider l’Afrique en général, la C?te d’Ivoire et le peuple ivoirien en particulier, à partir de la France elle-même, en influen?ant la politique des ses dirigeants, comme le peuple fran?ais a su le faire lors de l’assassinat du Chilien Allende. Les dirigeants du FPI se souviennent que le peuple fran?ais avait bloqué les ports fran?ais pour boycotter les produits du Chili de Pinochet. Quant au Parti Communiste Fran?ais, pour contribuer à la définition de cette politique de partenariat dans l’égalité avec le peuple de C?te d’Ivoire, il doit sensibiliser le peuple fran?ais, par l’organisation de conférences sur la crise ivoirienne, et des reportages sur cette crise, reportages qui pourraient être publiés dans des journaux fran?ais. C’est une piste à explorer si le PCF agrée l’analyse du FPI. Mais le PCF est souverain et le FPI ne lui donne son avis que parce que le PCF l’a sollicité, amicalement. Et le FPI salue à sa juste valeur cette marque d’amitié et de respect dont il est honoré.

Mr. Obama didn't run promising larger deficits -- but now is offering record-setting ones. He'll add $4.9 trillion before his term ends and $7.4 trillion if given a second, doubling the national debt in five years and tripling it in 10. Mr. Obama's deficits will be much larger than he admits because he relies on rosy economic assumptions and gimmicks that mask spending and debt (like assuming popular new programs he supports won't be renewed).      Nor did Mr. Obama run promising more earmarks. Instead, he said he'd reform the earmark culture and "scour the federal budget, line by line, and make meaningful cuts." Now he wants to wave through a $410 billion omnibus spending bill with about 8,500 earmarks. This is on top of the $787 billion stimulus bill signed into law two weeks ago.

20090305050502AA43Psp	Politics & Government;Government	How come nobody talks about abolishing the Federal Reserve to fix the economy?	Any person educated on the subject of government, should know what the Federal Reserve is and why it hurts the nation, and why its responsible for our economic crisis. The Federal Reserve is privately owned by big-time bankers who literally create money out of thin air and loan it to our government at interest. Creating a never-ending string of debt. The only way the government can pay off the debts, is to borrow more money. If the government printed its own money, this would be infinitely better, no debt. But we let this federal reserve system cheat its way into our nation, so that it could act like a cancer and rot the country from the inside out. What could be more obvious when you look at what President Wilson said after he signed the federal reserve act.          I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.       ~ Woodrow Wilson      People really need to open their eyes to this. This is no conspiracy theory crap, this is real and factually indisputable. Educate yourselves.

20070510065405AAD8Dzs	Politics & Government;Politics	Look, I'm totally in favor of immigration reform, but I have a question?	Why are Republicans who normally say the government doesn't have the right to tell corporations what to do with their money suddenly on the bandwagon for telling them they can't loan money, sell goods and services or provide housing to illegal immigrants?      Perhaps the government should stay within the government's power and tighten up the immigration process, rather than infringing on the rights of a corporation to make money?      You can't have a double standard.  You either allow corporations to be financially autonomous or you don't.
