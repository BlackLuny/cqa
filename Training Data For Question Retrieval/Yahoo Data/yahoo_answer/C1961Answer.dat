qgk2XJpiaa	If you are looking for strictly a music player, I would go with the likes of the ROKR (your choice), due to the fact that it syncs with Apple's iTunes.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions would be the Sidekick, but if you really want to treat yourself I would suggest the T-Mobile G1, it's currently the best phone on the service and it has an amazing operating system, Google Android.

Examples of HD sources are: Xbox 360, PS3, Blu-ray(not Upconvert DVD), and HD cable or satellite.|`|UinOWcMUaa	It probably has a(n) HD component built into it.. but to watch TV in HD you will need an HDMI cable and the hd turner box from the cable company ! Be careful with the plasma and set the burn in cycle on it to prevent burn in. Also, playing video games on a plasma is highly risky so make sure your TV is set to recycle mode, to prevent burn in.

It's also possible that the bulb(s) are getting old and need replacing.
5wU0Jyc2aa	It depends on what type you have. But most likely you need to use the Blackberry desktop manager software. Through it you have the option of adding themes, apps, music, etc. You have to add it as an app, just click the option to add an app or theme then navigae to the file you downloaded and run through the steps. Oh yea and make sure you connect the phone to the pc.

1gqrH9Ykaa	What kind of iPod is it? Is it a video, or classic?<br>  Add details telling me, and I'll come back and edit my answer.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Okay, that's good. The 30 GB should show up as a drive under Windows Explorer (you get here by right clicking the start button and selecting explore -- assuming you're not on a mac). Just scroll to the bottom of it to find your hardware (the iPod) and navagate to the folder with the music. You may need to unhide some folders since Apple likes to be sneaky with their stuff.<br>  <br>  If you don't know how to do this, in the windows explorer press F10, click tools>folder options. Click on the tab that says "View", look for where it says "Hidden files and folders" and click on the circle that says "Show hidden files and folders". <br>  <br>  Once you navigate to the right folder in your iPod'd drive where you can see your music, copy and paste all of the files from the folders that start with the weird names like "f01" "f02" or something into your iTunes library on your computer.  I don't remember what the titles of the folders are exactly, but the file names shouldn't show the names of the songs. They should be encrypted in some sort of code.<br>  Anyway, be sure to copy all of the files, not the folders, because I'm not sure if it works that way. (Note: this will be very painstaking as you have to open each folder to get each of the files and do it over and over again with each folder. I haven't found a way that's faster, but it works. ;] )<br>  You should now, hopefully, have all of your music on your iTunes library.<br>  Next, just sync your new 80 GB to your iTunes library, and you should be good to go. <br>  <br>  I hope that wasn't too confusing. It's been a while since I've messed with an iPod that shows up as a drive.<br>  Anyway, hope I helped. :D<br>  <br>  If you still need help feel free to email me.
3mN1ceNDaa	www.

Haha, yeah, and they have to stick their hand in to get it too. That happened to my dad, except he didn't drop it in the toilet, he almost drowned and he had his cell phone in his pocket.<br>  <br>  Well, basically, all you can do is get a new cell phone. It would be easy to switch your number to that phone, but you are going to have to meet the people and get their numbers back.
VJ1C5JsYaa	As all electronics can over heat and should not be over used it is ill advised to leave your Xbox on for such extended periods of time. You increase the risk of it overheating and getting RRoD. Really you should only have it on while you are using it. If your point to keep it on so long is to download then you can leave it on however I would recommend you give your system a few hours of downtime everyday to cool off. If your afraid you might forget about it there is also a system option to auto shut off after 6 hours of inactivity. Meaning if no input signal is given in 6 hours it will turn off. So if you are using it though it will not turn off untill 6 hours after you are done with it.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	james said it all. i<br>  if you want to on it for a long period, maximum for 12 hours with the cooling unit.|`|k9j6XEejaa	i wouldnt recommend it. this will most likely increase your chance of getting 3 red rings.
DHMoBx5haa	You can get multi zone players easily, but local zoned players won't play it.<br>  Looks like playstations won't work out of zone - see source. <br>  <br>  If you don't know what "hack" means, don't even go there as you're more likely to break your drive completely than anything. You'd need to be a technical guru.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	In its stock condition, no, for NZ players are Region 4.<br>  <br>  You will need to hack the player to play all regions, or rip the movie to computer and re-write to DVD.
bocBnKfcaa	I don't think you can.  It uses a unique number to dial into your inbox which would cost money anyway to dial.  The only way is to use included minutes otherwise...
bqpcecWXaa	then, you probably messed up somewhere in the process. i unlocked and jail broke my iphone as well and everything is working fine. this is my 5th time doing it and so far no problems. i recommend going to some kind of cellphone clinic. you can go to youtube and find videos specifically for your problems, because im pretty sure others have messed up as well.  the directions are usually on the right side of the vids on youtube and they tell you exactly what to do and what programs to download to get the job done. hope this helped u out.

VJ1C5JsYaa	First off you are much less likely to get the RRoD with the Jasper chip as it is the newest chip for the Xbox and uses less power. Less power through the system means it stays cooler. It still can get the RRoD but you have much better odds of it not getting it.<br>  <br>  Secondly you should not use the intercooler! This is more important if you have the Nykos intercooler also. MS states that you are more likely to get a RRoD with this device and it does not work as told. I would simply avoid using all intercoolers. As long as you keep the system in an area when it can vent you will not have any problems.<br>  <br>  I myself have a launch date 360. I keep in on my hardwood floor on its side away from the wall. I have played for more then 20 hours nonstop before and never had a problem of any type.|`|k9j6XEejaa	i would probably use it if you have it. because anything that will reduce the risk of getting rrod is excellent.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Don't use the intercooler.  It doesn't work, and will void your warranty.<br>  <br>  The Jasper version of the 360 is the least likely to get the RROD due to both of its processors being smaller, using less power, and therefore generating less heat.  It really shouldn't be a problem anymore.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	use the intercooler as it can reduce the chances of getting the RROD. and the jasper is the latest and the best chip so far. it uses lesser power and produce lower quantity of heat<br>  so, you wont even get the RROD if you use the cooling unit with it (but do not on it over 12 hours)
CHJdKAD9aa	EA Sports Cricket 2007 is good but play it with 5 stars (difficulty level).<br>  Brian Lara is ok too but not as good as Cric 07 IMHO.<br>  <br>  Where to get it.... buy it at a store!

42tTsVuxaa	The quickest way is if you have a memory card reader in your PC just take the memory card out of your camera and put it into your PC, windows will pick it up as a drive and you can use windows explorer to get you pics.<br>  <br>  If you have to use a USB. Install the software for it and then plug it in. windows will now set it all up for you. You should be able to go to windows explorer and find the camera open that up and then look for the files you want. <br>  <br>  Age doesn't matter, even us old uns have to ask questions, sometimes<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR|`|a8hbGnlOaa	is it a digital camera if yeah just plug it in threw the usb and drag and drop or depending on the camera a message will come up when connected to your computer and ask you if you want to copy your pics and stuff if its a video camera it depends on what kind you have <br>  sorry maybe add some more detail to your question|`|jje1mNJEaa	depends on the camera

AA10179458	What do you mean scratch? DTV will require a better signal. If the signal is weak then you will not receive a picture.|`|xQm3qOfUaa	From your description, it kind of sounds like you may just have poor reception, however, I would expect to see your picture start looking grainy and noisy before I would expect to hear the sound go bad.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that by DTV you are referring to the digital converter box that will be needed when the off air stations go digital only.<br>  <br>  Analog signals can be weak and give you poor reception of both picture and sound.  If you are getting "off-air" signals (channels 2-13) direct from the local stations, then using a DTV converter may help.  However, if you are getting your signals from "translators" (channel numbers from 14 and up), then the DTV box will not help you because at this time there are no plans for translators to go digital.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about digital is that it is either an ON or OFF signal and it's a lot more "forgiving" than the old analog types.  What would be a marginal signal for an analog station, may be rock solid on digital.<br>  <br>  One other consideration is aiming your off-air antenna. If it's not aimed correctly, you won't get the best signal.  Sometimes they were never aimed properly to start with, or they may have shifted in the wind.  I'd check that simply by having a friend help you with one person looking at the TV while the other rotates the antenna.  Use a cell phone if you can't shout back and forth.<br>  <br>  And if it is all about signal strength, places like Radio Shack sell booster amplifiers to put in between your antenna and TV.  These should be placed as close to the antenna as is possible.  Some are either On or Off, while others have a gain control.  It is possible to have too much signal with an amplifier.

UphoLYGYaa	More than likely it shut off when it was accessing the HDD.  That is why that warning pops up "Do not shut off system when HDD light is flashing".  Because doing so interrupts the writing (saving) of data onto  the HDD and corrupts it.  The file isn't saved in its proper format, so it is no longer usable.  Obiviously you shouldn't shut it off when the little orange light by the usb ports is flashing, but since it seems to have shut off unintentionally there isn't much you can do about it.  Sucks, but you'll just have to start over.

nP1SZuUlaa	Okay, I'm going to preface this answer.<br>  <br>  The control scheme with the Wii remote is absolutely flawless.  Once you start using it, you're used to it in seconds.  IR aiming can't be topped by any dual-analog bull, and you really get into the game.  Really, it's very intuitive and you barely feel like you're playing a different game if you played it with a traditional controller.  I used the PS2 controller, and when I played the RE5 demo, it felt sluggish going back to dual analog when I had the precision of IR aiming.  It is simply the best experience RE4 can offer.<br>  <br>  Now then...<br>  No, no gamecube controller.<br>  But I implore you to buy this game.  It is my absolute favorite Wii game, and it's in my Top 5 all-time.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Yes, you can use the GameCube Controller (or Classic Controller). To use the Gamecube Controller, just have it plugged into slot 1, then on the title screen, unplug the Nunchuk from the Player 1 Wiimote. This will pass control over to the Gamecube controller, and revert the aiming system back to that of the Gamecube version of the game.|`|9roHz7ZTaa	No, it only uses the Wiimote and Nunchuck.|`|LczzUVAMaa	Sorry man but no dice!

Always ask for communication in writing.<br>  <br>  If no one accepts your written communication, send them an email (bcc your email ID) or by Registered Post.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later, there is going to be a dispute of non-payment. Better get started right now. Write down the names of persons u have spoken to in the past for this regard, and save the complaint numbers too.

b4mhcOy6aa	its all a bit of a grey area as the software itself is open source made by ppl at home but its when u use it to modify the wii that it becomes a little bit hazy im really not sure what ur aloud legally on ur machine i think it all comes down to what ur using it all for obviously game backups are ok if u have the originals but not if its piracy i think the best way to stay out of trouble is not hurting nintendos large pockets lol|`|jKc7aDCwaa	The Homebrew Channel itself is not illegal, as are true homebrew games and apps that don't circumvent copyright protection. Having backup loaders on your Wii is illegal, as they circumvent copyright protection. In the US, even using backups of games you own is also illegal since it violates Nintendo's EULA, regardless of what the DMCA says on fair use. I believe Sony and Microsoft have had successful lawsuits against people just for breaking their EULAs, regarding backup copies of owned games.|`|l8xi0rkvaa	it is but i woundnt worry about it|`|IUBRlWfFaa	Yes, 100%. But some of the actual Homebrew is NOT COMPLETELY.<br>  (e.g. Backup Loader, Starfall aren't illegal, but some frown upon them, if you get my drift.)
JGMtvQ2oaa	don't use Limewire, first of all.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Your best bet is to google the certain games you want. Try googling "Xbox 360 (game name) label(or cover)"<br>  However a few I know off are. They don't have them all but they do have some. Otherwise you should look into a labeling program. A lot of the newer programs have labels for the 360 and other console games.<br>  <a href="http://www.freecovers.net/browse/xbox_360/12.a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecovers.net/browse/xbox_36...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.customaniacs.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=470" rel="nofollow">http://www.customaniacs.org/forum/forumd...</a>

Hook up your ipod<br>  3. Mine auto-syncs, but not all are set to do this. So, if it doesn't auto-sync, then go to the sync tab, click on videos, make sure the video you want is checked on the list of videos, and then click sync.

fR2Geezcaa	The converter box is not meant to go with cable. It is for the replacement of an antenna (aka rabbit ears). You need to call your cable company and they will bring out a new box for free. <br>  <br>  Odds are they will tell you your previous cable package no longer exist and you will need to switch to a new package. Don't worry though I am saving $25.00 a month since upgrading with my cable company and I get approx 500 more channels than I used to/|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	You obviously don't bother to read any instructions, do you?<br>  <br>  a) Most Converter boxes  don't work with cable. They are designed for off-the-air transmission only<br>  <br>  b) If you get basic analog cable, you probably don't get any digital channels to begin with.<br>  <br>  So. a) order digital cable, b) gat a set-top box from your cabl eprovider.<br>  or, connect an antenna to your converter box.|`|lrMCiDnraa	The converter box works with over the air broadcasts you need to hook up a antenna to the converter box for digital channels.|`|557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	There are two ways to get digital channels from your cable company.<br>  <br>  1 - rent a digital box and subscribe to digital cable. This will cost you extra monthly fees from the cable company.<br>  <br>  2 - buy a new tv with QAM tuner.  Most cable companies are broadcasting network tv (ABC,CBS, NBC, FOX) digitally that QAM tuners can pick up.  This will not cost you anything more - except the cost of a new tv set.<br>  <br>  The converter box has an ATSC tuner NOT a QAM tuner so it can't be used with cable - only with an antenna.

09fa12a26541d585c238c7bb5ea61641aa	This sounds more like a reception problem rather than a TV problem, since it appears only for certain shows.  You need to give more information about your setup: signal source (antenna, cable, satellite, DVD, etc.) and any conditions connected with the problem (time of day, station, program, etc).  Double images or outlines occur on analog transmissions when there are reflections from nearby buildings (always there) or airplanes (temporary).|`|usIma0vIaa	<a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm</a>|`|UinOWcMUaa	Try unplugging all you connections and hook it back up -- e-mail me if this worked ??

Ml3FH7V2aa	Well, it will have damaged the power circuits in the printer. There are several components that can be damaged by overvoltage.  It may be possible to fix, but the expense would be better spent toward another printer. Labor is expensive and getting a tech to spend an hour diagnosing, and then another one replacing the bad parts to also find the processor and other parts damaged probably isn't worth the expense.<br>  <br>  Several Pixma's are under $100 (depending on model) most shop labor rates are 50-75/hr. So you decide.. it if were mine, I'd take the opportunity to upgrade unless you know how to do the repairs yourself.<br>  You can always take it in to see, check the "estimate" costs if you decide to take it in for service.

If no files or folders are visible when you use the laptop then you will need to use a file recovery program to get your pictures back. It will not recover all of them perfectly, but you should get most back.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if your A1000IS has carried out a low level format of the card then it's unlikely that anything can be recovered.

After you have recovered your pictures, it would be advisable to do a low level format of the card (page 50 in the manual).

I51RUYZraa	This is a pain in the ace and no amount of defragging or chkdisk is going to solve the problem, the virus is running as an administrator process and/or fooling the computer into thinking it is required for environment sustainability.  These are notoriously horrible for removal and I usually recommend customers do a clean install of Windows or use the recovery disk because removal involves manually deleting the executable and all of its remnants including but not limited to registry keys and corrupted system files.  If you have corrupted system files in the windows folder, you can initiate a system restore either using a recovery disk or D2D and during the first page you would select repair my computer, this will check and replace all of the pertinent windows files that have been changed or deleted, if you have trouble doing this, you can always just do a system recovery and blow it all away.  I do apologize if it comes to this, specially if you have important files such as pictures and multimedia but as much as I hate to sound rough, if you wanted any of it bad enough, you make backups.|`|wCDIVS4Haa	And let that be a lesson  to downloading "free" movies/games that really aren't free.

AA10271957	Possibly you did something wrong during the process. Restoring is easy but takes about 2 hours. Start itunes and then plug in your phone. If it says it doesn't recognize it then you must hold the home and power button at the same time, while connected to itunes, until itunes recognizes your phone (about 10 seconds), then it will ask if you want to restore everything or you can click restore.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I smashed the damn thing on my ceramic tile floor after 3 days and had to get an exchange. Another thing I hate about it is the battery doesn't last for ****. Another thing is my g/f wants to carry on a conversation and I find the format not suitable for that use.

It's been my experience that if you pay it after they shut it off, they will turn it back on without letting you know it's on and then they will bill you even if you didn't watch it.  I totally refused to pay for two months after they shut mine off and I paid them.  I was just going to leave it off (one less thing to pay) and they turned it back on without telling me and they didn't send the bill for the first month.  One day I got a call telling me they were going to shut it off if I didn't pay.  Well, you can imagine what I had to say.  Yahoo won't let me post it.  I never did pay that bill and there's no court in the country that would make me pay it.

a5de4b81a056634d9c13fe1f89c8532eaa	According to the articles that i've read, people will be able to connect ipods to the iphone. It hasnt been said as to whether or not the iphone would be compatible with an ipod dock but i imagine if sales of the iphone resemble that of ipods it might be so, yet it was stated that the iphone pulls music off of the ipod so i guess it would actually be pointless, unless of course apple would create something new...why not a mega dock called simply the "idoc" or something which could have the speakers to play music like the docks now, but would also recharge the iphone...hell who knows, but if they do...remember where you saw the idea first.

The current technology (doped silicon) will probably never go this fast, but in the past, every time we've run up against what seemed like a hard roadblock, we found a way around it.  Only a few years ago 1GHz seemed an unreachable goal even to the researchers in this field.<br>  <br>  Moore's Law says that computer technology (speed, density) seems to double every two years.  250 times is a bit less than 8 doublings, so you should have your answer for sure sometime in 2014.<br>  <br>  NRen2k5 the sequel's answer is also correct; for the moment at least the focus is on doing more work per Hz (as with multiple cores) rather than faster clocks.  This has as much to do with power reduction as speed limits, though.  We may well see another burst of speed improvements in the coming years.|`|047a188fbaf06daf127d5762d5676eb1aa	yep we will have but not while Intel have a monopoly on CPU's.<br>  You'd have had 2gig a lot faster if Intel hadn't bought out a company called Strongarm who were producing 2gig chipsmore then 3 yrs before intel decided to release them.|`|accfbd78e3c156e1fa2dd004626b1057aa	Maybe, maybe not.<br>  <br>  We might just be at about as fast CPU's can go.

ad05639dc339c14f3bf255e9d4b9041baa	Honestly PS3 games look like PS2 games on an SDTV. I got a PS3 on release day and for a while I was playing over composite cable (SD resolution). Madden 2007 looked pretty much identical to me on the PS3 vs PS2. Then I went out and bought an HDMI cable for 1080i and the difference was like night and day.<br>  <br>  Bottom line -- you need an HDTV to get the most out of your PS3.|`|AA10803194	On a standard TV it looks great, on a HDTV it looks amazing, sharper colors, bolder colors, clearer(not blurred like stdv) ITs like puting on glasses.
dc3aaa83c677145c0949074392c303e5aa	Have you made sure that you have the HDMI cable connected properly to both the TV and PS3?  Make sure it is in right side up and in all the way.  Sounds like a dumb answer I know, but I work at an electronics store and you would be amazed at how many times customers have brought stuff back only for us to discover that all they needed to do was hook it up properly.  If that dosen't work, try another HDMI cable.  Sometimes, there is a defect in the cable and it won't work.  If a different cable doesnt work, try hooking it up with another format like composite video.  If that works, then something is wrong with the HDMI port on one of the two devices.  If this is the case, contact the place you bought the TV and PS3 from and see if you can still get them replaced under warranty.|`|fCl7qwD2aa	you could try connecting componant cables up to it.

Of course there are free PSP download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.<br>  <br>  But there are other sites that offer free PSP downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many PSP songs, games, and movies as you can handle forthe rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.<br>  <br>  So once you paid your membership fee you have free PSP downloads for life.

94ffec2f4eabdbe0cbcff218a390484caa	Hey, Rita. So you want to know how an Ipod works. I have an Ipod too and it's pretty unique. I have a 30GB Ipod Video (Black) and once you get all of your songs into the ipod, your ipod will automaticlly organize all of your songs. The 30GB can carry up to 7,500 songs. The song are all organized by artist, ablums, genre, etc. You can also make your own playlist in itunes of your favorite songs and name the list. Then once you plug your ipod to your computer, you'll have your playlist there. However, if for example, you didn't like a specific song in your ipod. You cannot delete it from the Ipod itself. You have to go to your computer and delete your song from itunes. Then connect your Ipod to your computer and the ipod will read that that the song has been deleted and will remove it from your Ipod. <br>  <br>  There are so many things you can do with your Ipod. You can put phone numbers of your family and friends, put in up to 25,000 photos, have an organizer calander, (like, your very own schedule), Play games (like Pac-Man, Tetris, Zuma etc. But only for the Ipod Video, the games won't work on the nano). Also the Ipod has a Screenlock. What this is, is that you can actually lock your Ipod from anyone who steals it and have your very own combination. I lock it from my little brothers and sister all the time. lol. If, say you forgot your lock combination and you can't open your ipod, just connect it to the computer and the ipod will unlock.

PeGFA6Wnaa	do they leave a number to call back?  if it is a debt collection agency then i would imagine they would leave you a way to get back in contact with them to pay the money.  just listen, then call that number and tell them to stop calling you.  there is no way to block someone from calling you short of changing your number.  i bet a quick call will solve the problem.|`|zAkPpIjaaa	You need to answer it when they call and let them know that you arent the person who they are looking for. collection agencies are ruthless bitchies..and they will keep calling. They will stop if you tell them that you arent that person and you dont know that person.|`|602eb8b9f3eeb9a4df562245f12b7f11aa	You will probably have to listen thru the whole message to get a phone number for the company so that you can call them and tell them that they harrassed poor Eduardo so much that he lost his job and had to sell his cellular to you and that you would appreciate it if they would remove that number from his account.  Make sure you get the name and extention number of the person you speak with and mark it on your calendar in case it continues.  Companies can get fined for calling cellular numbers when they have been asked not to but they have to do it a certain number of times in a year.  Write down each time if they continue to call.  <br>  You also may want to check with the carrier to see if you can put a block on that area code if it's not one you need to be able to receive calls from. <br>  Good Luck

It's sound is less and memory is not extendable.You would have purchased z550 i, Its price is 7000 Rs and this cell  is having full features. Memory is etendable and a cool cell phone with less money. Now if you want to download any thing for your k700 i mobile from computer, you should have USB cable with you. It will cost you 350 Rs if you buy it.Connect that cable with your mobile and pc and then transfer files,pictures, mp3 etc from the PC or send it to PC. Or do one thing, buy a bluetooth device for your  computer. Your computer will work as mobile.Ask an engineer or a PC assembler, he will solve your problem. Or just go to the shop and ask for computer bluetoooth and take full details.The computer bluetooth is same as mobile bluetooth and Price depends upon the range of that bluetooth device.Or else go to ebay.com and seach for it.

f2cc569f92bb1570b53bfbbc7466f8ffaa	I already answered this in your last question.  There is no date at this point.  Like I said last time, Verizon is currently looking at this phone.  If they pick it up, it would probably be released sometime around February or March.  If they don't pick it up, expect a different carrier to take it and release it next summer sometime.  I'll be surprised if Verizon doesn't take it (or the CDMA equivalent) because Verizon and LG go together like love and marriage or a horse and carriage.<br>  <br>  Married With Children references aside, I would expect to see it hit the US market next year in either the first or second quarter.|`|e08187dbcb961356e4800c6e1c3a6c7eaa	From what I hear it is supposed to be out next month(July '07) with Verizon as it's carrier.

UmPFPKVkaa	I'm not a T-Mobile employee (I do have the service though), but I've been in the business for a couple years and learned a couple things. I'm going to break down each question here.<br>  <br>  What do you need to know in advance. The best advice is to know how well you're covered in your area. There is no point in switching service if the T-Mobile has horrible coverage in your area. This Coverage Map from T-Mobile will give you a heads up, but don't depend on it, when you get T-Mobile, you have 14 days to decided if you want to keep the contract.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/?WT.srch=2&Result_Inq&InqSource=TMO" rel="nofollow">http://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/?WT.src...</a><br>  <br>  Paying upfront really depends on how good your credit is.  If it's average you may not have any type of deposit. If you have really bad credit, you will have to get into something they call a "Smart Access". What that is that you are only allowed to have so much on your bill... you may not be able to go over $100 a month. Plus you will have to deposit.<br>  <br>  For the plans that T-Mobile offer, they are really good. At least in my opinion.  If you have 5 specific people that you talk to all day, you can get into the "myFaves". That is where you can talk with any 5 numbers you want (even landlines) unlimited. They have "myFaves" plans that start for $39.99. Another perk is that if you want, you can add Mobile to Mobile for $6.99 so you don't have to add other T-Mobile customers as your myFaves.<br>  <br>  And if you are getting a Sidekick 3, you will have to get a Sidekick Unlimited plan anyway. With that you get unlimited Text Messages (and IM's) and Unlimited Internet. That will cost an extra $20.<br>  <br>  The Sidekick 3 and Sidekick iD are the same size, but the iD doesn't have bluetooth, camera, or music player.<br>  <br>  What are qualities about each phone? Wow... there are a few phones that T-Mobiles offer. Jump over to T-Mobile.com to see what they have to offer. Some phones are just phones, other phones have things like bluetooth, camera, media players, or email. And then there are Blackberries. Check out the phones, then when you decide which one looks most appealing to you, go to this website and read what other people have thought about the same phone:<br>  <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.phonescoop.com</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps a little with some of the questions that you had. If you have any more, you can IM when I'm online.|`|ir2HKmjEaa	dont go to t moblie when i had them i had at least 50 dropped calls|`|yqJKGZYtaa	ok i work at TMobile its a 2 year contract with a sidekick id.So the sidekick id is about 99 dollars and if u want to instent message u would have to pay for that too.U would have to pay for so many stuff if u want a sidekick id but it does come with a 2 year contract.Ill say u ahould get a simple good TMobile camera flip phone all of them are good.Hope this helped

f3586d5e0985f6e9f0447a70215d2b84aa	When Apple formats the iPods the memory shrinks.|`|15aab0a27a4ed405f2ef954104c5fd65aa	it comes preloaded with an operating program which requires some memory space.|`|AA10585364	That is correct. It's because of the way a computer deciphers your storage into binary numbers. Manufacturers of memory define 1 gigabyte as 1,000,000,000 bytes but your computer will calculate a gigabyte by dividing the bytes by 1,073,741,824. It sounds confusing, I know, but don't feel shortchanged. As with all harddrives, flash memory, RAM, etc it's all the same. As always, some of the space is reserved for the Operating System and other functions to make your electronics function properly.|`|AtHjqgctaa	It comes with preloaded software and that takes up some space, its the same with everyone|`|esC0B3igaa	Hey, I just bought one for a friend and I had the same thing happen.<br>  <br>  I think what Apple doesn't tell you is that the system information on the ipod probably takes up some of that space.<br>  <br>  3.77 is still a lot of space though really. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
3aLq5Ndiaa	I'm the same.  I think there's some frequency emitted by the tv that we're able to "feel."  Think along the lines of the slight hum of a flourescent light bulb in an office.  You can hear those lights.  I think the TV thing is similar.  I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who can feel a tv when it's on.|`|e2e905d31f2eeb0e471a3bb750095e5aaa	On average, the human ear can hear between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz.  Although these numbers vary from person to person (with several factors involved such as genetics and age), it isn't uncommon to hear these frequencies.  So go ahead and brag - good hearing is something to be proud of and something to protect.|`|AA10299265	I doubt you could tell if mine was on. Chances are you are hearing the horizontal oscillator noise in older televisions. Newer TVs with their higher frequency scan rates are undetectable by human ears. I used to be able to hear these same noises when I was younger, too. I used to walk out of TV display areas because it was so noisy. FYI, that noise occurs at 15,734 Hz... in the upper regions of human hearing capability.|`|4Mu9M1xUaa	I can do that too

But, the only thing I can tell you my friend, is that ...:  "It would damage your battery cell".  <br>  <br>       So, as a suggestion, I would suggested you to charged it for the night and take it of from the base during the day, example.  But if you do used it for few hours, than put it back on for a couple more hours on the base.

HBNx77BBaa	That's got to be 8 megapixel 'fine' and 8 megapixel 'medium'. Always choose fine. You get less pictures on your card but cards are cheap. A lower quality setting can mess up your picture a bit - particularly in the sky or flat areas. You may not notice at first but when you do it will bug you. Definitely go for fine.    (I think the 'm' may be 'n' for normal by the way - could be wrong, but anyway 'f' is the one to choose).

Then just drag and drop the songs you want onto the iPod icon.|`|AA12180617	you're going about this the wrong way the ipod is a SLAVE device and not a master!! you meed to copy files from the itunes folder on one PC to the other then use one only. this will then make the SAMES files on the  new PC as on the old one.  however on the PC you also need to copy the library for your outlook as well as the contacts are stored in outlook  and not the ipod or itunes..    When you add songs to itunes you don't add the actual song - just a link to it's location. ?The "!" means that that song is no longer findable . For example the memory stick has been removed. ?To avoid this you need to do the following:-    In iTunes preferences set both ?"let iTunes manage my music" And "iTunes keeps local copy in music folder " - the exact wording and location in preys will depend on version of iTunes you are running    Once you have done this, plug in your memory stick again and add the tracks again to  The library (this time the screen in itunes will say copying songs briefly).    Then to let iTunes manage your music select "consolidate library " from  Either the file or advanced menus again this depends on  The version of iTunes you are running .    Your music is now stored as links in the library plus the actual files are in  Your iTunes music folder and to be safe you should back up the contents of your iTunes folder on my music      The ipod is designed to work with and be the slave to itunes on the computer to which its paired.    If you do not pair a ipod to a computer you cannot alter its settings.    If you pair your ipod to a new computer it overwrites what's on it.    Simply dragging music onto an ipod does NOT make that music playable it then acts as hard disk. To make the music playable you MUST use itunes to sync with it as only itunes can put the music files in the correct file names (not the same as on the computer) in hidden folders and create the hidden indexes for them to be playable.    I suggest copying the contents of the "iTunes Music" folder on your old computer onto the new one by USB hard disk, USB Flash memory or DVD-r      You cannot transfer music from an ipod to itunes as Itunes is the MASTER location of the music files. if you NEED to transfer music form your ipod to the computer as you have lost the original you need a 3rd party application (I use Yamipod for mac) but a whole range can be found on www.versiontracker.com and enter ipod transfer in the search box under your operating system.    once you have the utility installed run it and close itunes! connect the ipod (if itunes starts up and asks if you want to pair say NO and close itunes again). then with the utility transfer the songs form the ipod to your hard disk.    Then disconnect the ipod, START itunes... drop the files you have just transferred onto the itunes Library and once the files have been copied into the library you can delete the originals (NEVER MOVE or touch the itunes folder on your computer otherwise you will lose the music let itunes manage it for you).    Now reconnect the ipod and when it asks pair say YES and it will transfer the music to your computer.    When you pair the ipod to a computer it erases ALL the previous library and tracks and replaces it with what the current computer want it to.    if you want to erase the ipod you select RESTORE form the ipod's tab in itunes then it re formats and re installs the ipods firmware resetting everything to default values and removing the lock (except for the touch which asks for the code to allow this)    the ipod needing a master player to sync with is NOT unique to apple Creative, Zune, Sony al have one of one sort or another.      the Master files are on the computer in the itunes library and you really need to back these up directly. When you PAIR an iPod with a computer it erases all songs on it!!! and deletes pairing with original computer.

To update your iPod: plug it in and wait for it to show up on the left side of iTunes. Then highlight the iPod icon and click the "settings" tab on the right pane. There is a button there to update the iPod to the latest firmware.<br>  <br>  If the update doesn't solve your problem, you can always do a reset when the iPod stops working right. To reset the iPod, hold down the center and menu buttons for about 10 seconds, or until the iPod restarts itself.
0C6EL4l1aa	ciao<br>  la tecnica è lo "stop motion", o in italiano "Passo uno".<br>  In pratica è l'analogo tridimensionale dei vecchi cartoni disegnati a mano.<br>  Vengono effettuate moltissime fotografie degli oggetti, spostandoli in maniera millimetrica e poi ricomposte in un video.<br>  Un film realizzato così è quello di Tim Burton, Nightmare Before Christmas, che ti consiglio di vedere in dvd, soffermandoti anche sugli effetti speciali.<br>  <br>  In allegato un pezzo del film e la spiegazione di wikipedia|`|5OvgzDP6aa	Nessun programma particolare, solo molta pazienza, esempio<br>  La scarpa è a terra, registri per un sec, ti fermi, la sposti di 1cm, registri di nuovo e ti fermi e cosi via, e le fai fare tt quello ke vuoi tu, ciauz|`|lohBEsbAaa	non c' e bisogno di programmi particolari ma basta essere bravi con la telecamera , basta filmare un po alla volta cioe :<br>  filmi la scarpa sul pavimento, poi metti in pausa la telecamera sposti leggermente la scarpa, poi torni a filmare , poi di nuovo metti in pausa e sposti la scarpa alla fine facendio scorrere il filmato sembrerà che la scarpa si muova da sola !!!<br>  credo che queata tecnica si chiami "step muvie"
