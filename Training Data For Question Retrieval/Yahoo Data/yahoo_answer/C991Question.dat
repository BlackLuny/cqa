20090203114207AAB7YJu	Sports;Wrestling	Perfect Opportunity for HBK-Undertaker Feud?	I think next week's Raw will be a perfect time to kick off the feud between these two. Here is how I think think it should go:   Being that Legacy will more than likely be banned from ringside during the Orton-Undertaker match, Randy goe to  JBL with a bussiness proposition. He tells JBL that if he could lend him some help tonight he will get the first title shot after Orton wins at WM. JBL obliges and since HBK is still employed till NWO forces him to go out and interfere which either ends the match in a DQ or causes Undertaker to loose. The Undertaker wants revenge against HBK and this could lead to their WM match, hopefully along the lines of hell in a cell. You guys think this is a possibility?

Hi guys n girls. ok i've been trying to get fit over the last 3 months. i've been eating correctly, weightlifting and also cardio (biking, running, swimming) 5 days a week, i've seen good results. my question is related to my running levels. when i go for runs for around 30-40 mins at the end of it im tired and puffed, but however my resting heart rate returns in very little time and I feel normal very quickly. i also run fast.

20090203120818AAbw7L2	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Home defense firearm with specific requirements?	I am not a hunter though i have no aversion to it. But my roommate recently moved with me to a bad side of town and left. She was a felon and we could not own a firearm to defend ourselves. Now that she has up and left I feel the need to defend my home. This gun will more than likely be fired once at a range after purchase to make sure i know how it works and will likely be instructed by an experience firearms owner of some sort. After this It will(depending on what it is)reside on the wall in my bedroom or in the drawer of the nightstand. Hence why I am looking to go cheap.      I was thinking a shotgun with buckshot as wall penetration is an issue. Or a .38 revolver of some sort. Id rather it was less mechanical like a revolver so that I wouldn't have problems on the spot. I am talking cheap here like low hundred as low as I can go as I only plan to use it in case of a home invasion.      State is Ohio if that means anything to you.      So I am looking for:   -Cheap   -Less mechanical or more reliable   -Low chance of wall penetration   -Cheap      Thanks!

Eboue, Song and Denilson...yer they may have a few good games a season, but thats not going to win us anything or get us into the Champions League. These lads would get nowhere near the United bench let alone the starting 11...

He won the 2002 World Cup, but only with world class players (Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Denilson, Cafu) and he lost the Euro 2004 to Greece, even with a home crowd.  Jose Mourinho has good tactics, but he's never won a CL.  Arsene Wegner has had a dream team several times yet Arsenal still haven't won a CL.  Benitez has won a CL but hasn't won a Premier League Title.        It can go on, but really, are managers that good, or is it that they are good at buying players.

I have been to the HEAT arena and used the basket and my shots seems to slither its way inside the basket after the ball hit the rim.I notice that the break away rim bents highly noticeable when the ball strikes the rim.Sometimes the rim bents that you swear that thing bent all the way.Back in high school,in p.e it use to be the same  thing.Everybody knew that the hoop the HS team uses was easier to play than a real stable park hoop. Every time a player took a shot and made it everybody knew it was because the break away was asorbing so much force when the ball hit the rim which makes it acts like a cushion to give it that soft touch. Well anyway, I just want to see what ya people think. Oh, and please think this one out because I had many people played on my portable basketball system,they start making a lot shots and do not realize the reson is because the hoop is not stable(rim,backboard, pole). All of this factor can make the worst basketball player seem like he is good.I am NOT saying Kobe,Lebron or D Wade sucks.Or any others!

20090221025132AAbHfM3	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	MUFC Glory hunters (not for true MUFC fans who know football.)? A history lesson..?	From football 365...      The memories of spring 1998 will ensure Manchester United are not allowed to start thinking the Premier League title is in the bag.      Most pundits believe the championship will be heading back to Old Trafford this season, with bookmakers Paddy Power so certain they have already paid out on a United domestic treble.      The move has been dismissed as 'a gimmick' by United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, whose side entertain Blackburn on Saturday knowing victory will take them eight points clear of second-placed Liverpool.      And he recalls exactly the same plaudits being showered on his team 11 years ago, when they opened up a 12-point lead on Arsenal only to suffer a dismal slump in March when they managed only one draw in a three-game run that included a home defeat by their chief rivals.      That sequence put United on the back foot and they never recovered the initiative as the Gunners strode to their first title triumph under Arsene Wenger.      "People were saying it was a foregone conclusion in 1998," recalled Ferguson.      "But when we got to the beginning of March, Ryan Giggs and Gary Pallister got injured, Peter Schmeichel was carrying one and Paul Scholes had to play with a broken toe.      "In attack, Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham had to play all the time during a certain period because Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was injured.      "It told on the run-in because we couldn't freshen the team up."      The killer blow came when the Gunners came to Old Trafford and Ferguson had to rely on John Curtis and Ben Thornley in a game United eventually lost to a late Marc Overmars goal.      Along with the last-day heartbreak in 1995 when United laid siege to the West Ham goal at Upton Park but failed to get a winner to prevent Blackburn clinching the title, it is a day etched in Ferguson's psyche.      However, he does concede the whole make-up of the Premier League has changed markedly in the intervening decade, making such comebacks - the like of which Chelsea need this term - substantially more difficult.      "It is a tough league now," said Ferguson.      "There are so many teams fighting for survival for a start, which makes it a challenge all the time.      "It is a far better league now. There are far better players and the standard of football is much higher."

20090220233043AAVkQ8m	Sports;Basketball	Does this prove Bruce Bowen's a dirty player? If you were in NBA, would you want him to be in the union?	 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc4yz__ak...       I'm neutral. Honestly, I've never had a problem with the Spurs, maybe because I'm not a Western Conference Fan. I love the fact they actually have a real leader who's never betrayed them. I'm a Knicks fan, so I could understand that with Patrick Ewing, although we didn't have 4 titles in 10 years. Being a Knick fan, who loved the 90's, I know what a dirty player is. It made the Knicks a tough team. It allowed them to get through the 1st round 9 years in a row (92-00), and make the postseason 13 years straight.      But this right here is not basketball. I've see Bowen effect other player's, by getting under their skin, but outside of causing an injury, there seems to have been no reason to do this. Personally, if I were an NBA player, in the union, I'd look to ban Bruce Bowen from the union, just for being this inconsiderate and guilty.

How much money do you think a person from the UK who wants to train in Lance Storm's wrestling school in Canada and FCW's school in Florida, gain some experience on an independant circuit like Ring of Honour, then tryout for FCW's official promotion, after spending some time in FCW, try and get signed to an official promotion. How much money do you think a person fromk the UK would need for this would they make enough money through a plan like this:      * Earn a degree in Law and then carry on to try a career in the police force, I've heard with a degree, you'll be promoted much quicker and treated much better by your bosses.      * Then when they've decided that they're ready, book up for Lace Storm's wrestling school, fly to canada, book your self an apartment or something there, and do the 6 month wrestling school course course.      * Then when they've finished with Lance Storm's wrestling school, book up for FCW's school, fly to Florida, book an apartment over there and then do the 6 month wrestling school course course.      * Then try and gain some experience at an independant promotion like Ring of Honour, fly over there, book an apartment, tryout for it, and if you're accepted stay there and gain some experience.       * Then go back to FCW, tryout for its official promotion, book another apartment, if you're accepted, stay there and gain some more experience.       * Then try and get signed to a major wrestling company like WWE.      How much would all of this cost and would the first point get the person to afford all of this? Thanks very much!

Now its all getting stupid with Shawn Michael's getting banked rupt and having to work for JBL was stupid to me. Then Jeff Hardy got into a car accident, got into an accident with the fireworks, and all of that which had something to do with Matt Hardy, which killed reality for me when I thought it was real. Now their saying that they are mostly viewed which i find thatthe yr're exaggerating because i no some people who doesn't watch it and that reason because they tell me alot that its gay for wrestlers to be wrestling with underwear, that they haven't watched it since they're favirote wrestlers left, and the fact that some find it stupid. I only liked it for the some the wrestlers entrance, move-sets, and even the finisher like the RKO, 619, and even the STFU. Now some things are getting a little stereotypical with certain groups of race and culture.

I was on the backs team (going by size that is) and like i made some really good tackles on some of the bigger guys. When we got the ball the coach told me he wanted me to take a run from dummy-half at least once every set. I also was the most involved on feeding the ball from dummy-half in that game. I heard him say i carved up on defense (lol felt good) and alot of my team mates said i did a heaps good job as well... so does it sound like i will play no.9 this year (coz i would really like to)

20090221043143AAS5VRD	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	IN GOOD CONSCIENCE: is united's 2009 squad really the greatest ever?	(Is Hiddink’s Chelsea appointment good for world football?    http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  )      Hey guys   First of all, let me clarify this: Im not anti-United   Thinking objectively, I beg to differ with commentators who are contemplating the possibility of Man Utd's 2009 squad as the best ever   This is an article discussing about the notion    http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/footb...    The greatest ever? Really?   Lets bring the facts in      -> United are  5 points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, having both played 25 games.   As far as past seasons are concerned, this deficit can easily be turned at any stage of the season; even Sir Alex Ferguson himself acknowledged this as United lost the 1998 title despite leading 12 points at one point.      -> Of the last 14 matches which United have gone clean sheet, only in 1 game they faced credible opposititon.   Sure, going nearly 1300 unbreached is a scintillating record.   But with full respect to van der Sar and his backline, their opponents have been rather easy meats with the exception of half-strength Chelsea.      -> The most critical phase of the season is yet to come...   ... that is the next 2-3 months when the Champions League resumes.   All top European managers know this, and Fergie has more reason to agree than ever; they will meet Jose Mourinho-coached, Italian champions Inter Milan (whom clearly are the worst team United can possibly be drawn with) and will still have to play Arsenal and Liverpool, the only two teams whom United have lost to in EPL this season.   The latter two are the ones to look out for; lose these two games and the title can easily fly from Old Trafford.      -> The squad has the highest expectations ever on its shoulder...   ... which is to win the quadruple: EPL, FA Cup, League Cup and the Champions League.   Only one teams has ever accomplised this before; the 1967 Celtic squad.   United might have the winning mentality, but too much pressure wont be good      With all the statistics above, my question is:   DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THE 2009 UNITED SQUAD IS THE GREATEST OF ALL-TIME?   Personally, I feel that it doesnt have enough credentials to claim the title just yet.   Only if they really complete the Quadruple come May, then they can boast about being the best ever, ahead of Celtic 1967 class (which will be really hard to do)      Please put forth accurate and intelligent arguments, rather than just answering 'yes' or 'no'   Will be appreciated if you can identify your club affiliation      Thanks   lightofwadowice

Then i also knew that my school also had a team and i tried out and i made it. i have been playing soccer for quite a while now since i was 5. then my club soccer coach got really mad at me because i didn't go to some of her practices. i told her i had games and homework. some people on my team even got mad at me. when i went to play the games she would put me in for a mere 10 minutes. in school in would play the entire time. then my club and and school coach met one day at a game. my club coach came looking for me. then when my school season was over my coach acted around me like nothing had ever happened and puts me in a lot to play and i score a lot of goals. next year she is also going to be my coach unless i quit the team which i don't think i will because i love that team. i also want to play for school again because i know the coaches there appreciate my talent... what should i do?

20090219171410AAEOpaH	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Why does the United States watch woman's soccer more than men's soccer(football for the rest of the world)?	I live in the United States and soccer (football) is my favorite sport. When I hear soccer, I usually hear woman in it too.  Is our country too ignorant of the beautiful game?  I don't mind women playing soccer, what annoys me though is that people on ESPN show more highlights of women's soccer than men's soccer.  They don't show the real skill involved.  The only time ESPN was treating soccer (football for the rest of the world) seriously was when David Beckham came to the L.A. Galaxy, which was a horrible excuse because he is not world class material.      Our Women's national soccer team is pretty good and they're one of the best in the world and I don't like it that much when they lose, but why is the US so ignorant?  Just because you're team isn't the best in the world doesn't mean you can't support them (I'm talking about the men's US team).  I guess they're so jealous of the Latin American/European/African players that are so good.       I don't like this at all.  Sure, they show UEFA Champions League on ESPN2, but it's not admired enough.  More people know who Mia Hamm is more than Ronaldinho in the US. It's annoying.
