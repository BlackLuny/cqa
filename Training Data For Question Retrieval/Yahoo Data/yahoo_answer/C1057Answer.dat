Every time a ball comes at you, try to react in the same way each time. (Always duck for a shot coming at your head, jump when one is coming at your feet) Eventually, the nerves in your back will reprogram themselves and do as much as cut your response time in half. Then you can go up front without too much worry.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	you are lucky you can play dodge ball they took it out of our school because a girl got hit in the head to hard.
yAA5NpiDaa	although i'm a big fan of RAFA  but i think it's ROGER however NADAL has the time to break the records and be the greatest player.|`|i0e9DY9uaa	Federer was asked the same question in aus-open and this is his answer:" you probably will never know who was tha greatest of all time...and that's intriguing.."    but sampras decided to be open and named 4 guys in no specific order" Rod Laver,Borg,federer,Sampras"|`|NUqJVWFJaa	Recently Roger Federer was number 1, now its Rafael Nadal.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	fernando verdasco yeah|`|cjlJO6guaa	Rod Laver is often consisdered the "greatest male tennis player of all time" as he is the only player to have won 2 Grand Slams. Howver, it's very difficult to compare players from different eras because the game of tennis has evolved much since the time that Laver played.<br>  <br>  Out of more recent players, I would have to say that Federer is the greatest, even though he hasn't won as many slams as Pete Sampras (yet). He's stuill a current player, and still has the opportunity to equal or better Sampras who has been retired for several years now. Also Federer performs much better on clay than Sampras ever did - having reached several finals at Roland Garros, something Sampra never did.<br>  <br>  Federer v Nadal? Even though Nadal is currently no 1 and seems to be currently dominant over Federer, he hasn't consistently produced the same results that Federer has yet. <br>  <br>  If we are talking about women's players, there are several contenders - Maragret Court, Steffi Graf, Martina Navritolova. Margaret Court certainly has the numbers as far as number of Grand Slams is concerned, but once again it is difficult to compare players from different eras. All of these women were very dominant in their own time.<br>  <br>  My picks would be Federer, and Margaret Court.|`|0zwnZKwiaa	Mine will be based on number of grand slam won. If for all time tennis player i will choose Margaret Court for winning 24 grand slam single title.She became the first woman during the open era and the second woman ever to win all four Grand Slam singles titles in the same calendar year. Court won 24 Grand Slam singles titles, more than any other player in history. She won 62 Grand Slam titles overall with 24 singles, 19 women's doubles, and 19 mixed doubles, again, more than any other player. She is the ultimate and a lengend of tennis. That's my answer!|`|hRoR7AY8aa	In terms of talent, class and extreme awesomeness definately Roger Federer.<br>  <br>  In terms of results (no. titles and grand slams) Margret Court, she was so dominanant and as the person above me states has won the most grand slams ever.<br>  <br>  Edit: on second thought i would say Justine Henin, considering her height 5'4'' or5'' all of her contenders in the top 10 were 10 inches taller than her, so considering that i would definately give her a vote for greatest player, i hope she is considering a comeback =)|`|ZtA8bev1aa	I believe that Roger Federer is the greatest tennis player of all time.  Also, I would not be surprised if Rafael Nadal surpassed both Roger Federer and Pete Sampras in the next four years.  Hope this helps.|`|kvTNpChaaa	who was the greatest tennis player?...well i say Andre Agassi<br>  <br>  who is the greatest Tennis player right now?..<br>  <br>  well thats a battle between Rodger Federer and Rafael Nadal|`|H2M4GFtSaa	Pete sampras won 14 major grand slam titles<br>  federer is close behind<br>  <br>  those two are the best|`|BRTa5h7iaa	Roger Federer vs. Pete Sampras is the common debate for this title<br>  Roger Federer:<br>  -Better variety in strokes<br>  -More variety to game<br>  -Did better on clay than Sampras<br>  -More dominant prime than Sampras<br>  <br>  Sampras:<br>  -Better first and second serve<br>  -Better net game <br>  -Won more Grand Slams<br>  -Had tougher opponents to beat in his career<br>  <br>  If I had to choose one, I would choose Federer but it is definitely a close decision. Another rising player looking for a chance at the title is Rafael Nadal who has already won 6 Slams (at 3 different Slams and on 3 different surfaces).|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Roger has proved to be a contender for this title because of his ability to play on all surfaces as hard courts, clay and grass.<br>  Secondly, he has set a magnificent record of being at the top position for 237 weeks in a row which speaks for his consistency.<br>  He is the only person to win five Wimbledons and five USO in a row. He has managed to win at least five or six grandslams without a coach which shows his calibre. He got 13 slams within a span of 5 years so that speaks for itself. I just think he is a complete package and I have always admired him for his determination to succeed. Go Rogi!
7Xiz8iwPaa	It depends on a lot of factors:<br>  <br>  The higher the tension, the more control yo have over the ball. The lower the tension, the more power you have because the loose string causes a trampoline effect. You also must realize that over time, string loses its tension. So if you string a racquet tight, you will get more play out of the string than if you string it loose.<br>  <br>  It also depends on your racquet. On the neck of your racquet, they should list the recommended tension for that specific racquet. Whether you decide to string your racquet loose or tight, base it off the range provided on the neck.<br>  <br>  This matter really comes down to personal preference. If you are an experienced player and do not need help controlling the ball, go with a looser tension. If you are new, it might be a better bet to go with a tighter tension. Also account for money. If you don't mind stringing your racquet once a month, than stringing it loose isn't a big deal. But if you want to get 2 - 2 1/2 months out of your string before you have to pay again, you might wanna get it strung tighter. <br>  <br>  If you still can decide, just ask your stringer for advice. They are professionals and most likely get asked this question a lot!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	60 on each, you want control over power, especially with power strings like pro hurricane.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Personally, I like the VS gut in the mains at 58 lbs., and the pro hurricane in the crosses at 54 lbs.  If you want more control, increase the tension by 2-4 lbs, for more power reduce the tension by 2-4 lbs.  It also depends on what racquet you are using.  Bigger headsizes may need higher tensions to counter the power/ trampoline effect.  Good luck!|`|BRTa5h7iaa	55-65 is the typical range. The higher the tension, the more control you will have. The lower it is, the more power you will get. It depends on the type of player you are. A difference of less than 3 won't make a noticeable difference. I use 58.|`|sptrtwxlaa	depends on the string tension of your racquet, bc if its lower the racquet will mess up & if its too high it will break. I always string it near the max to get minimal power & more control.|`|dac40c900160ab9700d5d99256e01ca6aa	If your not sure it should be stated on your racket but I would say 55 for the average person.|`|monCPTRVaa	These answers pretty much answer it all, but if you go for a higher tension (Around 60) your arm will begin to hurt.

N2ujeJkIaa	What I would do is start with 5 mins on the tread mill at a moderate(jogging) speed and increse by 30(or more) secs each day. After about a month, you should be able to run about an hour no problem!! Also, try running outside in the cold(drees up good thoguh) because it helps control your heart rate(makes your running more effective). Try doing some keep-ups to get some ball control or just go outside and dribble around with the ball(crossovers,inside and outside of your foot dribbling and best thing would be to make a small course to driblle through.Alternate with each foot inside and outside)I hope this helps you out!!!!!|`|TepKLuP7aa	I think you should practice on your treadmill that you have. Practice running for about at least 15 minutes each day, then if you want to improve more add about 2 minutes every day. By then you should improve your running skills a little more than you had before. About your soccer skills i think you should go to the local park in your area or anywhere where you can can at least just kick the ball and practice a little by yourself. you should practice just kicking it into something, or hitting it to a wall. <br>  i wish you good luck--- :)|`|Irf5IO6daa	try doing high knees on the stairs. juggling with the ball will also help a lot|`|x2mgUMb6aa	get a ball get a wall knock yourself out.<br>  oh and practise,practise,practise.|`|pcO8DKFBaa	I used to be a professional soccer player on Rangers so I'm telling this from my experience.<br>  Soccer isn't that easy as you can get better in such a short time.  therefore, to get better in one month is hard to do so what you really suppose to do is to run.  If you keep running everyday you will definitely get benefit of it.  try to keep a same pace and distance every time you run. I suggest 2-5 miles but not too much!<br>  good luck|`|zXViw7oHaa	I also play football and I truthfully think that it all depends on the position you play.  If it's a position like mid fielder or forwards than you really want to make sure you have good stamina and are fast.  Consider how much work that you will be doing on the field on your position and train for that.  Hope that helps good luck with the tryouts.|`|Kc28d61Raa	you could find a local indoor soccer organization (i've gone to one), and practice practice practice! it's fun:)|`|5X0p45Zbaa	<a href="http://www.Soccer-training-info.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccer-training-info.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerwarmup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerwarmup.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerdrills.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerdrills.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccer.com</a><br>  <br>  Its all here to become pro , Good Luck!|`|frA6KJwIaa	um, practice, and run a lot.

mCTmari9aa	I get what your saying but not because you have more than one good player in one spot means you can trade him for free. Yes you would need another player besides CC to get Johan but Johan isnt worth CC and Fielder man. If you wanted to trade CC and Fielder you would have to add another player from his size to make it even.<br>  <br>  Thats the reason it got vetoed. Now why it should be ok for people that make deals to get to get vetoed... because if somebody likes brian giles and is willing to trade lincecum for him is kind of crazy. what is happening is that you are screwing the other league members by totally ripping off the other manager. Yes he accepted man but if somebody stacks their team that way he would be practically cheating the rest out of a fair chance to win.

JsyuYAGXaa	What I want to happen: All of them go the jets<br>  thats not likely though, at all.<br>  So, what i really think will happen is this:<br>  <br>  Haynesworth: Titans, they won't be anything without him<br>  Lews: Ravens, he'll stick with his team and retire there.<br>  Scott: Jets, you are correct in thinking one of those two LBs will go to the Green & White, and it will be Scott. Can't wait to see him and Harris light it up in Big Apple.<br>  TJ: Surprsingly i think the Jets would be a smart choice for him. The Jets need a premier WR since Coles is gone and TJ is the guy. The only problem is the Jet's lack of QB. But if the Jets don't get TJ he will go the Eagles, and own with McNabb.|`|tZmETak7aa	Albert Haynesworth - An absolute gold-mine.

The Cowboys will be done signing players if they get Lewis; even though they did increase some more cap space today and are up to $15 million.<br>  <br>  Bart Scott- Ravens or, again, Cowboys. Dallas is rumored to have interest in Scott; who is younger and cheaper to sign than Lewis.<br>  <br>  Haynesworth- Redskins. They always make a huge signing. Except this one might actually work.<br>  <br>  T.J.- Eagles. But only if they can't swing a trade for Boldin.|`|MxHIdyVAaa	Personally, I see Marvin Harrison getting the offer from Philladelphia.  Marv & McNabb went to Syracuse together and I would more than assume Marvin is looking to be closer to home.  On the same token, if Al Davis is still Al Davis (has been for 123 years), I could see Marvin accepting an overpriced deal from Oakland.<br>  Ray Lewis & Bart Scott - Lewis is not going to be in Baltimore anymore.  I think that was more than clarified after the franchise tagging of Terrell Suggs.  I believe it was yesterday I read a report on NFL.com that the Jets are more interested in Scott, as you pointed out.  Given Jerry Jones approach to the game, I could definately imagine Lewis in Dallas.<br>  TJ Houshmazedah -  Seattle may be a good fit for him.  Deon Branch has been less that impressive, or even present there, for Hasselback.  I don't see the Titans or Eagles reaching a deal with TJ.  Mainly, i believe this because they both had an opportunity to lure Randy Moss away from resigning with New England last year.<br>  Jim Mora commented on NFL Network that TJ could be a good fit in Indianapolis.  But, c.r.e.a.m. is the name of the game, and the Colts don't have the cap space.<br>  Oh... I guess i could also state, 'why aren't the bengals going to do themselves a favor and let the real problem go in cincy?'  who ****ing knows, bengals = 3 wins in '09.  I don't see TJ accepting an offer from Cincinatti.  A good fit though for TJ could be the G-Men.  With or without Burress, Houshmazedah could be a great boost for quarterback, Eli Manning.<br>  Albert Haynesworth - An absolute gold-mine.  Easily in the top 10 in regards to best defensive line-man to ever play the game.  With that being said... i don't quite see him in Indy... unfortunately.  I would just like to comment i am creator of the Facebook group "Haynesworth for '09" .  It is a group dedicated to the Colts potentially acquiring Haynesworth.<br>  But, i heard on NFLTA the other day Albert made a comment he would wish to be the highest paid defensive player.  NOT HAPPENING in Indy.  But, i would like to make a very good point.  Haynesworth is going to get paid one way or another.  The Colts don't have the money right now.  Next year is still looking like an uncapped year.  The Colts could be very deliberate in negotiating with Haynesworth just like the Patriots did with Randy Moss.  Moss (though Haynesworth's approach would be somewhat different) was dealt a 1-year-deal, and a pay cut (COMING FROM OAKLAND) .  Moss was lured in basically because the Patriots made him understand how well of a fit he could be in NE.  If the Colts can accomplish this, Peyton Manning is going to have to reschedule his Super Bowl Party back a week (from it's normal day, seemingly year in and year out) cause you could realistically expect Indianapolis in Miami again.|`|aLcGuGVNaa	Ray Lewis - Cowboys<br>  Bart Scott - Jets<br>  Albert Haynesworth - Redskins<br>  TJ Whosyamomma - Seahawks<br>  <br>  I think Lewis will go to the Cowboys because his leadership would help them more than any other team, and it gives him a chance (gulp) to compete for another championship.<br>  <br>  Scott will land with the Jets.  He'll be alot cheaper than Lewis, and Rex Ryan will have a man in the middle of his 3-4 that knows his defense.<br>  <br>  Haynesworth will go to the Redskins because Dan Snyder is the only one dumb enough to pay 12-15 million annually for a DT with that many question marks.<br>  <br>  The Seahawks are by far the team with the biggest need at wideout, but they have already invested alot of money in Deion Branch, and Nate Burleson so they might have to cut or restructure one of their contracts in order to pay more money to one position.|`|0yOqleBnaa	I say Lewis will go to Dallas, Haynesworth will probably end up somewhere else, TJ probably will go Seahawk, and I think Bart will go to the Jets.|`|5jIdcbyYaa	There all going to the LIONS!|`|YFFhkRSdaa	jets<br>  ravens<br>  bucs<br>  eagles

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	As the other answer stated many blamed his innings pitched but I dont buy into that. He threw the ball with a much freer motion 2 seasons ago and last year he seemed to labor with his delivery. Rick Knapp seems to have found a mechanical flaw in his delivery and all indications are he is back to a more free delivery. If he throws with the more fluid motion he displayed 2 seasons ago he has a very good chance to rebound. 2 seasons ago the rest of the AL hitters voted his fastball toughest to hit (and Santana was still with the Twins) so make no mistake he has the stuff to win and win big. Now they need to make sure his head is as improved as his delivery, bad seasons can weigh on some guys and they never rebound. I see him winning 15 games with a 3.50 ERA and 160 K's.|`|8ul02MOcaa	In projected stats on ESPN; he is projected to go 14-13 with a 4.39 ERA. 100% of leagues own him.<br>  <br>  Verlander, after a career-high 202 innings pitched in 2007, had enormous problems in 2008. Though he ultimately battled through and increased his K/9 rate in the second half, his ERA (5.32) and WHIP (1.49) suffered.<br>  <br>   More importantly, he racked up more than 200 IP YET again. If indeed he was tired last season, as many Verlander apologists are quick to argue, then what makes anyone think this season will be any different?|`|ViB84hYzaa	Yes. For that matter, I see the Tigers as a whole having a rebound, bounce-back season. The offense will start out better than last year and take some pressure off of the starters allowing for more consistency. The bullpen is closer to being set, so that will help the club as well over the season as long as a #1 closer is determined/found from within the staff and they remain healthy.

6Wdl6UFdaa	First off, if you haven't excercised in a while, define a while. If its been a REALLY long time *years* then you should take a different approach. Which would be starting off easy, go out running, test your current aerobic power level. Circuit training would be best for rugby aerobic conditioning. I.e run 5 minutes moderate intensity, walk 1 minute, run 5 minute again moderately, and so on. As you progress, you'll find it to be much easier, and eventually you can shorten the walking time, and add in some sprinting time. I.e. Jog moderately for 2 minutes, sprint 1 minute, jog moderately (recovery), sprint 1 minute. Do this a couple times. Rugby requires power, agility, speed, and good aerobic (cardiovascular) power. This is just one component<br>  You should also practice with a friend, to develop your skills (I.e. pass the ball back and forth while running around, try kicking different sorts of balls, such as grubber, up and under, etc) Strength is a must (for forwards especially, back's will need great speed, aerobic power and agility), thus start doing some resistance training, start going to the gym or buy some free weights and do basic excercises. If none of those options are available at this time, then workout at home (weight less) Pushups are a good strength developer (muscular endurance, strength) and sit ups for core, youll need that when your in the scrum. Skipping ropes is also good for aerobic power training. Have fun!|`|WnTHyxAiaa	it really depends on what team you play for eg weight restricted, age restricted, and what position you play. <br>  <br>  a wing doesn't do the same training as a flanker, or as a half back.|`|G1H9hZHkaa	run three minutes, 30 seconds pushups, 30 seconds situps, 30 seconds squats, and 30 seconds burpees
bke1xKcCaa	The AL East could have three teams to win 95 games, which has never happened. The Rays ar no fluke, they have solid young pitching, great intangables, and a youthful "we can beat anyone" stride that makes them very dangerous. The addition of Pat Burrell and Jason Isringhausen only makes them more dangerous. They will fight all the way with the Red Sox and Yankees so do not count them out of anything.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	3rd place at best. (Bandwagon will say first)|`|PN4JMhsNaa	well i have to say yankees will win the AL East and the rays and red soxs for the Wild Card.|`|k6EOio40aa	I think they will still be a force to reckon with . I don't know why everyone think they just got lucky last season. That team is extremely talented. You don't just get lucky in a division like the AL East. You have to be great and they are and I think will continue to be for years to come.<br>  <br>   Their SP can be a little shaky but they have plenty of great hitters to back the starting rotation. Especially with the addition's of Gabe Kapler and Pat Burrell.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	Well I am a Rays fan (not a bandwagoner) and I think they'll do great but not great enough to make the playoffs.  It sucks having arguably the three best AL teams in one division.|`|IZtd0kBiaa	3rd place but still a good team
THvXrJYxaa	The 30 has a higher magazine capacity. It comes standard with 10 round magazine and you can buy a 13 round for it. The 36 comes with a 6 round magazine and i don't see that you can get any higher capacity magazines for it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.glock.com/english/index_magazines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.glock.com/english/index_magaz...</a>|`|bHr7nGAvaa	The only real discernable differnence would be magazine capacity and ease of holding.  The glock 30 having a double stack magazine (rounds are staggered so that the sit almost side by side with each other, which means a higher capacity and larger grip which may be more desireable for larger hands) the glock 36 is a single stack (rounds are sitting directly on top of each other, making a smaller slimmer grip for someone with smaller hands and also doesn't "print" as much, which makes it easier to conceal carry.)|`|9xClnnFvaa	the 36 is a slim line model. It is a bit slimmer. Any glock magazine can be used on the same platform of caliper as long as it is not short. Such as a glock 26 magazine would not fit in an 17|`|4dc6f1b232153ebd77211e59c7bf12caaa	I own both of them and prefer the 30 over the 36.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Don't apologize.  <br>  This is the appropriate section.<br>  The 36 is the one you may get to keep if the O-bomb reinstates the "assault weapons" ban.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	The thirty has double stack magazine which has higher capacity of ten rounds. The thirty six has a single stack 6 round magazine which allows it to have slimmer grips. The thirty six does have a plus one magazine extension you can add for one extra round. That would give you eight total if you carry one in the chamber. The purpose is that different people prefer different models, calibers, etc. If they are still selling a model than there is still a demand for it.

d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	If they want American drivers, then they don't have a lot of choice - the best US open-wheel drivers are getting regularly and badly beaten by Australians and Europeans who can't get an F1 drive. The team will have one advantage, in that they are likely to be able to get a Superlicence exemption for any US drivers they want...the choice would be even more limited otherwise.<br>  <br>  Marco Andretti would be one to give a chance to, both from a potential talent AND marketing potential point of view. Mario is probably the only US F1 driver that most of the general American public could name from all history, so the Andretti name will give the team a little credibility (let's face it, they need all they can get after the bad feeling and sense of naivety they've created with their statements up to now). <br>  <br>  The other drivers currently in US-based single seater series are poor. Stanton Barrett is too old, Ed Carpenter is just rubbish, Graham Rahal hasn't done anything to show he is F1 standard. I guess that leaves Danica Patrick. A marketing dream, IF she's good enough. <br>  <br>  One problem with that pair is that they have no idea what an F1 car should "feel" like. Andretti has tested, but not for long enough to be able to "sort" a car on his own. They could come up with a design, test it and find that they are 4 seconds off the pace...who is going to develop the car from that point? They would have to get hold of a competent ex-F1 driver to test the car for them...and if they are going to do that, then they may as well let said driver race too...<br>  <br>  If USF1 do come across something called "reality" before they name their drivers, then they should get hold of an experienced F1 driver from ANY country to lead the team. This isn't A1GP, this is F1.|`|RVq3YK4Baa	well i think that Danica Patrick would be wonderful<br>  and there are rumors about AJ Almendigner, he would be a good driver :)|`|AA10349169	I also heard Kyle Busch, that would be cool<br>  They are also looking at a ton of young Open-whell drivers|`|c37428f3fbea3315c20ba2ba639993b2aa	there are no american drivers at this point in time who can drive an F1 car well enough to be competitive...<br>  <br>  not to take anything away from american racers,there are some very good american drivers out there... but the simple fact is the pathway in american racing is so much different from the one in F1....<br>  <br>  the technical requirements alone needed to set up an F1 car is very different from the requirements that american drivers are used to....they'd simply get lost in the details...|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	i don't think its a simple question of is ther any american good enough, its also a question of is the deal sweet enough to get the american driver, juan pablo, jeff gordon, tony stewart, all have the ability to be instantly competitive in f1, but could the team afford the deal to get them to switch diciplines? doubt it, you could probably add scott pruet, paul tracey (ok ok so its now north american leave me alone) brian herta, as well as marco & gram to the have great potential LIST|`|KTxxd700aa	If it was up to me Id go for a well established F1 racer with development nouse, Rubens Barrichello is just as good as any racer on the grid.<br>  Try out a Yank, I'd go for Marco Andretti, skilled (ish), young, family pedigree and has tested a F1 car before.<br>  Maybe Will Power as a test driver, well known in the US and constantly under rated.|`|r5JwUTfPaa	ANYBODY but that Danica Patrick or that toenail-painting Scott Speed. We're supposed to be putting the best American open-wheel drivers on this team, not the worse. I agree with the answer above, put A.J. or Ryan on the team. A.J. should be in that 19 car this year, not Elliott Sadler. Ryan should be with NHL this year, not that Kandy Kahne looking runway model Milk and Doughnuts. Get those guys on the team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|j9Xx8syQaa	I like picking  one experienced driver and one American 'rookie to F1'... Marco or AJ would be good choices for the American. I wonder if Jeff Gordon would still be interested? That would be an interesting choice and he's shown interest before with the whole thing with Juan Pablo a couple years back ! Picking two rookies to F1 may put them at a disadvantage from the feedback standpoint. Wish they could pull someone like Sutil or Vettel. I'm really hoping they don't put Danica in the car. I'm not saying she doesn't have the PR stuff working for her, but honestly there are better drivers out there and unless she's bringing some $'s with her I don't she why they'd choose her.|`|02kkSw3Laa	One American driver and a very experienced driver currently employed as a team tester. Klein, De La Rosa, or maybe even Coulthard, any of these guys would work for me. Going in with 2 inexperienced American drivers would be a mistake, and please don't mention Scott Speed.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	I'd like to see Marco Andretti get the shot.  It would be great to see an Andretti in F1 again but of course the "Dinger" would be cool as well.  The thought of Danica in F1 is just a hoot.  That would be the epitome of sellout.  Of course she has already soldout.|`|Pe15GxjSaa	Marco and get Scott Speed back. As for the test driver, I'd probably go with Graham Rahal. Speed could be the senior driver and show Marco how not to crash a car. He was also pretty good in qualifying a sub-par car.|`|c09e1f232acd578a9f591c5b83a68f43aa	If they insist on Americans, then Andretti makes sense. Putting Scott Speed alongside him would probably be a good move as he's the only US driver with recent F1 race experience. <br>  <br>  They should get a reality check and employ an experienced driver though.|`|4Md2AcOOaa	Rumors are going around they want an experienced driver, There after Rubens|`|0eys8EDqaa	takuma sato & anthony davidson....most likely|`|1d729bf4d6b38d30422b14b8a730ea1aaa	Scott Speed (or lack of Speed!) was rubbish, arrogant and immature.  He could be a complete waste of money if he's bought back, unless he's done a major amount of growing up.  Mind you, NASCAR is completely different to F1 so he might not want to change or now have the right skills.|`|uuxFIWRQaa	Jonathan Summerton|`|Xw7XHhg6aa	Ryan Hunter Reay and AJ Allmaindiner would make the most sense.|`|aYIEnd0Gaa	DANICA!!!! <br>  SHE.......IS............HOT!!!!!!!!

Thats a great defence but i would switch maicon and alves.....|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	B|`|IWM1khX7aa	A) Italy <br>  Gigi Buffon is a good keeper and the best for Italy.  Zambrotta is good but not great.  Giorgio Chiellini is a great young center back along with the old Cannavaro, but he's still great.  Grosso is not that strong though.<br>  <br>  B) Spain<br>  Iker Casillas is probably one of the best goalkeepers in th world.  Sergio Ramos is one of the best right backs in the world.  Puyol is one of the best center backs in the world.  Marchena is ok, and Capdevila is decent at left back.<br>  <br>  C) France<br>  Steve Mandanda is a bad keeper when it comes to a big stage so he's not good for the way he handles pressure.  Abidal should be on the left and Sagna should be on the right.  Both of them should be very well on each side.  Phillipe Mexes and William Gallas are good center backs, but they don't do do good for France.<br>  <br>  D) Brazil<br>  Julio Cesar is one of the best goalkeepers in the world especially how he's been playing this season.  Dani Alves and Maicon should switch since Maicon can actually play on the left side.  They are the best set of wing backs on any National team, and Dani Alves is one of the best right backs in the world. Juan is pretty decent and Lucio is a great back and leader.<br>  <br>  D) Brazil<br>  They barely edge out Spain, but they get their advantage from the wing backs and both of the center backs are very good.  Also, Julio Cesar is amazing.  I think Sergio Ramos and Puyol are the two best defenders mentioned in this list, but Marchena and Capdevila (maybe even Casillas) aren't good enough compared to Brazil.|`|HkqiGEMuaa	D)<br>  Julio Cesar<br>  Maicon..Juan..Lucio..Daniel Alves|`|BulFLGRpaa	B<br>  <br>  OR    ricardo osorio-rafael marquez-johnny magallon-carlos salcido|`|xMEuz7otaa	E)<br>  --------------------Van der Sar---------------<br>  Rafael ---- Vidic ---- Ferdinand ----- Evra|`|yaMmdhpIaa	BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB|`|cOPCNP7Laa	One composed of my own country's players|`|wrhqkEiMaa	When I read all the choices the "one of these is not like the other" tune popped into my head, because C) clearly shouldn't be in that list lol<br>  <br>  Although for D) I would put Marcelo in left back, in my opinion Dani Alves is better suited for a right midfield role.  With him and Maicon on the right flank Brazil would dominate that area of the field.
rNUyV1EYaa	Without the regulars things have certainly changed here. I know for a fact a lot of people no longer post questions because of violation notices.<br>  <br>  That means many of the users here that took this section very seriously- and posted great questions all the time- are nowhere to be found; all because they are getting reported for no reason.<br>  <br>  My only hope is the new group of people here can rise to the occasion and make the Football section a great place again.|`|rM9WzIkHaa	i would go to the group but i find it hard to answer and read the response's.<br>  <br>  i mean come on peopleits never the off season there stuff constintly going on. in about 4 hours free agency starts, i cant wait to see who gets who. then the draft i cant wait for this years draft. i really hope the 9ers get a linebacker a good one at that.<br>  <br>  it also seems like the regulars just talk now like freinds do in the group section.<br>  <br>  i bet by tomorrow i can have some good Q's<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  as you would say thumbs up to those who agree<br>  <br>  <br>  man am i horrible at spelling and english|`|4KTe107Yaa	I get reported no matter what or when I ask questions.

(Like dumb trades,  steroid bust on good player, etc) it will be like this. Plus baseball is coming back so.....|`|6tGYe5roaa	The number one reason is because it is the off-season. There really isn't much going on. Nothing to talk about. This would have happened with or without the intrusion of trolls. I rarely ever come in here anymore. I think it just happened a lot faster because people had to deal with getting violation notices for everything they posted. Also, it seems like most people stay in the "locker room." Everyone seems to have migrated there so there really is no need to come on here.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	i think it's more that there are so many haters and trolls. like everyone else stated, it's really hard to have fun when you wake up the next morning with like 50 points gone and 5 violations waiting in your inbox. and it's the off-season and the draft gets really confusing for me to follow...like the lockerroom format LOL. i go on Y!A like once a day to check for any interesting questions but most of the users are in different sections anyways :/|`|AA12170560	I'm not part of any group here.<br>  <br>  I just don't show up as often; mostly because I'm tired of seeing thumbs down for valid answers: especially those based on my experience. <br>  <br>  I get roughly 90 minutes of downtime between my day job and coaching, I like to spend the time here when I can...but...<br>  <br>  I'm particularly tired of trolls that feel it's necessary to call people names or answer in a way completely inappropriate to the person asking the question. Sarcasm is one thing, idiocy is another.<br>  <br>  I've had more fun answering the person's question through email and recommending a best answer.|`|RS3fjNboaa	I think some of it is because it's the off season, but the biggest reason I'm not here as much is because I'm tired of the trolls.

ViB84hYzaa	Not a thing to do but work even harder than ever and try again next year. I suppose you could start by asking the coach what other areas of your game need to be worked on so it shows you are willing to look and learn what you need to do to improve your chances next time around. Is there an attitude problem or something else like a negative reputation in school? That could be something that is keeping you from making the team. Just a thought. Maybe the freshman has a better upside than you. More often business leaders and coaches tend to like the younger guy who can learn as he goes and become an asset to the team as a team player rather than somebody who is older and only there for the short haul.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	listen to the coach and get a more powerful shot. clearly it wasnt a powerful enough shot and the other kid must of had something esle you didnt|`|AA10068004	If this is high school there is no way these other kids shoot 20mph. Heck my girlfriend and I went to a festival once that had a clocked shot slapshot cage and even she shot at 40mph and she is all of 4'10" and about 110lbs... and never picked up a hockey stick in her life. <br>  <br>  I really want to think your being straight about all this but...you say you have no attitude but your here judging the other kids saying they suck and are worse than you. Thats a pretty bad attitude. Maybe the coach sees that too and is using power as an excuse. Then again 6'2" and 195 doesn't assure power.<br>  <br>  No offense man but you sound bitter over his assesment of your ability and insulting the other players, well what kind of team player would you be? Sorry man just being honest.|`|QSShHlRiaa	This is how it is your whole life.<br>  they pick the kids who suck becuase<br>  their parents are probly friends and all that crap.<br>  this kid wont go far at all just becuase he makes a<br>  highschool team doesnt mean **** if he sucks.<br>  youll be in the NHL and he'll be working at wal*mart.<br>  and then you can go to wal*mart and say didnt you make <br>  the highschool hockey team over me? and he'll say yeah <br>  and you can tell him your in the NHL now.

bke1xKcCaa	Satchel Paige was arguably the best pitcher of all time. If he had played in the majors his entire career the Cy Young award may have been called the Satchel Paige award. When he finally reached the majors in 1948, after integration he was 42 years old, but that didn't stop him from being a quality pitcher. At age 52 he went 12-10 with a little over 3.00 era. I mean he was simply a beast on the mound. As far as contributions to race and baseball, he was one of the main attractions of the ***** Leagues, not only bringing attention to the sport, but to the misconceived notion of the time that the white race were superior athletes

AA12170560	Squats are the power exercise for your positions.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind it's more than just quad work - being weak in any other muscle group that supports this exercise can make it more difficult.<br>  <br>  a couple of strategies that might help are:<br>  - always have a spotter - or two<br>  - try placing a bench under the lowest portion of your squat so that during muscle failure - the worst that happens is you sit squarely on the bench.<br>  - breathing is important, inhale on the way down, exhale coming up.<br>  - try looking upward toward the ceiling on the way up.<br>  - bar placement is everything: there are 2 schools of practice...across your shoulders...OR...up front high up by your clavical...supported in place by your arms crossed over.<br>  <br>  To get beyond your plateau...<br>  try alternating light and heavy days.<br>  For example - <br>  Monday a heavy day...<br>  more weight, less reps /  more sets.<br>  Thursday a light day<br>  less weight, more reps / less sets (to muscle failure)<br>  <br>  The same strategy can be applied to your Bench - which is fine <br>  (keep up the great work)<br>  <br>  I hope that gets you moving forward,<br>  <br>  oh - and before I get a thumbs down - <br>  this is the old Notre Dame Strength and Power plan|`|YCwmCDkUaa	waterboy|`|sh01nOWCaa	Your bench and power are great for a kid your size. how tall are you??? as far as squatting, you just got to strengthen your lower body and then I promise you will see results. I was one of my states best full backs for thee years (going as far as scouts coming out just to see ME) and I could not squat for **** either. But I built up my lower body strength (TRIPLED my usual regimen) and I saw results within 6 weeks.|`|AA11364084	your bench and power clean are not bad at all.  As a freshman you need to be squatting around 285ish.  As long as your above 250 then you should be good for right now.  If your weakness is squatting then that means you need to focus on it more and you should be ok.

DWLOquXSaa	If your really like a sport, you wouldn't bee doubting yourself like that. I was in the same situation ( I wasn't sure whether I wanted to do softball). I ended up just running out of tryouts and doing track because well....It a lot more of an individual sport. You can be bad but your not letting a lot of good players down. I really like track now and I think I made the right choice. Sports are there so you can enjoy yourself. Don't do softball if you don't enjoy it.  So anyways, good luck and I hope you end up making the right choice.|`|5JqCObDSaa	If softball is something you really like, you can get better at it but if it is not really of interest to you then I would suggest you find something else you really like and are good at, you'll get better fulfillment out of it that way.

Maybe get a friend and go play tennis or something you like. We have a park where I live where you can walk on trails or run and it has three tennis courts where you can play tennis. If you don't like tennis, maybe swimming or something you really enjoy. Sometimes I wish I were your age again so I could feel bored and find time to go do things I like and have enough energy to do them lol.

RKLFYS2Naa	1Grip the two seam fastball by placing your index and middle fingers directly onto the seams at their narrowest point. Your index and middle fingers should be parallel to the seams. Curl your thumb and your ring finger and use them to support the bottom of the ball. <br>  Step2Use a firm grip. The two seam fastball should be griped firmer than other fastballs. This will increase the sinking effect of the pitch. <br>  Step3Throw the ball with maximum effort and use a normal three quarter arm position. Your arm should be slightly slanted away from your head. Although you will throw the ball just as hard as other fastballs, it will be slower because of the way the ball spins. <br>  Step4Aim for low in the strike zone when throwing a two seam fastball. Above the pitcher's belt, the pitch will lose its sinking effect. The pitch is best used for inducing ground balls. Throw the pitch below the batters belt and he will likely swing over the top of the ball, knocking it into the ground.|`|SDxJKbnqaa	1. Put your index and middle fingers on the two parallel seams<br>  2. Grip it tighter than most fastballs<br>  3. Throw it just like a regular four seam fastball<br>  <br>  What gives it it's movement is the way the ball spins<br>  You might wanna try putting your fingers a little inside of the seams

IWM1khX7aa	La Liga.  It's almost as good as EPL, but since the clubs aren't that rich, they don't get all the players they want.  But Barcelona and Real Madrid are two great teams (Barcelona is the best in the world).<br>  <br>  CGrant456, I don't care how mnay titles a team has, if a team is performing as the best team in the world currently (which is Barcelona), then they're the best team in the world.  It doesn't matter how many titles a team wins, it matters if a team is playing better than another team (in this case, Barcelona is playing better than Manchester United), then they're the best.  This is all unbiased.<br>  <br>  Best leagues in the world<br>  1. EPL<br>  2. La Liga<br>  3. Serie A<br>  4. Bundesliga<br>  5. Ligue 1<br>  6. Eredivisie<br>  7. Portuguese Liga<br>  8. Campeonato Brasilero Serie A<br>  9. Scottish Premier League<br>  10. Turckell Super Lig<br>  This is my opinion|`|L5tWiYOFaa	The Central Mongolian Premiership. Joshjo - Manchester United is the best in the world right now, respect the titles. It's not called the EPL, it's the Premier League, for the same reason that we don't say 'Spanish La Liga' or 'Italian Serie A'. Who plays the best football, that's a matter of opinion, and therefore inherently biased, joshjo, titles are a matter of fact.|`|UeAiVWfHaa	spanish italian or german<br>  <br>  but who said englisdh is the best? it is but spanish is close 2nd. matter of opinion|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	La Liga!|`|AA11822515	Italian or Spanish. Although they're both pretty entertaining, they don't have the pace of the English league, and there is too much diving and dirty play going on. It's still always a pleasure to Barcelona and Inter playing though.<br>  <br>  And lol at above.<br>  <br>  Joshjo - Not really sure what you're getting at. I think Barca are a great team, maybe even the best. I'm not even a Man Utd fan but they are currently English, European and World champions, they look awesome and thats a fact. We'll just have to wait and see what happens this year. If they get past Milan, I reckon they can go all the way.|`|MRvHMel9aa	Liga BBVA in Spain followed closely by the Serie A|`|uJRMjYhFaa	I'll say the Spanish League!|`|fu4VXe1iaa	I agree with cgrant456. The English Premier League has a very high level and no other league equals the "kick and rush style" of the football in England. Nevertheless, I very much enjoy Spanish football because it's all about attacking and doing nice moves. But I really hate Italian football, it's not "joyful" to see Italian teams playing a game. It's true that they are very efficient but it's sometimes boring to see them play because they much more oriented towards defending (at least once they scored a goal). <br>  I would rank them as follows:<br>  1)England<br>  2)Spain<br>  3)Italy/Germany (or maybe Brazil too but I don't know enough about the level of the Brazilian competition to assess it)|`|gPvOcB6oaa	The Highland league...Auchtermuchty Old Boys|`|40cUhBfnaa	I would say either Serie A or La Liga

If Dwight can make his half-court shots, then lebron should be able to make them easy in any way.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Looks real to me.  Its really not that big of a deal.  I mean, yeah, its a nice shot, but what they don't tell you is how many times he actually tried it in order to make one.  He'd never try it in a real game, but as for trick shots like that, there's a lot of things that NBA players could probably come up with in a game of HORSE or something, when they're just dicking around.<br>  <br>  Edit: As for the guy above me who said he makes 15 out of 25 from half court all the time.... thats just BS.  You don't even have NBA players shooting 60% from normal 3 pointers, to believe that some coach is shooting 60% consistantly from half court, he should give up his job and play in the NBA, since he could just shoot half courters all day long and be the leading 3 point shooter in the league.

T2UZXarLaa	Alright, day-of decide how cold it is. and from there decide how much you would normally wear for just walking around outside. wear that because since youre a beginner youre probably going to spend most of your time sitting around on your @$$. If you plan on working really hard or moving around alot then wear less.<br>  <br>  snowboarding usually costs quite a bit so if youre under the age of 22 and/or your bf isnt rich expect to pay for rentals and the lift ticket. if he pays for it be pleasently surprised. Around here (Wisconsin) a rental and a lift ticket is like $40. in colorado its over $120 at the bigger resorts<br>  <br>  Things to remember: (most important to least)<br>  *To put on your snowboard youre going to sit so wear SNOWPANTS or else your @$$ will be extremely cold and you will be miserabe... i only didnt wear snow pants once and it was terrible.<br>  *Youre going to be touching a lot of snow so youre going to want waterproof warm gloves. the dryer they stay the warmer you will. mittens are prefered by some because they keep heat better.<br>  *For a jacket youre probably going to want a hard shell (water proof/resistant, wind proof/resistant) a soft shell will also work in warmer weather or for people who ride harder.<br>  *Hats are good. but not extremely important if you have long hair. just keep your ears warm.<br>  *Your neck and face will be cold on the chairlifts and if you eer get up some speed so youre going to want a scarf/neck warmer/facemask.<br>  *Ski Goggles are good but most people find them annoying so they only war them when its snowing or really windy.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest renting a helmet since youre a beginner and you dont want a head injury to ruin the date. Its unlikely you will seriously injure your head but its a good precaution to take.<br>  <br>  another thing to remember is that you can always take layers off but putting on layers you didnt bring is really hard.<br>  <br>  In case you still have questions heres what i take snowboarding:<br>  Snowboard (this can also be rented)<br>  Snowboard boots (also can be rented)<br>  Snowpants (under my snow pants i wear pajama pants cuz you want a flexible material)<br>  Fat Snowboarding gloves (warm, waterproof)<br>  Jacket (depending on temp either my hardshell or my fleece softshell)<br>  Hat<br>  Helmet<br>  Ski Goggles (i bring but i usually dont wear)<br>  (my jacket goes up to my face so i dont wear scarfs)<br>  Backpack (if im going all day and brought alot of stuff)<br>  <br>  yeah thats pretty much it... if your bf is boring bring your ipod/mps player cuz many ppl listen and ride at the same time. also food/drink is expencive so bring that if you can.<br>  <br>  Finally dont forget a camera cuz who wants to forget that painful first experience!<br>  <br>  Have fun if you have any more questions feel free to email me at speakerguy1257@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  EDIT: oh yeah thanks to the kid below i rememered 2 things that you may want to think about as well.  Sunscreen - ive never been burn and i neve wear it boarding but if you burn easily then definitly use it. chapstick - your lips will be chaped if its cold.|`|QuQioUd7aa	what i wear: underarmour spandex pants, and a underarmour spandex shirt (heat gear) <br>  (most of my friends just wear a t-shirt then a sweater then there jacket and pj pants underneith there snowpants)<br>  then i wear my snowpants over and my jacket<br>  <br>  then theres my helmet, goggles, bandana, snowboard boots, gloves, snowboard, burton tall snowboard socks<br>  <br>  and i bring my cell, snowboard lock, money, and ipod and hair tyes with me, for when i go into the chalet and my hair is a mess haha !|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Yes the learning curve for snowboarding is high. Unless you've already surfed or wakeboarded it will all be foreign to you. Alot of people try to realte snowboarding to skateboarding to beginners and truth be told it's not true to beginners  Skateboarding only relates to "jibbing" (rails, jumps, spins, flips). <br>  <br>  Few tips I've learned on the mountian...<br>  <br>  1. Take lessons unless you already know someone patient enough to teach you pay to get the basics. <br>  <br>  2. Have the right gear. Boots, Pants, Gloves, Goggles, Jacket, Beenie, LipBalm... Prioritize in the same order I mentioned. Your gear will be more important than what kind of board you are using. I say this because chances are you will rent a board for the frist time (btw you can get lesson and rental deal combos,including lift ticket, for a reasonalbe price). It's just better to have your own outerwear to avoid the funk.<br>  <br>  2. Try to fall flat (forward or backwards) Avoid catching your fall w/ you hands and avoid falling strait to your butt. If you have ever heard horror storeis about broken wrists and/or tailbones this is the reason why.<br>  <br>  3. Keep your knees bent as much as possible. It will be awkward but it helps with turning and speed.<br>  <br>  4. Don't get caught up in the "drama" of everyone else around you. Snowboarding to some people is a big ego session (you ******* know who you are) and will stir up bull **** against you to make them feel better. Just ignore them and stay focused on your riding. You are NOT there for them right???<br>  <br>  Most of all Have fun! Snowboarding is a beautiful activity once learned and respected.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|8lhaxl4Naa	Woah that dude wrote alot. I will tell you what i wear.<br>  <br>  I always head to my mountain wayyy early. And it cold in the morning of course. So I always start with jeans, snow pants, t-shirt, snow jacket, long socks, gloves.<br>  <br>  Usually by mid day the mountain has too much sun so then ill ditch my jacket in the car and wear the rest.<br>  <br>  As far as other thing to bring with... The way i see it is the less you bring the better. If you really want to have a good time and enjoy snowboarding then keep as much stuff out of your pockets as you can.<br>  <br>  I only bring my phone and my wallet. Both stay zipped up in my pockets :]|`|uWBn5HpOaa	well, its common sense? your gonna be in snow, getting cold, and getting wet (not sexually) so you'll need a jacket, gloves, waterproof snowpants, goggles(optional) a hat, money, and chapstick, if your going with your boyfriend cause kissing a girl with chapped lips ISN'T good<br>  :]|`|dfdywIlbaa	bring a hat, money, gloves, goggles, jacket, snowpants, boots, and possibly a scarf. then just bring your setup, or if your renting just bring some extra cash
kyEPS7xCaa	If the Mariners are contenders by the Trade Deadline, then yes.<br>  If not, he will either be traded or he will ask to be traded to go to a contending team.  That team will be dependent on the situation of the other clubs.  <br>  <br>  I would say Boston might be a good fit for him, especially since the Sox have a great Farm System for the Mariners to ask a decent trade for, possibly a position player and a pitcher to build around Felix and Bedard.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	Yes.

Hes a hardcore passrusher, and they only person the Hawks got that from last year was Mebane if I'm not mistaken. And a little from Julian Peterson. Everyone is talking about moving Orakpo to olb in a 3-4, but I think if you want to harness a players full ability, you keep him at his position. Look at Vernon Gholston of the Jets, they thought he would be a stud when the moved him to olb, but thats the risk you run.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	WR ever heard of Michael Crabtree|`|cftWwsidaa	crabtee|`|JhrdIVBgaa	Waste It|`|tTpdaLFyaa	Originally, it seemed as if the Seahawks were going to look to draft Michael Crabtree from Texas Tech, but because of his injury status, they may not.  Instead they are looking for some help on defense.  Defensive tackle BJ Raji from Boston College seems to be the likely pick at #4 for the Hawks.  It would be difficult to pass on Crabtree.  He's the most talented offensive player in the draft.  The Seahawks could benefit from a big, tall, talented receiver.|`|WWIs1o5qaa	Take crabtree I guess.

q8dX0MsNaa	you have already found the crappie so you don't need much help with that.<br>  try casting bass lures underneath the docks for the bass. they like docks for hiding places. lots of dock owners sink brush beneath their dock to make them even more attractive. start with jigs or plastic worms rigged texas style, pegging the weight with a toothpick against the worm so they remain a unit skipping underneath the dock.<br>  good luck to you, B.|`|amlmhoUuaa	Use a road runner for the crappies and a jig and pig combo or a plastic worm, lizards texas style or a spinnerbait under or around the dock for the bass.|`|mdSsNKnwaa	In smaller bodies of water, there tends to be more vegetation, and the fish usually stay shallow.  With this said, one of my favorite small body of water lures is the frog.  There are lots of frogs in smaller bodies of water, and are at the top of a bass's menu.  You can always go weightless and skim it across the top if the water is above 55 degrees, or you can texas or carolina rig and go a little deeper.  Any color will suffice, as I have not found a bad one.  Just match color to how much light there is ex. cloudy/darker colors, sunny/lighter colors.<br>  <br>  Lizards, plastic worms, jigs, and topwaters also produce well.  I really concentrate on the shoreline while fishing small bodies.  Lots of times, the biggest bass will be sitting a few feet off the bank.<br>  <br>  I stay away from crankbaits, jerk baits, and anything with a trebel hook because you are constantly having to pull vegetation off your hooks.  Also, bass have no interest in getting a mouth full of moss.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Also, if the fish aren't biting one lure, don't be afraid to change quickly and find out what they're eating.  Most often you can figure out a small body of water within an hour or so.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	For crappie, here's the best lures ...<br>  <br>  1.) A curly tailed grub, on a road-runner.<br>  <br>  2.)

2wgEsVmsaa	Well, it's certainly a lot more boring. 5 pitchers in every game that you win by 10 runs might make sense, but it sure is boring. Frankly, if throwing fewer pitchers made these guys really good, I could see it. But their ERAs aren't down, their Ks aren't up. Seems like it gives them more chances to be mediocre. But, I liked the days of Koufax and Marichal competing for the lead in shut-outs, and the loser might have 7.|`|Id4OLpIZaa	Lets not forget that science has improved a lot. There are probably scientist (medical doctors) who proved or claimed that if they throw this amount of pitches or with this amount of days rest, the chances of blowing ones arm is high. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, it's more of a strategic thing. I mean, today there are so much scouting and information about the pitcher that if the pitcher pitches too many innings, it is likely that he well get bombed in the latter innings. <br>  <br>  Other than that, I agree with you. I always thought if you pamper and baby a pitcher too much, he will never be strong enough to pitch an entire game or be successful. It's like weight lifting. Should you only do 10 push ups because your afraid to pull a muscle? of course not. you do as much as you can and as time goes, you get stronger and able to do more push ups. I thought this concept should go with pitching as well. I don't know. lol.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Yes it has hurt Major League Baseball.  When a manager refuses to allow a hot pitcher to go the distance if he's working efficiently because he doesn't want him to eclipse the 120 mark, and bring in a cold, less effective reliever, and they wind up losing the game for the starter, that is what hurts teams.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Honestly, I don't know.  I mean, it doesn't really make too much sense if you think about it.  In a time when players are conditioned better, stronger, healthier, take care of their bodies better, it would make sense that a player could pitch longer than his predecessors.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can come up with, is that the advances in conditioning, strength, etc has helped the batter more than the pitcher.  As a result pitchers have to be better than before in order to get hitters out.  Now I'm not saying that today's pitchers are better than Seaver and Ryan and Koufax, etc, but the game has changed.  <br>  <br>  Here's one theory.  With hitters being stronger and ballparks smaller, pitchers now can't pace themselves like they once could.  I mean, starters still pace themselves somewhat, so they can go 7 as compared to a reliever who will leave it all on the table for 1 inning, but I'm thinking that maybe the older pitchers were able to pace themselves better so they could stay in the game longer, and as a result were able to pitch 9 innings and also pitch on 4 man rotations.  I could be wrong, but hey, its an idea.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	Pitchers need to get ahead of hitters and throw strikes. Pitchers today are too cute and throw too many pitchers.

wXxJUnLJaa	I don't think he will go to the Lakers though.|`|9cub6mMQaa	By the time Durant is eligible to go to the Lakers, they will not be able to afford him without giving up Kobe or Pao.<br>  <br>  And players like him as long as they don't play with him. When he plays, there needs to be two basketballs on the floor: one for Kobe and one for the rest of the team.|`|vq5eKUhiaa	The press has to make things more dramatic and Kobe is a good target for some of the reasons Johnny said.<br>  <br>  It HAS been quite a while though, since Shaq left because of their conflicting egos (Phil Jackson ultimately made the decision to trade shaq and not kobe) and a long time since the white girl in Colorado.<br>  <br>  But those are valid reasons for the press to make him a target.<br>  <br>  What ISN'T true is that he misses tons of shots and makes little to no passes. That would be the Kobe Bryant of the past who couldn't trust his teammates and i don't blame him. He has become more of a team player now because he can trust his teammates more and more, seeing that they are actually better than the people he had a few years back.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say that he doesn't cry to the refs either. He gives the refs their due and tells them when they make good calls. I see it happen all the time. When he disagrees he will speak about it but it's not a common thing.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say the press demonizes him because he and shaq had that little "feud" 5 years ago. Shaq has always been loved by the media because of his amiable personality, so Kobe was made out to be the antagonist and it's continued ever since.|`|tgZXvSv2aa	He's demonized because of <br>  <br>  -White Girl in Colorado<br>  <br>  -Kicked Shaq out of LA<br>  <br>  -Said he wanted to be traded but then changed his mind<br>  <br>  -Has been known to call off screens<br>  <br>  -Copied off of Isiah Rider's dunk to win the dunk contest<br>  <br>  -Misses a ton of shots and often makes little to no passes<br>  <br>  -Cries to the refs when he gets fouled|`|j6NImFHgaa	Because the press dont know anything. It's their job to spruce things up and make players look bad. But if you know the player personally, you will see how they really are, and the players see Kobe as a real down to earth person.|`|fZ38PPgSaa	i doubt it
ePvvGUu3aa	Shawn Michaels vs. Sting<br>  <br>  Both men have similar stories from the past and present. Both men are well known by many fans and wrestlers, respected by arguably everyone.

lYnkvRASaa	Habs clearing a bit of space and doing Begin a favor.  Begin is a UFA next year and has been a healthy scratch quite a bit this year.  If he is going to earn a contract for next year somewhere he has to play.  Gainey was lucky in that he got someone to take him without having to do the waivers/reentry waivers thing.<br>  <br>  A lot of these UFA guys near the end of their career seem to be having a tough time resigning the following year (smolinski comes to mind)  The youth movement is afoot in the NHl and as a 30+ year old UFA you better be playing to show teams you still have something.<br>  <br>  Dandenault is another one on the habs in a similar situation.|`|AA10068004	Yes I think Habs do lose a little physical presence with this deal.

3teWTOPqaa	Yeah Kobe can drop 40+ anytime he wants to, but he has to watch the game and decide when it's best to score and when to facilitate. If Kobe is just looking to put up points, it makes the Lakers much easier to defend.|`|9cub6mMQaa	He certainly tries - he takes enough shots. The problem is, when a player of Kobe's position (shooting guard) takes that many shots it's a team problem. When a player takes that many shots the other players tend to stand around and not run an offense because they KNOW they aren't going to see the ball in a shootable spot on the floor. (Just like early in Jordan's career for the Bulls)|`|6VW2lTxnaa	I beleive no, kobe cannot score 40+ points whenever. He is argubly, the best player in the NBA at this point in time, but you have to take in consideration that he is playing against the best ballers in the world. They can turn it on any game, just like he could. They made it there for a reason, and everyone one of them can play ball.. In turn, they can also play defence, like they have. If kobe could score 40+ every game, why wouldnt he? It's a dog eat dog world out there.|`|w8AFCj5xaa	Yup <br>  <br>  Kobe chucks the ball up 30 + times a game when he wants against sorry teams   but that doesn't help your team <br>  <br>  people need to relize kobe is just  a shot jacker   <br>  <br>  he will go like 12/27 from the field  and have like 0 reb 1 ast 0 stl   and people act like  had a spectacular performance|`|9IqUpCqgaa	He can score 40 points a night but if he wants to, but right now KB24 is becoming more matured and he is always trying to analyze the game and if he see's a teammate who is on fire he always share the ball  just to win the game.|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	yeah he could but then it would hurt his  teamates and his team and hurt his defense thus causing less wins so he wouldnt do it|`|k6wcLIRBaa	Yep but he dont need to but like in 05-06 he should have
u3FqxhY8aa	Wow that was pretty good to get this question from "Holy Thursday", I wouldn't have thought of that at all.  Nope I have heard nothing about poor little innocent Ana squeaking her shoes, guess she must have just done it that one match out of all of the matches she has played in her career.  Ana is better than that, her "squeaking" is Ana quick jumping to get herself ready for the serve.  I guess Daniela is just a very big sore loser.  Wait, and who is Daniela Hantchova again, what has she done other than this semifinal in the past year???|`|1w5blbobaa	Ohhhhh god why u hv problem with my all fave JBP(lol....)If Ana is sweet u can't blame her 4 that & She is no doubt.<br>  Bt ya I agree that squeaking is definitely annoying,bt Ana don' do it now.<br>  & don't talk abt Daniela She can never use the right advantage in right situation,it's not only AO bt recently though I didn't heard anything abt her.(except her AO doubles final).<br>  <br>  Anyway Holy Thursday JBP.|`|hRoR7AY8aa	i haven't heard any complaints but i can imagine it could become fairly annoying, but i think everyone obsesses over ana ivanovic to much can't wait until sharapova comes back so there is a little bit more variety so is friday going to be "Good Friday?"

There's you're answer. Dogs are lower on the chain of life therefore you're restrictions shouldn't be as tight as that of someone who murdered someone and I'm getting so tired of these questions on Vick, the man did a crime, he went to court, jury of his peers, fair trail, he went to prison. Everything that happened was by the book, a fair sentence was given so I believe he deserves to get out, its his time to get out.|`|Z9Nm6eDvaa	I don't have a problem with it. The courts decided he served his time, he must have been a model inmate or he would still be sitting behind bars. Plus lets jump to the facts, what he did is low down the ladder of crimes, people who have murdered and raped have been let out early too. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but if the man did his time he did his time and deserves a second chance.<br>  <br>  After all how many people have we all given second or more chances to, we are a forgiving society especially when you admit that you were wrong.|`|zcyTx4NZaa	You're comparing Mike Vick to Charles Manson?

They served their punishment and life moves on.<br>  <br>  Not comparing the two crimes but the system determined this was the appropriate punishment for Vick. I'm not going to board my dog at his house but it's completely unreasonable to continue punishing him.

qBk0fPWGaa	The normal pyro and Smackdown opening.<br>  <br>  the 2/27 edition of SmackDown opens with Vladimir Kozlov vs Undertaker and Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy being announced for later in the night.<br>  <br>  John Cena opens to mostly cheers and says it great to be back at smackdown. he says its been 2 years since he last was on smackdown, but not much has changed. says smackdown moved to mynetwork tv and he didnt know he owned a tv network. cena says 'micheal cole' looks the same except he is wearing a coboy hat. (referring to j.r.). he says that smackdown still has the same great fans to a pop. he then talks about promising that he would find edge and give him a fight. so thats what he is here to do. he calls out edge. edge makes his entrance. He asks for a World Heavyweight Championship re-match. Edge accepts, but Vickie comes out and says Edge won’t be competing tonight. Cena charges but Vickie says something. I can’t hear because there is so much heat on Vickie. i think she says cena will be facing someone tonight, but not edge and introduces Big Show as his opponent for later on in the show. big show's music plays as he walks on the stage to end<br>  the segment. (it will be interesting to see if jr or tazz announce that cena was traded to smackdown for triple h during this segment.)<br>  <br>  Carlito & Primo vs. The Miz & John Morrison for the WWE Tag Titles.<br>  A good match with a couple of missed spots. during the match the Bella Twins came to ringside to watch the action. primo was isolated in the heel corner as miz and morrison controlled the matchup for a while. primo finally got in some offense and baught enough time to tag in carlito. carlito came in and hit some offense. at the end of a back forth match carlito hit the Backstabber on Morrison for the win. the colons retain the WWE Tag Titles. after the match The bellas left with Primo and Carlito. one of the twins looked back at Miz and Morrison like she wanted to stay with them and wasn't necessarily happy to leave with the colons.<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Kozlov<br>  A very long match that was boring in spots but the crowd was firmly behind Undertaker throughout the contest. Kozlov botches snake eyes twice. taker finally goes for old school, but kozlov reversed it into a powerslam and gets the 3 count. Surprisingly clean pinfall victory for Kozlov, (judging by vickie's comments on the 2/20 taping and kozlov's win over the undertaker, it looks like kozlov may be at least temporarly in the picture to face taker at wrestlemania.)<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy<br>  Matt out first. then Jeff comes out in street clothes, which surprised everyone. Jeff on the mic says they’ve always been together and that they will always be brothers. Matt says he is not his brother. He goes on a long semi-shoot about how the fans love Jeff more and how it is about Matt this time. He says the fans wouldn’t forgive Matt if he committed Jeff’s sins. Matt blames the fans and Jeff for his mediocre career. He says Jeff is all hype. Matt says fight me but Jeff refuses. Matt slaps Jeff twice but Jeff exits the ring and walks away up the ramp to a mixed reaction. There is no match.<br>  <br>  Shelton Benjamin vs. Chavo.<br>  mvp made his entrance in business suit sans the jacket and sat with j.r. and tazz at the announce table to be was a guest on commentary.<br>  Benjamin threw Chavo into MVP at one point. <br>  Benjamin Taunts MVP then gets cradled for the roll up 3 count. and Chavo Guererro defeated Shelton Benjamin. as Shelton looked stunned by his defeat, MVP hit the Drive By Kick on Benjamin.<br>  <br>  John Cena vs. Big Show<br>  Huge pops for both athletes. long match with offense back and forth. match was so long the crowd was dead for awhile. looked like cena and show were improvising alot. Cena finally hit the Attitude Adjustment on his 2nd attempt and then Edge ran out and slid in and out of the ring without even touching Cena. weird spot. Cena was distracted by Edge at ringside and gets the KO from Big Show. High elevation Showstopper for the pinfall victory. Edge gets in the ring and poses over Cena to end the tv show. <br>  (triple h did not appear on the 2/27 episode of smackdown. im sure raw on 2/23 will reveal why.)<br>  <br>  bonus dark match:<br>  casket match: undertaker vs big show.<br>  during big shows entrance he acted paranoid, even turning quickly towards the fans at the corner where the ring steps are.<br>  taker Kicks and punches Big Show. show falls and taker rolled show in the casket with his foot and slammed the lid shut. the match was around a minute. my friend looked at a text and the match was over. no one around me expected that short of match given the advertising it had locally. after taker left up the ramp rather quickly. the ring crew opened the casket and show freaked like he ants on him and flopped around a little before exiting up the ramp.<br>  <br>  Biggest Pops:<br>  1) John Cena<br>  2) Jeff Hardy<br>  3)Undertaker<br>  <br>  Biggest Heat:<br>  1) Vickie Guerrero (seriously, this woman has tremendous heat. Eddie would be proud)<br>  2) Edge<br>  3)matt hardy<br>  4)kozlov|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Carlito & Primo vs. The Miz & John Morrison for the WWE Tag Titles.<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Kozlov<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy<br>  <br>  Shelton Benjamin vs. Chavo.<br>  <br>  John Cena vs. Big Show

A lot of players have got a duck in their first Test innings and still went on to play a major role for their respective teams.<br>   <br>  In Tendulkar's first ODI innings he got out for naught, today he is arguably the best ODI player (in fact he took 70+ ODIs to register his first century) <br>  <br>  Hughes may not have got an auspicious start to his career. But that does not mean he can't make it big in test cricket. We should also consider the amount of pressure that was weighing on him. We can hope he can make an indelible mark before the end of the series.|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	Who knows whether this will harm his career, theres no reason why he can't score well in the second innings, <br>  <br>  But with so many players scrambling for the vacant opening position left by Hayden that if he doesn't score well they may chose to try one of the other players. If they perform well we may well have seen the last of Hughes.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It was only his first innings, give him a break. Plenty of other top class batsmen have all got first up ducks and have been mentioned herelike Gooch and Tendulkar.<br>  <br>  Truc, he wasn't judged on one innings. Prior to this he was one of the seasons top scorers in the Shield.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	nothing|`|R0NfdgzLaa	we've seen that judging players on one innings isn't a good idea, just ask dave warner.  as soon as the hysteria started (after his smashing 89 on debut) you could tell there would be people calling for his head after five or six digs.  you can't replicate that kind of form, day in, day out, but nobody in the media seems to understand that.  same with hughes, he won't be getting blobs every time he bats, so at least he can relax as the media probably think he's already been axed.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	He would have it roasted and eat it,so that it gives him the energy to do well next time.So this duck will help him a lot!!!<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I'm weird  indeed, thanks Marco<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Ofcourse Rixie(Asterix) is weirder than me|`|gz2M5hsBaa	There was this Sri Lankan guy who got 5 ducks and only scored a single run in his first three test matches.

7PHmV3fBaa	"Not happening" said Big Albert's agent.<br>  <br>  Well the agent DID say that on Sunday/Monday and said that he was still talking with the Titans, but guess what!? ...... as of early today Haynesworth is worth 100 Mill to the Skins so he's out of Tennessee. Today he signed.<br>  <br>  It's really weird with all been said by the agent and the fact that Albert is from Tennessee and that the Titans did had that kind of money to offer, too bad Albert won't be on a Super bowl team this year.|`|Pw4sfCZVaa	I am a hardcore skins fan. Don't listen to any of the other responses.<br>  <br>  Currently the Redskins are about 8-14 million BELOW the salary cap. <br>  <br>  Dan snyder I believe is starting to learn that big name free agents don't make a team<br>  <br>  They can afford Haynesworth, but would have difficulty doing other things such as upgrading there lines, and drafting players<br>  <br>  They are not in one of the best cap situations, infact one of the worst<br>  <br>  Are restructuring deals in order to extend the contracts time to pay money therefore increasing salary cap.<br>  <br>  Relief has hit the Redskins because the cap was raised 4 million dollars due to decreased salary usage<br>  <br>  The teams most likely to sign worth are Tampa and Detroit, both have ample cap room, and have recently cut players where 'worth would play|`|4J519h4Oaa	They do but it all is money up front signing bonus etc, so they can stay within the cap and not go over. They still have to sign other people including their draft picks so they will have to make some moves if they want to get younger and still be a good football team. They need him and some offensive lineman maybe the draft can bring the offensive lineman on board.|`|fKco44yxaa	Do you fools just answer randomly without looking at anything?<br>  <br>  The Redskins are 3mil OVER the cap.....they have NO room to sign anyone...at them moment they are restructuring deals to not get penalties....they're not even thinking about free agents atm<br>  <br>  Specially the big man who wants 16mil+ a year|`|ZgFqLJOYaa	Heck ya!|`|AA11364084	yes|`|4kdlE54Paa	They have one of the highest cap room available.  They are looking to be theones actively picking him up because they can afford him. <br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.
87GObfqEaa	You know, Shane Doan is doing pretty good as a captain but if you added Ovie or Crosby they would be playing alot better. They need to make some changes before the trade deadline if they want a chance. Of course if the Coyotes would get a bigger named player they would sell more tickets. Bill Moyes, the owner of the coyotes, has said that they have had interested investors but know one knows who???? I know that they haven't been paying the rent for a few months and the paper said this morning that they are behind $4 million. They're trying to get the city of Glendale to reduce some fees that they have to pay too. Alot of rumors have been started from up in Canada about the Coyotes moving but they aren't true.|`|t14Jk1IPaa	Probably didn't affect the way they play, but they are in some trouble! From what i heard they aren't paying rent on the building and the Owner has lots millions of dollars trying to save the team. If Crosby Or Ovie was playing there the team would be playing better. I think would would really help the team is making the playoffs and making some extra bucks in the playoffs, but I don't know of that team will be able to stay there, we will see.
Y0154oAYaa	Because they quack under pressure.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Boston is the one of the top teams in the NHL while the Ducks are struggling to make a playoff spot.|`|ViB84hYzaa	Poor player management and the team from what I have heard has stopped listening to Carlyle.

But then I love terrible puns so, if this were my question you would have just gotten best answer for that one. lol.|`|2hb0Lr2Raa	hey you telling this to CBJ fan?<br>  we've been disappointed too many times, so no complaining from you!
NZKramllaa	Cena, He has his "Technical" Side Occasionally and "Powerhouse" Side. He is more able to Carry a match a little bit more than Batista IMO. and Cena is real good at being a brawler as well and Can work the Crowd really good between those three Cena and Hardy are the best are Working Crowds. Cena isn't a Mind Game type of guy like Triple H, Randy Orton and Chris Jericho. He is more of a Straight in your face type of Person, and Cena can transition through many styles of Wrestling.<br>  <br>  I've seen Batista in OVW he is a great wrestler. but People who hate him only judge what they see in WWE and doesn't research his background. The thing with Batista he is just Powerhouse and nothing else. We Rarely see any Technical Wrestling or any other from him. He is just pure powerhouse and alot of people find that boring, Even Bigshow the biggest powerhouse of them all Shows his Other Attributes other than Powerhouse and Able to do a DDT, LegDrop etc....and Batista tends to be just a lift and slam type of Wrestler half the time.<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy can Wrestle, but does it to his Own Style. Wrestling is a very unique sport and there are Many ways to Wrestle diffrerently and Jeff Hardy is one of those Individuals that Wrestles Differently and Yes Extreme High Flying is a Wrestling Attribute. Hardy is showing improvement, We see him pull out a Couple of Technical Moves every once in a while. So he is slowly learning differet styles.<br>  <br>  Overall out of all three Cena is my pick.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Yes I completely agree. But, what there doing if following there gimmick and should not be scrutinized!<br>  <br>  Probably Cena he looked great in OVW!|`|T13xM9iJaa	I would have to say Cena when I saw him in the indys I was like wow he can wrestle same goes for Batista|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	batista no question|`|j9GokH9Qaa	hardy no doubt..|`|9dMc4ZMRaa	Jeff Hardy. The guy isnt afraid of making crazy jumps and moves (like the one he did on Randy Orton), and the guy can also get VERY VERY extreme even though he doesnt look like it. Cena and Batista are 2 disgraces for the WWE - people mock them, and they only have fans because they're faces. And they never turn! That's what sucks|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Good question. Nice explanation too. I agree with everything that you said. I personally think Jeff Hardy is the best of all three. I really like them all though, so it's really hard to pick the best one. I think Jeff does win this one though. It's a close call. I narrowed it down to Jeff and Cena.|`|w173betxaa	Well, Batista is but, Cena is a close 2nd because if you saw his first match against Kurt Angle you would see his technical wrestling ability.|`|41WXZPnCaa	MMMM Damn I'm Cena Fan <br>  <br>  But I Don't Know If Cena Or Batista <br>  <br>  A Good Wrestler Should Have A Good Move Cena Has The STF and Batista The Figure 4  And Jeff ?????<br>  <br>  John Cena|`|OnN5FQf4aa	WWE sucks. Jeff Hardy wins because he can do the most stuff. Cena and Batista are douchebags.|`|KCS862Qaaa	John Cena.|`|FkFKDpt5aa	randy orton|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Jeff Hardy|`|6Ro48ZhMaa	cena= steroids<br>  <br>  batista= more steroids<br>  <br>  jeff= no steroids <br>  <br>  jeff is better|`|YU51MbZDaa	John Cena|`|qBk0fPWGaa	Neither all are great but better:<br>                       Dolph Ziggler!!!!!!!!!!|`|NXktxy8jaa	Call Me Crazy, But It Is Batista.<br>  But Before You Give Me Thumbs Down, Hear Me Out:<br>  Batista Is A Powerhouse, He Will Stop Almost Anyone<br>  His Weight And Strength Can Prove It And No He Doesn't Take Steroids For You Haters...<br>  Yes, Jeff Hardy Is A High-Flying Risktaker, But That Is Really All He Can Do.<br>  He Is Small In Size And Muscle So He Cannot Land Powerhouse Moves Like Batista<br>  John Cena Is A Brawler. He Focuses On Weakening His Opponents Slowly While Batista Goes For The Kill Right Away<br>  John Cena Takes It Slow And Lets The Crowd Savor The Moment, While Batista Focuses On The Match And He Tries To Get It Done Immediately.<br>  They Are All Great In Their Own Way, But I See Batista Being Better Overall.

Wait, Jon Kitna would be better.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I make a point of not grading a list of guys on a scale of boyfriend material.|`|Gs2fpVJfaa	nope dont think hes the greatest boyfriend even though i like him as a football player|`|RS3fjNboaa	LOL! I don't have an answer Troller. This is freakin funny!

c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	**** no.<br>  <br>  Pro football would only exist in TX, CA, FL and OH.<br>  <br>  Hockey would only exist in Canada, MN and MI.<br>  <br>  And the MLB would move to the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  This is just a bad idea.|`|etErp8rcaa	They should be able to leave their home provinces, but it might be interesting to see a battle of the provinces. <br>  <br>  My own province, Alberta, would field a ridiculous team, especially on the blueline (Phaneuf, Green, Neidermayer, and Bouwmeester are all Albertan), but it kinda falls apart in goal.|`|Y0154oAYaa	It would be unworkable in professional sports although when building a team you should factor in the home town advantage.|`|WPCATkoYaa	no it is so much more fun if they get traded everywhere. then you get the chance of a good player coming to your state|`|b6QazRVwaa	not at all|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	..........and who would play for the Southern teams?
3teWTOPqaa	lol, I thought that was kinda of funny when Artest said that, but when you think about it, it kinda of make sense, Artest got the strength, length, IQ, and jump shot, all he needs is be incredibly athletic to be just like LeBron.<br>  <br>  just on that note, I think Kobe is probably a new and improved version of Shane Battier, you take away the jump shot and athleticism, then you get the current Shane Battier.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Ron Artest times 500.<br>  <br>  Much, much, much better than Ron-Ron.  Although, Artest's D is better, and it probably always will be.|`|xP08melDaa	Lebron's better than Artest but thats not saying much... To tell you the truth i think Lebron is one of the most overrated players ever..
wDCfu9hGaa	Skate tool, wax, kicker ramp, rail, skate video, pads/helmet, skate/it game, skate clothes/shoes.|`|KJMOvKcSaa	maybe some shoes if yours are worn out. shoe gue (not glue. gue)is what ALL street skaters need. a rail. idk maybe some skateboard gear youll need in the future(deck wheels bearing trucks hardware)|`|dYK1KPp4aa	Customized deck.

giWvSwqRaa	Power seeker.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	well theres no real type of player you are based on what racquet you have. But generally beginners use oversized because they lack the coordination/form to hit it in the middle all the time. But My friend whos really good uses an oversized racquet, and it works out nice in his serve and volley, but you wont see many pro's with an oversized racquet.|`|JJ0OIiZ1aa	Okay sherrise bad player has nothing to do with it. Yes normally beginners use it, but ive seen college and international player use oversize. Once you get the game down well, you want to switch to midplus or so, but there are some players that just like the feel of oversize rackets.|`|dOpKsNYcaa	No type in particular. You can play any style with an oversize racket. The larger racket head is used mostly by players that want to add a larger surface area and sweet spot on the racket. A lot of people find the larger racket heavier and more awkward but some find it easier to play with. Andre Agassi used an over-sized head racket for 20 years.|`|sptrtwxlaa	a bad player or beginner.|`|ZOFaizO3aa	one word....pusher|`|monCPTRVaa	This is most likely because you are a beginner. Most beginners use oversize racquets. Once you become more experienced, you might switch to midsize to midplus racquets.<br>  <br>  And if you play with head, then that just means you play with Head. ;)|`|dac40c900160ab9700d5d99256e01ca6aa	You have to be a good player to be able to control such a large racket.

(3-55)<br>  Seriously though, got to go to work so only had time to look at that race. Very difficult one again. Surprised you didn't mention that Spencer is going for a four time consecutive on SINGLEB who is now improving and is the one I would be on to WIN,but, there are three others, TUXEDO your LEND A GRAND who could well be placed if he gets a run, and that being my point, several are finishers,but think Singleb should hold on from running just off the pace. The other one that comes into the reckoning is SWEET GALE rated just 63 a drop from 74 last time out. Not a race I would normally play with, but, as you put it up and I looked at it,I might just have a quid or so on each and combination f/c and t/c|`|1e0f00a9ac9b210b0e0841914953d657aa	well done that man,i couldnt pick my nose. but i fancy give us a song 2.15 lingfield ew p.s keep em coming|`|88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	I've been keeping an eye on your selections and have been very impressed.Lot's of people slate the all-weather but there's winners to be had,especially if you bear in mind the difference in the surfaces.<br>  <br>  Sadly I bumped two of my e/w lucky 15 selections for you two picks so have to apologise for the jinx.<br>  <br>  Even worse I dumped Ridgeway Jazz which won at 10/1.<br>  I Also left out Dvinsky at 8.20 .<br>  <br>  The two I had left are Teasing going in a minute and Cap ST Jean at 8.50.<br>  I always tell people to stick with their pick too.<br>  Keep up the good work!|`|bQmMNG5vaa	You did well yesterday, shame I didn't put bahamian shot on early, or even at all!!!
2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Hah, that's pretty horrible. <br>  <br>  I'm happy we scored 29 in the second, and we are only down by 5!<br>  We just shot the ball at 20 some percent! <br>  <br>  Wow, we just weathered a storm.|`|j6NImFHgaa	The question is not specific as to if this is for a player or a team as a whole. But it's good for a player from highschool to the NBA, but not good for a team, LOL|`|JV8lgDRCaa	for madsen, thats a LOT. lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: the cavs has only 11 POINTS against the Rockets at the end of the 1st Q...<br>  thats not a GOOD GAME. not good =(|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	For a single player, that's good. for a whole team that sucks.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Average for each QT|`|v9bTfQGMaa	By one person, yes. By the team, no (NBA and usually college) High School, sometimes.|`|WumhCEpVaa	11 points hell ya in a quarter imagine 11x4=44 44 pts in 1 game like come on|`|aupDanleaa	yeah its the most any team has scored in a quarter ever|`|tgZXvSv2aa	For a single player to do so in the NBA, yes it is.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Team = Not so good.<br>  <br>  Player = Good.|`|A2SogiGCaa	its average|`|bQqkdPL9aa	doesnt matter cuz cavs put up 29 in the 2nd|`|ipCGjFSoaa	That's a huge number for a quarter.  If you scored 11 each quarter you would have 44 at the end of the night.  I don't think anyone has ever averaged that many points a game in the history of the NBA.  Avg. points per game seems to top out at about 30-33 by a handful of players each year, so yeah.|`|tGjoKeUtaa	no thats rilly good if u score that much every quarter u will score 44 points. Whoever said thats terrible is stupid|`|khbLZQHIaa	No, that's horrible for the NBA.(See: Cleveland Cavaliers @ Houstan Rockets.... Wow, I've been busy doing other stuff I forgot about the game.... Although, this game is defenisve so neither team has many points.  Lol at how big this parenthases is.)<br>  <br>  Pretty bad for College (Although college only has two quarters/halfs)<br>  <br>  Not great for High School.  It's not bad either though.<br>  <br>  And Middle School and under, it's fine.  Sometimes good.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Lol @ Cavs...
zWIpcQvsaa	Nope! If Liverpool can beat them at their own ground, it's doubtful that Real will win at Anfield, stranger things have happened... But i doubt it!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes, 2-0 at Anfield|`|IXDiEX8eaa	No.Madrid have just lost at home.So my prediction for the second leg is Liverpool 2 Madrid 0|`|gpNIG15eaa	Hopefully Real Madrid will throw Liverpool into the Champions League bin of rejects.|`|exARv7Bmaa	Don't know, do you know if it'll be raining?|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Maybe or maybe not i don't care go Chelsea|`|8QxVjXUxaa	YES!!! REAL MADRID WILL KICK LOTTOPOOL'S ***|`|MRvHMel9aa	No, with Liverpool's victory in Madrid on Wednesday Madrid will have to win by 2 (because of the aggregate) and against a defense like Liverpool's and a keeper like Reina it's unlikely. (FYI I'm a Liverpool fan)|`|xMEuz7otaa	In the 2nd leg, I predict a 1-1 scoreline and Liverpool will go through 2-1 on aggregate..|`|n0Zh6sn6aa	No.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for you. The fact is that Gerrard, Torres, Kuyt, Babel, Ngog will prove to be too much for Real Madrid's defense|`|2zTX5qpSaa	No. The just lost at home and barely have a chance to win at Anfield.|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	No Liverpool will knock them out of the CL.|`|LNfQSoPkaa	Surprisingly...no|`|uJRMjYhFaa	I think that Liverpool will win!|`|qbf2ZXWHaa	yeah don't worry Real Madrid will win.

Jf8LiEw2aa	I'm a runner, but I would say do baseball if it's something you love to do and are good at. If you do register for baseball, I STRONGLY encourage you to do some running on the side. It is extremely beneficial for any sport!|`|P055DfvBaa	Well coming from a guy who grew up playing baseball and ran track in high school,  I would probably play baseball. Here's why.  You will do running in baseball, just not like in track.  And in track you sit around waiting for your event bored out of your mind.  You could always run on your own time.  And is there a Professional track league like baseball?  If you are good enough, there's definitely a better future in baseball.|`|PqY0xNxHaa	Why would you ask this on THIS section? Everybody's gonna say baseball.

e0yNUBd9aa	Look for roosting areas by locating droppings in the leaves.  Turkey droppings are white and look more like thick drops of paint.  Secondly look for feeding areas by looking for tracks in the dirt around fields and places where they have been scratching in the leaves for acorns and bugs.  The night before your hunt sit quietly near roosting areas and see if you can hear any birds fly up to roost.  If you do hear them, set up before daylight between the roost and feeding areas, wait for them to pitch down from the roost and start calling softly.  If you do not roost and birds (hear them fly up) then try to locate birds in the roost just before sun up with an owl hooter.  If you cant locate any birds in the roost, set up near feeding areas because they will head there at some point.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Country boy, don't dog the dude out. He SAID he's never hunted turkey.

Also walk around in the woods if turkeys have been known to be in the area and search for trees with a lot of droppings underneath them. Look for areas of disturbed ground cover where they have been scratching around for bugs.<br>  <br>  You can also sit in the woods right a around dark and listen for the soft putts and clucks of the turkeys while they are roosting, and even the flapping of the wings when they are flying up to roost.|`|llcbe14kaa	Look for turkeys! Just kidding! Personally I like to take a yelper and an owl hooter, move slowly and do more listening than anything. An occasional "scratch" on the slate or a few "hoots" will often illicit responses from turkeys.

bHr7nGAvaa	Withthe current Assault weapon ban that they are proposing, hte are planning to do away with ANY autoloading rifle.  The excuse they are using this time?  To keep guns off of the mexican streets.  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=6960824&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=...</a>|`|440w07PQaa	I'm not sure where you are, but in America semi-autos are still legal. The anti-gunners in power are talking about creating a new "assault" weapon ban, but they haven't done it yet. It will take some time before they do. <br>  <br>  Full-autos (machine guns) have been heavily regulated since the National Firearms Act of 1934. Then, in 1986, the gov't amended the 1968 Gun Control Act. The amended 1968 GCA prohibits civilians from owning any machine gun made after 1986. American civilians can still buy properly registered machineguns that were made before 1986. However, they are relatively rare and therefore *extremely* expensive.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	ya they did that assault weapons ban today but thats only fully auto or burst ....you will be ok if you already have a m 14
UoT86gbiaa	Do not take a pitcher.  Unless you're in a format than loves pitchers, wait until after at least round 3 for your first pitcher... round 5 is better.<br>  <br>  When you pick at the turn, look in your first pick for value: somebody that fell.  Maybe Miguel Cabrera is unexpectedly there, but if not then Rollins or Braun would both be excellent choices.  In your second pick, you may have to reach, as it's a long time before you get to take someone else.  I like Utley here, especially if you can nab Rollins first.  Then you're covered with great players in the two shallowest positions and won't have to worry much about room trends until closers start popping.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	I would definitely take Braun if he's available. I also like the power/pitch combo.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	There are 3 great fantasy SS. If Rollins is there,, take him. The 4th best SS is a 3rd or 4th round pick|`|cWmx0J4jaa	not bad, but check out Lincecum too.|`|eSL9tWnQaa	Personally I'd lay off the pitching before the 10th-11th picks, SPs are always a gamble, power is not. I'd look for Howard, Tiexeira, Manny & Longoria around that time assuming Hamilton and others are off the board.|`|yqaQPYzaaa	Id go with Teixeira and Braun back to back.|`|FMuEJ6Tuaa	I go Rollins and Utley.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	Great choice of Howard/ Santana.|`|LGVrhTFTaa	1)Sizemore 2)Braun 3)Howard 4)Tiexiera 5)Utley<br>  <br>  J.Rollins' production doesn't merit this high of a pick (I'd rather grab Alexie Ramirez in the 4th,or 5th round.).Don't reach for players just because they play a shallow position.But,build a strong/over powering offence in the 1st 6 rounds.THEN start taking pitchers,and closers.<br>  Also; only take 1,or 2 outfielders,0 catchers,and 0 offencive backups in the 1st 6 rounds.Take 3,or 4 pitchers in a row after the all important 1st 6 rounds.(There will be good outfielders,catchers,and utility players<br>  after round 10.) Last thing,keep your offencive bench to a minimum (I<br>  only have Willy Taveras on mine for an occasional boost of steals+runs.) Alot of starting pitchers+closers will over power the teams that wasted early picks on big name pitchers+closers.I've won <br>  4 of 6 of these leagues,and that's how I did it.<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~
wK4GjOpHaa	Hockey is not necessarily violent. There are a lot of recreational NON contact leagues out there.  There are divisions for beginners to learn the game and play at a slower pace.  I am a woman and I have played year round for the last 9 years.  Both my son and daughter play.  It's fun and actually can be addicting.  This is something that you and this guy can do together.  Go for it.|`|8ebGghbbaa	That's a dumb reason to play hockey. It's lots of work and it's a violent sport. If you aren't ready to work your *** off and get hit, then I wouldn't reccomend it. If you really like the sport then it is awesome to play.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	Its fun. But it requires skill.|`|zcyTx4NZaa	Why is that a dumb reason to start playing?<br>  <br>  You know how many people start doing things that they probably would never do because a girlfriend or boyfriend does it? Lots, it's called taking an interest in your partners interests and it's a good thing.<br>  <br>  If my girlfriend who knew nothing of hockey started watching games and playing it because she knows I love it, and then because of that grew to love hockey herself, I would love her even more for it.<br>  <br>  I say go out, play a few games and see if you like it, trying new things is never a bad idea. (well almost never)
MjkUm0yFaa	i'd work on it. but their not that bad. if u have only been swimming a bit, their actually pretty good. work on technique.|`|2umKyYEaaa	Better than me when I was your age. I didn't take swimming seriously back then though. It really depends on how you swim. For example, I started swimming when I was 10 or 11, skipped a lot of classes and didn't swim at all last year. Now I'm 15 and I regret it. Here are my times if you want to compare:100 free: <1:09<br>                                    50 breaststroke: ~40 seconds<br>  I know a kid who's about 10 years old, if not younger, that's a bit faster than me. I don't compare to others because I haven't been swimming that long and really suck for my age group, but I still swim regularly and try to improve. Compare your times with other people that are around the same age and have been swimming for as long as you. Nobody can really tell you if you times are good or not, it depends on the person. <br>  I'd say your times aren't too bad, but you probably could do better.|`|9FzQOUjNaa	Yeah there okay.. a lot of hardwork will get thoses times even faster|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	no their not you need to practice|`|hISHBHRYaa	Your freestyle times could use some work but I have to say, you are definately a breastroker. 44.56 is really good for your age|`|ug0TFgD7aa	yup that's ok...|`|jIyvb2OOaa	no theyre not so hot

rvyvF3KAaa	It's not the best idea to make a mock draft for fantasy baseball. Many things get mixed up so that mock draft is highly unlikely to turn out the way you want it too. I like it though.|`|PxMNxytjaa	I dont get it! hahaha but i guess B|`|b6QazRVwaa	A <br>  maybe another quality reliever could help, but fantasy drafts are hard to prepare for.  good mock draft though
vMZCED9jaa	That's kind of hard. Whenever I play with my neighborhood friends, I aim at 300 to 400fps electrics, such as JG's/Echo's, and G&G plasticas, and they usually break skin and kinda leave a bloody welt for a month or so... That's the fun of it. You're scared, but you also want them to be scared. So you have to use tactics, and what-not, and an ideal plan.<br>  Go for Walmart, Dick's, Sports Authority, basically your non specialized airsoft stores. Though airsoft atlanta does sell some good springers, they may "hurt". Well maybe at 10ft, it'll leave a welt, and if you use .2's.<br>  Use .12s, they don't hurt, even though its they shoot at a higher velocity, that doesn't mean anything. <br>  Hurt? Well.. I guess all airsoft  guns hurt, but some are just feel like a small pinch that will go away in a few minutes or hours. So aim at anything under 300fps with .12s. That's about 230ish with .2s.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	As said by others go to walmart. You can find a great variety for around 20 bucks and almost all list the FPS on the outside of the package. That mixed with a lighter pellet will do just fine. You should be able to find some spring pistols in the 200 range that wont hurt with a decent shirt and jeans on. AND EYE PROTECTION.|`|e7dd270cdf00271adf6455ab26554175aa	Walmart sells a bunch of airsoft guns for decent prices that dont hurt a bit. Try one of the electronic types. They dont hurt at all.|`|MWvcl9tKaa	If you dont want them to hurt then I suggest a spring pistol, but im sure in the future you wll want somthing more accurate.

Who cares that he had the most stats in the 80's. It's just a decade. Do you care who had the most wins, and k's from 1975-1984? No you don't. THat stat is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, Morris was good, but no better than schilling, and I don't think Schilling belongs either. Alan Trammel was a great fielder with a good bat. Not one of the all time greats. Sweet Lou was also very good, but certainly not greeat. It doesn't matter how long they played together. That is irrelevant. Players aren't judged based on how much time they spent alongside other players. THey're judged on INDIVIDUAL achievment. If you want to put them in TOGETHER, on the SAME PLAQUE...fine, but not individually. And Dale Murphy was a .265 hitter. Period.
wAwQDwDBaa	I would every day dribble with each hand (while not looking of course) right 100 times then left 100 times. Then not looking again dribble back and forth right and left 100 times. Then open your legs one stretched out in front of the other so you can dribble through them one hand to the other 100 times. Then switch with the back foot from the first drill and dribble 100 times. As well as what the first guy said.|`|WumhCEpVaa	you can do stuff like dribble through ur legs backwards and frontwards and also do figure 8 which is dribbling in a 8|`|wFhf2N33aa	If you want to improve your dribbling skills, try bouncing the ball with your good hand then your other hand. Then if you master dribbling with both hands, take a ball and a bounce it off a wall.

So I'ma start with the 5s, what can I say just a great looking shoe with mad comfort. The cushioning and colorways of this shoe is just crazy. The reflective tongue shines like no other shoe in the world (my opinion). Now, the 13s are comfortable, have great traction, look amazing, suede feels great, and one of the best basketball shoes in the Jordan line. The "Black Cat" design is what I really love about this shoe.|`|xm2ZxPXXaa	30+ pairs but my favorites are:                           <br>  air jordan 6<br>  air jordan 8<br>  air jordan 12<br>  all these shoes are nice and comfortable when playing ball!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	the 1s|`|bJSSwWitaa	I love the 11's because they're hottt with the patent leather, and they came out in the time when jordan made his 1st cameback, and saved basketball .|`|vFbzBo4eaa	All Air Jordan shoes are great and it's a pleasure to have one|`|9iB1AiQlaa	From 1996 to 1998.

Rob Van Dam (gone), Mr. Kennedy (movies or injured) and CM Punk. Now all have won the title when they cashed in, but none has really moved to main event status. Even with everything the WWE tried with CM Punk he just never was really over with the fans as the WWE wanted him to be. Of course you aren't really over unless you have the complete backing of the McMahons and Triple H.
w173betxaa	The first one @ WM21<br>  <br>  the first Money in the Bank ladder match which featured Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Shelton Benjamin, Edge, Kane, and Christian with Tyson Tomko at ringside. The match contained many notable moments, including points where Jericho, Christian, Benjamin and Kane all jumped over the top rope to the outside of the ring to knock down multiple opponents. Another moment included Benjamin executing a T-Bone Suplex on Edge off the top of a ladder and later using an inclined ladder as a ramp to run up a standing and hit Jericho with a Clothesline maneuver. Benoit also executed a Diving headbutt from the top of a ladder onto Kane. In the conclusion of the match, Benoit climbed a ladder to attempt to retrieve the Money in the Bank briefcase hanging above the ring but was stopped by Kane who had also climbed the ladder. Benoit used repeated headbutts to knock Kane to the ground and attempted to retrieve the briefcase once more but was knocked down by Edge who hit him with a steel chair. Edge then climbed the ladder and successfully obtained possession of the briefcase to win the match.|`|dcNT65mTaa	WM24 MITB was the best in my opinion. The participants were CM Punk, who won, Y2J, Shelton Benjamin, MVP, John Morrison, Carlito, and Mr. Kennedy. It was so much carnage in and out the ring, Benjamin was thrown off a ladder onto a ladder, Morrison did a moonsault into a group of the participants fighting while holding a ladder, there were like 4 or 5 finishers done off the ladder (pay dirt- benjamin, mic check- kennedy, back stabber-carlito, twist of fate- matt hardy returned and attacks mvp).

Despite his wreckless attitude, terrible promos, and steroids, he was entertaining for me as a child and I liked him more than Hogan. <br>  <br>  90s-Undertaker... One of a kind, truly one of the legends, and a phenom by all means. The Undertaker was and is what wrestling was about, creating an image (or gimmick if u prefer) that mesmerizes the audience and a wrestler with in ring ability to put on a performance to remember as often as possible. I had a better understanding of the WWE and WCW at this time and no one kept me watching more than the Phenom.<br>  <br>  00s- Kane... Since his debut, I was a fan. I didn't like the whole unmasking any more than I liked Rey Mysterio's. It just seemed pointless, and really didn't seem like it would make him any more a fan favorite.

Tall lanky people are easier to throw.  This same muscular body type is good at MMA types sports generally where grappling and boxing are frequent.<br>  <br>  Smaller people who have less strength are more suited to blending arts like (Japanese) jujutsu, aikido, and sometimes judo where strength is less of an issue and your opponent's energy is turned against him.<br>  <br>  Tournament karate, TKD, and kickboxing are sports where height and reach is a benefit.<br>  <br>  There are many more, this is just an overview.

AA11251285	Two days a week, go out to a local track and do some 'speedwork'.<br>  This would involve you first doing a warm up of a lap or two easy jog, and then do a full 100 yard sprint(just ONE of the straight-a-ways on the track). After the 100 yard sprint, do the rest of the lap around the track nice and slow jog to get your breath back.<br>  When you come back around to the place where you started your last 100 yard sprint, do ANOTHER 100 yard sprint, and again, finish the lap with an EASY, SLOW jog to get your breath back.<br>  Do this until you have done 4-8 sprints (depending on what shape you are in)<br>  <br>  If you do your speedwork on Monday, don't do it again until Friday.(You need to give your muscles a chance to heal & rest).<br>  <br>  On days that you are NOT doing your speedwork, you can lift weights and go for easy jogs of 2-4 milers.

nRBC4E5saa	Well, not trying to hedge my bets here but it depends on who you're going up against and what your strengths are.  I know a guy who's great at half guard and another who loves rubber guard, even one guy who does that upside-down guard stuff a lot.  I prefer open guard with the feet in the hips, or butterfly guard.  Rubber guard's better for subs, half guard is good for sweeps and scrambles, butterfly is pretty much only good for sweeps.  When you're first starting out, just try to retain guard and keep from getting passed.  Once you've got confidence that you won't have your guard passed too much, start playing around with your options.  Sooner or later you'll have your own guard game.  It probably won't look like anyone else's.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Well every one is different. Every one will also find different things that will work for them that will not work for some one else. It is just like callsign said. I personally am a full closed guard but getting used to opening it and putting my feet of the hips. In my opinion the only bad guard is an inactive guard. We have a guy at our gym who only competes in MMA so he gets a good rubber guard and tries to stall and it aggravates me because he has so many subs just waiting for him|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet system is really being adopted by so many grapplers that I even see it in my Hapkido school when we're rolling. It works when you know what you're doing but it really does depend on the situation so you can't say "this guard is the best" because it isn't that simple.<br>  <br>  I've always used a closed guard whenever I could. If i caught a half guard I hadn't considered the Lockdown to apply pressure to the calf, I simply continued working till I swept them over or managed to catch them in a full guard.<br>  <br>  There are always options and variations that you can use. Knowing them all takes years of training. Being able to recall them all in any given situation takes even longer. Keep working on what works for you and you'll find your preferred guard.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WAT6QksFaa	It is more personal preference and skill set than anything. <br>  I prefer half guard to lock down one of there legs and take their back.<br>  I use it as a feint to make "Mr Wrestler" guy get over confident and try to pass. It is then easy to either take their back or sweep to side,  full mount, or x guard. <br>  It cannot be explained in words, you need to work in your gym and have it done to you thousands of times.<br>  You cannot preform a proper rear-naked until your have had one done to you. You need to feel it putting you to sleep to appreciate it.<br>  That goes for every submission, sweep, guard, etc...<br>  You are very new , ask questions and don't be embarrased.<br>  <br>  Mc-28 yrs MA|`|ThNC4f1kaa	Half my training is freestyle wrestling so I don't like guards at all. Neither being in them or pulling one of my own.

I would take the belt and make a line across it. I would run the treadmill at whatever speed you run at and count how many times the belt rotated per minute. It would then be a matter of measuring the length of each belt rotation and multiplying it by the distance of each rotation. you could then transfer this info into fractions of a mile each minute and multiply that by each minute  you ran. It will be a bit of a pain. You could also use a pedometer and calculate the distance of each step and multiply it by the number of steps you took to get an approximate distance also.|`|RPJjtBLOaa	im gonna have to say the same thing<br>  plan it out before you run.<br>  <br>  like the car theory.

23qMl5LXaa	First of all, it sounds kinda like you just started this randomly. I don't know, but it just does. Some important things to remember are that you have to have forms to get more people. You can have a small team of just you 5, but it would be really really hard and it wouldn't look good to judges. I like your outfit idea, but personally, I think that it would be too hard to manouver and too hot. I think that you should toss off the gloves and the tights, make the shirt longer, add on the intials of your team name or the full name, add a few colors, and wham. It isn't as cute, but cheerleading is a serious buisness. My advice: join another team. I think that making your own is a great idea, however, in todays economy, it really isn't probable. However, I can't tell you what to do. Good Luck!|`|KnCcEfBpaa	Maye for a dance outfit, but for cheer (I am assuming 5 of you means a stunt group) lose the tights and gloves (for safety) and try to get matching uniforms (shell & skirt designed for that purpose).<br>  If you want the bare midriff style look for sites selling all-star uniforms. Your single best personal investment will be a pair of shoes made for cheer!<br>  <br>  Seriously, before thinking about uniforms, sign up as a group at either a local rec. cheer program, a gym(with cheer/tumbling classes) or even an HS squad's cheer camp and get qualified instruction on surfaces that are made for cheering. The cooler the stunts, the quicker you can end up in the emergency room.<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|8C4eDazGaa	sounds trashy...

The game being "on Senators ice" only makes the decision that much easier.  If you weren't going with a Leafs fan, it'd be a no-brainer.<br>  <br>  From a statistical perspective, the Leafs are up 3 points over the Senators, but the Senators have 2 more remaining games (if they win both, they would pull ahead by a point).  The Leafs have played as many games as your Habs have, which means the cold numbers (as well as your going with a Leafs fan) suggest you should break one of my 2 cardinal rules in the NHL (see my source).  If the game were on Leafs ice (and if you weren't going with a Senators fan), your decision would be a no-brainer.<br>  <br>  A third perspective is needed for me to actually help you, but unfortunately, I don't have that third perspective.|`|DuUEYkCZaa	Hi Ben G,it is good to know that there are still some Hab Fans.

Frazier-Ali (1), and Louis-Schmelling (2).  <br>  <br>  Frazier-Ali (1) was the first time that two undefeated heavyweight champions fought each other in their primes (arguably, since Ali was exiled for his true prime), and the WORLD showed up to see it, either by buying a ticket at MSG or at one of the hundreds of closed-circuit theaters around the world showing the fight live. . . If styles make fights, than this matchup is the kingpin to which all others should aspire to. . . the quintessential slugger (Frazier. . .all heart, killer hooks, and forward-only mentality). . .against the quintessential boxer (Ali. . . fast, mobile, long reach, and great defense).  Their third encounter, also, could be called the greatest match ever, since it showcased both of these warriors towards the end of their careers, showing that HEART is the last thing to go on a fighter's abilities.<br>  <br>  As for Louis-Schmelling (2) . . .  very short fight, but the GLOBAL ramifications of this fight are breath-taking when you stop to think.  Joe Louis had already lost to Max Schmelling once, and had all the weight of a WAR on his shoulders. . .representing USA against a German, who represented the Nazi regime (unfairly, though, since Max never had any real ties to the Nazis). . . .and all this. . .with ADOLF HITLER sitting in the "box seats".  And Vitali Klitschko thinks HE'S under a lot of pressure, being asked to defend twice in four months?  Pleeeeeeease!!!!  Joe Louis scores a killer one-round knockout of Max Schmelling. . . placing it in the running for greatest fight of all time.<br>  <br>  So what matters is. . . are you looking for pure FIGHT contents (Frazier-Ali). . . or GLOBAL impact (Louis-Schmelling)?

8iRi6hqSaa	Aah the good old days of learning to Kickflip, I remember getting so worked up when I saw every Skater around me doing Kickflips without even trying yet there I was trying and trying but to no avail. It felt like no matter what I did I could not get both me feet on it, why? Fear? maybe. To be honest I do not know exactly what was stopping me from learning this trick. I did however eventually learn it, now I learnt slow and then started to speed up later, some people learn things fast some slow, some weird like me, it wasn't until about 6-7months into Skateboarding until I sucessfully landed a Kickflip, hard to believe? yep I thought so. The weird part is I learnt Switch Kickflips and Nollie Flips in less than 2 weeks, this is strange but also not because switch and nollie are just the same as normal kickflips and other tricks except you use your opposite feet, if your goofy stance by default like me (meaning you skate with your right foot on the front of the board and push with the left) then your left foot at front and pushing with your right foot would be switch for you, the same rules apply when doing switch tricks however it is much harder to perform a switch trick, like kicking a football with your opposite foot, I found that practically impossible to control the ball or to even get power in the kick. Anyways now that you know how long it took me to learn the Kickflip I hope that you don't beat yourself up over it too much if you do not land it straight away, now onto how to perform the Kickflip... <br>  <br>  Explanation of The Kickflip...<br>  Ok in order to pull this trick off you are going to need to be confident in your Ollie. Something I wasn't when trying to perform this trick, that could be why it took me so long to learn but anyways to do a kickflip first bend down like an Ollie and relate to the force in the back foot step. Push down with your back foot, raise your front foot so the board lifts up off the ground, raise your back foot too but this time as your lifting up off the floor move your front foot toward the Nose of the board and as your doing this move your foot over the concave, so your moving your front foot up the board toward the nose and then you want to kick your foot out of the concave and give it a little pressure to make sure the board gets a good spin. You have to make sure you perform the Ollie basics while your front foot is moving up the Skateboard to give it the spin. Now the Skateboard should be spinning underneith your feet, your front foot should be far infront and above the board while your back foot is hanging above the back of the board waiting for the grip tape side to show again, as soon as you see that grip tape you MUST place your feet back on the board, this is where the back foot comes in, as soon as you see the grip tape move your back foot down so it stops the board spinning and at the same time bring your front foot back in so that you land with both feet on the board and not one. Then like the Ollie bend your knees so that you can take the pressure of the landing.<br>  <br>  Although it is hard to see when the board is back on the grip tape side, you will get used to it, most the time you will not even need to look as time progresses you will just know when to do it. You sense it and when your used to it you don't really need to focus as much but focusing is always better. That's how it's possible to skate blindfolded or with your eyes shut because you get used to how the tricks feel. Remember if you want your Kickflip to be higher do the same as the Ollie, more Pop and tuck yourself up and you will have a higher Kickflip. Go and master the Kickflip because it is one of the best tricks ever, it feels so good when you do them, especially as it's the main trick and almost everyone learns this trick first (some people learn pop shuvits first but for me those I found easy and learnt them without really trying much and I learn those after Kickflips). It is one of the smoothest tricks you can have if you master it, and it looks impressive and gets other skateboarders stoacked when they see a nice Kickflip off a big wall, roof or down a set of stairs. Skateboarding relaxes me and relieves stress from almost everything in Life, but when I have a bad Kickflip day that can actually stress me out more and the only cure is to do all the other tricks you can do and forget about Kickflips, if your having a bad Kickflip day chances are your not going to land a decent one and hurt yourself in the process, at least it's that way with me. So go out and learn the Kickflip! Go now

Racing is a sport. I suppose driving 200 laps at competitive speed without hitting anything hard, is about the same as hitting 200 consecutive home runs, or sinking 200 consecutive 3 pointers. Best answer I can give them. How do you deal with ignorance, when they are proud of it?|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	i won't talk to them because to me they have there nose stuck so far up in the air they think they are better than others and unwilling to change..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I know how you feel<br>  Here is what you do...<br>  Realize you crossed over into a territory unknown by the person your talking to.<br>  Just respect the fact that they have a narrow view of intense sports.<br>  And just watch them talk, until they change the subject.<br>  It's not worth your time or breath to convince anybody that racing is exciting.<br>  Just don't get upset with the situation.<br>  ...we understand|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Tell them to take a trip to Charlotte, NC to see how much work it takes to make these cars go around in "circles". Most people have no idea how much work, setup, and prep is required to put on this sport.<br>  <br>  But let's remember everyone! Nascar is all for entertainment. To each his own. If they don't like it they are allowed to have an opinion.|`|QGevDlIkaa	say, okay how bout u get in a car, direct your pit crew on how to make it ride right while still being fast, and then see if you can drive 500 miles door to door bumper to bumper with out messing up where a single lapse in concentration can cost u a car, other's cars or even someone's life. yea @** its not just hoppin in your car and drivin in a circle.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	I just call them ignorant|`|x1fp1vESaa	omg i get that all the time I HATE IT!!!!!!<br>  i just say it is not like that when they are going like 200 mph, bumper to bumper and like 3 or 4 wide and hey there might even be wrecks. <br>  a also say i dont give a crap it is much more than that. but trust me i am soo with you with ppl telling me about "all it is, is cars turning left and going in circles for like 4 hours so just stand up for yourself and say that nascar is a great sport!|`|GCOrku95aa	What's so great about watching any sport? If you enjoy watching it, by all means, watch what interests you. What's so great about grown men running into each other for a ball? What's so great about watching grown men try to hit a ball and catch it? What's so great about grown men kicking a ball? So what's the problem with grown men driving a car around in circles? I enjoy what I like, you enjoy what you like, get over it.<br>  <br>  By the way, I enjoy football and baseball, myself.|`|CxoytUYhaa	Well usually I would say you try to do it at 200+ mph within a few inches of each other.  Or you could say its just fun to watch. I mean why do people watch football, baseball, basketball, etc.? Mostly because they are fun to watch.  Also, if they say these guys aren't athletes just say they are wrestling a 3400 lb+ monster for 3 hours and they have to have extremely fast reflexes and instincts.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Ignorance is aplenty in this world.  I just look away and move on. Occasionally if I'm in the mood, I will try to explain the legitimacy of the sport.  You're not going to change their minds so why bother.  No argument will make me love soccer.  I guess the difference is I don't make fun of soccer lovers.  Nascar is just an easy target because of its southern heritage and roots and fanbase.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	I get that all the time from my cousin who likes nothing but wrestling.He almost made me miss the new hamshire chase race.Btw,my B-day is tomorrow!!!!|`|MWSv1yfhaa	Usually I don't try too hard with people like that.  They have their minds made up and nothing you say will change that.|`|SzuSqKR0aa	I HATE THAT! I usually say something like well you obviously dont know understand theres WAY more to it than that" or " try going 200mph and cars all around you about 6 inches away!" "or you try it and let me know how it goes" funny you should ask that, I went to see the comedian Josh Blue this past weekend, and he asked "is there any NASCAR fans here tonight" and there were some cheers then he said" then get the hell out" I thought what a damn jerk  that made me mad the rest of the night! im so sick of people thinking all NASCAR fans are dumb rednecks because I know im not!

HWYzREAIaa	you could try to fit them both in by seeing what time you perform and what time you race. but your cheer team is counting on you. without one person it can mess up a whole routine. in group stunts, that would leave three other people who have nothing to do because you aren't there. and yes, cheerleading is a sport (to everyone else who opposes!)<br>  <br>  as important as track is too (i did track and cheerleading at the same time in high school as well) you'd be letting down your whole team if you skipped the competition. in track, it's not as big of a deal, you're more letting down yourself, not 30 other people. if it were my decision, i would compete in the competition. but ultimately it is up to you. <br>  if you still can't decide, ask both of your coaches what they think. your cheer coach may say to go to the track meet, and change the routine last minute. or your track coach may say hey its just a track meet we have a lot more to come. hope this helps and good luck sweetie :]|`|23qMl5LXaa	I would find out what time you go on in cheerleading and what time you race in track and try to fit both in. However, if push comes to shove, it really depends on how big the competitions are. If the track meet is a huge big deal one, then track, but if cheer is like the one that could get you into the one to get you to regionals, then cheer. I think I would choose cheer anyways though.|`|qT8yID3Taa	yes, cheer is a sport. go to the competition, the whole routine would be messed up without a person. go to the cheerleading competition!|`|ULitp0PWaa	You should cheer. Your whole routine would be messed up without one person & not to mention, you coach would kill you. Your track coach could kill you too, but everyone else can run without you, its almost impossible to do a whole cheer routine with just 1 person missing.<br>  <br>  ?|`|1JsWMX0daa	why cant you go to both. leave practice early. go to practice late.|`|n9HAc3H2aa	Cheer isn't a sport... go run track|`|DSseZwPLaa	cheerleading is a sport i did cheerleading for 5 years and i would rather go to the cheerleading competition its funnier to|`|BgSxa8LXaa	cheerleading...your team depends on you to be there and if they have to rely on someone else in a stunt it may not hit...track is fun, but it is not a "team" sport, so i would go with cheerleading|`|M4Xuek3Naa	Track is cool and cheerleading isn't a sport.

Our designated "shooter" hasn't been able to shoot now for the whole year. It's time to teach him other aspects of ball or get crawford lol.
0kdZ0VcZaa	ummm sometimes he pisses the hell outta me.. but he can do good for the lakers...obviously he isnt the same "machine" we saw last year but hes still a good shooter.<br>  not the greatest but hes decent<br>  <br>  <br>  btw yup he doesnt make smart plays|`|adM9rI7Faa	ok 1st of all 356 is pretty good and u have like 20 spellin errors, and if yall up by 115 i think its ok to shoot 3's but not wen its a tight game|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Hey i didnt read your dicreption BUT  if you dont watch all their games you cant say that he has saved us a lot with 3 pointers.|`|58wJWgILaa	Statistically speaking, you have a good point for argument.<br>  <br>  However Sasha'ss effectiveness does not depend on stats. As a player yes he makes mistakes. But who doesn't?<br>  <br>  His defense is not really tight like Kobe's but he has an undying killer mentality that sees the possessionn to the end that makes him seem like a better defender than he actually is.<br>  <br>  Regarding his shots, he may no throw the preetiest three pointer but you are assured that the shot CAN go in.<br>  <br>  He is still young and his room to improve is huge.<br>  <br>  His vitality to the Lakers is not questioned.|`|3teWTOPqaa	He is a streaky shooter and he has struggled this season.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	He's a streak shooter and as long as he keeps the turn overs down I am ok with his numbers. He doesn't play that many minutes anyway.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	He steps up and help us. That's why he is on the bench|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Bro, stats aren't everything. If you actually watch him play you will notice that 90% of the shots he takes are 3's.<br>  <br>  So, 356% from 3 is pretty good considering how many he actually takes.|`|vJyF8siJaa	I noticed, that I know Sasha been struggling but during last years playoffs and early this season Sasha has been on just now he's on a slump.|`|MTbgg5eyaa	If you are just looking at his stats, then you must be insane.<br>  Sasha is a good shooter.<br>  He is a streaky shooter.<br>  <br>  And you have to appreciate his game because he's been developing it.<br>  He doesn't want to be dubbed as a "Shooter" only, that's why this season, he tries to be an All-around player, so that he can help his team more.<br>  <br>  So what if he's shooting .356 from the 3? You don't measure a shooter just by that, you have to take into account his minutes played, what the intervals are between his playing minutes and his bench minutes, then you measure up a good sizeable PER.<br>  <br>  Sasha doesn't play defense with his feet, neither Ariza.<br>  They go for the risk, they go for the help defense, they let you drive by and go for the steal.<br>  <br>  If you hate Sasha, then I suggest you stop watching Laker games.<br>  YOU JUST DONT KNOW BASKETBALL.
ulIZ38jVaa	luke over morrison. he can shoot the three also but most of all he know the offense very well and he fit's phil's style of play. he can post up, bring down the ball and he is also a very good passer. if you really watch the lakers you will know what his real worth is coz it's mostly the intangibles<br>  <br>  sasha over brown- brown is athletic and he can defend well but he doesn't know the system yet and he cant shoot the ball like sasha does. the lakers need 3 pointers coz they need to spread the floor, they don't need another slasher like brown.<br>  <br>  oh and i think they got both of those players coz their contracts are expiring and they need more money. The lakers didn't get them for depth really i mean they barely play.<br>  <br>  plus it might ruin the chemistry of the bench and the starters if you mix those 2 up coz they are fairly new to the lakers offense.<br>  <br>  like some say... don't fix it if it ain't broken : )<br>  <br>  * i think phil knows that ariza is better that's why he's on the bench coz he wants someone who can come in and be a spark while luke can be more at ease at the starting line up coz he'd be with all the better players. unlike if he came from the bench then he'd have to do more coz he would have to contribute more and since he's not that kind of player he may not be efficient. anyway your right about sasha he doest throw up silly shots but hey phil knows best right so lets just let them play and hope for the best. Lakers in 09!|`|1gHVlfbNaa	Yes Morrison has a lot of potential but he's been havin an awful season, not a good way of realizing that potential. <br>  <br>  Phil likes to play Luke since he's perfect for the triangle. A great passer who could (occassionally) hit open shots and drive to the basket.<br>  <br>  Sasha was not was he used to be - a ferocious defender, maybe Brown needs to get more minutes.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	luke walton.<br>  Sasha:Brown is a defender but sasha is a scorer.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Walton - Bigger, Stronger.<br>  Brown - ATheletic

tvuhGTD9aa	Lincecum doesn't yet have enough major league service time to gain arbitration rights (and he's even further away from free agency), so his negotiation leverage is quite limited. His $650k for 2009 represents more than a 60% raise over his 2008 salary.<br>  <br>  It's very strange. Many fans complain that players are overpaid, yet they seem to expect that Lincecum should be paid more.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	There was already a question about this, and I've already answered it in complete detail, so if you want the full details, look it up.<br>  <br>  To sum it up, its his 3rd year.  He has no choice.  The Giants don't have to give him anything more than the MLB minimum which is like 400 and he has no choice.  Next year he's eligible for arbitration, but this season he has to play for what they give him, with no other options.  So 650k is a nice raise considering they could tell him to play for 400k and he can only say ok.<br>  <br>  As for fair market value, he wont get that till after year 6, when he can sign elsewhere.  Again, I've explained that on another question.  It surprises me how little people really know about baseball.|`|gU08XLzPaa	He is not a concieted a**hole who is all about the money|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Welcome to the full understanding of baseball.

It is all part of the great game of baseball!|`|zczneZ7baa	hes not greedy|`|2wgEsVmsaa	I have never understood why a guy signing for a lot of money makes him an a**hole to people. If someone offered me a job at 3 times my pay now, I'd probably take it. I'd be the highest paid writing teacher ever. That make me conceited? How? Mr Lincecum might feel that he likes where he is playing. He might feel he needs a year or two more to make the big bucks. He might have been told that that's all he's going to get. Who knows? It does seem he should have been given more, but then, one of any number of factors might have prevented that. I doubt seriously that he said, "Oh, no! Not that much please! I want to earn less. Don't want people to dislike me!"|`|AA10441760	Giants didn't really have to pay him more than he was making, they gave him a small form of thanks with that raise.

I belive its not till his 6th year when he becomes an outright free agent.|`|LMan8aLqaa	I bet he is only making this much because the giants don't want to blow all there money on a pitcher who might of had a fluk year because they did that with Barry Zito and he's getting paid to lose everytime he pitches.|`|CkZrQVEGaa	lol yeah i think he shoulda been paid around 1-2m<br>  freaking jonathan papelbon(im a sox fan :)) is a closer and is being paid more(770k i think) than tim(i like tim too,SHORT PEOPLE PRIDE!)|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Because the Giants are cheap.

3teWTOPqaa	I guess the Improved Artest is having an off night.<br>  <br>  LeBron's track record with the Rockets isn't good, 3-6 vs Rockets in his career. With Battier and Yao, this team resembles the Bowen-Duncan due that shut LeBron down in the Finals, and now you add a Ron Artest, who in my opinion is the best defender for LeBron, Cavs are going to struggle.<br>  <br>  You should consider it a blessing LeBron is knocking his 3s down, Cavs will keep this game close or win it as long as LeBron knocks down his jumpers, and somebody better start fronting Yao, cuz he is owning it out there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Putting Wallace on Yao has got to be the dumbest decision Mike Brown made tonight, if he is going to do that make the double team faster, you can't expect a 6'8 Wallace to hold his own against the 7'6 Yao.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I agree, the Rockets could be ten or twelve points easy.|`|0n04tIJ6aa	Cavs offense right now ...to put it bluntly...skiddish.<br>  <br>  They are taking open looks and using fakes too early..then while the clock's runnin down...drive in toward Yao in order to try and trigger a foul. It's not working, need better ball movement. (Lebron's foul trouble isn't helping either) Someone needs to get into a rhythm, otherwise they are going to let their frustration get the better of them. <br>  <br>  They are currently playing imo like they did against Chicago(Loss) on Jan 15.<br>  <br>  I blame Marv.

bHr7nGAvaa	Well, I love the remington 700 series, you should be able to find a model for any application you plan on using the rifle for, though I have always been a sucker for the classic bdl and cdl.  This would be my first choice.<br>  <br>  Tikkas are also great guns, though they are a bit lighter than the remingtons, this is great if you want to shave a little weight off of your hunting load.  but if this is going to be a paper puncher and a mostly range gun, then it will take a slightly greater toll on your shoulder.<br>  <br>  Savages are amazing, sub moa right out of the box.  The accutrigger not only shoots amazing, it prevents the trigger from being accidently pressed if it is dropped while chambered.  Look into the 110 series.  They are also very cheap considering what you are getting.|`|vSuWyrFTaa	Reid, you can't go wrong with the Rugers, or the 308 round either.

The best part of the savage is the price, they are only about $500. I know it is a different caliber but the results should be very similar.<br>  <br>  The .308 is also a very good choice for all around hunting. I know how hard it is to pick a rifle, so good luck, I hope I helped.|`|bb00b983d4318ce15fdce73f19f1ef72aa	My favorite is my Remington LTR in 308, but that is a specialized version and cost upwards of $900.  If I were to buy another just for hunting and punching some paper, I would buy the savage.  They have different stock options as well as blued and stainless steel.  The acu-trigger is the best stock trigger I have ever had.  But the best part of the savage is the accuracy.  I currently own 3 different models and all 3 shoot well under MOA with factory ammo and half that with my handloads.  For the money, they cant be beat.

The ***** Leagues had some unheard of players that later played in the Majors... Henry Aaron, Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Satchel Paige are only a few.<br>  <br>  Robinson was the first black player to play for major league team (the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947). But please don't think for a minute that blacks weren't playing baseball before then! Teams like the Grays and Monarchs routinely beat major league teams... at "exhibition" games.

qgX9eFX9aa	I'm guessing that you are using the 05-06 Suns, right? <br>  <br>  Back then, the Suns weren't actually as deep as your roster suggests- in fact people were questioning their depth for a portion of that season (and have been ever since). <br>  <br>  Amare missed the entire season that year- played only 3 games, KT only played 50 games, same with Barbosa, and Thomas also joined midseason (had a nice playoff run with the Suns and hit some big threes) but he too only played 28 games with the Suns. They actually lacked depth up front for a while with the loss of Amare (which is why they signed Thomas that season).<br>  <br>  The comparison is interesting- the Suns, without Stoudemire, weren't all the bad defensively- they were ranked 18th in the league at defense while the current Blazers are 16th. The Suns were ranked 2nd offensively that year as well and that's exactly what the Blazers are ranked this year.<br>  <br>  The difference though, and this is huge in terms of their stylistic play on the court, is that the Suns moved up and down the court a ton- they LED the league in pace that year, which means they were the fastest team out there. The Blazers, though, are last in the league in pace- they are the slowest team in the league this year and average about 10 less possessions than the Suns did per game. So, the Suns gave up a lot more points (because of their pace) but they also scored a lot more. <br>  <br>  The Suns made and took way more threes than other teams- once again because of their pace- the Blazers are in the middle pack on this. The Suns were also dead last in terms of free throws taken- not a coincidence since they run so much- the Blazers are in the bottom third of the league, but they still get enough free throws- unlike the Suns.<br>  <br>  So, stylistically, the teams are different- one likes the half court, one likes to run (and the styles of the individual point guards- Blake and Nash reflect that)<br>  <br>  But, in your post, you seemed to hint more at the amount of assets each team has- the Suns didn't have the health or all those players until later in the season so they weren't all that deep in actuality at each position. <br>  <br>  In terms of stockpiling youth though- the players you listed on the Suns had an average age of 28 years old- so they didn't have the young talent the Blazers have outside of Diaw (who was very promising at the time) and Stoudemire (though he was injured the whole season). Thomas, Jackson, Nash were all over 30.<br>  <br>  The average age of the Blazers you listed is 23.5- a difference of nearly 4 years. That's huge in terms of trade value of those players, assets, and young talent. Keep in mind out of the guys you listed, the Blazers have no one over 30- their oldest players are Pryzibilla and Blake, the rest are 21-24 years old.<br>  <br>  Bottom line- most of the talent on the Blazers is young- all their big time players are young and they have an amazing core for the future- they will be able to get an older veteran or develop the team and see who they should keep and who to get rid of (its impossible to keep all of them given the contracts but you never know with the amount of money Paul Allen has...). The Suns though had one young gem in Stoudemire and Diaw was promising as well- but besides that, their core was not unbelievably young or anything, they were about average in terms of age, and their best player (Nash) was 31 compared to B-Roy being 24.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In that case ignore the stuff on styles of play- my points about the injuries the Suns faced that year which made it so they weren't nearly as deep a team as they appear on paper as well as the age differences between the two rosters still apply though.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	i agree they are to be the "suns" of the past. they will play hard all year and then get beat in the playoffs. sorry but its the truth. the problem is keeping all of them together for a while. and hope that the money issue and what "player is the best man" drama dont happen|`|7bx2XQlqaa	No, they will be better.  Brandon Roy is the truth...future hall of famer in my opinion.  Oden slows the game down.  They are more of a half court team than the Suns were.  They have better post game than the Suns with Aldrige.|`|ciQFlpuLaa	no, they're very different teams. the Phoenix Suns were an offensive team with an impressive backcourt. the Portland Trailblazers are a defensive team with an impressive frontcourt.|`|9iB1AiQlaa	Different roster and different coaching style. Not even close.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yeah. In the next few years they can probably wind up winning the Championships.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	maybe|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I don't think some of the answerers took the time to read the entire question.  Obviously, they play a different style of basketball.  But in terms of depth they do share a striking similarity.  Although, I think Portland is probably even more stacked than the Suns during their heyday.  At least potentially, assuming Oden and Bayless live up to their billing.  Honestly this team scares the hell out of me.  If Oden can avoid the injury bug they should be a threat in the West for many years to come.  They have a great mix of players at every single position.  Their greatest concern is finding enough minutes to keep them all happy.<br>  <br>  The W's have some nice depth as well.  It's just too bad it's all concentrated at the SG/SF positions.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Portland is sure to be title contenders for the years to come, if you look at their roster full of young very good players and their core roy, aldrige and oden are future stars. Portland is a team of the future and right now they are doing great being 4th seed in the western conference. This shows you what potential they have.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They have a great team and in future they will be a frachine team,they have their own young trio:Roy,Oden and Aldrige.It's time when you see this guys in great actions.They have a lot of potentional but they need expirience and when they have it they will be a great thing.|`|BiMkowVMaa	No. The Blazers actually play defense.|`|Zc7H10w3aa	The Blazers offense isn't as good as the Suns, but their defense is way better.|`|VHphDgrhaa	Ha Ha Ha yea right no one on that team even compares to my favorite player shawn marion!
BiMkowVMaa	I really like all sports as well, but some I prefer on certain levels.<br>  <br>  Baseball: Love going to games, can't watch it for the life of me on TV.<br>  Hockey: Same as Baseball.<br>  Football: Reverse of baseball and hockey.<br>  <br>  I like basketball because of the creativity of the players, last second shots, when players get hot and can hit any shot at any angle no matter the defense or the pressure. I like the grace and the power. The upsets, the underdogs, and the dynasties. The speed of the game. I like that it's a team game. I like the athleticism and the unpredictable outcomes. I was raised on basketball. I've been watching basketball and  the NBA since 1977. I like watching the players grow from high school phenoms to college stars and then to the pros. It was all around me as a kid growing up. I just have a deep history of it. It's probably the same for you and your favorite sport. <br>  <br>  I just think its how you perceive the sport. You may never take to basketball like I'll never take to baseball, hockey or football. But I still respect the athletes and the history behind each athletic genre.<br>  <br>  Much like you I would like to try and get into other sports more often, but i just can't either.|`|io3hggzZaa	i would have to say because of the passion. those three sports that you listed are bigger professionally where the plays have already made it to where their career will end and they will care more about money than winning. watching college basketball (im presuming that you don't watch it) the players have passion to win as do th fans and just by watching it, you can feel the passion and the games make you want to sit on the edge of your seat. that's just me though.|`|VHphDgrhaa	Just going out there having fun supporting your team and having a fun night and maybe grabbing some food!<br>  <br>  Go wizards GO!     shawn marion rocks out loud.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	I've played it since I was like wat, 3?<br>  <br>  Its kinda like how a girl gets stuck on dancing<br>  <br>  Dancing is girly, fun, and awesome( not to me, my friend)<br>  <br>  But to me, basketball is fun, awesome, and i like hurting ppl! lol<br>  <br>  I like seeing ppl get hurt, and for some reason its just fun to watch!<br>  <br>  And yes, I do watch any team at any time, not just the Celtics&Suns&Tarheels!<br>  <br>  Go Red Wings! lol =D Im a Red Wings fan!<br>  <br>  lol well back to basketball...<br>  <br>  My family has been a sports family for like 4-6 generations<br>  <br>  And a Tarheel family<br>  <br>  And a basketball family<br>  <br>  now for other teams...<br>  <br>  Well lets just say:<br>  <br>  I like NY Giants my dad likes Patriots<br>  <br>  I like Celtics my dad likes Bobcats<br>  <br>  I like Red Wings and my dad likes Penguins<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yeppp....|`|vFbzBo4eaa	You see i never watched NBA games,i mean to go in arena and chear my team.But i'm secited because NBA is a place where amazing happens.I like to watch teams like Mavs,i like Nowitzki,because he's the best shooter in the nba with Allen and he's a plesure to watch.I like to watch Cavs-I want to watch them because of LeBron's creative,powerful,long range,stylistic dunks.I like to watc the Blazers-I want to see how Greg Oden how he does the work with his power dunks,defense,rebounds,blocks and etc.Bull-Because of the mix of size and quickness with great dunking abilites Derrick Rose,i like also to watch Heat,Michale Bealsey shooting and dunking abilties nad Wade's too.<br>  Other people like to watch other great nba players and at the mokment it realex you some match and you can see great players in action because like they say:<br>  NBA WHERE AMAZING HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!|`|0eMQDINbaa	No offense but baseball bores the hell out of me.<br>  <br>  I agree watching an entire basketball game in one sitting may be tiresome and may seem boring. But the final few minutes/possibly seconds in a basketball game in close games are considered to be the most intense among all sports. <br>  <br>  Some games are fast paced and exciting others not so much. Sometimes it all depends on the team that's playing. If you want to see boring basketball, I suggest you watch the all-star game. After watching the previous all-star game, regular games just seem much more entertaining all of the sudden.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	i guess it all depends on the person watching. if you already have it in your mind that you are not into it, you wont ever be. but just watching a player get a big time block on a shot that has to go in for the win its just crazy. Basketball is all about the energy and momentum. you support your team when they score a goal on a power play, its the same thing in basketball. you are the home team and your team is losing by two, you shoot a three and you get the win. its awesome.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	the dunks,crossovers,buzzer beaters,lay ups,teamworks,players,their greatness, records, champions|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	NBA where caring Happens.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Brewmeister for president!!!!!!!!  I agree.  I also have heard that out of a handgun, the 22 mag is the only handgun caliber that can penetrate a bullet proof vest.  It has to do with the small cross section of the bullet as well as the high velocity.  I would imagine the 17 would zip right through as well.  Those highly explosive bullets in the 17 would be plain nasty.  I might even take the 17 with explosive bullets over the fmj's in the 223.  Blasphemy, I know.  Just my 2 cents.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	For a "survival expert," you sure ask a lot of questions.  The .22 Magnum would be the better of the two, but it's still a desperation ploy.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I agree.

But, could a .17 kill someone?- absolutely.<br>  <br>  Forget about the "perfect shot" crap...It would do some serious damage to a person.-weather you hit them in the leg or shoulder, you will leave some massive damage.<br>  <br>  The speed, velocity and fps of a close-range shot with the .17 would be hella-destructive.<br>  <br>  I would bet anyone that nobody would step-up and willingly take a shot to the torso with one.<br>  <br>  Absolutely, there are better options, but if that is all you have, then make sure you hit some bone first.|`|ZWQyvmgUaa	I would use the .17 before I put it down to pick up something else so if it is the tool at hand use it.

WnQ3fhVhaa	I am a Panthers fan. I do not hate the Ducks. I hate , well dislike is a better word ( hate is reserved for people who have really done wrong by me ),some players on that team as well as the style of play at times. I have a very strong dislike for Pronger. He plays like a fool so much, it is annoying to watch . He has talent. He doesn't need to play like that . Also for the talent they have on that team, they tend to play a bit of goon hockey. It is so unnecessary. That is why I really do not care for the Ducks on the whole. I do like some of their players though .|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Telling from my name, I clearly do not hate the Anaheim Ducks.

At least, that's the reason I didn't like them at first. They were named after a lame Disney movie for Pete's sake. I kept waiting for them to hire Emilio Estevez as the Coach, lol.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, worse than that was that when Disney owned it, they didn't care about them. They were a marketing gimmick, they knew nothing of Hockey, they didn't hire any real hockey people to build the team, they flat-out did not take the organization or the sport seriously, it was a farce and an embarassment that they were in the League. That's why I hated the Ducks.<br>  <br>  Since ownership has changed hands I have to admit the organization has come a long way. <br>  <br>  A: Losing the "Mighty" in the team name and losing that stupid duck/mask thing from the movies = brilliant. Thank you for that. <br>  <br>  B: Showing that you care about hockey and that you deserve to have a team by bringing in good, proven, hockey operations personel and signing/drafing good talent and actually trying to build a legitimate hockey team? Another plus for them.<br>  <br>  For me though my hatred for the canards was too strong in the beginning and has become too ingrown now for me to be a fan despite changes for the better. But while I'm not a fan by any stretch of the imagination, at least they aren't the laughing stock of the NHL anymore, kudos to the new owners for that.<br>  <br>  Maybe one day I could actually cheer for them, you know, if they got rid of Pronger, Perry and Giguere.|`|pMIc1XXWaa	i hate the ducks because of the people who root, work, and play for the duck. no matter where i sit in the pond it seems like i'm surrounded by a group of idiots who don't know hockey at all. bryan hayward drives me nuts because he cries about things that aren't penalties instead of doing his job. and finally their players are lame, getzlaf is highly overrated, pronger is a dirty player, perry is a panzy who doesn't want to get physical(unless its throwing an elbow), and giguere is the most overrated goalie in the NHL.<br>  Does that answer your question?|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I have to admit...

Also, lunging will help, especially if you can add a weight vest or hold weights in your hands while you're doing them. <br>  <br>  Big things could be doing leg presses which will help you be explosive on your jumps, and squats are good for just about every aspect of hitting.<br>  <br>  I'd also work on your core muscles by doing planks and by laying down on your back and keeping your feet about 3 inches off of the ground with your legs straight.

Since I started it two years ago it has become a passion and a very healthy hobby. I saved money on gas + lost 25 pounds + gets me outside more. If you invest in a half decent bike it would be smart to find a good place to secure your bike while at work.

They aren't the first team I think of when I think "Talent". They have a few good players, and a lot of terrible or overrated ones. And they have a big problem in net. Budaj has proven again and again that he's not a legitimate NHL starter, and Raycroft? Come on.<br>  <br>  Add to that the fact that they got bit bad by the injury bug this year, and they're doing about as well as I figured they would.|`|ks1WIgSKaa	All that talent? um were? Stastny, Wolski, Hejduk, Sakic, and Smyth. <br>  Sakic been gone for most of the season, Stastny been missing for 2 months. That leaves them with the other three. The team dont have much depth at D and have the worst two goailes in the NHL. The sad thing is they will finish last in the West but wont get a top 5 pick damn all those shity Eastern teams.

5vXgcAbCaa	I can't wait until he gets fired. What has he done for WWE? He has left them for TNA once, he has blown a Wrestlmania storyline because of drugs, and he has been suspended because of drugs another time too. What has WWE done for him? They saved his career when he flunked in TNA. They gave him one of the biggest pushes we've seen in a long time when he got off of a drug suspension. Other people like him because.... I don't know why, there's really nothing good about him. WWE will be able to move on and give pushes to wrestlers who deserve it and haven't held WWE back for 10 years. He needs to go, he needed to go time WWE put him on the main event scene, he is a good tag team performer, nothing more.|`|8DIkez2uaa	You people that say Jeff has done nothing for the buiness, you are out of your mind. Jeff has given possibly the most too the business, money-wise and entertainment-wise. He has given us the most extreme matches and his entertained us for years with his dare-devil antics that I swear you and all the other Hardy haters don't have the balls to do. He is more entertaining than HHH, who got about 7 extra title reigns because of Steph, he deserves way more titles than Edge who hasa had so many pointless reigns, and has sacrificed his body more than anyone else with the exception of Foley, and a few other legends, but Jeff has managed to stay healthly and not get injured.<br>  <br>  Jeff is a great performer and his put on some of the greatest matches ever, and is probably the best leadder match performer ever. And I guarentee you, Jeff won't get a third violation and if he does, he'll be back in a couple months after his released. He's just too much money.<br>  And the reason people like him, is because he's just a cool guy and everyone can relate to him in one way or another. But judging by your avatar, you wouldn't know about being cool.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why do you hate him for taking pain killers, when over 90% of all the other wreslters are shooting roids like it's their job, they just never get caught. Steroids are just as illegal and just as bad for you as anything Jeff has ever done. you obviously just don't like him.|`|eGCWuY4raa	I wish that all of you Jeff Hardy haters would get a life.  How can you wish that someone would relapse and possibly lose his job.  Would you still be glad he was gone if he died of an overdose?  To wish that someone would get back on drugs is sick and twisted!  I personally hope that Jeff has finally conquered his demons.|`|a5X1sHHpaa	WWE likes him alot and after he got fired the first time...TNA offered a contract as he kindly accepted. His contract expired and WWE wants him back as long as he's clean. He accepts it and now has the biggest push ever in his career. He is bringing in the money for WWE so WWE keeps him.|`|qlpjDvoNaa	While I don't dislike Jeff Hardy and would agree he has done a lot for the company entertainment wise. If the WWE had talent like it did in the attitude era he'd still just be a mid card and I doubt he's brought in as much money as the Foley's, HHH, Rock, Hogan, Austin. These heavy weights these days are 2nd rate compared to those. But as far as the drugs, yeah they all take pain pills and roids but if the rules say don't do them then I think you've shouldn't be doing them and the punishment is deserving. All these guys need to be busted because if not they'll end up like Brian Pillman or Eddie Guerroro|`|TYpoaLXnaa	jeff hardy has given up his body for the wwe. it is amazing he can still walk. he deserves to wrestle. his past record is supposed to be history. he did pay the price. there is no doubt he only has 3 or 4 years left. he is a small man for a main event. yet has sacrificed his body. he will need many surgies after his very good career is over. when wwe was a mess after the tragedies jeff and the undertaker performed at full level well beyond capabilities. other people are les judged. jeff only harmed jeff. he was not jailed. why so much hate towards a man making a living. his body is shot to entertain. there are more serious criminals in sports. why all this hate to jeff.|`|WrJgHaqqaa	hey i like jeff hardy hes cool and so is his hair i love john cena the best though and i hate randy orton|`|4tvI9WYjaa	oh  shut up|`|4zQEvzCsaa	If he can prove that he still has what it takes to be a main event guy, then I belive that WWE should give him thre chance, otherwise it's a huge waste if talent. <br>  Out of curiosity, would people react the same way if it had been someone like Undertaker who had previous drug violations? Would you all still be calling for him getting fired? Think about the double standard you all have against Jeff.
nRBC4E5saa	1) There is no best martial art.<br>  <br>  2) There is no best martial art.  And you never fight a group of people, you survive and escape a group of people.  In fact, let me correct myself and say, "track and field".<br>  <br>  3) There is no best martial art.  However, certain training methods, like full-contact sparring, can shorten the amount of time it takes to become proficient at defending yourself.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Dude, tai chi all the way!|`|PFeynjyqaa	I would recommend MMA if you're only in it for the short run and aren't looking for a long term commitment...traditional martial arts are based on a person developing into their skill rather than just learning to fight. Which takes time....years even.<br>  And no matter which you choose, there is no magic way to fight, there is no substitute for strength and speed.  And against a group of people (more than two) you're going to have to be way bigger, way faster, and way stronger to have a chance.|`|EnwwqUGZaa	You need to be a bit more specific.  Do you mean 1 on 1 self defense, 1 on 1 tournament fighting, 1 on 1 in the dojo... oh, I could go on but let's stop there.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk pure self-defense, Steve H has the right idea.  Get a gun, take a class, and get a carry permit.  No martial art is as fast as a bullet.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk about practical practice, surviving while getting to your gun, or the times you can't use it... it depends on you.  Not every art is best for every person.   As another answer already said, there is no "best art" just best for you.<br>  <br>  Look at your strengths and weaknesses, what is available to you for training.  Most martial arts are not short term.  a Year is long enough to get a basic idea, not hard core skills.  Some things to keep in mind as you look include:<br>       - does this art focus on sport or self defense?<br>       - does it play to my strengths or my weak areas?<br>       - If i have only a year, do they require a long term contract?<br>       - can I try a few classes for free?<br>       - what are other students who have been there a year doing now?<br>  <br>  Aikido and Aiki-jujustu tend to do a lot of multiple attacker practice.  Aikijujutsu being the more self-defense oriented.  TKD and Kick boxing tend to focus on 1 on 1 more and sport more than self defense.  There are a host of others in between.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	1.  a hand gun<br>  <br>  2.  a hand grenade<br>  <br>  3   ti chee|`|WAT6QksFaa	Ditto Callsign.<br>  <br>  He said it all.<br>  <br>  Mc-28 yrs MA

Hardly anyone wants anything to do with Shamrock after the Kimbo debacle, and Royce hasn't fought since he was popped for roids.  Both are in their 40's, and neither has been a draw for years.  Add to that the fact that they fight in different weight classes, and the best you can hope for is maybe a show in Japan one day.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	hopefully never. Why would any one want to watch that? The last time they fought Shamrock laid on Royce for like twenty minutes. Did you see the guy Shamrock just beat. That guy was fat fat fat and had no idea what to do on the ground when on bottom. Royce lost very very badly to Matt Hughes. There is no reason in the world to watch this...at all.

They're 5th and they don't have Cesc Fabregas, the team's best player.  Real Madrid has closed the gap from Barcelona and they now have a chance to win La Liga, and they haven't lost a La Liga game since El Classico, where they only lost to the world's best team (Barcelona).  Real Madrid is hardly struggling, Arsenal is.|`|KmMRHKTNaa	I hate to with Real Madrid.

WUc9TbHCaa	I think you should assume that both your times and your GPA are inadequate for getting a full scholarship. This will push you to perform better.

4j7rodV2aa	You'd rather have it be a little tighter than looser. I wear a medium an it's a little snug, but I don't think it would be as beneficial with the magnets being farther away from your skin. Plus with spring/summer/ and prime golf season coming, you'll probably drop a little winter weight and it'll fit perfectly!
UoT86gbiaa	Traditionally, you lay your team out so that everyone can read it by position.  So - with an effort toward adjusting for the moves you've detailed so far - it looks like this:<br>  <br>  C Mauer                      <br>  1B Teixeira                  <br>  2B Phillips                   <br>  3B Huff                       <br>  SS Greene                   <br>  OF Dye                        <br>  OF Hunter                    <br>  OF Burrell                    <br>  U Konerko<br>  B Dukes<br>  B Lowrie<br>  B Stewart<br>  <br>  SP Scherzer<br>  SP Danks<br>  RP Broxton<br>  RP Soria<br>  P Wheeler<br>  P Saunders<br>  P Jurrjens<br>  B Volstad<br>  <br>  Your OF is pretty deep, but you are banking on Torii getting his share of steals.  Greene is the SS for St Louis and has a fair glove, but is craptacular in fantasy.  I'm far from convinced that Lowrie is going to solve that problem, but what the hey.<br>  <br>  Your SPs are extremely weak.  Jurrjens is probably the surest thing on that roster, and that's saying a lot -- it's saying that you really need SPs badly.  In fact, your RPs aren't great, either.  Broxton and Soria are very good, but you really want at least three closers, and you only have two.<br>  <br>  I'd trade Teixeira as soon as I could get some decent value for him.  Somebody in your league may have come away with two shortstops, so see if you can get a SS who can run and a reliable SP in exchange for Tex.  Konerko is a decent fill-in at 1B, and Dukes is a very good player to have in that U spot, so you have the hitting depth to make the move.<br>  <br>  Keep a close eye out for guys who may inherit closing duties (Wheeler is, I believe, third in line on his team behind Percival and JP Howell, but I could be mistaken).  Jon Rauch and Kevin Gregg are a couple of popular candidates in that vein.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Unfortually, you may be stuck w/ greene. He has some power, but his batting average sucks. If the computer picked him for you, he most likely the best one left.  If Jed Lowie, Boston Red Sox is left in the free agent pool, you might want to pick him up. he might be a good back up at SS and 3rd<br>  <br>    John Danks is pretty good,,, He is NOT<< NOT a closer. He is a starting Pitcher|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	khalil green plays for the A's i believe but now 100%... he is average entering his prime i believe he has a decent upside so i would keep him... <br>  john danks is the closer for the white sox i believe and they are going to have trouble getting him saves this year since the twins are looking amazing!!! jk but he was shaky/inconsistant and i would drop him if i were you<br>  ian stewart, max scherzer, jonothan broxton, jair jurrjens, i have all never heard of either so i would look at their stats but ya im pretty sure you could drop them all and pick someone else up...|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Greene is your SS.  I would dump Maine if it were me.|`|Uh0EGOu4aa	I would say that you have three guys who shouldn't be on any team right now, if this is a 12 team mixed league, 21-23 rounds.  <br>  <br>  Khail Greene is not going to become good now that he is free from San Diego.  He will put up the same power numbers and will bat eighth or ninth in the lineup.  The only thing good about him is his guaranteed 20 homers, if u really want a 250 avg and no steals, runs and rbis<br>  <br>  Clay Buchholz doesn't even have a shot at cracking this rotation, and i wouldn't even hold him for later this season.  regardless of whether u like him or not, there is a good chance he will be traded, after his dreadful numbers last year.  He still has good upside though, just not yet.  <br>  <br>  Joe Saunders is going to suck this year.  The wins were pretty last year but i would cut them down to 10, not to mention raise his era to about 4.2.  That along with the decreasing quality of the angels(lost teixeira and krod)  and his terrible strikeouts, and i would rather have a pelfrey who would get more wins with the same stats.  <br>  <br>  finally, jed lowrie is not the next nomar or anywhere near as good as he was at the time.  he will never hit double digits homeruns, and besides maybe a 300 avg and 80 runs, he is going to do nothing.  he doesn't even run.  skip schumaker would be better, and he isn't that good either.|`|mCTmari9aa	Tommy A: Greene is the SS for the Cardinals and use to play for the Padres before traded for Mark Worrell. AND ONE MORE THING: John Danks is not the closer for the white sox that is Bobby Jenks man. Danks went 12-9 and is a starter. btw  how can you answer if you havent ever heard of Broxton who is the closer for the Dodgers, Jair Jurjens who led all rookies with the most wins (13) and is probably their "ACE" ala Chad Billingsley, Max Scherzer is one of the brightest young pitchers in the league and was an awesome RP and showed great promise as a starter, Ian Stewart is the 3rd baseman of the Rockies and will get a lot of playing time with Heltons injury and Atkins and those trade rumors.<br>  <br>  To answer the question though... Drop Maine cuz he is the weakest of all your pitchers or Cruz isnt a starter in the texas OF. Lowrie would be a good pick up and I would pick him up cuz having 2 SS is really important since there isnt many good ones othere.<br>  <br>  Sorry if i seemed to rip on you Tommy but I dont believe that people should answer just for the hell of it. <br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question and helped make it look a little more clearer.|`|c75bb3ee1a90cf621122a146bcba05e9aa	greene has been a big dissapointment but is now playing in st. louis and that could help him a little but if u have another ss id drop him.|`|l24YT86Waa	maine

SIKuOevVaa	1. Walter Payton: For speed, agility, toughness, and drive, none was ever better.<br>  <br>  2. Jim Brown: I'll admit that I put Payton ahead of him because Payton's the one I saw as it was happening.  But the film of Brown lives up to the legend.  Ever see the film of 8 Cowboys, including Bob Lilly and Lee Roy Jordan, trying to take him down?<br>  <br>  3. Barry Sanders: Looked beyond human at times.  Probably the closest thing since to...<br>  <br>  4. Gale Sayers: If he'd played healthy even as many games as Brown, who knows.<br>  <br>  5. Emmitt Smith: It's not the records, it's the winning, and no running back did that better than he did.<br>  <br>  6. Marion Motley: Again, I'm going by old film, but a truly remarkable player.  Sports Illustrated's pro football guru, Paul "Dr. Z" Zimmerman -- admittedly a Browns fan growing up -- still thinks Motley was the best running back he's ever seen.  Motley was the model for fullbacks like Brown, Jerome Bettis and the other "buses" we see now.  And the model for him was...<br>  <br>  7. Bronko Nagurski.  Today, he would still be great, but not remarkable size-wise.  Back in the 1930s, he was a monster.  And to think he was, for a few years, in the same backfield as...<br>  <br>  8. Red Grange.  In both the offensive and defensive backfield, helped bring football out of the caveman age.  If Nagurski was the model for Motley/Brown/Bettis, Grange was the model for Sayers/Payton/Sanders.<br>  <br>  9. Jerome Bettis.  I grew up watching Franco Harris on many an NBC Sunday afternoon, but this is the greatest Steeler runner of them all.<br>  <br>  10. Curtis Martin: When I think about what he did behind a Jets line, I'm amazed.<br>  <br>  Honorable mention to Franco, John Riggins, Earl Campbell, Frank Gifford, Billy Sims (headed for Canton 'til he wrecked his knee in his 5th season and never played again), and the old Packer duo of Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor.|`|6AvvxvAqaa	no order:<br>  barry sanders<br>  emmitt smith<br>  walter payton<br>  jim brown<br>  earl campbell<br>  john riggins<br>  eric dickerson<br>  curtis martin<br>  ladainian tomlinson<br>  gale sayers<br>  terrell davis <br>  bo jackson|`|goe3y4FPaa	guys from the cowboys, 49ers, raiders, broncos,etc...|`|znccVpkeaa	payton hesterrrr!! everyone else on your list|`|PG1LuEk5aa	barry sanders<br>  <br>  paul hornung<br>  <br>  herschel walker<br>  <br>  tony dorsett<br>  <br>  curtis martin<br>  <br>  marshall faulk<br>  <br>  earl campbell<br>  <br>  erick dickerson<br>  <br>  walter payton<br>  <br>  jim brown<br>  <br>  <br>  I refuse to put emmit smith in any all time list because he is over rated....you put barry sanders behind that line in the early 90s he would have rushed for over 3500 yards a season...|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	1.

rv6zl5t3aa	As a Bruins fan, I've always loved the guy. I definitely don't want to play them in the playoffs. Kind of sucks for Clemmensen though. But the Devils are Marty's Team until the day he retires. Just like the Pats are Brady's team. We all know Cassel had an awesome season, but it's the same with Clemmensen.|`|sz808KV1aa	im also a bruins fan and im sorta nervous too (im used to that heartbreak in the playoffs in my 19 years of life). i respect marty but i hate the devils, just hate em<br>  <br>  i called at the beginning of the year bruins/devs in the east conf. finals, and im sticking to it<br>  <br>  right now, its gonna be close... really really close... like dangerously close|`|xxn73tw3aa	They should be really scared because the devils are now unstoppable!! Stanley Cup here we come!!! YAY :-)<br>  <br>  <3 Welcome back Marty<br>  <br>  The only unfair thing is that they sent clemmer back to the minors :-(|`|WPCATkoYaa	he is so good at playing the puck. and hes got MAD golie skills!!|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Its hard to determine how scared the Eastern Conference will be with Brodeur back due to the fact that he missed about 4 months with torn biceps tendon. So if he stuggles, the East won't be cared. If he is effective, the East should be scared.|`|8etb6truaa	I am nervous because the Devils are already a powerful team without him but also it was against the Avs the last place team in the Western conference. I am looking forward to seeing them play the flyers. That game is gonna be intense.|`|N1bAgvg0aa	they should be scared. brodeur is a badass and the devils have been kicking *** without him. its gonna be a good finals, my detroit redwings and the devils|`|n9py5Dreaa	Very|`|Q4O0cpFoaa	the devils are not a one man team so i doubt people are scared more of brodeur than the whole team|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Guy is truly amazing but they beat a last place team in Colorado(A team with a road record of 11-18-1)..That being said I think he can pitch a shutout in his sleep.|`|G33E41IBaa	They should be scared haha.  The Devils are 5th in the league, 3rd in the East with Scott Clemmensen, the backup's backup in net for nearly 50 games this season.  Now, imagine how much the Devils can improve with our best player back in net!  The Avs aren't an amazing team, but to post a shutout right after a major injury is still a huge accomplishment.
hMkb7H31aa	The blibla is not only a future great - he is a present great, as well.  Hitting 4 home runs in one day is only the start of his brilliant career with the Indians.  By the time the season starts in April, the blibla will be up to about 14 home runs a day.<br>  <br>  The blibla rules!|`|faIU064Saa	I can only answer this question in the way that Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers does. Has blibla put in the time and effort in order to become great and are circumstances in his favor? He is only as good as he is allowed to make himself whether he puts up the barriers or society does. Does he practice? Does he have good teachers? How does he deal with adversity?<br>  <br>  In the end the answer is probably not... He may be destined to be good, or better than average.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	1. Who is "the blibla"?<br>  <br>  2.

QC2hvnggaa	You have to think that a lot of the women who sign up for derby (jammer not included) are on the larger side: tall, buff, heavy and angry as hell, which is probably why you are 2nd guessing yourself. <br>  <br>  But you also have to think about your own size and what DIFFERENT kinds of blocking and assisting techniques you can bring to the table with your smaller stature: Because you're shorter,  you have much more surface area to block.  Example? You can take these women down at the hip or thigh (both legal areas) when most women can't crouch down that far..it's not easy for them- which also means it won't be easy for them to hit you as well!   Also making assists with your jammer is easier for you because you can balance and redistribute your weight easier than taller, larger women can.<br>  <br>  Another benefit: Your skating form will be easy for you:  Taller women have to bend and crouch super low to get a good skate form.  Short, little girls merely need to squat a little to get a good form.  It is also widely known in derby that the lower you are, the better balance you can achieve, especially around the turns.<br>  <br>  I haven't even discussed the benefits of being a small jammer!  There is even more benefits for this position including sneaky, squirrely moves you can achieve to get past blockers, as well as hiding behind your larger blockers to sneak past the opposing pack!<br>  <br>  I hope this all makes sense...<br>  <br>  No one is indestructible...But half of being a good (and mean) derby player is all about your mind set.  BOTTOM LINE:  Think big, and you will play big - never think that you can't do it, because you can do anything you damn well please.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck,  have fun out there!!|`|Hj8HW5S5aa	definitely some of the best jammers are tiny scrappy girls. thats the beauty of derby-- it's perfect for every body type. we have a girl who is 100 pounds on our league and she's an awesome blocker. it's just about not being intimidated.|`|YXovN3iaaa	Totally. Can you skate fast? You could become an awesome jammer. Find a league near you and see if they have open practices, and then give it a try. But yes, derby's got a place for every kind of skater. Good luck!|`|kaue6fqzaa	Yes! There are many girls smaller than you that are derby girls. Mostly you need to have the want and desire to do it. Where do you live? There are teams all over the country you can look to join.|`|MbNNj4Mbaa	Most Definitely!  I'm exactly your size and have been playing derby for two years now.  I'm also one of the hardest hitters on my team.  I couldn't even skate when I started, if I can do it anyone can.

I compare David Carr to Byron Leftwich...  Minus the injuries...  Both started for teams for a few years. Had very few ups, and alot of downs... Then they both were released, and now both serve as a backup to star QB's. <br>  <br>  but no. He shouldn't sue the Texans.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	no y should he.

C4mzZwiWaa	look at ur basketball stats in high school junior high maybe and college.|`|VHphDgrhaa	if you are good in college then ask for a simulation of when you would be picked and if you like the spot hopefully you will get picked for a team!|`|PbNcLBbqaa	You have to enter the draft in some way, nobody really knows the process.  You don't get chosen to be in it.  If Blake Griffin decided "you know what, I wanna be a lawyer!" (which he won't) then he could decide never to enter the draft.  You can send a letter to the NBA and certain people would mail you back where you would most likely go in the draft.
8lsBBK62aa	I don't think so. Big Fella Thanks just wasn't quick enough to lay up with the pace and he didn't jump very well. The sharp 3 miles around Kempton probably didn't suit him.<br>  He should be a lot more comfortable going round Aintree in the Grand National but I don't think he has enough scope for the Aintree fences.<br>  Nacarat was very impressive, he reminds me a lot of Teeton Mill the way he jumps and gallops. He's got to be on the shortlist for next season's King George on the strength of Saturday's performance.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about Simon but I presume he's being prepared for Aintree.|`|6xiwiiIzaa	What happened to Dallas Belle ??|`|lOw5PD0Paa	In my opinion big fella thanks was given a naff ride. For a horse that is deemed a true stayer, he could have bin ridden closer to the pace without any worries. And the amount of ground that he made up from the final corner to the line was amazing so surely he had plaenty left and would have won by a mile under a better ride. Hope Simons goes for National, i've got a nice each way on him

We can sign D Hall and still get Haynesworth. But you may see a couple of releases. D hall is a definitely coming back, he grew up in Dc he doesn't want to go any where else. When we sign him I think you could see a player like a Shawn Springs who is overly paid for his age get released. Plus I like D hall he is a huge playmaker. If we bring in a player like haynes which I think we can, D hall will be able to make huge plays, Jason taylor who i would love see to get a second chance will make huge plays. Man, I am telling you Haynes will make our defense have multiple pro bowlers, were talking about D hall, jason taylor, laron landry, carlos rogers if he learns to catch, london flecther will have a even better season to finally get him to the pro bowl, haynes his self, my projected pick in the draft brain orakpo, and chris horton. I know your thinking what about the offense but our defense did not create enough turnovers either last year which brings up field position for the offense. We will probaly pick up two offensive linemen one being a former redskins Derick Dockery. I think if our second year rereceivers Thomas and Malc Kelly get healthy we will be a championship caliber team. I am telling you this is the year.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	bad news for me. as a Giants fan i was hoping that Danny Boy would screw up once again and sign haynesworth to a $100mil contract and take a huge hit in the salary cap. oh well, we will have thr correct answer in a few hours. lets see what happens.<br>  <br>  TJ to the GIANTS!|`|mUG8XtNpaa	The Redskins have landed Haynesworth.
FZRWMc3Baa	It was a decent trade for both teams.  Cap hits are close to being a wash.  The Ducks have 5 defensemen becoming UFAs after this season and the Pens have three other guys who can do what Whitney does (Gonchar, Letang and Goligoski).  Kunitz is immediately at least the second best left winger on the Pens.  Plus the word on the prospect is encouraging.  He was rated the second best player in the Duck's system.  Whitney has struggled but I think he'll find his footing with a change of scenery.  If not this year, then certainly in the next year or two.  Again, I think this works for both teams, even if Kunitz isn't the ultimate answer to Sid's need for a scoring winger.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I think it was a poor trade. I understand the problems they are having with scoring (complete reliance on Crosby and Malkin), but I fail to see how adding the inability to move the puck whenever Gonchar is on the bench, is going to help improve their game...<br>  <br>  Kunitz is a good addition, but unless they are planning to sign a defenseman who can move the puck before the deadline, it won't make a difference...<br>  <br>  The lack of ability to properly move the puck due to Gonchars absence is what got them into a scoring rut to begin with...|`|ks1WIgSKaa	Even trade the prospect the Ducks through in was there best forward prospect. Pronger and or Niedermayer is most defetaly going to be traded by Wendesday.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Poor trade by the Ducks..hellllloooo McFly we need offense!<br>  <br>  I'll miss ya Kuni.  Say hi to Petr for me.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Well, I'm a Pens fan, so I was a little shocked when my dad told me we traded him.  At first, I though he was kidding, but he wasn't.  I though it was a somewhat good move-bad move deal. The good thing is that we got a winger to back up Crosby, the bad thing was getting rid of Whitney.  Why?  Somethings I just don't understand.

I mean take Cavs fans for example.  How many of them did you see anywhere before LeBron?  I never once saw a Cavs fan ANYWHERE.  When it comes to online places like here, you never saw anyone admit they were a Cavs fan.  And now that they're doing well all of a sudden they're all over.  Hey, I don't like the Lakers, but at least you saw their fans when they weren't good.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	I agree. There's nothing wrong with being a fan of GOOD SPORTS. I am a chicago fan and i pay attention to what's going on with all our teams, however, most of them have been so bad lately that usually I would rather watch a Lakers game, or a Cav's, game, etc. I don't think that makes me a bandwagon fan, i just like watching good basketball. If my team sucks then i'm not going to devote as much time, and energy to that team as i would if they were really good. I don't think that makes me a fair weather, or bandwagon fan. It makes me not an idiot.

XLXncQu9aa	I think their future depends on what they can do to shore up that offense.  The thing that amazes me is, that as good of a coach as Lovie Smith is, he still hasn't solved the offensive issues.  He was in the super bowl a couple of seasons ago, so he is no fluke of a coach.  The problem with him is that he doesn't seem to care about fixing that poor offense.  They are in desperate need of an offensive line, WR's and a QB.  I think the QB is the first problem they need to address.  Right now is the time to go fishing in the free agency.  They need to look at getting Jeff Garcia before another team like the Vikings snatches him up.  Also they may have a slim chance at Kurt Warner if the Cards don't sign him which they will.  Secondly, they need to take advantage of the weapons that the Bucs, Colts, and the Bengals let go.  T.J. could be a prime receiver for that offense.  Also Marvin Harrison.  The Bears defense has always been solid, so that isn't the issue.  The issue is fixing their horrible offense.  If the Bears don't do that, then expect them to go back to their losing ways, and Smith will be fired.  It depends on what they do in the draft and free agency.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	They better focus on Pass Defense and Running games because if they don't, I don't see them in the playoff next year|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, how often do you hear about the Bears spending big money to bring in big time players to improve their team?<br>  Not very often.<br>  They rely on the draft and what budget players they can get from free agency, but that's about it.<br>  You don't ever hear about them shelling out big money for the proven big name players.<br>  Until they are willing to do that, they will be very average for a long time.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Unless Jerry Angelo is fired, nothing good is gonna happen. I mean look, they are well over cap, and they never sign any big free agents.

hRq8gMuQaa	You want an airsoft that doesn't hurt. huh. I shoot 350fps and i don't think they hurt, but whatever. Uh, try 150 fps too 200fps. Like little cheesy airsoft guns. But you'll get no range till you start shooting over 300fps. And i would use .12 gram bbs for guns shooting at that fps. Shoot .20 gram(the white ones) for over 250-275fps. and you'll start to like the range element of airsoft soon, so you'll start not minding the short sting.|`|MulZfdzQaa	Airsoft pistols really dont hurt that much.. just stings for a little but if you cant take it then you should dress in layers.

ujIinLzGaa	I would go with the Browning, especially if it has a B.O.S.S., which reduces recoil, and helps accuracy.  Unless you are hunting bear, elk, or moose, you can probably do just as well with a .270.  And people have killed even these animals with one, although, for them, I would recommend something heavier.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I'd go with the browning.  It's a more proven design, it's been around longer, parts are more easily found if ever needed.  On the other hand, I prefer the 30-06 hands down to the 270.  Too bad it's not a 30-06 browning.  Well that's my opinion, and it's worth exactly what you paid for it.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	Benelli does wonders for recoil reduction and are known for quality, I say go for the Benelli.|`|AA12211483	<a href="http://www.nokick.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nokick.com/default.asp</a><br>  <br>  Check it out, Man!!|`|Q3yGFnnnaa	Neither one, wait around for a Winchester model 100 to go up for sale.|`|Y96SnYL3aa	go with browning you cant go wrong with american ww2 weapons

So Raw ruined him and he hasn't been able to bounce back since do to injuries. However I still have high hopes for him and think he has the Charisma of the Rock and great wrestling skills to go along with it.<br>  <br>  And if you don't think Raw ruined him, think about how much more successful he was on SD, than Raw. US title reign, Mr. MitB, great fueds with Undertaker, Batista, and Lashley. And then on Raw: a blown push of a lifetime, and fueds with Super Crazy, William Regal, and then a few crap mini-fueds with HBK and Jeff.<br>  <br>  I hope he doesn't move back, because he still belongs on Smackdown on needs to work there and be successful before he can even think about Raw.<br>  <br>  And I don't think he likes changing brands, it's just how it had to be.|`|a5X1sHHpaa	Mr.Kennedy was injured 3 times in his career taking out about half his career down. He was also on roids before so WWE can't really trust him since he lied about drugs using to the wwe. He has gotten the push after winning money in the bank but after another injury...he was force to give it up to edge and set off to their plan B.<br>  <br>  So Kennedy is more like a wrestler based on annoying people with his mic announcing in every brand and start minor storylines for that year of which brand he's in.|`|hz2o9UmMaa	I think that is ok for mr kennedy because it gives him other chances for him to wrestle other people i think he might get drafted to raw again and possibly ecw maybe its a 30 out of 100 percent|`|qbEeecndaa	WWE determines the brand not Mr. Kennedy he just goes where he is told

rGGymoowaa	It was a combination of factors from the huge size of the USSR to the role the government played in promoting a sport  machine dedicated to to promoting the state for propaganda purposes. Also Russia and many of the former Soviet Socialist Republics such as Lithuania, Ukraine and Belarus to name just a few love sports as well. <br>  <br>   Consider even though communism has come to an end Russia was still #3 in the medal count with 72 medals (23 gold, 21 silver and 28 bronze) and Ukraine was 10th in the standings with 27 medals (7,5,15).  Belarus won 19 medals (4,5,10) and Kazakhstan 13 (2,4,7) and you get the picture of how many great athletes would have combined to make the Olympic Team for the USSR. <br>  <br>   You can get a better understanding of how this would work by examining basketball. When it was USSR many of best basketball players where from Lithuania not just Russia. This was the case when USSR beat USA in 1988 Olympics with a team made up of 5 players from what was then Soviet Socialist Republic of Lithuania. <br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/countries/country=LTU/olympictradition/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nbcolympics.com/countries/cou...</a><br>  <br>   Know that Lithuania is an independent country they have their own basketball team while Russia has to make do with Russian players and foreign players they nationalize as citizens. At Beijing Olympics Lithuania came in 4th and Russia failed to make the medal round.<br>  <br>   Another major factor as mentioned was USSR created a system of state supported athletes that didn't have to worry about jobs or earning a living as long as they where athletes. They received training, housing and many other benefits that allowed their athletes to remain amateurs and just concentrate on their sport. <br>  <br>   Many of USSR athletes where in military or police.<br>  <br>   It was because of USSR and other communist nations such as East Germany (GDR) that convinced the IOC to end pro athletic ban as state supported athlete made this a mockery.|`|mjX1Zhjjaa	Ask the French judges that take the bribes.|`|fCB7TTBCaa	It was gigantic.|`|F32uPjAraa	Um. Because they are very good at sports?|`|CLGGdTadaa	because for the longest time professional athletes weren't allowed in the Olympics so they would enlist people in the military; and instead of doing military stuff they would become really good at a certain sport. the USSR were really good at these loop holes.|`|n8dBGNYwaa	because their athletes were trained the communist way. they get enlisted in a sports conservatory and train for the most of their precious childhood. plus they are a big country with veri talented people. they can jus pick out some of their better athletes and then win medals easily.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	They don't anymore.  Once the wall came down in Germany and the USSR broke up, their dominance in the Olympics went kaput....ya.|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	Cause communism?|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	The USSR hockey team is a great example of why. These guys were all nhl-calibre guys who were enlisted in token jobs by the government and practiced/played hockey full-time. As such, they were getting paid to play hockey but weren't professional athletes and could still compete.<br>  <br>  As a result, they dominated for years, the only major setbacks being the 1972 Summit Series and the 1980 Olympics.|`|8TW00N9Daa	I think if you look at China last year you will see a lot of the same things that the USSR did back then.  They would take a very young child and train then in that specific sport.

They don't survey every hunter, but enough to get a fair estimate of game animals harvested.

For the Wildlife Management Areas they also adjust the number of quota hunt permits available for each WMA. <br>  I hope this helps with your project.
8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	I love this fight.  It's easy to make much of the size difference but, when you look at it,  there really isn't much difference between 6'3.5 and 6'5".  The weight is the biggest factor.  Lennox would not come in at 245 against Holmes because he knows he would need as much speed as possible.  However, he's at his best at around 241.  He's still the best of all the BIG Men.<br>  <br>  Holmes has fought big guys before,  Roy Williams and Leroy Jones,  but none of them are near Lewis' over all skill level.  Williams was picked to beat Holmes, who went in as "The opponent".  It was actually the Williams fight that made people take Larry seriously.<br>  <br>  Larry would have to rely on his speed.  However, here is the difference between Holmes and ALI.  Though I say ALI would win a decision,  I have always said that anyone ALI can beat, Holmes could beat easier.  That is simply because ALI is faster than ALL and Holmes is faster than the rest.  Joe Louis might be the one exception.  <br>  <br>  I have Holmes and Lewis ranked 3rd and 4th on my TOP 12 list.  If Lewis were a more aggressive boxer he might be able to use his power to knock out Holmes or score a knockdown or two and take a decision.  However, Lewis' greatest weakness is NOT his chin.  It's his unwillingness to take chances.  He looked like a world beater against Grant, Golota and Botha, all of whom were either scared or not skillful enough to stop Lennox from doing what he does best.  <br>  <br>  Lennox Lewis is one of the smartest boxers ever.  Sometimes his intelligence gets in the way.  Sometimes you have to just "Let go"  like Manny Stewart often tried to get him to do.  <br>  <br>  Larry is a very smart boxer too.  He has it all and knows how to use it.  Some can punch harder.  Some are faster.  NONE can do a little of EVERYTHING as well as Larry can.  Lennox is second only to Larry in this respect.  He can BOX,  FIGHT,  Mix it up.<br>  <br>  Lennox would have to throw straight punches and use his jab.  He could possibly off-set Larry but in a straight jabbing contest,  NO ONE is as effective as Holmes.  Louis, Lewis and Liston are harder and ALI is faster but NONE of them can blend the SPEED, POWER and ACCURACY as well as Holmes can.  <br>  <br>  Holmes would keep a distance.  He would score early with his jab before Lewis can get his working.  He would make Lewis come after him.  He wouldn't run but just keep out of range.  Lewis would lose the first 3 rounds and the 4th would be close.  <br>  <br>  Lewis could hurt Holmes but he tends to be cautious against certain types of fighters.  I could see him running through some of the guys Holmes has beaten but I don't think he would take the same risk against Holmes.  Larry would know this and pick up the pace in the middle rounds.  <br>  <br>  Lennox would split rounds 5 through 10.  He might even score a knockdown but I don't really see that happening.  Holmes doesn't LOOK good at it but he's a master at blocking punches, especially looping or cross punches.  <br>  <br>  Holmes would pace himself and take the fight into the latter rounds.  He's not using as much foot work as in the earlier rounds.  His straight right is landing with more accuracy.  Lewis hurts Holmes in round 9 with a straight right.  Holmes holds on and survives.  From that point, Holmes works the jab effectively. <br>  <br>  In round 12, Holmes hurts Lewis with a solid right to the side of the head.  Lewis ties him up but Holmes can now match him for strength.  Lewis is stronger but Holmes if fresher.  Lewis is getting tired and trying to pick his shots.  However, Holmes won't let him.  He's the busier of the two right now.<br>  <br>  Holmes opens up in round 13.  He's trying to put a very tired Lewis away but Lewis holds on and fires back.  His punches, however, have little effect.  He's pushing them and breathing very heavily.  The bell rings with Lewis' back to the ropes.<br>  <br>  In round 14 its more of the same until midway through the round.  Lewis lands a jab, with Holmes right in front of him, but misses the follow-up right.  Holmes lands a right flush on the face and Lewis backs to the ropes.  Holmes is landing at will.  Lewis blocks a few but he's in no shape to stop the assult.  The referee steps in.  Lewis protests but the ref has seen enough.<br>  <br>  Holmes by TKO in 14|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	holmes to good to strong and better jab|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	I gotta say holmes 6 rounds to 4 with 2 even. I don;t see any knock downs but I do see holmes jabbing a lot more and faster than lennox as the fight goes on.<br>  <br>  Lennox would more than likely try to conserve energy since he is the bigger stronger man, and when he is resting i see larry going strong at him.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	I'll take Lennox Lewis with the reach and size advantage.  <br>  <br>  Funny how they both lost back to back to unhearlded HW Oliver McCall.|`|dh48AkbCaa	holmes takes a decision over 12 rounds, or a late stoppage over 15.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	Lewis !|`|bO0moNVfaa	Mike Tyson.|`|kBScgrVMaa	A prime Lennox Lewis would KO a prime Larry Holmes. For the first three rounds, it would be a battle of the greatest heavyweight jabbers of the last 30 years, but as soon as Lewis starts landing his big overhand rights and awesome uppercuts, Holmes would be found wanting. <br>  <br>  I know Holmes was knocked down and got up to win fights, but that was against fringe contenders, (fighters that never made world honours) a prime Lewis would finish the job, just like when he KO'd Golota, that fight for me, was pure prime Lewis. <br>  <br>  The Lewis that got KO'd by McCall and Rahman was a fighter looking past his opponent and at a bigger prize, i.e Holyfield, Tyson and Bowe, who, all at one time and another froze Lewis out of the world title picture. The McCall and Rahman fights would never have happened had the aforementioned fighters stepped up when they were supposed to!<br>  <br>  Larry Holmes wouldn't be able to handle focused, in-form, in-prime Lewis' superior boxing brain, awesome defence, sheer strength on the inside, and ultimately Lennox' huge heavy hands! <br>  <br>  Lennox Lewis was at his very best when he was faced with a legitimite challenge, and a legitimite fear, Larry Holmes would've provided both, and for his troubles, "the eastern assassin" would have been stretched inside 8 rounds!!|`|AA12325046	Good question and both were outstanding champs.  They both fought Ray Mercer and Lewis almost lost to him and Larry handled Mercer rather easily even though well past his prime when they fought.  This is not what I'm basing this fight on but think that Larry is tougher and faster than Lewis.  Lewis definetly has the size advantage, but Larry isn't exactly small and handled bigger heavyweights along the way like Cooney for example.  Lewis has a good jab but Holmes has a ram rod great jab.  Both are about equal in the power department and I believe Holmes has the stamina advantage over Lewis.  This would be a close fight until about the 10th round and this is where Larry would start dominating the fight.  Lewis would land some good shots and Holmes would shake them off.  I think out of 15 rounds that Holmes would take 9 rounds, Lewis 5 and 1 would be even.  In a 12 round fight, Holmes would win 7 rounds, Lewis 4 rounds and 1 even.<br>  <br>  To Kungfuex.  I always answer honestly and don't always pick the Americans to win unless I do think they are better, so smoke that.  I base my answers on the skill levels of the fighters, their competition, their style etc.<br>  <br>  To Kungfuex well I guess we are now making this personal huh?  I will challenge you anyday on any subject and not just boxing.  Typical arrogance which ruins this site.|`|g4QFDU6paa	I could actually envision this being a boring fight between 2 superior tacticians.  But Lewis got KO'd during his "prime", while the only time Holmes got stopped was by Mike Tyson when he was 37 or 38, so I go with the Easton Assassin.|`|iS94TGdxaa	tough 1 -both great technical fighters- i say holmes by ud- i dont think lennox could get past that jab - holmes jab was vicious- best jab in boxing history! and becuz of that i give holmes the fight|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Speed kills, and Larry has a huge advantage in that, plus skill, chin and endurance.

dpSr0icwaa	no way to tell what is going to be in the new ban, but I expect it to be worse.  The old ban did incorporate some semiauto handguns  and some shotguns.   I expect the new ban to include a lot more semiautos, and I expect it to include all semiauto shotguns and all pump or even double barreled shotguns that have either a capacity greater than 3 shells or a barrel shorter than 24 inches long.<br>  <br>  Also, after the AWB was passed, Clinton actually put pressure on lawmakers to enhance it with a further restriction to limit magazine capacity to SIX rounds because 'if it is good enough for a revolver it should be good enough for all handguns, anything more is just for murdering!' and also Clinton wanted to further enhance it to eliminate small guns...because he and a lot of the antigunners didn't like that gun makers were simply making smaller guns to fit around the restricted 10 shot magazines.<br>  <br>  I expect the new AWB to choose a round count that is less than 10, maybe 8 or 7 or 6.

1JsWMX0daa	do a lot of squats and lunges. but start off easy they make you soar, especially lunges. run. not jogging or walking. running. stretch. jump around with ankle weights strapped on. and of course, practice your long jump as much as you can.<br>  <br>  oh yea- get on a step machine once in a while.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	jump rope? jumping jacks?...just jump a lot haha|`|oHIlRKl2aa	there are quite a few things you can do to improve your high jump.  The first and most important is to work on your approach.  That is the most important part of the event.  The better your approach the higher you can jump.  Most of your time should be spent practicing the approach.<br>  <br>  Also, weight training is very important. Squats, dead lifts, Olympic lifts (clean and jerk, snatches) are great lifts that help to develop maximal strength and explosiveness.<br>  <br>  Also, high jump drills will help too.  Below are 2 resources that I think will point you in the right direction.  One is an article on the high jump approach, and the other is a page with high jump drills.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/high-jump-approach.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/high-jump-drills.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.track-and-field-jumpers.com/h...</a>|`|KJMOvKcSaa	jump ropes probably. and just practice jumping over things around your neighborhood like bushes. hope this helps :D|`|jDi063pQaa	I have found what I think is the best free resource for jump training information.

AA10698309	Buddy - listen to all the advice given so far, it is all very good.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Martial arts isn't about fighting people who are talking smack, it is about self-discipline.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to fight, just let it go. You already showed them whose boss last year so you really shouldn't have to do them again. It isn't worth the trouble you can get into proving a point a second time. If they need two or three guys to take you then they are just plain pathetic and aren't really worth your time. Who cares if they say you are scared, if they then just call them out on how you won in a fight against them last year and how they need more than one person just for one guy.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to say ignore them and walk away though. This isn't elementary school and that technique doesn't work anymore, school is much more hostile nowadays. Let them talk their smack, talk some back at them if you have to, just don't throw the first swing...If they want to fight you bad enough, it may just happen whether you like it or not and your going to have to defend yourself right? Tell them you aren't fighting them just to show you can beat them yet AGAIN, and if they still want to go down that road then you will have no choice but to fight back. <br>  <br>  Plus you can't really get in trouble because it is self defence.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I have a tip. Grow up! Martial artists do not want to help you in a street fight and we definitely do not want you to even get in one. If you think being the bigger man by walking away is being a little bich then you need some serious help. I think you should sit down and have a talk with your parents|`|e3a4075c6850002f169185ad414d1a75aa	Do not fight!!  Dude, you're messing with some dangerous stuff here.  If you've already gotten into it with these clowns before and they still wanna fight, chances are they've got something "special" for you.  And by special i don't mean nice, i mean weapons.  Not to mention when u and a crew start fighting another crew, u're talking about gangs and the school will call the cops, u could be charged w/ lynching, on and on.  It sounds weak and all that, but just try to avoid it.  The more u fight, the better the chances the fights will get dirtier and more dangerous.  So keep yourself safe, and leave these guys alone.  And stop talking to them.  It just wont be good, so leave it alone.|`|OgTkxG7Vaa	You should be in jail. What is it like to be a violent, negative, despised force in society?|`|YDr8EO5Taa	CYBERBULLY|`|OGAYO4UDaa	Bullying at school is a very serious problem. I would tell your parents of the situation and tell them everything! Don't try to make yourself look like the victim if you have agitated the issue yourself, just be honest with your parents. Your parents will most likely contact some one at the school and the other kids parents to alleviate the situation. It sounds like you can defend yourself but avoidance is the best option.|`|qSKsEL1Oaa	looking for answers on the internet is not going to help you in any way what so ever. if you beat them before then just walk away. if they are talking ****.....be a man about it and don't let it get to you. self control daniel son, is the key to wisdom.|`|lJJsKvunaa	fighting puts a target on your back.

What sports make up each sport?<br>  I'm gonna go standard here and say baseball, football, basketball. hockey???? maybe?  <br>  Baseball - Boston Red Sox, a consistent winner with a huge following.

And most importantly they win more often then not.<br>  Basketball - San Antonio Spurs, the most consistent winning team for the last 10yrs.  4 titles.  no not the flashy lakers, or big 3 boston.  Spurs are always in contention, and they grow their own talent.<br>  Football - Pittsburgh Steelers, again consistent winners, never make huge free agent splashes.

VIhNt19taa	in my oppinion you should pop it.  I no it seems like a stupid idea, but chances are itll pop sometime during your tournament no matter how much you tape it up.<br>  <br>  If you pop it tonight, put some polysporin and a bandaid on it.  then tomorow morning, more polysporin a bandaid and wrap it with like duct tape or somthing.  Make sure that you can still grip the club properly though.|`|f3l0LrEvaa	DO NOT POP IT WHAT EVER YOU DO!! it will make it ten times worse. the liquids inside your blister protect your outside skin touching your inside skin. cover it with medical tape, or mole skin, or get extremely thick tape, and cut a hole in the middle.|`|D2UZHpp9aa	tape it up over a strong band-aid. Make sure to wear a glove over that hand. If it starts hurting, reduce grip pressure.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ajkMt6gRaa	Use medical tape and buy a right handed glove if it helps.|`|c6q3EERdaa	Use fingernail polish (or an equivalent) or athletic tape to cover the blister.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	GolfNut is correct, but here's a little more info:<br>  <br>  according to Golf Digest, the best idea is to lance the blister- one tiny poke w/ a needle and drain it.  The outer skin acts as a protective barrier.  Definitely put Neosporin or another antibiotic ointment on it.  Mole Skin is a good idea, as well.  Get some strong athletic tape and tape it up.  LOL- duct tape would hold up pretty well, but I don't know how it'd do with gripping the club.
fPU8Skifaa	Dropping that much time in a 50 is difficult, but it can be done. First, make sure you are fast off the blocks. Once you get off the blocks have a good streamline and do 3-5 dolphin kicks. When you break your streamline, do not breath the first stroke up! Also, do not breath more than three times each 25. When you get to the flags try not to breath going into or out of your turn. Right before your turn, make sure you have good momentum and can have a fast turn and a good push off the wall. Have a good streamline again and do not breath your first stroke off the wall. Go as fast as you can on the second 50 but keep good technique. Do not breath from the flags to the wall and make sure you hit the wall hard and not on the top of the touch pad. I know this seems like a lot to remember for a 50, but I did all of these things and went a 26.5 last weekend!|`|XmMDTqYpaa	YAY! I love the 50.  The most important things to do, get concentrated before your race.  You have to calm your nerves, and focus all of your adrenaline on the race.  Also, you have to work on your technique 100% of the time.  Since it is such a quick race, the way to get an edge on your competitors is to have perfect technique.  Then, if you have the same turnover rate as the other swimmers, you will be faster then them.  The third thing, do a lot of stretch cord dry land training.  One really good way to use stretch cords is to tie the cord, or band, in a circle.  then wrap the circle around a pole, and then put one foot in the circle.  Then, raise your foot off the ground, and lift it forward, and hold for 3 good seconds.  then release.  A really good way to train your fast twitch muscles is to use stretch bands, and hold a position for a couple seconds.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but holding a hard position with resitance really helps your sprinting.  Also, starts, turns, finish's, confidence boosters... Do everything you can do to get that extra .01 seconds.|`|DjQQosqjaa	You just really gotta work on turns, lengthening your stroke, not breathing in and out of turns and trying to take as little breaths as possible. I got down to 3 breaths for my 50 and 8 for my 100 and I dropped time immediately.<br>  Drop your head on flip turns too...<br>  24.21 50 Free<br>  52.91 100 Free|`|dMmeVi5zaa	Before your race you have to get in the zone and really concentrate on what you are doing. Picture yourself swimming fast enough to get down to a 27 flat. I think that is the most important thing you can do.|`|MtCHyA1Uaa	make sure your start + turn are really good and you get off the blocks fast. this could make/break you in short distance event|`|rXUa5Zv4aa	save nothing. fast dive, blast the underwater kick, kick like hell and pull strong and fast the whole thing. It takes a lot of practice to get going fast. <br>  I go 26.7 and this weekend im hoping to break 26 using this strategy. You just have to pull long and hard, but at a fast pace too.<br>  <br>   I think on average i get about 25 pulls off the wall each 25.|`|ovDqPtg8aa	KICK LIKE CRAZY, pull as hard as possible.<br>  make sure to do an awesome start, then blast the powerful kicks underwater.
1HwyDyD0aa	You'll end up with injuries, if they're really tight and you're doing a lot of sprinting.  In addition to the flexibility exercises, which will help  a lot, if done properly, massage will help tremendously.  Hopefully you can find a massage therapist, but if not, you can work on the muscles yourself.  Definitely will help.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	Having tight leg muscles is not good for sprinting, it hinders performances and can be highly susceptible to injury ... I suggest you see a physio or sports specialist who can give you some flexibility exercises to help improve your flexibility.
wXxJUnLJaa	Fundraisers can helpl you raise money.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Make sure you keep up with your studies. Your mind will work for you long after your body cannot keep up.<br>  <br>  The odds? There are 30 NBA teams, each with an active roster of 12 players. Let's expand that to 15 (injuries, etc.) to be generous. That means there are around 450 players in the NBA. In the US, there are 300 million people. That means you have 1 chance in 666,666 to make the NBA. Of course, there are players in the NBA from all over the world, so your odds are more like 450 players in 6 billion in the world: 1 chance in 13,333,333.<br>  <br>  So looks like you've got a better chance of winning a lottery or being struck by lightening than making it into the NBA.

ozVqauMXaa	I think he cultivated that look over a period of many years.  The old school mullet, and the beady mean eyes.  And don't forget the acne scars.  All this was done, purposefully, in order to scare the daylights out of hitters.  Ask John Kruk how it worked out.  Oh, and he could throw 100mph, and throw the nastiest slider ever.  But all that was secondary to the mullet.  God I miss that mullet.|`|gUMucKOkaa	I feel certain that he does not.<br>  <br>  But, he always was ugly. lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

39ixfEIraa	Shawn is a born again Christian. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian under the influence of his wife Rebecca.[1] His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. Hickenbottom is a Bible teacher in San Antonio.[1] He also appeared on a Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) program along with fellow professional wrestler Sting<br>  <br>  Does alot of charity events....<br>  he is my favorite wrestler even though i dont watch it anymore, but as i grew up (im 20) i thought he was a good role model...|`|DgwqNbWKaa	He's not supposed to be a role model if you don;t like him don't watch. Doesn't change the fact that he's the greatest of all time. People always forget that sports stars are not here to be role models, there here to be the best at what they do. Don't like it, watch something else. Or I got 2 words for you. I would just like to say that HBK was the greatest of all time but now he sucks, because he's too worried about being a role model.|`|k19i61q9aa	Why? He's a wrestler.

For the money, the pilot is ok, but a x7 with a e grip is hands down way better.|`|RuJYupFWaa	In my eyes, a Pilot ACS = Tippmann X7 w/ e-grip, with the only differences being looks & construction.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's ok as a beginner gun.  Spyder has been making some of their guns come stock with eyes (well, eye) and clamping feednecks, which are pretty crucial to any electro nowadays.  But for the price (if you can find one in stock under $80), it's a good buy for what it does have.

Log in and there will be a way to cancel. It's been a few weeks so you might have to click on account info or something but its there. I had a heck of a time doing it myself cause there is nothing on their website that lets you do it and when I called they said I couldn't cancel. When I emailed them they got back to me in 1 day and gave me that website. So use the website and if for some reason you can't find it email them and ask them about canceling. You shouldn't have any problem. (edit). I just looked at it and when you sign in there will be a slot on the right that says delete your account.

dQ99YWeoaa	Get which ever games you can afford cause Red Sox tickets are really pricy. If you can afford it, get tickets to a Red Sox-Yankees or Rays home game. <br>  <br>  Best places to sit=behind the dugout (majorly expensive, amazing view), up in the Green Monstah (also expensive), the bleachers aren't bad as long as you dont end up sitting behind a pole.|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	Best place to sit is in Yankee stadium and rooting for the team in Pinstripes. But if you must go to Fenway and be a Sox fan, buy a home game against the Rays they have some explosive offensive players and it should be a high scoring, fun game. Also the tickets will be more available then against the Yanks. Try to get seats above the green monster, there's usually great crowds up there and a nice view. But be prepared to be cramped, cause the seats at Fenway are SMALL.|`|qqrRoOJIaa	honestly at this point get whatever you can cause tickets aren't easy to come by. I usually sit on the 3rd base line right under the roof and those are great seats but a few summers ago i came across tickets for center field bleachers in the front row. It was amazing. You're close to the field and you can see it all. Also a great spot to take pictures, like most girls like to do at sporting events and im sure your girlfriend is no different, I know mine wasn't when we sat there.|`|GW2HHBw9aa	I would get tickets to the game on Monday April 20th vs the Orioles. It is Patriot's Day so the game starts at 11.05 AM which is the earliest start in MLB all season. The Boston Marathon goes right by Fenway that day and it is a festive atmosphere all day.<br>  As for where to sit, I would say that depends a lot on your budget. Try to sit in the Infield Grandstand if possible. The seats in the OF are usually angled poorly to the action so you will get a stiff neck.|`|CkZrQVEGaa	tamba bay rays(opening day 3 game series i think)<br>  yankees game(go sox)<br>  monster seats for sure!<br>  <br>  go on redsox.com to get the full schudule|`|d1cjF4Plaa	YANKEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YYqrT4jBaa	You're gun isn't broken. The rapid fire sounds means you're out of air. If it sounds like gas is leaking, the o-ring on your tank may need to be replaced or you may need to oil the internal o-rings.|`|xE6WXVIeaa	Air will leak down the barrel when the tank's just about empty. Try refilling the tank and hooking it up again. If air still leaks down the barrel the valve probably needs to be replaced due to damaged/ worn out valve seat. Like everyone else said, Tippmann's will fail to recock and "rapid fire" when the tank is running out of gas.|`|7w1c7vVCaa	not sure, the rapid fire could mean ur outa air but probably not, u should get it looked at

Rsr8nngWaa	Interval work is always best. Try doing a workout of 200, 400, 600, 800, 800, 400, all at about 75%, with an equal distance of jogging in-between.|`|tRxg17jqaa	Over Running always helps like if your training for a 800m then run the mile and so does underrunning run 400m extremely fast to get better at the 800m a good 400m makes for a good 800m and so does a good mile.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	I would say.<br>  do lifting two days a week and run three days.<br>  Run maybe a mile or two a day.<br>  then do some lifting in between days as sort of an easy day.<br>  but don't and get too much muscle, it can slow you down.|`|V3TQOp0aaa	Train (running wise) for the 400 and 800 because the workouts are almost the same but weight lift for the throwing.|`|j0IS59hDaa	lift weights while doing lunges?<br>  then run<br>  then do squats<br>  idk i just made this up<br>  it sounds pretty good to me though :]
fZMFAep9aa	power bar gells tase nasty but work also start running 2 miles a day and walk if you have to but every day take off half the times you walk so tomorrow run 2 miles and say you walk 8 times saturday walk 4 sunday walk 2 then by monday you should be in decent shape|`|x6uCeQ5Aaa	First of all do not drink a five hour energy drink before you run. These drinks will leave you exhausted as soon as the caffeine wears off and can cause you to have an upset stomach. Also the amount of caffeine can make you dehydrated. Here is the best you can do: tomorrow run two times, in the morning and after school. Then on Saturday go for a run in the morning (3 miles) and in the afternoon (2 miles). Sunday repeat the process. There is nothing that will magically make you get in shape but this will get your legs used to running. This is the best you can do with such short notice. Whatever you do, do not stop running when you legs hurt, just think about how bad you want the spot on the team. P.S. Coaches don't just look for good runners, they look for hardworkers with good character...Good luck at your tryouts!|`|2V87n4PKaa	just bringing sports drinks and 5 hour energy isnt going to help<br>  your gonna have to train<br>  everyday, or at least 5x a week go for a run.<br>  run as far as you can. when your legs feel like noodles, keep running.<br>  you have to build up your endurance.<br>  or you can just use a treadmill i guess.|`|N3F8eBbsaa	The 5 hour energy shots will not help you at all. They will make you nauseous and really slow. Trust me, i've tried it myself. Drink lots of water throughout the day, and everyday! Start drinking now, at least 3 whole bottles a day. But you really do need to train, you cannot just start running and expect to be successful. Especially 3 miles. Hope i helped :)|`|KJMOvKcSaa	probably 5 hour energy and water|`|qZYK0bHsaa	first start running, at least one mile per day, and bring it up.<br>  I'd probably bring the 5 hour energy drink|`|TThgDsV2aa	first off dude you better run every day until then. start with 3/4 mile and increase each day, drink anything with electrolytes (sodium and potassium) after you've been sweating and are feeling tired, there should be minimal sugar so you don't crash.  5-hour energy is just a lot of niacin, vitamin b3, which will make you burn your sugar faster and prevent you from burning your fat cells which provide a lot of energy. if you wanted something which would provide you legit energy, a multivitamin would work best, but in the end, you've gotta run before then or even if you make it, you'll be slower than everyone else.

imMsVkKhaa	I believe Julio would win. He has the age advantage and is naturally larger, and Gatti's been boxing more than slugging in recent bouts, which makes things easier for the young Chavez.<br>  <br>  However, I doubt this fight is actually going to happen. I read an interview recently where Julio really seemed to believe it was going to happen, but Gatti has stated several times that he's going to retire soon, and that'll very likely happen after his next bout on July 14, which is against Alfonzo Gomez and not Julio Jr.<br>  <br>  Junior seems pretty confident that he'll get a shot at De la Hoya eventually also, but I'm not so sure about that either. We'll see. ;-D<br>  Source(s):<br>  (Julio's fighting Grover Wiley on June 9 on the Cotto-Judah card; I'm going.)|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	Arturo Gatti can't fight anymore, I didn't even hear about this one happening.

Cl6KbcAGaa	This can be done but, what kind (make / model/ brand) of bike are we talking about here. It just may not be worth it depending on what kind of bike and then what shock have you found for this particular bike in question? Coil shocks are just as good as air shocks and fewer problems with them too. Let us know and I will edit my answer when you do.|`|YE87HP26aa	Yes, you should be able to find the right size at a bike shop.<br>  There is no reason you shouldn't be able to find one that works with your bike.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why you want to buy a whole new shock; springs work just fine.|`|8qZrlz07aa	In short, yes.  You will need to replace the shock obviously.  Your local bike shop will be able to help you with this.

4Uaiy4Ejaa	In NC can you purchase a rifle or shotgun with ANY state licence except Utah and Calfornia.  We can sell to any other state residence.  However in order for you to purchase a handgun in this state you must get a NC drivers licence/ID card and apply at the county sherifs office for a pistol purchase permit.  This costs five dollars for the background check as well as five for each permit.  You can get up to five at a time.  One permit one pistol.<br>  <br>  Your ohio drivers licence is just fine.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You should, by the Constitution.  To be safe, though, and minimize your aggravation, get that NC driver's license first.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I strongly suggest that you get an NC drivers license and auto tags ASAP.  State troopers get a bit tetchy about things like that.<br>  <br>  You will need an NC ID before you can purchase a firearm.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	You'll need some form of proof of residence.

If so, then by all means follow your dream. But you'll need to play as much as you can without breaking down physically. Work out all winter, especially on your hitting.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for the financial realities of minor league baseball. But even if you never make it to the Show, you might end up with a decent paying scout, coach or manager's job some day.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fawhiGtsaa	Yes.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Those baseball scouts have their ways.

tH6z3JKWaa	Without a doubt. I think Australia will certainly make at least 300, will probably get 350 or better and are a reasonable chance of 400 or better.<br>  Australia are the team most likely to win test, ditto the series. I think   many of the Indian supporters who contribute to this site are going to be very disappointed.|`|aIhVHfMUaa	The first hour today is the key for the whole day, if North & Haddin get thru that first hour, even if they only score around 20-30 runs, it stands us in good stead to score around 350-400, hopefully more, being a second day wicket, it should get better to bat on as the day wears on. North and Haddin get thru that first hour and McDonald & Johnson are both reasonable with the bat while Siddle can hold up an end for a while, it would stand us to make maybe 400+<br>  <br>  however, 1 or 2 quick wickets in the morning, and there could be serious trouble! we could end up bowling before lunch! so hopefully it doesnt happen<br>  <br>  but there is something i find strange about Clarkes comments tho, since when has Australia ever thought that scoring another 50 runs from there last 5 wickets ever been thought of as being 'hopeful' times are a changin i suppose, cos normally he'd be talking about at least 350, i just thought it was strange he said only 300|`|60uWyEKtaa	Oh Binga, where is your faith? I am hoping for at least 400, North playing nicely, Haddin has not fluffed a shot yet and we still have Mitch, Siddle and Hilfy plus McDonald. Plenty of batting down the order, as long as we do not lose quick wickets in the first session with the new ball.|`|hTruYNUQaa	After being 3/38 it was a good Aussie fight back to reach 250 by stumps.<br>  <br>  It would be good if North and Haddin could consolidate for the first hour, because a score of more than 400 is vital against this very good SA batting line up.|`|KyU7thGRaa	australia will do it<br>  HOWEVER i find it funny that one half are saying yes <br>  and the other half are saying no.<br>  US AUSSIES MUST OF KICKED SOME @SS IN THE PAST HAHA|`|rxRFQlLXaa	I will say, Micheal Clarke should be tested for drugs!!,,,,Stop dreaming Aussies !!!, and Wake up, these guys ain't going to win the series !!! Mark my word !!!!!!!!LOL|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Well they have five wickets left so i think they will get around 310|`|G0lO7djeaa	WHAT I THINK? I THINK AUSSI (KANGAROO) SERVILE,SERVITOR|`|G2Hkq8yraa	Micheal Clarke could keep saying all what he wants, even,100 or 150 runs, not going to matter,  The bottom line is, Aussies will lose, End result, case closed!!,|`|YULPhBBHaa	Should get at least 350|`|LzkujA3Faa	We need around 50 runs more to get to 300. With Haddin and North in good form, 300 is not an unreachable total. But the big question whether that would be enough.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	They should put on at least another 100 runs for the last 5 wickets to give themselves a good chance.|`|cklqarifaa	Yeah id like to think we can make another 50. Marcus North is in pretty good form following on from the practice match and Brad Haddin was batting really well at the end of the Aussie summer. I think a score of 350 or more is well and truly on the cards. Shame about Phil Hughes, that was a pretty crappy shot to get out to in your first game, but im sure he knows that more than anyone and will come out in the second dig and have a good innings.|`|mZ2Uluioaa	i think they can not win this series, i agree with OMG and smoothoperator too ~<br>  good Q~<br>  star~<br>  good bless~|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	I think they have a good chance.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	i think they have a good chance of doung it<br>  <br>  cheers~

The one person I believe shouldn't be in there because of character issues is Michael Irvin.  He was in trouble with the law bigtime during the 90's (and he's still having drug-related run-ins with law enforcement presently!).  Anyway, I believe that a candidate's character should be reviewed/considered as well before induction in to the HOF.

q0rJV5T2aa	Yes, captaincy is all about strategy and clarity of thought.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	But chess players are extremely eccentric, they are socially deprived and social misfits.Vishy Anand is an exception <br>  <br>  Chess might be a game for genius but most of them are eccentric<br>  <br>  Thats why I stopped playing chess.<br>  <br>  You have different kind of chess players, attacking type, defensive type,risk takers.Chess depends on analytical ability with some strategy and forward thinking also along with creativity<br>  <br>  but chess is deeper compared to cricket<br>  <br>  So yes, in some ways it helps them to be good chess players|`|i57vLejdaa	sure why not, they have to make decisions, they think ahead to plan, analyze situations,   anyone could be a good chess player. just need to practice.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	yes good observation...<br>  they have to make decisions, they think ahead to plan....<br>  <br>  so good captains like Jayawardene,...Ponting... are capable of doing it~|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I should think they would.

9vLzGwVqaa	Panthers|`|QSShHlRiaa	It depends whos in net...<br>  for panthers. it was not pretty against boston...<br>  ill say Craig Anderson= 4-2. Rangers.<br>  if not ill say 1-2 Panthers.|`|xGxHkj8faa	Rangers easily win with John Tortorella as the head coach|`|N1OnviExaa	3-2 Rags|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Florida has a pretty mediocre away record and the Rangers have a pretty solid home record.  The two teams are evenly matched, but Vokoun has been really impressive lately.  I'm going to assume Vokoun does not play and pick the Rangers 4-3 in OT/SO.  Should be a good game!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	NYR scored one goal against a pretty bad Toronto team last night, and that was with the new coach smell.  <br>  <br>  The Rangers have scored the third-fewest goals in the conf (behind Ottawa and NYI); until that changes...not looking good.<br>  <br>  So 2-1 then to Florida...glad to see Fonzie has been that inspirational revelation...not so much.
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I would do Blake for Kunitz.  Kunitz is going to get the chance to play alongside one of Malkin or Crosby.  That can't hurt.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Nobody for nobody....and....nobody for nobody.   Do what makes  you feel good about yourself.|`|CocAkBnJaa	I'd hang on to boyes, I've got him in all 3 leagues that I'm in. He's hot and cold, he'll go ice cold for 2 weeks, then he'll come back and score 5 goals in a week with 2 GWG. I grabbed kunitz when I heard what happened. He was a FA in 2 of my leagues. I'd think he'll get a decent chance along side Crosby/Malkin to post some respectable numbers. I wouldn't think he'll be a #1 player, but a solid depth contributor.|`|LupVriVyaa	no way brad boyes is still allstar with 40 goals and kunitz is already penguin but fantasy no only perry and getzlaf make him ok

S0u3HKzhaa	Stone Cold Steve Austin,because Jericho has been in the bashing all the HOF's storyline and saying there shouldn't be a HOF this year.And has been attacking HOF and members of the Class of 2009.And with the history between Austin and Jericho I think a Wrestlemania 25 match would be awesome.Austin will obviously win,I can't see the WWE bringing him out of retirement in front of his home state at the 25th Anniversary of Wrestlemania just to lose.<br>  <br>  If not Austin I would pick Hulk Hogan.There have been rumours about Hulk Hogan supposedly having a match at Wrestlemania 25 and Hulk is one of the biggest legends in Wrestling.Weather you love him or hate him he is one of the most well know wrestlers.And Hogan was in the first Wrestlemania and won so I think it would be interesting to see Chris Jericho vs Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 25.And again Hogan would obviously win too.|`|5oaOOquXaa	Well    it     could   be   any    famous      legend    but    I    think   it's      going       to    be    the    one,     and     only     Stone   Cold  Steve    Austin.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	rowdy piper|`|w173betxaa	hulk hogan|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Stone Cold Steve Austin.. no doubt..|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	For me it would a lumber jack match Jericho VS.

d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	Uhh... sorry, but no. 1979, 1998, and 2007 are all classics, but not this years. I've never been much of a fan for rain shortened races and this years 500 was one of the WORST I've ever seen.|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	catfish thinks its fits into the classic sucks catagory not classic great catagory.  but that does make it a classic.|`|UyvkM7feaa	God no - it was terrible. A crash and rain - nothing classic about that|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	The Daytona 380??? Far from it.............|`|QGevDlIkaa	hahahahahahaha a raind out race an instant clasic?????? uhh no i dont think so|`|AtIPTVBOaa	I think this one is as fa away from that as you can be.  This Daytona 500 was like one of the biggest disappointments of all times.  Nascar called the race so fast and didn't even give the rain a chance especially on the best race of the year.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Absolutely not.  The 2007 Daytona 500, 2007 spring race at Martinsville and 2008 fall race at Dover are all examples of instant classics.  Those all have great racing action with extremely exciting finishes that went to the checkered flag.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Although my favorite driver won, it was hardly a classic.  It will live forever in MY mind a classic, but i wouldn't expect it to for others.|`|MWSv1yfhaa	No, I would not say it was a classic.  I never like to see a race shortened by rain.
Pc0QjrQ4aa	Back-to-backs are pretty tough.  <br>  <br>  What I found interesting is that none of the teams that have gone to Europe (or to Japan, back when the league did that in the late 90's) have had any level of success in the playoffs that year.<br>  <br>  If there's a team to break that duck, you'd have to put your money on Detroit.|`|x9GODf8eaa	I doubt that tickets to a Tampa-Atlanta game would have taken any longer to sell out. Sweden is a huge hockey market, and they never get to see live NHL action, so its not a surprise to me. The fact that the Wings are stacked with Swedes just makes it more interesting in Stockholm.<br>  <br>  Its so hard to predict a winner right now because who knows even who will be playing for who at that point? Safe bet is Detroit sweeps, STL picking up maybe and OTL.|`|ViB84hYzaa	I'd say it will be competitive, with the likelihood of STL taking 1, if not both. As long as STL gets their team back together from injuries. I look at STL as the next Chicago in the West barring crappy luck in terms of the injury bug. No reason the Blues can't have their best season in years  in 2010-2011. Their might be a little let down for some of the Swede's playing in front of their family and friends back home or they may just play well enough to easily handle the Blues. Chances are 50/50 imo, better than this year no doubt.|`|AA10068004	Plenty of Swedes on the Wings.<br>  St.Louis may not win one of those.<br>  <br>  Thinking of going to Helsinki to watch the other match-up.<br>  <br>  LITY: Yeah Florida would be the downside..but come on man you know who I would be going to see over there..lol|`|etErp8rcaa	They should love their Wings. If you combined them with the Canucks, (and threw in Lundquist) you'd practically have the Swedish national team.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	At what point next season are Andy Murray and Mike Babcock fired?|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	1/10 chance.
lYnkvRASaa	Luongo misses significant time and comes back and can't stop a beachball for 7-8 games<br>  <br>  price misses time and still hasn't re-found his game.<br>  <br>  Brodeur- shutout first game back.  <br>  <br>  I guess there is no doubt about who is Canada's starting goalie for 2010.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Devils fans...yes. The rest of the eastern conference....not a chance they are happy at all. A healthy Marty and some new found goal scoring ability (in relation to the past couple seasons) and suddenly picking Boston doesnt feel so comfortable as the team to emerge from the east. And to think he is much more rested this season, here is to betting the oddsmakers in Vegas just adjusted the board (if they havent yet you better get your money in....the oddsmakers will do a fast fix).|`|0Fi9EANKaa	hell yeah, I went to the game last night and Marty looked in top shape. That guy is the face of the Devils franchise and is a true leader. I couldn't hear jack $hit when the fans were applauding him.|`|k9YaLawCaa	So Happy! Did you hear the "MARTY!!!!" chants? We love him. I'll miss Clemmensen and am sure he will play as a regular on another team next year. He did SO! well!|`|4de9c75ae84f69177cff43074c8f8609aa	Of course! It is because of him that the Devils NEVER missed the playoffs for the last decade or so...|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	I don't know, are lottery winners happy that they won millions and millions of dollars?|`|yGm29f3Eaa	Yep...I am.<br>  <br>  I just asked a question about it and I never venture into the hockey section|`|AA10068004	Marty never ceases to amaze me!|`|YJi66M5Gaa	If Marty Brodeur is back to his usual shape they're among the best in the league in net. I think they're legit contenders.<br>  <br>  What do the Devils do with Clemmensen, has he proven to be #1 elsewhere?The Devils DO need a puck moving defenseman who can help ease the forecheck.<br>  <br>  ADD: Brent Sutter should win the Jack Adams. No question. Unbelievable how good this team was 50 games without Brodeur.|`|etErp8rcaa	They should be. Clemmensen was very solid for them while Marty was out, but it's just not the same without #30 in net. I just could not imagine that team without him. Most seasons, I can't even name their backup goaltender.|`|kj48Bl3faa	Yess it was one of the best games I ever went 2.<br>  DEVILS ARE TAKING THE CUP!!!!!!!!!!!|`|suojKPfPaa	I seriously couldn't be happier! I wouldn't have missed that game last night for my life.. It was amazing.|`|n9py5Dreaa	Hells yea|`|DCNL73ZJaa	YEA HE IS AWESOME|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I know my relatives in New Jersey are glad he is back. But they were happy with how the team played in his absence. This after hitting the panic button .|`|G33E41IBaa	Of course!  5 shutouts and 7 games away!<br>  <br>  I was happy with Clemmensen's play, but you just can't compare it to having the franchise goalie, Martin Brodeur, back in net.  Granted the Avalanche really didn't play well, but Marty stepped up when he needed to make the saves, and the team pulled through to score some amazing goals and make good defensive plays to help Marty out in his first game back.<br>  <br>  Right now, the Devils are 5th in the league, and 3nd in the East with their backup's backup in net for 50 games this season.  I can't wait to see what the Devils can do with Marty back and healthy! :)|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Devils fans...thrilled.<br>  <br>  Rest of the Eastern Conference...not so much.<br>  <br>  I saw the highlights last night...pretty impressive for being injured as long as he was.<br>  <br>  Who'd have thought that Brodeur played in an NHL game before the Hartford Wolfpack's fashionista did?|`|9GzkVwfGaa	I am happy|`|zMSdChKgaa	No. We miss Clemmenson because he was way better than Brodeur.
53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	People overrate the Attitude Era because it was a complete foil (to use literature parlance) of today's era. People who may not agree with all of WWE's decisions today (and rightfully so) assume that the most recent era aside from the current one was better just because it occurred 10 year ago. Honestly though, whether they know it or not, I don't think people want the wresting back from the Attitude Era. I think the majority of their nostalgia comes from wanting that "shock value" back. It's a fair argument, but I think many would change their minds if they were introduced to a product that made the wrestling aspect of pro wresting relevant again. People can watch videos from the 80s and 90s and say they were good, but still want the Attitude Era back. Ok, fair. But I think if fans saw how wrestling could be utilized today if it would just be the center piece of at least one freak'n mainstream product again, then maybe they wouldn't want the Attitude Era back. They'd want back what's missing the most in WWE. Wrestling.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Finally someone who agrees! There are so many people bashing on the current era. They seem to love the Attitude Era, but a good number of them didnt even watch it them. They just go along with the rest of the crowd!|`|CfOh2qkgaa	I think there's a few answers to this question. 1. The group of people who grew up during the Attitude era may not enjoy today's wrestling cause it's different.  2.  There was more involvement with story lines and working the crowd during the Attitude era. 3.  Back then the WWF/WWE wasn't confined to it's clean image it's trying to portray now, I figure that most fans feels the WWE softened up nowadays, but we have to remember that wrestling has it's cycles, what's not fun for you doesn't necessarily mean it's bad for others.  Some people love the attitude era and some people love today's wrestling, just enjoy it as much as you can and try not to think too much into it.|`|RskPXtibaa	Attitude era was the best in terms of entertainment<br>  i been a wwe fans during the early attitude era<br>  but attitude era in terms of match quality was not that well<br>  the entertainment was the best<br>  <br>  but go back to the 2002 to 2004 period where WWE had the most quality matches in history<br>  for example see all the matches that involves triple h and hbk<br>  or kurt angle, undertake or lesnar or goldberg<br>  <br>  i love 2002 to 2004 more than that attitude ear|`|FkFKDpt5aa	yeh it did but compare to wwe have nowadays it was better then this era whatever era it is.<br>  <br>  dumb question to ask|`|qBk0fPWGaa	why it stop?
d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Yes the AMA rule is 150cc max for 2 strokes in the Lites class. KTM did bump their 144 up to a 150. There are several 144 kits for the YZ as well. I race the Lites class and I never, ever see a 2 stroke of any size race any more. Bumping the 2 stroke up to a 150 does help even out the HP, but power is not what makes the 4 stroke a superior motocross bike. Traction makes them a superior motocross bike, a 2 stroke will never hook up like a 4 stroke regardless of the displacement. By the way, your avatar is awesome.|`|8unHrIsDaa	the only 2t 144 i know of is the KTM SX. I do not know of a 2t 150. Either way they are nice, but dont really fit into a class so i would be careful with that. if you are looking for a 2t to race, i'd get a 125 if a 250 is too much for you.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Matt is a true champion and doesn't need any unusual circumstances to luck into a win.  He was fortunate at Daytona to be in the right place at the right time but he really did have an excellent car.  That's the reason he was there to begin with.  At California the rain delays had no bearing on his win, if anything it was the fact that Greg Biffle screwed up his last pitstop.  The 16 car was definitely the fastest and it was theirs to lose.  Matt had won there 2 times before and was on a streak of 7 races in the top 10 with a worst of 7th during that stretch.  Vegas is another excellent track for Matt and he won there in 2003 and 2004.  He can win again this year without the need for rain or anything else other than to avoid wrecking or mechanical problems.  Last year Jeff Gordon took him out late in the race when they were both running up front.  Just because he is not very flashy does not mean that he is not an extremely capable driver.  Matt and Jimmie are the only 2 drivers to make every chase and he's the reason it came about in the first place.  I'll say that Kyle Busch gets his first win at Vegas but I suspect that Jeff, Jimmie and Matt will give him a run for his money.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|H1VIZsutaa	It doesn't rain in Vegas. It might snow though.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I just thought of something! You know... Matt Kenseth is the type of guy who could actually pull of a win at Vegas, and make it three in a row. I could see him do it too. I bet he runs way up front and makes the Vegas race one of the most exciting races you've seen in a while. ...just because you can't stand to see him win.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Matt certainly doesn't need any weather assistance to win in Vegas. He's proven that by winning there twice, or is it three times?  History tells us a Rouch driver or Johnson will win in Vegas.|`|CwlnnwgJaa	Kenseth needs no help from the weather, Just ask the cat in the hat.<br>  <br>  <br>  v|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Aint no rain this weekend here!<br>  <br>  #24 Wins!|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Kenseth is always competitive at Vegas.Jeff Gordon will break his winless streak at Las Vegas.I don't have a guess for the top ten.|`|CrNFd1LPaa	Yeah he will need some rain this week.|`|a8EndhDmaa	no feel they momentum they have he will have a strong finish|`|nlSUGP9haa	im guessin just a little rain helps him lol

7utvegsmaa	Yes of course the spin would be different. Crosby and Overratekin are what the league calls "money makers" because they're puck hogs who take way too many shots and act like they're the greatest players of all time. But the media is told to tell people that they have all the value possible to attract suckers to the game who don't know anything.
9OVm1hL0aa	NO, it's called the economy.  It's the teams trying to survive not NASCAR.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	You need to do more research before you rant about something you obviously don't have a clue about.<br>  <br>  "Impound races"- are when you have quals then no practice between quals and the race. There are very few Impound Races now<br>  <br>  "Cookie cutter cars"- COT's have helped the small teams! I'm an engineer for HMS and believe me, the COT's have closed down on a lot of stuff that we could come up with to make the cars faster. Speed= Engineering $$$. HMS has over 100 Engineers on staff. I'd like to see a small 1-2 car team that has 15.<br>  <br>  "Engines"- There is still a ton of play in developing the right engine package. Do you want torque, ponies, durability? Build it how you want it within the guidelines.<br>  <br>  "Rubbing"- is allowed. Wrecking a guy for something stupid is not! Your theory makes no sense. Why would a small team tear up a goorace carar for 1 or 2 spots. For the lead, yes. But for 20th over 21st? Makes a difference of a few thousand bucks. It cost more time and money to fix or build race carar then it would be worth. That is why some of the guys are "field fillers". Qualify, run 1 lap under green, park it, and collect the money.<br>  <br>  Nascar has a capped limit of 4 car teams after this year. They are making Roush drop a car.<br>  <br>  The economy sucks! Stop blaming Nascar for everything!<br>  <br>  Do some research!|`|3e1ELOgnaa	Well said Chase H. I agree with you 100%|`|IrGapExUaa	Nascar is trying to help the small teams out. the bigger teams can only have 4 teams not. Also the no testing rule was to help the smaller teams. Nascar isnt trying to get ride of the smaller teams there trying to help them out.|`|GCOrku95aa	If NASCAR really wanted to help the smaller teams. they would get rid of the Top-35 rule, because it's the smaller teams who aren't in the top 35 in points that get sent home, even if they qualify for the race on speed. Michael Waltrip qualified on speed several times in his opening season as an owner, but because he wasn't in the top 35 in points he got sent home, and his spot went to another car. The rule is flawed to keep the money-making teams, the ones at the heart of NASCAR, which also happens to be their pocket book, from losing a spot in the race. The rule needs to go.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	NO. I don't think so. They didn't stop Joe Nemecheck of buying ONE car, with no sponsor, and try to qualify at Daytona or make the show at California. He finished last but.....he had all the same aero's as the next best Toyota team.<br>  I also don't think Nascar penalizes rubbing either. They only penalize the obvious like S. Wallace getting spun out on purpose at Daytona in Nationwide.   <br>   <br>  People wish that Nascar would franchise team's like the MLB and NFL do. The top 35 rule 'IS' Nascar's way of franchising team's. Most fan's just haven't realized that yet!|`|tTVS5oYzaa	For the sake of this arguement I am assuming you are talking about the Sprint Cup Series.  With that, there are only 5 races that are "impound" races.  They are both Talladega events, both Richmond races, and the July Daytona race.  All of the other races have post qualifying practice sessions.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, the new car design is actually a help to the smaller, less funded teams not a hinderance.  With very strict guidelines on the body, those teams can be more competitive because the ability of the larger, more highly funded teams to spend millions of dollars in wind tunnel time to fine tune the aerodynamic package is gone.  Look at both Jeremy Mayfield Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing were able to do.  They both didnt exist at the beginning of 2009 and were able to build cars that qualified for the Daytona 500 and Riggs was competitive in the 36 car.<br>  <br>  And in the Nationwide and Truck series, the new pit rules allows for teams to have smaller crews, the tire rules prevent the big teams from gaining an advantage of always having fresh tires, and the new engine rules help the little guys who cant afford to completely rebuild their engines after every race.  All of the things I think are helping the smaller teams stay competitive with the big teams.<br>  <br>  And one more thing...teams just cant keep adding cars.  There is a four team limit per car owner rule in place in NASCAR.<br>  <br>  There are probably still more things to be done, but I think NASCAR should be commended for the steps have taken to help the smaller teams.  Again, the #44 car driven by Allmendinger is a low funded, part time team and they finished 3rd in the Daytona 500 and are 13th in points.
FY17j1Ajaa	The Pens needed to move a defenseman for a winger, but Whitney? Kunitz is ok, but he's only slightly better than Fedotenko. Not exactly the type of winger to get for Crosby. That said, Whitney has been brutal since his return from surgery. He may still be not be 100%. As far as the prospect Tangradi, they already have enough of a young core of players. The Pens Have the top 2 scorers in the NHL and need to play for the NOW! They are only one season removed from the Finals. I certainly hope this wasn't a move simply for the sake of making a move. Chris Kunitz, while a quality NHL winger, is not someone who puts them over the top.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	As horribly as Whitney has played, just getting rid of him is worth it in my opinion.  I don't think Kunitz is the caliber of winger I would have aimed for...but this must have been the most we could get for Whitney at this time.|`|g3hfy9Ziaa	I don't like either team but the Ducks got the better deal since Kunitz is not the kind of left winder Crosby needs to improve the teams scoring and Anaheim gets a good defenseman to replace Pronger who is going to leave.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	I'm happy since i'm a Ducks fan,and I think the Ducks got the better deal.|`|HTKSoWLTaa	I like the trade, I think the prospect will add some depth at scoring next year plus he like 6'4 220 lbs.  Kunitz I think is nice because he seems liike a grit player.  I havent watched him play but he doesnt come off to me in his videos as a sniper type.  As far as Whitney goes, he's a good puck moving defenseman that has lost his way.  The fans have wanted him out for a while.  If he finds his game again it could be a great pick up for the Ducks.|`|QxWG5kGeaa	It sort of seemed like a desperation move by the Penguins since they are currently not in a playoff spot. I personally like Whitney more than Kunitz but maybe the prospect involved might make the deal worth it in a couple of years.|`|8qH5q7TGaa	Kunitz isn't what the Pens really need, they could have used a bigger upgrade at wing, but in exchange for Whitney I'll take anything he is playing awful and has been downhill for about 2 seasons|`|xGxHkj8faa	It was worth it because Chris Kunitz is way better.|`|gS8ZxQ23aa	I think it irrelevant since neither team will make the playoffs...HA..Sucks to be a Pens fan...GO WINGS!!!!!!!!!|`|ULw1777caa	Good trade for both teams.  Pens get what they need and the Ducks get a Defensemen who hasn't reached his prime.|`|3buQDaRDaa	I think might be a sign that Pronger is on the way out. As for the trade itself, I think both teams win.

obPSaYf3aa	When I joined 20+ years ago, I used my average of 218 certified by way of ABC book average and had my PBA house pros sign my application in place of the scratch league secretary because they were the ones that "drafted" me out of jr. leagues into adult scratch leagues at age 18.  Once I received my PBA membership card and certificate, after sending in my application and membership fees, I went to Las Vegas to attend a workshop on the ins and outs, grooming techniques, etiquette, dress code and behavor of PBA professional.  Also took lessons from PBA legend Don Johnson.<br>  <br>  Now due to recovery from a rotator cuff injury, I'm ready to apply for another membership with the PBA in order to ready myself in 8 years to join the Sr. Tour. <br>  <br>  After getting the required PBA schooling, I bowled in the Western Region in Northern CA and Eastern Region tournaments when visiting relatives in NY.  When National tournaments visited my region, I qualified for them via the "rabbit squad", which is for guests and those that are not exempt bowlers on tour.  Having qualified for all National Tournaments I applied for, I cashed in all eight that I entered and had enough cash awards to allow me to continue bowling in the regional program for a while.  These were tournaments featuring Walter Ray Williams Jr., Parker Bohn III, Pete Weber, Johnny Petraglia, Mark Roth, Brian Voss, Norm Duke and other legends of the sport.  The competition was fierce, but I had my share of beatings as well as victories against them on the lanes because we were all the "best".<br>  <br>  Now, the rules are the same, even though the dress code and grooming standards relaxed a bit.  If you want to join a PBA tournament, you have to have a USBC membership in good standing, pay the entry fee and willing to go through the "rabbit squads" in qualifying before trying to enter the actual tournament proper made up of the PBA's exempt bowlers.  If you happen to win a regional or National tournament as a guest, the option is there for you to join the PBA, which will not affect your ability to continue bowling in your regular USBC league, because PBA members bowl USBC leagues regularly when not touring.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope you have success with your bowling!|`|2MGJAwM9aa	You will have to register with the USBC , be a honorary member by winning a few championship titles ( of course , it must be recognised by the USBC ) and you will be invited to go for the selection rounds .|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	<a href="http://dennyspbatour.com" rel="nofollow">http://dennyspbatour.com</a><br>  first you have to be real good <br>  and yes bowling in regionals and doing well will help<br>  also to qualify for the pro tour you almost have to go through the trials <br>  i beilieve they are held in May
WPCATkoYaa	it really depends on your preference but you should just give it a shot. probly not lather it with wax just to see how you like it first but i dont c y  you cant use wax for roller.|`|XRBUkkEWaa	Hockey is a white joke!|`|CocAkBnJaa	I play roller as well. I'd be surprised if it made a huge difference. Plus when you have wax on your stick, it will rub off onto the puck, which does roll on its side and will disperse wax on the surface. Wax is bad for bearings, it's like glue, if that stuff somehow finds its way into your bearings, they're shot. Wax won't come off of wheels easily either, if you or someone else happens to step on your stick, wheels coated in wax. There's too many ways for wax to ruin roller, best to just keep it off.|`|eeWEof82aa	I don't think that the wax will help you too much, and I think the tape on your toe will also be detrimental to your shot.

Then again, based on your sentence structure, punctuation, and spelling, you don't really have much knowledge of the English language, which doesn't surprise me coming from a Yankees fan.<br>  <br>  First of all, if the Yankees really want to offer him 3 years and $75 million, go for it.  They won't.  In 3 years he's not going to be worth $25 million, thats why NO TEAM wants to give him 3 or 4 years.  If the Yankees were going to offer him a megadeal, they would have done it already.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Manny doesn't want an opt out clause because he doesn't like LA.  He's simply a greedy bastard.  He wants a long term deal so he can cash in now but he wants the opt out clause because he wants the option to make more money if the market warrants it.  He just wants the best of both worlds, a great contract now and the chance to get an even better contract should he perform well this season and he thinks his market value has gone up.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	The Yankees won't sign him. They need a center fielder. Johnny Damon and Hideki Matsui and both proven that they can no longer field Center field. Melky Cabrera officially sank last year. The Yankees already have Damon and Matsui in Left field and at Designated hitter. They already have Nick Swisher and Xavier Nady fighting over right field. Manny just isn't needed in New York. Remember when the yankees kept signing old guys that have been in their prime for several years now. None of them have worked out well. Kevin Brown, Carl Pavano, Johnny Damon (he came, and he couldn't even play center field anymore, much less run), Kyle Farnsworth didn't go well. Bobby Abreu went from winning a home run title to hitting 14 and 9 homeruns. I think that the Yankees have already learned their lesson about signing old free agents. They just don't have a place to put him right now.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Rumors.<br>  And a bad mistake to pick up Manny for the Yankees.  Gotta give our homegrown guys a chance.  Gardner and Duncan are looking sharp, and our pitchers are looking good as well.  We have to get younger, not poorer (in the wallets).<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, Manny would probably contribute a huge amount to the lineup, but why purchase him in his twilight years.  His D will be a huge downgrade, and we need some speed on this team.  Look at the offense we have going now.  We have a really potent line-up now.<br>  Damon, great leadoff guy with speed<br>  Jeter: Mister Clutch<br>  Tex: Uhhhh, it's Tex<br>  Arod: Ditto<br>  Matsui: Was looking real good last year before injury<br>  Posada: Same, and he seemed to be eying the ball really well yesterday.<br>  Cano: Trimmer, and working hard this off season<br>  Nady: Guy is consistent<br>  Gardner: Young, with speed.<br>  <br>  Let Manny go, folks.|`|ExlMB3N7aa	God save the Yankees from Manny|`|G4wGCghdaa	Of the 3 offers the Dodgers have made for Ramirez since he has turned free agent, this is the first that Boras has actaully taken  to Manny. Look for him to sign with the Dodgers on this deal.<br>  Even as greedy as Boras and Manny are they must have enough common sense between them to realize there are not many options left if any for the Dodgers or Manny. <br>  <br>  Lets see he turned down a 2 yr 45 million offer by L.A. in the fall then turned down their offer of arbitration. Then he turned down their 1 yr 25 million offer. Now they offer 25 million this yr and a Manny option of 20 million next year. This is the best he will get. 45 million or just the 25 then start this whole saga over again next season. Outside of the Yankees, Boston, the Mets, Cubs and White Sox not many teams could consider 22.5 million per season avg.<br>  <br>  I bet Manny takes this and is a giant drama queen again next off season if he has a big year at the plate. <br>  <br>  Even if the Yankees wanted to sign him they won't. There has already been more than a few owners wanting a salary cap after the cash the Yankees have thrown around this winter. Adding Manny without trading an A-Rod, Jeter, Sabathia, Burnett, or Rivera contract might spell the beginning of reality in New York if a salary cap is the result.<br>  <br>  My own personal odds on him are.<br>  Dodgers 95%<br>  Giants   2%<br>  Cardinals 1% <br>  Yankees 1/2 of 1%<br>  Cubs, Mets, White Sox    1/4 of 1% each = 3/4 %<br>  The rest of the League 3/4 % combined.|`|PqY0xNxHaa	He is definetly going to the Dodgers. The Yankees don't want him, and as a life long Yankees fan, I don't want him.<br>  Look at what he did in Boston. He doesn't try at all. Then he gets traded away, and he plays the best he's ever played in years. Sure, I love him for it, but do you really want him to do that to the Yankees?<br>  Besides, they don't need ANOTHER left fielder. They already have three. They're desperate enough to put Nady in right and start Gardner in center. Manny wouldn't help at all.|`|hqTCt86Naa	I think he started super sizing the juice the second he hit LA, and he will be outted soon.

We did for years and then realized that most of them "expected" to get their belts regardless of their effort, attendance and growth in their training.<br>  <br>  For the past three years we start each student out with no belt. This is to remind them that they must work hard all the time. Once the student has gained an understanding of the etiquette, traditions and basic techniques we promote them in class (about one month at minimum). I have seen this done in some dojo I visited in Okinawa and I had to ask why and they gave me the reasons stated above as well as a new student is not a student until they understand that the belt is never the important thing but rather learning and mastering the art is.<br>  <br>  I have had some of my peers ridicule our dojo for doing this but our student retention and quality is better than theirs so it must be working. I have also had several parents as well as adult students comment on appreciating having to earn their first rank because it taught them to set a goal.<br>  <br>  Regardless of how I handle this the majority of the schools out there will give you a white belt with your uniform.

w8AFCj5xaa	ai makes a easy target to scape goat but the bottom line is this is rips and rasheeds fault. iverson has sacrificed his scoring and minutes and his assist total is higher than his career average. there were a couple of games where ai sat on the bench in the fourth quarter and a game he didnt play at all and they still lost.<br>  <br>  the problem is micheal curry is trying to run a chauncy billups type of offense without a damn chauncy billups !  if that was going to be the plan then they should have just kept chuancy. they would have still lost in the playoffs but at least they wouldn't be *****in now. they would just be the suns of the east a team that will win in the regular season but get they azz kicked in the playoffs.<br>  <br>  they need to force everybody to defensive roles and allow ai to boost his scoring and get him going if they want any chance of saving they season. but as long as sheed and rip sit and act bitter about the billups trade and play like they aint never seen a court before then they will continue to lose. sheed is barely averaging 10 pts a game how the hell you go blame ai? ai aint taking sheed shots cause his scoring and shots are down.<br>  <br>  sheed and rip are to blame...|`|YhfMrppSaa	He is a distraction for Pistons|`|ED7bwcdnaa	I have to agree with TX fan|`|xBmGtq9waa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C-Ke0BMccg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C-Ke0BMc...</a> roflmao|`|wAwQDwDBaa	Well you have A: which Sheed is an idiot.

Ro03hVb6aa	I don't think it is a plan to get out of the S14.  i think the whole stink in the press recently was a clever tactic by the ARU (probably) to put pressure on the SARU prior to the re-negotiation and to make public the split of the funds which the ARU see as unfair.  it also cleverly forced the SARU onto the defensive.  The players you have mentioned are probably in the mid period of their careers and with the Boks selecting foreign players, probably see no reason not take the cash right now.<br>  <br>  I can't see the top SA sides being allowed into the Magners League or the Heinekin cup in this economic climate, certainly not for a few years.  The major sponsers probably don't really want to pay for exposure to a market like SA and there are probably conflicts of interest with their competitors in SA in place which will take a along while to iron out.  Plus the travel would be too much and would mean games like Munster v Leinster only taking place once per year in their league.<br>  <br>  It's similar to Henry pulling his players out (I think the rest didn't cause them to lose the RWC, poor selection tactical idicy on the night did, but that's another issue) but it's not the same exactly.  The TV guys wll probably complain about this too as the lack of top players will devalue the product and point out it's probably inbreach of existing contracts which will cost them a lot to get out of.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is the SARU know that if they pull out of the S14, the ARU and NZRFU will pull out of the tri nations, which leaves the SARU trying to prepare for a world cup against whatever the 6N sides can scrape together for a summer tour, which as we have seen is not usually much.  They know this is no way to prepare for a world cup and seeing as the RWC is what floats the world game of rugby financially in a way FIFA can only dream about, they will keep this as their priority|`|UwqU6p3taa	Yes it may be beneficial in terms of knowledge but there remains the spectre of player burn-out with playing from northern hemisphere to southern season (I assume thats whats happening). We've already lost Dan Carter withan achilles injury and had to try and scramble Luke  McCalister to repalce a superstar player. How long is it before this starts happening to the South African player ranks? It depends whether the SA players  are either young players on the rise or has beens trying to make a buck like others in the UK b4 them.|`|WnTHyxAiaa	i think its good, the players leaving will get knowledge of how northern hemisphere rugby works, it requires more strength, power, teamwork.  alot of south africans have played or are still playing in england.  its just a better experience for the players.|`|eXcXF3iRaa	It sure does require MORE strenght (!),,power(!),,teamwork and that is exactly why they did so well against the SH teams in 08 ;-)|`|Q11YuqKkaa	Yes, there are few SA players in UK but I don't think we are going to play there any time soon. At least I hope not.<br>  <br>  No offence to the NH teams, but a lot of SA players who couldn't even make their provincial XV are top players overseas.<br>  <br>  The competitions in the SH are a lot more demanding. Take it from our recent Boks who went overseas and came back:<br>  <br>  Victor Matfield<br>  John Smith,<br>  <br>  all of them agree that the SH competitions are a lot demanding.<br>  <br>  Schalk Burger turned down the offer to go tho Saracens. (www.supersport.co.za)<br>  <br>  And remembered how old Freddie struggled to get his groove last year? And that was during the Currie Cup, not to mention Super 14 (He got injured early in the competition).<br>  He had his French Flair moments, but all and all. Did not live up to expectations.<br>  <br>  BUT, and this is a BIG BUT....<br>  when our players return from the NH, they seem a lot more mature...just an example:<br>  <br>  When Percy came back he played a lot more consistant than we were used to, and he seemed a lot more calm. Same with Stefan Terblanche.<br>  Don't know if it is the Rugby, the culture, being away from home or just the fact that they got older.<br>  <br>  <br>  So to conclude, REALLY hope SA remains in SANZAR. Will miss the Never-Say-Die Aussies, and the only test team that can challenge the Boks at the Highveld, the All Blacks, and their HAKA too much.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The Saffa's have been whingeing for a few years now that they want out to play Heinekin Cup and in the 6 Nations. I hope they stay here in SANZA but is they don't, there's always the Argies, Japan, Pacific islands.<br>  <br>  Your comment about the ABs pulling players out of Super 14 was so that the stars wuldn't be buggered for the World Cup that was all it was.

I'm assuming 2x lessions a week, so this is 2 to 2 1/2 months of lessons.<br>  <br>  1. The best defense is running away. (No, I'm not being sarcastic.) So if the Judo instruction has a good cardio workout built in,  and the individual has been concentrating on that aspect consistently every day (jogging, wind sprints, some high-rep weight lifting, etc.) then there would be significant improvement in personal safety.<br>  <br>  2. Judo, as I understand it, is almost never taught as a self-defense style. Self-defense techniques usually include things like situational awareness, social de-escalation techniques, the aforementioned running away, and so on. Actual physical techniques woudl be things like eye-gouges, knee kicks, knife disarms, how to deal with multiple attackers, etc. It also may cover handgun use and pepper spray. So judo doesn't specifically help you out there. It may have some techniques to get out of grapples and locks, but that's about it.  <br>  <br>  3. The "average person" isn't going to be jumping you on the street and trying to take your wallet. Ambush tactics like that include multiple individuals coming at your blind side, hitting you with a pipe, and taking your stuff while you're unconcious and/or bleeding out. Judo won't cover this at all. <br>  <br>  4. In a high-school fight or barroom brawl situation? Eh, it may give you a bit of familiarity with being grappled, which will lower your adrenal response somewhat, which in turn allows you to think more rationally. But that's fighting (combat to protect your ego), as opposed to self-defense (combat to protect your body). If someone is OUT TO KILL YOU, then this isn't the technique they're going to use. <br>  <br>  that all being said: yes, 20 sessions of Judo probably would help you against an "average person on the street", if by that you mean "teenaged punk with no training whatsoever trying to start a brawl and not really trying to do anything worse." If it's not? You've going to get shived.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	I don't know how quickly you start to learn things in Judo but the avg person does not even know how to throw a punch. I would say that someone would do pretty well after 20 lessons.|`|EnwwqUGZaa	Since average attackers are ...well... less than average when it comes to smarts and skills, you might do okay with a little training.<br>  <br>  I consider 20 judo lessons a little.  The first half of those you will spend learning ukemi, some basic throws and pins follow.  Judo is rarely taught in a self-defense format today and when it is it is normally to upper rank students.<br>  <br>  On the other hand some basic self-defense skills you can easily learn today:<br>       - unplug you ears from your music, phone or whatever.  Listen to what is around you and going on.<br>       - pay attention to your surroundings, avoid trouble areas and potential problems before they become problems.<br>       - assume a posture of self-confidence and attention.<br>       - use your number one weapon your brain.

giWvSwqRaa	Different type of shock absorber, some you slide it in, some you just push it in.|`|3e8fsr8Iaa	Well there are different kinds, some push in between the strings and  others have to be put in while stringing. Just use a little more force.|`|N3F8eBbsaa	I always have a lot of trouble putting on shock absorbers too. You have to center it just right in the middle of the racket at the bottom, and you have to slide one side of the absorber over the strings. Then you push it down and slide in the other sides. Its really hard for me to do, but i hope i helped :)

G4wGCghdaa	The only thing spring training is good for is looking at prospects and hoping 1 will surprise and make the team. Also for getting these prima donna millionaires into shape. The game scores mean little with as many as 10 guys pitching for a team on any given day and guys who will never see the light of day at a major league park getting the bulk of the at bats. Hopefully no key pitchers or batters gets injured before the real season starts.<br>  <br>  Cubs are a little less talented IMO than last season but so is the rest of the NL central and most of the NL.<br>  <br>  I think the Cubs will be around 94-68 and win the division for an UN-CUB like 3rd year in a row. Then hopefully win at least 1 playoff series.<br>  <br>  The Astros I think will be one of 3-4 teams fighting for the Wild Card.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	I thought that my Red Sox had it made today!

(But they beat Boston College, woohoo. haha) Last night Josh Bard did a good job of catching Wake's knuckleball.

8qZrlz07aa	That will really depend upon the type of disc brakes you choose.  There are two types:<br>  <br>  Hydraulic Brakes<br>  Cable Activated Brakes<br>  <br>  Hydraulic brakes function much like those in your car or on a motorcycle.  The brake lever moves a piston which displaces fluid to travel down the brake hose and activate another piston at the caliper.  This piston (or more than one depending on type) pushes on a brake pad (or two pads get equally pushed depending on type) against the rotor and this slows your bike.<br>  Choosing this type of brake setup will require a replacement of your entire braking system from handlebar to wheel for each set of brakes (front and/or rear)<br>  <br>  Cable Actuated Disc Brakes:<br>  The mechanical bicycle disk brake works nearly the same way as the hydraulic disc brake does except a cable takes the place of all of the fluid components.  A brake lever pulls a cable leading to the caliper, much in the same way as a rim brake.  Where a standard set of rim brakes would have a set of arms that pull in, the mechanical disc has one fixed brake pad and one that is mounted to a large screw.  When the motion of the lever actuates the cable, a lever arm down at the brake caliper moves and turns the screw.  This pushes the mobile pad against the disc rotor and when pushing against the disc it pushes on the fixed pad on the other side.  There is a very slight loss in power because you are using some effort to deflect the rotor against the other pad bad this is negligible. <br>  <br>  So the simple answer is:  If you choose Cable actuated brakes you can get by with the levers and cables that you have but why not replace them with matched levers from the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  If you choose hydraulic brakes you have to replace everything.<br>  <br>  Good choices for hydraulic brakes, in no particular order are:  Shimano, Hayes and Avid.  <br>  <br>  Good choices for cable actuated disc brakes are:<br>  Avid and Interloc.<br>  <br>  You can read more about these on my site at this page:  <a href="http://www.tandem-bicycle-central.com/bicycle-disc-brakes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tandem-bicycle-central.com/bi...</a>|`|Z5xgSATSaa	You can use the same levers, but the cables will be too short. You might be able to cut the rear cable to fit on the front, but you will have to buy a new one for the back. This is providing the cables are still in good shape.|`|oPbLcfKoaa	You will probably need new wheels too. Disc brakes require special hubs to mount the discs. <br>  <br>  Most disc brake kits include cables and levers, but if your levers are now integrated with the shifters you should be OK.

R0NfdgzLaa	the average aussie does have a good sense of humour.  ian healy is brilliant, i love his commentary.  we used to hear a bit of his comedy through the stump mic, but having him on full-time is even better.  he's a normal bloke who doesn't try to be a big star when he's commentating, he just calls it as he sees it, and his honest humour is very entertaining... he'll even take the piss out of himself if he calls it wrong.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	then India will be the second best sense of humor:lol|`|mber3JoAaa	Tell you what, Healy deserved the smack in the mouth he got from that rebound of the stumps.

Some might say they are the pits.<br>  <br>  What is more humorous:<br>  Merv Hughes telling a batsman who just played and missed to: <br>  "turn the bat over, mate, the instructions are on the back"<br>  or<br>  Ian Healy saying to a player he just stumped: <br>  "back to the shed, ********!"<br>  <br>  Sometimes, what an Australian would not even consider offensive can almost cause a team to threaten to call off the game, as in when an Australian fieldsman said to an English player:<br>  "Jesus, mate, you're an arsey bastard!"<br>  <br>  Some of the funniest things said on cricket grounds in Australia didn't even involve the Australians. Ian Botham to Allan Lamb when they were batting together and Lamb was being too defensive for Botham's liking: "Come on, Lamb, stop flogging your meat and get in for a chop!" New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming telling Danny Morrison's girlfriend on the phone: "Danny's just gone out to bat, do you want to hold?" West Indian Viv Richards to Joel Garner when they were doing a McDonalds promotion and Ronald McDonald with his over-sized shoes appeared: "There's a job for you Big Bird when you retire, they can called you the burnt burger!" South Africans calling out to teammates in the field in Afrikaans, confusing the daylights out of the opposition.<br>  <br>  The Australians are the best (worst?) sledgers on the park, but they sometimes can't take what they give out, can they Andrew Symonds?<br>  <br>  And even when they haven't a clue what was said they crack a sad like when the Bangladesh keeper (who didn't speak English very well) made a comment to his teammate in Hindi or whatever the language was and had Ricky Ponting waving his arms around like a demented band conductor...|`|q0rJV5T2aa	IMO Oz cricketers take life too seriously, especially the ones I have seen playing in the recent matches.<br>  <br>  WI IMO are the laid-back relaxed guys with great sense of humour.|`|HTiczN3Xaa	LMFAO I've heard it all now!! <br>  <br>  ashish bhatia claiming to "do good quality humour".

WnTHyxAiaa	its probably because your wearing the wrong type of shoes mate.  if the ground is hard or dry, look to running shoes, touch shoes, or shoes with heaps of moulded studs.<br>  <br>  if the ground is wet, moist, or soft, look to something with less studs.<br>  <br>  personally i like to wear moulded studs they have more control and comfort.  some shoes actually have cushioning for your knees.  you should do some research at shoe shops, or on the net.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Wait till after you retire.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	Another possibility is tendonitis or something of the sort from overusing your knees. Best solution for that is some ice after practices and the use of a knee brace (just a sleeve, nothing fancing) for games (I wouldn't recommend wearing it much). But definitely check your shoes, the surface you're playing on, and the effects of ice before you go and buy something that you may not need.
CE4hcUmhaa	You didn't mention how long the trip was for- if it is a short trip, you can try the Carolina sandhills around Pinehurst.  Check out the website for Tobacco Road, they have some pretty good deals on some good courses, especially md-week.  You can get a hotel in Sanford or around Pinehurst and if you don't mind driving maybe an hour or so each day, play a good variety of courses.  Tot Hill, around Asheboro, usually has a special on Weds for about 30$ and ncludes a cart- it's a nice course, and has some of the weirdest greens ever built.  I've seen people putt the ball out of bounds off of the ninth- but, it's a lot of fun to play.<br>  <br>  But be careful where you stay- some of the counties in that area are stll dry- no acohol- but the Pinehurst and Ft. Bragg area have some good restaurants, bars, and other "entertainment".<br>  <br>  The other recommendations like Myrtle and RTJ are pretty good too.

qyATAaeXaa	The answer is both "Yes" and "No". <br>  <br>  Rock Climbing is a sort of sub-category of Mountaineering. It specifically involves the use of techniques that enable the climber to scale sheer vertical routes up a mountain. In many cases, a climber must employ these techniques on large scale climbs or the entire climb may be up the vertical face of a mountain. Not every Mountaineering climb involves using rock skills, and not every rock climb will be a full-blown mountaineering expedition either.<br>  <br>  Mountaineering MAY involve the use of crampons, ice tools, and snowshoes. Rock Climbers don't use these things. Likewise, Ice Climbers do use some of the same equipment, but there are differences between an Ice Climbers crampons and tools and what an expedition mountaineer would use (unless part of the climb involved a sheer ice scale as well.) <br>  <br>  However, mountaineering does not mean high-altitude only. Climbing Mt.Washington in the dead of February takes crampons and ice tools. It's a hike in summer, but it's mountaineering in winter! Same goes for a lot of the 14ers. <br>  <br>  Most mountaineers are also rock climbers. Climbers are not always mountaineers but that's up for debate as well. Big-Wall climbers are faced with the same amount of risk and weather as a non-wall climbing mountaineer. Someone who scales the face of El Capitan is a mountaineer. Someone who climbs trad in the Gunks is a climber because they are home for dinner. A gym climber isn't even a rock climber in my book. In no way is a gym-rat a mountaineer, they simply lack the skills and experience of someone who climbs real rock and deals with Momma Nature. <br>  <br>  Don't put all your faith in Wikipedia. Consult some climbing websites, magazines, and books too. <br>  <br>  The debate will rage on depending on the people involved. In my book, you make it to the summit of a peak, you can call it whatever the heck you want. It doesn't matter if it was a hike, and climb, or it was mountaineering. You're there and some other poor sucker got stuck at work or is plopped on the couch watching TV. You're better off than them.|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	The biggest difference between rock climbing and mountaineering is that mountaineering is about getting to the summit of a mountain, while rock climbing is about getting up a particular "wall".  Reduced to its rawest elements, rock climbing becomes bouldering, where fantastically difficult free climbs are made up very short heights from the ground, 10' to 20' usually.  It is almost all about strength, gymnastics, and technique.  On the other end of the spectrum, the epitome of mountaineering is climbing Mt Everest.  Many mountaineers are rock climbers, and many rock climbers are mountaineers, but usually the mountaineers climb rock faces in order to reach the summit, while rock climbers have to be mountaineers in order to reach a particular rock wall, such as Yosemite's Northwest Face of Half Dome.|`|1njsqy0laa	YES!!!!<br>  <br>  It always pisses me off when people talk about "climbing" a 4,000 footer. Unless it is a Class V (or IV in some cases) it is a HIKE.<br>  <br>  Rock climbing is Class V  or VI Climbing (see the Yosemite Decimal System). It includes everything from bouldering to big wall climbing, to aid climbing, to soloing...etc.<br>  <br>  Mountaineering is just that- climbing mountains. It involves anything from Class I to class VI. Many mountaineering expeditions require some Rock Climbing and/or Ice Climbing, but not all.<br>  <br>  That's the basic explanation. <br>  <br>  The two are separate terms. There are often bits of climbing in mountaineering and vice versa, but they are different.<br>  <br>  Rock Climbing is kind of an underground sport...it's difficult to find a lot of information. Try the individual types of rock climbing instead, such as Trad Climbing, Sport Climbing, Aid Climbing, Free Climbing, Soloing, Free Soloing, etc.|`|yvpfphQNaa	I'm afraid I don't know this stuff from any source, but this is what I've read or heard somewhere over the years. Bear with me.<br>  <br>  Mountaineering (Alpinism) as we know it now was first done in the Alps by all the countries that have Alps. So mainly France. This was done way back before technical rock climbing, but obviously it did involve some climbing.<br>  <br>  Now, us Brits and the Germans don't really have any mountains. Sure we have Scotland, and the Germans are close to the Alps (Schwarzwald is looked down upon by the Jungfrau massif), but nothing as good as what the French et al have.<br>  So we started doing rock climbing at crags instead of up high in the mountains.<br>  This was first done by nutters in hobnail boots and hemp rope, using chock stones to 'protect' falls, and occasionally bashing pitons into the rock to clip onto. <br>  Eventually technology progressed so that better gear and ropes were used for protection, and climbing shoes started to evolve.<br>  Once trad(itional) climbing was developed in this way, people thought it'd be a good idea to start bolting routes to make them safer / easier, and sport climbing was born.<br>  From this premise, I guess, indoor climbing centres came.<br>  <br>  Well that's what I think the history of rock climbing is, there may be some guess work or lots of inaccuracy but it might be a starting point for you!<br>  Mountaineering and rock climbing are synonymous because you need to be a good rock climber in order to do mountaineering. It's only when it started becoming more popular that rock climbing started evolving as a sport in its own right.|`|AA10895669	A huge difference.

CE4hcUmhaa	This isn't much of an answer, but it really depends on the circumstances.  There are a lot of court cases in the US every year, and it all depends on the situation and who has the better lawyer.  <br>  <br>  When you go to a golf course, in general, you are deemed to be "going to the hazard", meaning that you already know that getting beaned accidentally is a possibility, so the liability is your own.<br>  <br>  But, if someone is being negligent, drunk, or completely out of control, and they bean you, it might be their fault if they didn't exercise reasonable caution and follow accepted golf rules.<br>  <br>  One of the weirdest rulings is that if you have a caddy, and he/she gets beaned by someone ese, then YOU are liable as their employer-<br>  <br>  thanks to all of the jackass lawyers for that one!|`|z58NVkOnaa	Everyone understands that there are risks involved on being on the golf course.

X7OlyuEJaa	Hello, <br>   The cues you are looking at are of a medium quality and they sell for a premium price. If you want a Japanese cue with all the inlays, points, etc, you could just buy an Adams or Helmstetter cue for about half the price, they are made in the same factory anyway. <br>   For the kind of money they sell for, you could have a quality American made cue built for yourself, of course not with as many inlays etc, but nonetheless you would have a much better quality cue. If you want all the bling, you could still buy an American production cue like Mcdermott, Viking, Joss etc for the same kind of money.    Besides, why send your hard earned American money to Japan, when the American cue builders are some of the finest in the world.<br>  My 2 cents worth|`|UHCopNpgaa	ive bought quiet a few cues some for over a $1000 and some for under a $100 from experience unless you actually play with it first it hard to pick a cue that's suits you the last 2 i have bought are a POISON AX4 i play with and a POISON VX2.9 i break with both are made by predator and both are under $300 apiece in the last 20 years these are to me the best 2 sticks ive ever had to someone else they may not think so but wouldn't trade em for any custom or regular cue out there now.|`|1gPxH90Saa	Look, you can buy the most expensive cue available and it may not improve your game at all.. I've shot with bar cues so bowed if you put a string on em they could launch arrows with precision and have beaten people with $1500+ viking cues. It's all a matter of your skill level and what you're comfortable with. Am i claiming to be a great shooter? No, just better than some schmuck with too much $ in their pocket that thinks buying a cue will make them good.<br>  <br>  As for this "fast larry" he may be the best pool player in the world, personally I have no clue and don't really care to. I shoot pool to have fun. But do you think maybe he's getting some kind of endorsement deal from this company? Tiger Woods endorses Nike and other golf products, you think if you buy them all you'll be able to run through the PGA like he does? My guess is no. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad cue or even that it's not worth the money. I have no opinion on it one way or the other seeing as how I've never shot with it. Unfortunately it's one of those things you have to decide for yourself, although I'd think long and hard before spending that kind of money on a cue. Especially if you just shoot for fun or shoot in a crowded bar where it may "grow legs" and disappear on you.
AA12170560	Clothing measurement tape works best.<br>  But that's just the start - if your school has different makes of helmet - interior pad thickness matters.<br>  <br>  So you WILL have to try on the different brands of helmet at your size.<br>  <br>  If your school has Schutt helmets, your coach has a video tape for sizing you properly and he should get a measuring tape for each member of his staff.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Your hornet would be great out to 150 yards.  Maybe 200 if you want to push it.  If I was you, I'd send that little H&R back to get a new barrel for it.  If you send it in, they are able to match a new barrel to your receiver.  New barrels cost about $100, maybe a little more.  The barrels would be interchangeable.  You can swap between calibers in just minutes.  You could look at a 223 barrel, or even a 243 to get a little more range and knock down power.  Heck, I'd get a couple of calibers as long as they had it.  Maybe a 243, 500s&w, and a muzzleloader.  That might be a little ambitious, but that's what I'd do if I had a h&r.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No your 22 Hornet is a great Varmint caliber for Hunting Coyotes, whoever told you that is either jealous, or doesn't know what they are talking about. Here are some others for Coyote: 218 Bee, 222, 22-250,243, 22 Magnum, 220 Swift, and your 22 Hornet.**|`|0R46pYb3aa	Your .22 Hornet will kill a coyote.  I know people who cleanly kill coyotes with .22 magnums.  If you need an excuse to by a new rifle, .223 Rem., .22-250, .25-06, .243 Win., .223 WSM, .204 Ruger.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd go with a .243 Win. It gives you a little more versatility.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	My vote goes to 257 Roberts. To each his own, but I see no reason to stretch with the 22 caliber cartridges when we have such good 6mm's and quarter-bores.|`|gQUclrEvaa	A 22 hornet is just fine out to around 150 yards. Alot depends on what you intend to do with the coyotes after you shoot them. I sell my hides and have found a 243 with 100 grain do less damage to the skins than a varmint load and it is good out to 300 + yards. The ones I shoot with a 22-250 or a 220 swift blows the hide wide open but they are really hard to beat for very long range shots, but then also is the 243 with a 65 or 80 grain. I would suggest to a 243, when you are done shooting coyotes you also have a decent deer rifle.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	A Hornet is fine for coyotes out to at least 200yds. A fat full grown rockchuck takes a 45gr psp Rem. factory load in through the forward shoulder bones and out at the rear ribcage with a 3/4" exit at 250yds. A coyote is typically bigger but if you place the bullet in the chest cavity it  should be a clean kill out to 200yds possibly 250.<br>  <br>  For long range(250-500yds) coyotes a .22-250, one of the 6mms or .25s would be my choice. The .25s like the .257 Roberts and .25-06 Rem. in a medium weight rifle make a near-perfect deer rifle as well.|`|AA11622061	You can do the job with a .22 hornet, but I think they're only good to a couple hundred yards. I've always thought a .22-250 or a .223 is just right for hunting coyotes because they have more reach than the .22 hornet does.|`|dpSr0icwaa	22 hornet will work but it is really only for the shortest range coyote hunting.  Now, a 223 or something of that nature is going to be a lot better choice.|`|HhECyibGaa	I like the Hornet but if they are a bit far away a 22-250 or a 243 should do the trick nicely.|`|bYVCuyGFaa	It depends on weather u wanna keep the fur if so .223 if not .243 rifle either gets the job done. I love my .223 for coyotes|`|HuDn5MMtaa	Your hornet will be just fine.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	.223 long range<br>  <br>  12ga 00buck brush or over dogs|`|3dqAFwD8aa	It just depends if you want to keep the skin and tan it out i would go with a 223. It is about the best for hunting coyotes. Just make sure u have the right kind of ammo a hollow point will mess the hyde up i use a hornedy bilistic tip when i hun them. Best time to hunt coyotes is on a full moon.|`|8829j405aa	i used 22 LR for years but i prefer a 22-250,|`|QrjuueMCaa	Travis S had a good answer. Good advice.<br>  <br>  I personally use a 22-250 when im hunting coyotes. Works great plus, it doesn't leave a big *** hole in them so your pelt is worth more. <br>  <br>  Lock and load. Keep your powder dry!|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The best? ---- The 22-250.........<br>  <br>  That being said -- The best isn't always the best.....<br>  <br>  I recommend the .223.... Why you might ask? -- Because the ammo is way cheaper.....<br>  <br>  Although the 22-250 is an excellent performer, I am not going to cough up the roughly $20 a box on up for cartridges.....<br>  <br>  Yes Yes Yes if you will be a super dedicated critter slayer and want the best then of course get the 22-250.....<br>  <br>  But if you want the next best choice then surely look into the .223...... Ammo starts as low as $7 a box for cheap stuff......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/store/html/223_ammunition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/st...</a>
A7QROnjLaa	I know (not think) he is too good for them.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Is Arsenal good enough for Bendtner <br>  <br>  <br>  Bendtner is a joke only wegner see's anything good him|`|mK06dus9aa	I think he is too good for Arsenal. So much for them being the club that nurture and develop young talent. The best thing he could do for his career is leave Arsenal and get away from their boo boys to somewhere where he will be appreciated and will be allowed to gain confidence. Adebayor has only 3 more goals his season.|`|5h0yIiLkaa	ahhhhh Bendtner, Bendtner, Bendtner.....(shaking head)|`|LNfQSoPkaa	No he's not, Because he's completely useless<br>  I would rather have James Beatie upfront..at least he knows where the goal is!
EGe0k8P6aa	The Gamo Big Cat comes without iron sights from the factory. If you want iron sights you'll have to buy them as an add-on and either install them yourself or have an airgun-smith install them. Pyramid Air has some iron sights you can buy. <br>  <br>  Honestly though, it would probably be easier and cheaper to buy an airgun scope and attach it. This is just my opinion based on my own experiences with iron sights and scopes, but once you get used to them, scopes tend to be easier to use and more accurate than iron sights (since they have fewer focal planes and they magnify your target so you can see it better. The only area I know of where scopes generally aren't a better choice is at extreme close ranges (less than 10 feet). Granted that springers are harder on scopes than the multi-pump guns I tend to favor, but you should be able to find a decent airgun scope which will last a long time and help you enhance your gun's accuracy for around $30. For $60-$80 you could get a really nice scope that would probably last as long as the gun.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	It would probably be more expensive than it would be worth but you may be able to get a gunsmith to mount a peep sight (which are quite expensive alone) and some type of front sight such as is used on .22 rim-fire rifles for target shooting and hunting on your rifle. But, as I said, it is going to be expensive. If you don't want to spend that much you should probably just keep using the scope; these air rifles were made without sights and there are not any after-market sights available for them that I can locate.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the rifle and shoot safely.

JAicBUHAaa	No.  Your queer if you like groping other men who are wearing tight pants, i.e football.|`|5h0yIiLkaa	Hell Nizzo! Soccer, i say Football, is an amazing sport. It's not as big a sport as (Basketball, football, or baseball) but that doesn't mean its queer at all. Soccer is a very masculine sport and the fact that the rest of the world plays it, says something. Americans can be retarded sometimes...but no, ur definately not gay for liking soccer over football. It's ok..i get alot of flack too.|`|GbyHQQLiaa	No you're intelligent. Soccer is the greatest sport in the world!|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	yep|`|2X5pvFWVaa	NOOOOOOO, you are not, I love soccer myself, at least we know our anatomy, unlike football which is named buy a person who failed his anatomy class, don't know the difference between foot and hand.No offense. But really soccer is popular all over the world except in USA, in fact football is only played in USA, and many people around the world don't even know it.|`|emHay25eaa	no effing way!! soccer is awesome and is definitely considered masculine.  who the heck is calling U gay 4 that?!?!?!|`|qbf2ZXWHaa	Many people like soccer over football.

He's in Hendrick equipment and is one of the most competitive drivers out there. His stats speak volumes. Even during his part time seasons for the last two years, race for race, he was still in the top 10, without a win. Imagine how much better he will be able to do this year in the #5 HMS Kelloggs car.<br>  <br>  Even Rick Hendrick admitted that when the engines of the #5 & #88 let go in Fontana, he was worried about the whole stable, including the other teams that sub out engines from them, like the #14 of Tony Stewart.|`|IrGapExUaa	Yeah Mark Martin will win at least one races this year.

Bb8Ijj8xaa	firstly i have to say that the majority of those answers are total bull !!!<br>  i mean to say... hit the testicles use a hammer fist!! and the guy who says that you cant knock someone out with one punch.... you all either watch too much tv or are deluded.<br>  <br>  ok my friend to serious stuff.... yes you can knock someone out with a single shot and to be honest if you practice one or two punches on a bag or with friends holding pads then your ability to use more power will eventually come.<br>  <br>  the secret to real life self protection is to hit first.... dont wait for your opponent to gain the initiative... because then you will be in a world of pain. learn to know the signs, the bulging eyes the neck picking the splaying arms.... all signs that your opponent means business and that action is needed.<br>  <br>  if you know how a knockout actually happens then you will be fit to train accordingly..... basically to cause a knockout you need to make your opponents brain shake inside their skull which causes a small bruise on the brain and cause the person to faint. to achieve this you will have to hit the jaw line from the tip of the chin to the ear and the closer you hit to the ear the harder to achieve the knockout. now a lot out there will say that you can hit the temple or hit the ear or hit the back of the head but you have to imagine yourself in the situation and you have to be aware of your own limitations.<br>  <br>  for eg you say you are not very strong.... so you will have to use body weight and good technique which with practice will be very achievable if you were bigger then you may get away with sloppy technique and rely on strength<br>  <br>  another thing is the situation you will find yourself in..... you wont be in your training gear and you wont be warmed up and you wont get the correct distance.... people who train forget these basic things and even if they have a catalogue of black belts it wont help them in a bar with tables around and in there best jeans and possibly a jacket on with some guy in their face and only 12 to 18 inches to throw their punch because this is the range you will have to fight at not the 2 or 3 feet you use in the gym<br>  <br>  look up geoff thompson on the net he is an english guy who worked as a doorman for years and you will gain good advice and tips from him.<br>  <br>  so dont listen to anyone and be strong and use your fear to your advantage<br>  <br>  good luck|`|bO0moNVfaa	what the **** youve been attacked?where do you live?Normally skinny dudes like you die in brooklyn.

If you hit their jaw in that manner, and they don't move their head... Knock Out. You have to throw a hook hard. If you can't do the damage you want to, run, because they'll be pissed off.  And if your just trying to learn how to protect yourself, while doing some damage, just google Krav Maga|`|WnTHyxAiaa	you cant do a 1 punch knockout if you tried your hardest.<br>  <br>  you need strength, i recommend gong to the gym and doing some weight lifting/ strength training.  <br>  <br>  if thats out of reach, the you better imporvise, push ups, use a vacuum cleaner as a dumbell lol.  i dont make it up be creative|`|UHFhtc6daa	well it depends how far you want to go. just try to aim for the TEMPLE.

If it is your first bike, get a 125, you will be much happier, and it's cheaper. It will also be used, so if it breaks down on you, you can get some experience in fixing it, that's always fun.|`|oHc3S74baa	kx 125 will be better - you will grow into it within 6 months.

hNfOgNNBaa	Not a whole lot NOT to like about Phil Mickelson.  A tremendous competitor, person, father and husband (undoubtedly).  <br>  I'll never forget when he broke that dudes Rolex during a tourney, went to his golf bag (to fetch a couple of Ben Franklins) and gave it the guy with an apology!<br>  How many guys would do that? Really?   Phils a classy guy who still awaits the 'good bounces' after experiencing plenty of bad ones in his past.  <br>  Good for you- go Phil.<br>  <br>  That was neat to see him signing hundreds of autographs after last Saturdays round in LA-  Again, a good guy who cares about people.|`|z58NVkOnaa	For a South paw, his swing is nice to watch...I saw a film clip in which, they flipped the clip, to see what it would look like if Phil was a right hander, and strange as it seems, the swing didnt look good.<br>  <br>  I used to be a fan of his...I am more of a Tom Watson fan myself.|`|A1ohtlWsaa	yes hes well cool.Alot of golf players are cool you dont get many jerks like in football.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I am!  I started out liking him cause he's a lefty, like myself, but I've found he's more than that.  I don't mind that he isn't a natural lefty, either.  Out of the three Major champions that were left-handed, NONE of them were natural lefties.<br>  <br>  He's a thinker (sometimes an overthinker) and isn't afraid to try anything on the course.  People say he's fake, but he's one of the few that will actually think about a question, analyze it, and give an intelligent response... there aren't any automatic responses (or cliches, like some top ranked golfers like to use).<br>  <br>  He'll sign autographs till his arm falls off.  The only pro that is more fan-friendly is John Daly.<br>  <br>  He's active in the community, as well.  He takes underpriviledged families out so their kids can go shopping for school supplies and clothes, among other things.

That's why they walk him all the time.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	The way to measure fear from pitchers to hitters is to look at their Intentional Bases on Balls (IBB) numbers. The leaders for the 2008 season are listed as follows:<br>  <br>  Albert Pujols (34)<br>  Carlos Delgado and Prince Fielder (19)<br>  Lance Berkman and Adrian Gonzalez (18)<br>  <br>  Pujols was way ahead by 15 from the nearest sluggers. So for the 2008 season, the most feared hitter in the MLB was Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals.<br>  <br>  The most respected hitter of all time was Barry Bonds, whom holds 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place on the most IBB's per season list. His career total for Intentional Walks was 688 in a 22 season career which puts him on an average of 31 IBB's per season.<br>  <br>  Say whatever you want about him using PED's but he was the greatest hitter to wear a baseball uniform.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	**** the dude who said ryan howard that guy strikes out like 200 times a season...plain and simple ...Albert Pujols is the most feared hitter now in baseball...hits like .330 with 40 homers and 120 rbi's? is that even a question?? come on guys|`|5vXgcAbCaa	He's an up and comer, but I think it's Hanley Ramirez.

The difference between a Manny Ramirez and an Alex Rodriguez is this. Manny never has pressure on him because he dosent care if he gets a hit or not in the big situation. Alex Rodriguez puts the weight of the world on his shoulders when he goes to bat and most of the time he ends up choking. Any good pitcher can get Alexx Rodriguez out if they can spot there best pitch in the perfect location, but if they miss Arod is so talented he'll launch it 430 feet into monument park. But with Manny you can spot your best pitch and there is still a great chance he will still hit it. Albert Pujols is a great hitter to but no one as clutch as Manny. If my life was on the line and the killer said i'll cut you a deal, im going to give the hitter of your choice be tween the 3 1 at bat aginst Johan Santana or Roy Holladay and if he gets a homerun you live and my choices are Arod, Pujols and Manny, in 2 seconds i would pick Manny.

T2UZXarLaa	im going to be honest with you. if youre just starting out you dont need the best board. Get a beginner board from Rossignol or Morrow or Ride...  By the time youre able to use that board to its full potential it will be all dinged and scratched up. Also theres alot more designs for the lower edge boards because theres alot more of them so it will be very easy to pick a cute one if thats a big thing for you. <br>  <br>  Thats my advise but heres the answer to what you asked.  GNU is the company with the best reputation but i would need to know the specs of the board, your height, your weight, what slopes you normally ride, and how much time you spend in the park to be able to advise which to choose...<br>  <br>  Oh and the roxy is the cutest|`|O2CCvf5Jaa	Roxy is for girls who are out there just to be snow bunnies. Not a real snowboard whatsoever. I'm not really sure what boards are good for girls, but i have always had burton boards and i really have no reason to change, burton makes an excellent board.|`|A1Orj1Jqaa	Another good brand that isn't too known is Arbor.  Last year they made a really good all-mountain women's board that was rated highly.|`|5a3bf2514197ad9aaf59ea9c805d8adbaa	Gnu is the best brand of the three you are considering.|`|LIKkt8djaa	For good brands I'd look at.<br>  <br>  GNU<br>  libtech<br>  Omatic<br>  Stepchild<br>  Capita<br>  Neversummer<br>  K2<br>  Forum<br>  Rome<br>  <br>  Avoid pretty much all the brands sold at those big retail stores "D&icks,sports check,sports authority,big 5 ect ect". Pretty much all the brands sold there "Lamar,LTD,Sims,morrow" are low end garbage decks that any boarder planning to go a lot shouldn't bother buying, They'll only end up holding you back.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	i agree with getting a "beater" board for your first board..of your 3 . i would pick roxy to start..they are typically of lower quality (but still decent) compared to higher end boards--mostly Roxy is about the looks so it'll meet your "cute" requirement...i started off on a Kemper years ago and now have a K2 and it is amazing!!!!
MFI0V2GBaa	No, burton is NOT the best company out there. Just because every poser and non-snowboarder in the world knows the brand name, that doesn't make it a good company.  It'd probably be fine for the type of riding you'd be doing, but personally I laugh at anyone on one. Especially girls, being one myself, and riding park, if I see a girl on a burton, or roxy in her matching burton outerwear sitting there, I'm going to think she's a snowbunny, and 99 out of 100 times thats true. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to look like you know nothing about what you're doing, dont get a burton, and don't get a roxy, i wouldn't even consider roxy a snowboard company.<br>  <br>  Out of those boards the GNU is you're best choice. If you want to take other advice, check out rome, best boards out there that I've rode, flexy and great for park I wouldn't go any other brand myself, and you're not going to look like a complete snowbunny out on the hill if you can't ride.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry that all probably sounded rude ,but I'm sick of people sayig Burton is the best, just because it's the first brand they heard of.|`|sWoNU1Tdaa	burton is good, but i have a burton air and am about to get a never summer legacy-r. i do like my burton but i definitely do not think thay they are the automatic best. I find that they are actually not as innovative as other companies such as never summer, lib tech, GNU, and rome. check those out and make sure you get a board that matches what you want to ride, like park, powder, groomers, all mountain, freestyle, etc. do a lot of research and read a lot of reviews, it'll be worth it.|`|AKoitlwSaa	Another brand is Arbor.  Makes really good boards, and not many know about them as they are little talked about even here not many know or talk about their boards.  Have had an Arbor and tried out a couple and they are good.  They also make a really good women's board, Push, which was given great reviews and I know of some friends who loved the board.<br>  <br>  Although not many know about them, they are really good and have great board.<br>  <br>  Also, Burton is pretty good.  Heard good stuff about the GTwin (park) and the feel good-all mountain.|`|T2UZXarLaa	yeah, im also going to add to my other answer since you asked the same question twice that you should watch out for burton groupies... burton is an average to above average company but it is the most advertised so many people who have little idea what theyre talking about will say its the best. unless someone can give you reasons against companies like GNU or Forum theyre just giving their inexperienced opinion. There are many companies out there better than burton|`|WPof1jcxaa	I think Gnu is the best out of the three. I also like K2 and Rome and Stepchild. Burton is over-rated , expensive and not that good. And sorry but none of the links worked :)|`|8lhaxl4Naa	You will get alot of people to tell you burton... Which is somewhat true. But it all depends on what kind of snowboarding you want to do AND what your style is. If your a beginner i would sway away from burton. Where i come from unless your pretty steezy you don't ride a burton. All of the rich poser kids buy Burton's<br>  <br>  I prefer Rome Boards. Hope this helps :]|`|uWBn5HpOaa	burton is the best brand out there for girls. or alibi is a good one too.|`|VBSURuKtaa	GNU, absolutely.|`|gFNCIJsfaa	burton totally, no doubt|`|LIKkt8djaa	For good brands I'd look at.<br>  <br>  GNU<br>  libtech<br>  Omatic<br>  Stepchild<br>  Capita<br>  Neversummer<br>  K2<br>  Forum<br>  Rome<br>  <br>  Avoid pretty much all the brands sold at those big retail stores "D&icks,sports check,sports authority,big 5 ect ect".

a7c58f98182e790dbad3d9b9604f3104aa	its not about swinging it that extra 180, if you think 3 then 180 u wont land it 5.  its all about ATML (approach, takeoff, menuvar, and landing)  (approach) when approaching the jump you want to be carrying a bit of speed not too much to over shoot the jump but just enough to land in the sweet spot past the knuckle of the lading.  when approaching the lip and riding up the lip you want to be on your toe eadge.  a key part of the takeoff is your prewind make sure your knees are bent.  get your shoulders set for the prewind as you go up the lip of the jump. (takeoff) when at the top of the lip make sure you unwind your prewind, pop, and look over your back shoulder( regular: right shoulder, goofy: left shoulder)  then suck up your knees and if you want grab indy.  keep your head turned the entire time looking and trying to spot your landing.  at about 360 or so release your grab and prepare for the landing.  (landing) when you land make sure your knees are bent and your shoulders are square with the landing of the jump.  you need to land with a flat board, and if need be you can transition to an eadge after you have landed.  and just ride away.<br>  as you get better at throwing the 540 you can try different grabs and corking it out.|`|xjS2Hdjbaa	just start spinning and hopefully for you you'll figure it all out before you hit the ground<br>  (tip: landing head first means you've got it wrong)|`|b384db6ad40e335e34a6b836f0c3ea3baa	don't think 3 at all, you need to be thinking 5 from the drop in to the landing otherwise you will probably stop at 3 and stall before trying to finish the last 180 taking it to 5. For a 5, on the takeoff throw your shoulders around just a little harder than you do for the 3. As you are in the air keep spinning past your 3 and look for the landing down between your feet as you are passing the 3. Finish the 180 and put your board down slightly on your toe edge and get your shoulders square down the landing. Stomp it and ride away.

fHJqqMzLaa	The PADI Master Diver program has been around for a real long time.  It was a course when I got my Scuba instructor rating, over 25 years ago.  Since PADI is one of the largest certifying agencies in the world,  I would have to say that the odds of being in the top 100 for the world as the youngest Master Scuba Diver are against you. An Instructor who used to work at our scuba store (<a href="http://www.visibilityunlimited.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.visibilityunlimited.com)</a> actually had the honor of certifying the 10 millionth PADI scuba diver and that was in the year 2000.  If you are in the U.S., you might be among the top 100 in your particular state.  The odds are much better for that.|`|16vMIGPiaa	I'm betting you're a real go-getter!  Ambitious and competitive.  :)<br>  <br>  Top 100...  hard to say.  There are a lot of good divers in the JOW program.<br>  <br>  And - it's not about competition anyway.  As a Master, you'll do well to learn that.  Yeah, the dive geeks that go the Tek route are into deeper, longer, colder, ...  all that stuff.  But as a Master recreational diver, you're about breadth of experience and confidence in the water.  You explore what it is to be really at home in the water, and to be a top-notch dive buddy.  That's all about self-mastery and cooperation; no room for competition there.<br>  <br>  Relax, bud!  You're doing great.  Remember it's about having fun.|`|D19F6m92aa	I don't know.  <br>  I have seen pictures of Jacques Cousteau' sons when they were younger than you.  But you are in good company.

Come game day, only the top players start.<br>  <br>  "Doctor Pine cures all."<br>  <br>  Grades AND demonstrations of leadership factor in to this as well.<br>  <br>  For on the field mistakes and drama, we don't reward the players with exercises to benefit their body or skill sets - they do "log rolls".<br>  <br>  The player lays on the goal line and begins rolling down field.<br>  This is demonstrated during Hell Week with the admonition that needless penalties and careless mistakes will be dealt with in this manner.<br>  15 yard Personal Foul is a 60 yard roll.|`|Med7VQI7aa	Up Downs are good. <br>  <br>  I think a severe one would be "Snakes."

If you think that it might give you a little grief then go for a wide :]|`|viUrA7kXaa	Well, I have a 156 Skate Banana with size 13 feet, i get a bit of toe drag, but my stance is wide and ducked out. Wide boards feel weird for me because you have to lean alot before your edge kicks in...So if u wanna park board you shouldnt get a wide one.|`|T2UZXarLaa	Simple answer: you dont NEED one but i have size 13 feet and i find it alot more comfortible and i dont have toe and heel drag throwing me off. but yeah its not necessary if you dont like wide boards<br>  <br>  if youre not sure id get it wide

T2UZXarLaa	Morrow is a great beginner/intermediate company. my sister owns one of their boards and she loves it for the ability shes at. I have morrow boots myself and theyre the best boots ive ever had.<br>  <br>  Theyre a great company to buy your first board from because theyre cheap and quality for the money. a burton board for the same price will be and absolute crapload.  Stick to a company like this for the beginning and once you get to advance/expert move on to the better/higher class companies.<br>  <br>  my internet isnt great now so i cant see the board through the link but morrow makes good beginner boards so im sure itll be fine|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Go here and compare prices<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h..." rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h...</a><br>  <br>  Email them and let them know what your intentions are. Keep in mind 5150 is a sister company of RIDE snowboards so you will be getting a RIDE board with 5150 graphics. Think about it, with the money you save you can have both your board and bindings for the price of a board alone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps...|`|uWBn5HpOaa	morrow boards are like the World Industries boards for skateboarding. morrow is terrible snowboards, and if you don't know what World Industries is, its like looking at a pile of **** and trying to use it to skateboard.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Honestly, until I saw a few answers on this site I had never heard of Morrow boards.  In all my years of snowboarding, I have never hard Morrow being talked about with the good brands of snowboards.  There are plenty of other good brands of boards out there.|`|LIKkt8djaa	To be honest morrow is a horrible brand. They're oriented towards beginners because of how cheap they are. If you plan to go boarding a lot you'll find it to be limiting your abilities fairly quickly, So really it'll depend on how often you plan to ride. Personally I would avoid them and checkout quality brands like.<br>  <br>  For good brands I'd look at.<br>  <br>  GNU<br>  libtech<br>  Omatic<br>  Stepchild<br>  Capita<br>  Neversummer<br>  K2<br>  Forum<br>  Rome<br>  <br>  Avoid pretty much all the brands sold at those big retail stores "D&icks,sports check,sports authority,big 5 ect ect". Pretty much all the brands sold there "Lamar,LTD,Sims,morrow" are low end garbage decks that any boarder planning to go a lot shouldn't bother buying, They'll only end up holding you back.|`|nRYVWkpEaa	Hmmm.<br>  yeah,  a lot of people on here (well, the same people on mulitple answers) seem to think Morrow boards suck.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you, I had one.   It was the first board I bought and I used it for 3 seasons.  I honestly loved it.  And I used it when I was more into park - obviously it wasn't a park board or w/e, but it did me well.  I was able to ride boxes and rails without trouble.  Mind you I didn't do the really hard stuff at that point, (which I still don't really do, lol) but I could hit an up flat down staircase and pretty much just boxes besides that.  The reason I bought a new board is pretty much because that one was actually a little too big, and I THOUGHT I'd be doing more park (which I actually did less of this year) and because my Morrow board was in fact a beginner board.  Then again, it was a girl's board, I don't know how much of a difference that made, but hey...I loved it!  You will probably want to switch to another board eventually, a higher level board, but like I said, mine lasted for 3 years, probably could've gone more.  Oh, and if you're not a park person, it still worked for me :)  I never had trouble keeping up with anyone, blacks weren't much trouble, so, yeah...it worked well for me:)<br>  hope that helped a little bit.

My first bass was an Ibanez GSR200 Soundgear bass.  It's not a bad bass, it's definitely playable.  Some of the most popular "beginner" bass brands include Squier, Ibanez, Dean, Rogue, and Yamaha.  If you buy these basses new, they're usually between $150 and $250.  If are looking for higher end basses, Ibanez ATK, Fender Made in Mexico Precision, and Fender Made in Mexico Jazz basses are good instruments.  They go for around $300 on the used market, and around $400 new.

D1beU6MPaa	The first thing you need to know is as much about horses as possible. Know breeding aspects, training, how horses run under what conditions.<br>  Get to know the industry, trainers, hot walkers, grooms, etc. Get to know other jockeys an get tips on how they got their start.<br>  Watch your weight. In most countries a jockey can never weigh more than 115 pounds. You have to maintain weight in order to meet weight requirements..<br>  Most jockeys start by working in other aspects of the training process. They hot walk horses (cool them down after training) grooming and participate in exercising duties long before they actually become a jockey. They get to know the profession and decide if this is the career they want to have.<br>  You need to go to Jockey School such as Frank Garza Jockey School in Southern California. There are also jockey schools like Chris McCarons in Kentucky..<br>  Going to jockey school is not required, but if you are not Grandfathered into <br>  it, it is a big plus. If you can already ride and can pass the test by the <br>  stewards, it is not necessary.<br>  <br>  You start by running schooling races. These are races that help you get familiarized with racing and track facilities, and prepare you to become a jockey. Often this is required before you can obtain a jockey license.<br>  You must have a license in order to be a jockey. Most racetracks provide applications and the license is good for any racetrack within a given area. Recommendation from a trainer to jockey school is a huge plus. <br>  <br>  Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. (The winning owner in most states receives 60% of the total purse.) The second place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the second place purse money. (The second place owner receives 20% of the total purse in most states.) The third place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the third place purse money. (The third place owner receives 15% of the total purse in most states.) The most successful jockeys can earn over a million dollars a year. The least successful will make less the $20,000 per year. The record for purse earnings in one year by a jockey is $23,354,960.00* set by Jerry Bailey in 2003. *These are the earnings of the horses, not the jockey. As a rule of thumb, a jockey' s real earnings are approximately 7% of the horses' earnings.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|PwZZJh1taa	there are about 97 jockeys @ tampa bay downs you may want to consider a place with less competition until you are deemed worthy to ride were you want, that is once you have become licensed. <br>  go to the track closest to you and try getting a job with an outfit that stays in florida all year round. you might want to consider hot walking, grooming etc until getting a shot at getting on a racehorse, this way you will learn more about the horse and the horse racing business, this will not however be an overnight thing, but if you are serious, you will meet someone that will get you there, other than that there is probably the greatest jockey school in puerto rico, google it up get yourself enrolled and graduate and go back to the tracks near you and approach a jockey agent <br>   and let them know you graduated from the jock school in PR. <br>  call the track and ask them to mail you a condition book, all the jockey agents are listed in it with phone numbers|`|JN6RS4vdaa	No track in Florida is going to even consider giving you a license.  Your best bet is to go to Ocala and learn to ride at a farm or training center.  Since you have no experience, you have A LOT to learn, from basic skills to gate work.  After you learn more about horses and feel comfortable riding, you could go to the track and get a job as a groom and/or exercise rider.  To actually get your license as a jockey, it will take you years.  At most tracks you have to hold your license as an exercise rider for at least 3 years before the stewards will think about giving you a license.  <br>  The application process for the jockey school in Puerto Rico is extremely difficult.  When I entered school, the maximum you could weigh was 102 pounds because we had to ride with 107.  My class only had 15 people, and because the weight is so difficult to make, only 12 were able to graduate.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HJA4bgWtaa	Lose weight and get a job at the track as a hotwalker.

ajkMt6gRaa	don't let someone tell you that you can walk on.  You will have to compete at a level equal to or better than the scholarship players.  The best approach is to work on your game and to win tournaments ( at various times of the year ).  Do not just play four months in school or take a week off here or there.  <br>  <br>  Write the coach at the school you wish to attend and ask him to look at your scores ... or mail him paper clippings of your tournament wins.  Be sure to make your JOB finishing this pursuit.  If you do not committ yourself to dropping your scores in the next 3 months you will lose ground against kids that are already better.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Best thing you can do is contact the coach of the school you'd like to play for.  Tell the coach how hard you are working to become more consistent with 'playing for the team' your ultimate goal.  Put in the hours of practice and show the coach you mean business.  If things don't work out (during try-outs) you should then think about having the 'practice team' discussion in which you can ask to 'work-out' and practice with the team ONLY.  (However, this may prove to be your 'ticket' as you will be given a good dose of reality as to how good you'll need to shoot in order to play competetively at the college level.)|`|D2UZHpp9aa	Yes absolutely you can walk on. If you get into the school otherwise, talk to the athletic directer and coach. They can get you on the team. On the other hand if you can get that handicap down to a 5 or 6 you will get recruited to most DII schools, and all DIII schools. So if you wanna go DI, first get into the school, next talk to the athletic director and coach, third keep working on your game and eventually, you'll be playing in events with the team.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
Cl6KbcAGaa	To be blunt, DO NOT upgrade anything on this bike, it will not be worth the money spent to do so. Leave it as it is and RIDE it! Your money will be spent in a couple of years when this one finally calls it quits on you.

WLwTKS3qaa	Who are your other pitchers? If your ace isn't as good as Beckett I would pull this trigger. Ichiro is his own competition when it comes to hits and batting average. He never hit below .300 season average in his career and he is also great when it comes to base stealing ending season with 43 SB aka 3rd in American League. And Josh Hamilton... Should I say more?<br>  <br>  Lot of fans will think of Beckett as question mark. Because he dealt with injury last season and won only 3 of his last 10 starts. But currently, he is having a great spring training such as throwing great fastballs and shutting out innings. He is now fully recovered and ready for another great season.<br>  <br>  In the end, Markakis is well rounded player who can get you decent hits, BA, HR and RBI. But since you have Ichiro, who is god of BA and hits AND Josh Hamilton, god of RBI and HR, I think it is time to upgrade your pitching a little if you didn't draft pitcher in 1st round.

If you can become a scratch player by the time your a freshman in high school, I could see it happening. If your a scratch player as a freshman or sophomore, you'll have colleges all over you trying you to attend their school. That way, you'll get noticed. Play through college, and play well, you could easily get your tour card. By the time you finish high school, try and average under par.

However, some of these guys on tour, depending on the course, conditions, and day, are shooting 7 or 8 under par.|`|z58NVkOnaa	Are you willing to sacrifice many opportunities to enjoy growing up?  pretty much losing your childhood to go after a dream?  <br>  <br>  Do you desire to reduce the enjoyment of the game, turning it into work, rather than playing?<br>  <br>  Nothing is impossible, if you put in the effort, time, disipline & the acceptance to take 1000 bad swings in order to produce one good swing then another 1000 again, the maturity to accept bad luck, then yes...what is there to stop you?|`|49b9f11e44e18077f6f0e62710cda0d0aa	I believe that you can eventually make it.

And I've made a career out of it.

He is a great power hitter, he can hit a lot of pitches out of the park that most batters wouldn't think to swing at. He can run well. And his defense is good. His arm strength is the best in mlb, he can throw out just about anyone. He is not the best power hitter, or best contact hitter, or the fastest.

e3m3rdNYaa	No, even if he did go on trial, his doctor has admitted to supplying him with steroids. In the United States there are certain situation where a Judge can declare you unstable to stand trial. But then again, they are convicting an 11 year old as an adult so there is alot of inconsisency in the law. Plus we don't have a president with the balls to say anything about it. So, yes in the United States, unless you are completely retarded (no offense to anyone) you will stand trial; and though the Constitution says you are innocent until proven guilty, he would have to prove his innocence rather than the other way around.<br>  <br>  But the again OJ way equitted...|`|dcNT65mTaa	I don't look at his career just based on what demons he had in his personal life.

He performed with the best of them. He brought his best every week!

I was a big fan of Benoit watched him back in the WCW as a horseman. But we all know that the ring is a stageman. We're talking about real life. In real life he didn't take care of his body and lost control and murdered his family. I hope they never take it off the record that he murdered his family. And what for, so his family can go to his grave and not feel like they raised a bad son. What he did in the ring doesn't amount to much now because he couldn't keep his life together.|`|XsXWnV3qaa	i dont know either but i really want to see chris honred rather than ignored by the wwe.because i just hate it when the wwe pretends he does not exist,but since everyone that was involved died,we can only wonder, but not confirm...but it just depends if everyone is willing to forgive,but i think right now if the wwe even mentions him they get hell from the media about it..<br>  <br>  im just sayin|`|CQ9oxJXnaa	In the US, if someone knows the difference between right and wrong, they are competent to answer for their crimes.|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	No Chance he killed his family.

rTSwouqXaa	Just concentrate on the fundamentals but try to make a game out of each drill. One example is a game called head-n-chest. It is a accuracy game. The kids get 1pt for hitting their partner in the chest(not physically) and 2pts for hitting their partner in the head(again not physically). This is a good game for when your players are warming up.|`|AA10867275	I love to coach this age.  They want to make you and their parents proud:)  Just line them up on the field, call their name(so they don't all try to go after it), roll or hit them the ball and see how well they stop it.  This helps you determine where they should play.  It will take more than one practice to determine this.  You will have to teach them the bases.  I line mine up on home plate and either run in front of them or have a child that knows the bases run in front and when they touch a base they have to yell out the name; FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, HOME:)  Of course, they are going to want to practice batting.  You can arrange the rest of the players on the field and let the batter run on the third hit or something.  There is so much you can do with this age-just remember to have fun.

Magallon is better than that wack a$$ Carlos Bocanegra, Salcido is better than Bornstein, Pardo is better than Sacha and we know Vela is better than Altidore.

Come on now. You think Altidore is better than Bravo or Vela? Come on now, neither Vela or Altidore are realities yet, you and I know that, so how is Altidore or Vela going to be better than Bravo or Donovan, when Bravo and Donovan are 2 established players who have been around for years. If someone gave me a chance to pick, take 2 out of these, Bravo, Vela, Donovan, or Altidore, I would go with Donovan and Bravo, because I know what they have done before, no one knows what Vela and Altidore have done. Although I would go with Nery Castillo, who is a 6-time Champion. Besides, neither of them 3 (Bravo, Altidore, or Vela) really play, besides Vela who plays a lot as a substitute, on the other hand, Nery Castillo had been playing well until his recent injury. You honestly think Cherundolo is better than Osorio? Come on now Darko. You're talking about someone(Osorio) who became champion and is a starter in the same league Cherundolo has been playing in for years and hasn't moved to a bigger club for a certain reason, he hasn't been good enough. I do think Bradley is better than Torrado, I've seen this guy play ever since he was in Herenveen, and like you know, he's one of the best players from U.S. in my opinion, if not the best along with Donovan. Bocanegra I'll give you, because he's been playing at a top level in Europe for a long time, Magallon hasn't been someone as a star until 2007 when Hugo Sanchez started calling him up. Dempsey and Arce is a real close one, but for the fact that Dempsey has been playing in England and has been quite consistent at times, I'll give it to him, although it is the hardest to decide between. Ochoa VS. Howard is also another very hard one, but due to Tim Howard's recent status with Everton and lately with U.S.A, I will give it to him. I do think Ochoa is a better Goalkeeper overall, but Ochoa hasn't been playing much with Mexico. As for the rest, Marquez VS. Onyewu, no contest, Marquez is better. Salcido VS. Bornstein, no contest, Salcido. Beasley VS. Guardado, very hard, but Guardado is better, and the rest I already gave my opinion on them.<br>  <br>  I think this would be more appropriate:<br>  Howard VS. Ochoa- Howard<br>  Cherundolo VS. Osorio- Osorio<br>  Onyewu VS. Marquez- Marquez<br>  Magallon VS. Bocanegra- Bocanegra<br>  Salcido VS. Bornstein- Salcido<br>  Arce VS. Dempsey- Dempsey<br>  Pardo VS. Kljestan- Pardo<br>  Bradley VS. Torrado- Bradley<br>  Guardado VS. Beasley- Guardado<br>  Castillo VS. Altidore- Castillo<br>  Donovan VS. Vela- Donovan<br>  <br>  I think this is the reality of the Best 11:<br>  <br>  ___________Howard<br>  Osorio, Bocanegra, Marquez, Salcido<br>  ________Pardo___Bradley<br>  Dempsey________________Guardado<br>  ___________.Castillo<br>  ___________Donovan|`|zPCfcDXNaa	are you serious? this is your opinion, not a fact. and seen as your are real biased in the line-up i can put up my own too and say mexico has more talent. altidore plays in the second division, he sucks btw!  so does cherendolo and bradley|`|2P6VDNwSaa	So Mexico raping Brazil's SUB 17 in the World Cup SUB 17 was just a coincidence.|`|AoynQR2Haa	If you constanly have to come here trying to remind everybody that you think your team is better, it means their not...|`|C3RCunFoaa	i guess sub 17 was a fluke, they only won the 2005 WorldCup!|`|eWadjRfpaa	you just got told by pablo.....|`|AA11358486	este wey otra ves!!!!!|`|KmMRHKTNaa	u have absolutely no point at all....<br>  Tell me this simple question it wont be that hard.

Bravo is way better then altidore and donovan combined!<br>  oh and giovanni dos santos scored with tottenham in the uefa cup... case closed....|`|xmFiyRRNaa	First, I would say Mexico's top two forwards are Nery Castillo and Vela. Definitely not Bravo. And for what reason exactly would you put Altidore above Vela. <br>  <br>  Vela= Scored plenty goals in Arsenal's Carling Cup run.<br>  Plays regularly in both the EPL and Champions League, occasionally starts. And is only 19. <br>  Altidore= Scored what, maybe 4 total goals for Villareal?(descending team) Currently playing where? Xerez? I thought they only did photo copies, didn't know they ran a team in Spain.<br>  <br>  True, your boy Donovan is doing well at the time and that's OK. Over 20 million people play youth football in the U.S. so of course they're going to have talented players and not just those robotic, "efficient" players they're known for. <br>  <br>  I don't really understand why you always feel you need to come to the Mexican section and start something. Are you compensating for something? Has something in your life gone wrong? <br>  If so, let us know. Us Mexicans are very warm and welcoming people who are always willing to help those in need.<br>  Just let us know.<br>  <br>  Also, by your logic, if Giovani has already failed then what does that make of Altidore? They're roughly the same age yet Giovani is actually still playing (and actually scored today in the UEFA Cup) in one of the wealthiest EPL teams around and has already played for the greatest team in the world. While your Altidore is currently bench warming at Xerez?<br>  YOU FAIL!

Last year around this time we were on our way to a 22 game winning streak. Now we are on a 6 game. It's because due to McGrady's injury and Alston being traded we have better ball movement. I believe that the Rockets can do it. Earlier this season I had my doubts because we were losing to the 'easy' teams or the teams were supposed to win against. But ever since the trade we've been doing good, and I have more confident in them. I'm proud of the Rockets, and this is a first since the 22 game winning streak. I think if they get out the first round this year I will throw a neighborhood party and invite all my friends. LOL. That's how proud I am. <br>  <br>  GO ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Pffft!

8MUj24s6aa	Well 9mm and .40s&w are calibers. Both calibers are used in guns from big to small and anything in the middle.<br>  <br>  The bigger caliber is the .40sw. <br>  <br>  My question to you is what info do you want. Info on buying a gun, the different types of guns, uses, etc. If we knew more of what you want we can definitely point you in the right direction.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	The .40-caliber is the bigger bullet.  The 9mm Parabellum (most common 9) has a bullet diameter of .355" to .357".|`|LWzrCu5caa	the 9 mm bullet is 0.356 inches.  So the 40 caliber,  which is 0.4005 inches,  is bigger.   <br>  <br>  The case is also larger on the 40 caliber and hold more power.<br>  <br>  The 40 caliber is more like the 45 ACP in stopping power than the 9 mm.  <br>  <br>  The military went to the 9 mm due to a NATO treaty designed to standardize ammo.  The Army,  Navy and Marines held onto the 45 ACP as long as they could before going to the 9 mm.<br>  <br>  The police,  copying the military,  switched to high capacity 9 mm.  They found out very quickly that like the old 38 before,  it had little stopping power.  One attempt to solve the problem was the double tap.  A better attempt to solve the problem was many police departments went to the 45 ACP or the 40 Caliber.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line,  if you are doing research on buying a gun,  forget the 9 mm.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	The 40 S&W (no period in front of the caliber is needed) has an interesting developmental history. About a quarter century ago, the 10 mm Auto was developed, mostly to assuage Jeff Cooper. The FBI bought a bunch, discovered their agents couldn't generally handle the full-power loads, and contracted for a lighter loading. The folks at S&W duplicated the FBI load in the same case, cut shorter (sort of the reverse of what they'd done to develop the 357 and 44 Magnums).<br>  Rather than surfing sites, you'll do better to buy old-fashioned paper. Barnes' "Cartridges of the World" and a couple of handloading manuals will give you all sorts of information on cartridges.|`|RjUWPz5daa	This is a great website, full of good info. Even for a beginner.|`|HhECyibGaa	a .40 is a 10mm bullet.  The 10mm cartridge is just longer and more powerful than the .40sw.<br>  <br>  Try looking at gunbroker.com for all types of guns.  You can get some ideas as to types and prices there.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	A different way to answer.<br>  Bullets are sized by grains. 9mm can be 100 to 147 or so and my own 40 caliber is loaded with 180 grain bullets. My 45 is 235g. You get the idea.40 is definitely bigger but not significantly so.|`|5OsHrulJaa	.40 IS BIGGER IS BETWEEN 9MM AND .45 FOR MY POINT OF VIEW THE PERFECT BALANCE CALIBER STRENGTH WITH ACCURACY|`|9NcOBG8Laa	<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2318074275_fbf413e1fc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2164/2318...</a><br>  <br>  9mm is smaller than .40|`|VzxWweU0aa	just google both and research them.|`|Y96SnYL3aa	i would have to say .40 because have u seen a 9mm
VA0sTrbFaa	He is a horrible person and a horrible role model for his younger team mates. Tigers should have booted him out of the team many years ago and that way more of their young players could have become better without a big creep yelling at them and putting them of their game. He is a big mummy's boy obviously.|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	It's not like his 'dummy spit' was uncalled for, maxwell forced him into the ground by pushing him in the back. Richo is a passionate footy player, you expect these sorts of things from guys like him.|`|fe2972a6d01c24558121148ce762b7dbaa	Thought he had matured last year but, last night he was back to the whinger I have always thought he was.|`|VLCUDZlcaa	Coz he is Richo and hes is allowed to ...

Giving Richo a role up the ground and letting him get his own ball is the best thing that could have happened to him and the club.<br>  <br>  PS someone who barracks for Collingwood bagging anyone over anything is a bit rich|`|2s244jGgaa	I saw the him & Maxwell incident, and i thought it was a bit weird to see him complain about that too. I mean, hes been in our game for a while now..shouldnt he be used to that kind of treatment from the oppisite team by now?|`|4wRyTY9Raa	I must of watched a different game than you last night, never seen him do it once, he had a go at the umpire at one stage but that was it. Most forwards do it, Fevola is one of the best.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Actually I have to agree with you on this one...he does pay out on his team mates when they dont pass to him all the time.<br>  <br>  One thing I have picked up is that when things are going really badly for him he does a hamstring or injury of some sort...almost as if later on everyone can say 'Poor Richo, injured again but he kicked a couple beforehand so he is still a champ'.<br>  <br>  ONE person is not a team...its called a team for a reason and no single player should try to (or think they are) above the team.<br>  <br>  Then again he is getting old and is probably in the  twilight of his career so if he wants to act like a sooky lala then we wont have to put up with it for much longer.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	lol richo spit the dummy at maxwell for a tackle, its a tackle deal with it.|`|M2hrodq5aa	yaa he does it all the time<br>  <br>  him and fev<br>  i dont understand why he's a favourite at tigerland|`|lkA2L59Gaa	it's good to let anger out sometimes, rather then holding it in =]
nRBC4E5saa	Since you've just started, I'm not going to try to relay any submissions.  This is best left for your instructor.  However, when you're first starting out you want to survive as long as possible and keep from getting passed.  Two of the best things you can do are to control your opponent's hands, usually through the use of his or her sleeves, and control his or her posture, which can be done by grabbing the lapel.  When you're on the bottom you need to control the hands of your opponent so that they can't control your hips, head, or shoulders.  Keeping their posture broken down also keeps them from aligning their spine, which makes everything they do, harder.  I'd suggest just working on that for right now.  You're only two classes into it, you're still just learning the basics.  Just try to make those basics really good.  When you can keep from being passed, then you can move on to submissions and tap the guy whenever you'd like.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	arm bar would be a good spot to start at|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	a lot of things you can do from your guard!<br>  <br>  1)Arm bar submissions-push his ahead away and grab the cross arm<br>  2)You can go for a sweep<br>  3)If he postures up, bait him into a Kimura lock<br>  4)If he postures up, scoot your hips back and go for a guilottine choke<br>  5)Shift your hips to one side of his body and go for an oomaplata<br>  <br>  These are just some examples|`|CdAE4nXcaa	the guard is the best place to have someone when you are in bottom there are a ton of submissions, sweeps, ect.  if your in a gym your instructor will teach you but it's not something you learn over night it takes years and years to master BJJ.
mMFJrPbvaa	Ocala National Forest...its only about an hour from you depending where in Orlando you live.  You can hike in a good 10-15 miles and not see a single person.  There are primitive sites on lakeside or there are sites just in the middle of the woods, just pitch your tent and you`ll be set.  If you do run into ppl they are usually just day hikers out with their dog but they tend to not venture too far from the cars.  But yea Ocala national Forest is the closest thing to you within 3 hours, I`d say Ocala and Everglades are the top choices in Florida...everglades being a ways south of you.|`|8b5d578eb528c7c65931b1cc9f827d2aaa	Peace river!!!

The fact that you also have a desire to be close to emergency help means you lack the medical and survival skills to go "Man v. Wild." <br>  <br>  Stick to an established trail system and get some training on trip planning and proper equipment use before you plan on going into super-survival mode.

fKlZdoPHaa	Michael Jordan has stakes in the Bobcats. He runs the show there.<br>  <br>  Jay-Z has stakes in the Nets, and could be instrumental in bringing Lebron James to the Nets. <br>  <br>  Magic Johnson has stakes in the Lakers.<br>  <br>  Edit: A stake holder is an owner. That is something you obviously did not know out of ignorance. Next time, ask a question properly, or don't ask at all. <br>  <br>  MJ both runs the show, and makes big bucks. He doesn't dance around for our entertainment there. Learn the definition of stake holders, and do your research.<br>  <br>  Edit: You are wrong again. If you are done with your delusional victory dance, understand that Jordan owns part of the Bobcats, and runs the basketball operation. A corporation doesn't have to be publicly traded for the stake holder to exercise influence. For example, if you own part of a private coffee shop, you are considered part owner, regardless of the status of your shop as either private or public. <br>  <br>   You are confusing stake holder with share holder. All share holders are stake holders, but not all stake holders are share holders. Your question says, do they run the team, not just dance. I told you, yes, they run the team, and gave you an example. Formulate your questions better. your victory claim shows your sign of trying to avoid further dialogue to mask your ignorance.<br>  <br>  yes, stake holders range from janitors to owners. saying shares would be wrong, because we don't know what kind of ownership those guys have in the organization, compared with a public company, where the filings make it easier.|`|tLuTy0gIaa	because many of the teams have been passed down for generations, and the white people had the money. now many black people have money so you may see it soon. to the guy above me, he is right you kind of avoided the question.|`|JJV3L4R4aa	cuz there not wealthy...white ppl r wealthy blacks r rich.......shaq is rich,  the white guy who signs his check is wealthy|`|fZ38PPgSaa	becuz they are not white|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Dunno really lmao

TE4W3k8Xaa	This had better be super for that price! yes it is ,actually.The light action is the key feature of this combo,allowing you to feel the slightest pickup of the bait,and also allows a slow easy tip action to cast very small and lightweight lures that trout find so appealing.You could shop around and find a comparable setup with close to the same,if not the identical specifications as this one.The reel is known as ulltralight,and I would use the lowest weight line rating,to gain distance on the casts@2lb.Just be careful where you use it,if there are big fish there they will snap the line more easily,but you have a trade off here,you want to be able to cast to distant fish,but once you hook them you don't want to lose them to the very weak and thin line that got them to break...there is usually a weight limit of the lure it will comfortably work with,ok( I would use it on small streams)like 1/4 oz. or some other rating.This isn't something that you would take to a large river or lake,because the fish would snap off too easily.I have several of this type and they are alot of fun to use.I didn't pay that much for mine though,I bought them at clearence sales and saved a bundle.See if you can find a less expensive version with the same attributes,and stock up on the specialized lures and baits you will need for this combo to work well for you.|`|AA11016927	Any Shimano combo in that price range would be excellent for any type of fishing. Although, in my opinion you may want to get a longer rod....... <br>  <br>  If your new to fishing you may want to investigate a cheaper combo so you have extra funds for lures and terminal tackle. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
vJyF8siJaa	Yes, we have the best record. Lakers also won 2 games againsts the cavs and celts. yes we lost to the magic 2 times but we're still one of the top contenders in the league.|`|uY9Pef3jaa	Of course, they have too many tools on the offensive ends and play great defense. They beat a bunch of tough teams on the other end including Boston, and ended Cleveland's 21 game homestreak. I think they deserve the name of "best" in the league as of right now. and on top of that they have argueably the best player in the league.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	umm yeah you are right sh!t, why didn't i think of that. your theory is so correct. they only beat the Celtics and Cavs, which Orlando has done too right? yeah, oh and didn't Orlando lose to New Orleans by like 30 or something a couple of weeks ago. we beat the Hornets 3-1 to take the season series. Let's see the only loses that we got beat by bad teams, Sacramento, sure at their house, and by the way they are long time rivals, since the cow bells. we lost to charlotte, they played a good game, and we didn't. we also lost to Indiana, who got a lucky tip in. In miami we lost by a point, then the same thing in Orlando, and San Antonio, and our worst lose was only 12 points. But you are right, all those sorry teams we lost to shouldn't make us the best team in the league. didn't Boston lose to G.S. and the Clippers? everyone has their bad games you sorry sh!t|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Yes, LAL winning next 5 games after Suns game I meant  and NBA title<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  After SUns|`|5CqgX5V3aa	Yes they absolutely are that good.

They nned to do a lot more, den what they r doin to be considered that.|`|P5rfNdFEaa	Yes they are the best team.  They are not in full capacity and still have the best record.

Y4mz8BShaa	Well, since all Crosman AEG's are...terrible, to put it nicely, I'll go with the CyberGun's poor quality S&W. It's a spring pistol, and not very good, but at least it won't kill itself. You actually have to abuse it to cause it to stop working.|`|hRq8gMuQaa	eh, well. I would prefer neither but if that's where your mind is set too. Look to see which has better fps and which has better accuracy. Usually that stuffs listed on the back of the box or whatever. I would prefer one of the shotguns that are sold on the Crosman website though.|`|Y96SnYL3aa	saw is heavy <br>  <br>  p90 isnt <br>  <br>  for a airsoft war id go with the p90<br>  <br>  to show off the saw|`|GNiSOzcraa	neither try airsplat.com UTG M324S Master Sniper Airsoft Rifle  <br>    Price:  $84.95
GbyHQQLiaa	Well basically a centre forward is an attacker, you may have guessed that. They are the ones that do most of the shooting and finishing. Basically it's your job to score goals. <br>  <br>  You probably won't have to do much tackling but you will have to make runs as some of the midfielders of other attacker try to set you up to score a goal.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped!
dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	The real question is can you learn to apply your skills successfully to a defensive situation? All martial arts have practical abilities...regardless of the mine is better than yours mentality most schools seem to carry. A good instructor does matter but in the end it is you and the attacker. Who goes home is up to your ability to defend yourself with what you have learned regardless of the system.<br>  <br>  As for the CIA, FBI, etc...they utilize aspects of various martial arts but have training curriculum designed that incorporates defensive tactics rather than a set system. This way they can train their people in tactical fighting that will aide them in their line of work. Most people that work for these agencies do not train in martial arts on a regular basis and the majority of them have very little skill if against a skilled person.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	Well Traditional Tae Kwon Do has a lot of self defense, but it is also good to have some ground work. But personally i would want to go to the ground in a street fight. I don't want to roll around on asphault and possibly another person come up and kick you.<br>  <br>  But law enforcement are taught bits and pieces of martial arts to work for them. Remeber they are not killing someone so they wont be doing a spinning backfist on someone|`|zzkmdusEaa	My best bet would be Ju Jitsu.<br>  <br>  It is a form of martial arts that involves a lot of grappling, which is important, almost key for Law Enforcement when they have to disarm or wrestle perpetraitors to arrest them. You don't turn on cops and see a police officer doing a bunch of kung fu moves to drug dealers, when they have a guy that is resisting they grapple with them and wrestle them to the pavement.<br>  <br>  It also doesn't involve a lot of jumping around and doing back flips so i'm sure it would be manageable in a hallway or street.|`|A4Mm0YNdaa	Most practical for what?  BJJ will help you maul a single opponent, but TKD may be better for fighting multiple opponents.  I believe the CIA is very secretive about their combat programs.  The FBI trains in a form at least partially based on Hapkido (my own art, which I can only recommend as a very versatile and effective art).  The KGB stopped training a long time ago.  The Marines use a program called MCMAP (Marine Corps Martial Arts Program), which is a more or less eclectic style.  Honestly, as far as "Ones you can use in buildings, hallways, cities streets, etc." goes, I can only recommend Hapkido; I'm not familiar enough with other arts to judge their performance in such a wide variety of circumstances.  Hope this was helpful.|`|3fIuH4l8aa	Wow thats a tough one.<br>  <br>  There will be various schools of thought here. The karate specialists will tell you its the best and so will the TKD guys or the MuayThai guys etc etc.<br>  <br>  The police tend to use a combination of common martial arts.<br>  This i think is the best. For example. The TKD kicks mixed with Judo Takedowns and muay thai lethal attack patterns.<br>  But you have to remember that these men aim to disarm, restraint and contain a person, not injure or hurt. So their focus is more in that area<br>  I guess the whole idea is what is the Art used for? Self defense, beating up kuds in school or professional fighting etc. <br>  <br>  Each art has its own pros and cons and the best fighter is not the one who practices the best martial art but the one who practices the most.<br>  <br>  Remember what Bruce Lee said... <br>  “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”<br>  <br>  I personally try to mix Judo and Muay Thai. So one can end a fight asap and deliver a lethal blow when needed. Both can be extremely defensive and deadly offensive. Its not easy but one day i'll be that good.|`|6caba2c28a921cd3cfa3a7d483226a41aa	Kenpo Karate.

RK9bJPOmaa	Well for defense i have to go with Steelers. But for Offense i would have to say CARDIANALS!!! Overall is the Cardanials too. lol.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Steelers.  There is a reason why they beat the Cardinals in the super bowl.  Overall the franchise is better than that of the Cardinals, their QB is slightly better, and their defense is better.  The only thing the Cardinals have are better receivers.  You can't be the best in every category but overall the Steelers are better because they are a well coached team.  Also the Steelers seem to keep their players longer than most franchises do which can make a difference.|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, since the Steelers just beat the Cardinals in the Super Bowl, I would guess that means the Steelers are the better team.<br>  It was a close and awesome game, but the Steelers proved they were the best of the rest.|`|MDhI4mBEaa	If you watched the SB then you already know the answer.|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	Honestly: the Pittsburgh Steelers, is the better football team|`|yuGhmhGuaa	If your asking Pittsburgh plus the officials, then of course the Steelers|`|AA10867564	steelers by nearly every stat or comparison point you can imagine. <br>  <br>  however, the cards did make the steelers sweat in the superbowl because of warner's ability to read the blitz. after the 2nd quarter int/td by harrison, the steeler's D and O disappeared. without that final fumble/sack, the steelers had a 50/50 chance of losing outright.|`|NNdU2Xutaa	Your New World Champion Steelers no offence cards fans but steelers are the better team on all sides of the football|`|pCsm08njaa	Already proven on the field (at the Super Bowl no less).

XIhahUDHaa	Yea definitely get a rawlings. As for Gold Glove vs. Heart of the Hide vs. Pro Preferred, it all depends on how seriously you play, but I can tell you for a fact that Pro Preferreds are quite noticebly better. I've had mine for around 2 and a half years of summer travel ball and HS ball, and its kept its shape and is only now starting to get slightly stiff, but it's still a great glove. Of course it really all depends on how much you wanna pay, but if you're serious and can afford it, go for the pro preferred. <br>  <br>  I dont't know exactly what the model you mentioned is, but Rawlings makes it clear as to whether you're getting an infield or outfield or pitcher/IF glove, so i'll just assume that it is an infield glove. 11.25 inches or 11.5 is perfect, any bigger and it's harder to get the ball out of your glove quickly like you need to at second or short. Those are my positions btw. Anyway good luck, nice choice.|`|aBJGIhjNaa	your best bet for gloves are raulings(cant spell) , mazuno. and thats it all others are not as good. also gloves are separated into different groups, outfield- long with leather net thats flexible so it hugs the ball when caught, catcher- round and heavily padded for high velocity catching. infield- a standard glove. light for quick hand movement and medium padded for line drives. and pitcher same as infield except there is only one finger hole on the back side of palm(not sure why) and really are not meant for fielding. also make sure the glove is flexible but sturdy i have found that gold gloves rip and fray very very quick.<br>  hope i could help|`|5pK4LjMfaa	yeah i believe rawlings gloves are some of the top gloves on the market
