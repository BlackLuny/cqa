VHlXFcUwaa	yep first answer <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080928093002AAuGPQ7&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> Help ?|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	It's kinda hard to explain, but it basically means to keep your elbows tight, and to not bend them.|`|uGgDUzoCaa	to straighten out your elbows to the point where they can't be straightened any more. thats it pretty much
VM3Ziubzaa	OMG! all you need to do is cut one lemon in half and heat them up in the microwave for a little bit. Once there warm, you just put them on your elbows. You can do that twice a day or four times a week. Also the same goes for grapefruit. This really helps. My sister was doing this all the time. The best one yet is using the feet cream, it's really thick and kind of crunchy, you can put that on your elbows. Or one last thing, oatmeal works for dark elbows, dark under eye rings, and stretch marks!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|s0XitgG5aa	an old wives tale is to lean with each elbow in half a lemon for a while, its supposed to bleach them. :) other than that, it may just be natural pigmentation that you won't be able ot change, or you could just try a scrub and moisturiser|`|OwxT3oTCaa	I had dark elbows usaually you have to scrub them with hot water and soap:]|`|Xw5A7ObVaa	There are a lot of skin lightening creams around, but I don't really know how safe they are (Could contain bleach etc), I bought one made by Daggett and Ramsdell from an Afro-Caribbean beauty supply shop but haven't used it yet - it's supposed to be good though.
mfTHJFNraa	Don't worry, the gap will fill in quickly because your permanent cuspid is waiting to come in.  With orthodontics, it will fill in even more quickly!|`|9f7292c3270df51eb281378313276e5daa	What can you do?  You wait for it to fall out, everybody has to go through the same thing.
cRKWuWC8aa	Fear is to be scared of the unknown, and it will only limit your opportunities .<br>  <br>  What is it to be afraid of ?<br>  Fear is what me make it, and it is all in our head .<br>  We're all already dying - every single person and animal on this planet are - because as soon as you're born, you start dying .<br>  Death is inevitable, a thing we all have to come, and you can not avoid the inevitable .<br>  <br>  You'll have to adjust your perspectiv of death, it is not evil, just unavoidable .<br>  <br>  People who fear death usually has something undone or something they regret/have to fix .<br>  <br>  If you are one of those, I suggest you fix that .|`|8juzFrSwaa	i think everyone is a bit scared of death, you just have to realize everyone will die, eventually..its the circle of life :) your born, you live, then you die. you just have to live your life. maybe doing sumthing for your community/people with special needs/animals might help you, like when god or whoever chooses to take your life away you know you have atleast done sumthing "living for" something that'll change the lives of others, ya know? :)<br>  i hope that helps, i know it helped for me:)|`|ZNbauLJzaa	It's gonna happen to us all at one time or another.  Because it is an obsession which is interfering with your life, you need to work on this with a psychologist or other mental health professional.  If you are religious talk to your pastor/priest/rabbi about this.|`|Xy9YbCo5aa	I can totally sympathize with your situation, as my brother is terrified of death too. I think it may help if you clarify the concepts for yourself.<br>  <br>  First, are you religious, or spiritual? If so, then you probably know (or believe) that the spirit inside never dies, and we are all merely manifestations of that one True Spirit. So there really is not death, just transformation.<br>  <br>  If you are not religious or spiritual, and you don't believe in an afterlife, perhaps - as someone else mentioned - there are things you want to do that you have not done, or things you wish you had said to certain people. If that's the case, make a plan to do those things that you want to do, and reach out to those people that you need to say things to, so if something does happen, you will be at ease.<br>  <br>  If you are torn between believing and not, I would suggest doing some research, and reading about the beliefs of different religions, or spritual traditions, and see if any of them "speak" to you inside. <br>  <br>  I myself find much comfort in the Buddhist teachings. There is no death, and no hell, merely transformation. You might pick up some of the books by the Dali Lama - they are excellent.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I will keep you in my prayers. Namaste'.|`|5yuZwOLQaa	You need to view death as a natural process.  Most folks live to be quite old.  Live each day to its fullest and don't worry about things that you cannot change.  God bless you.|`|a3d9a55c23e62b2329a91e310c787b30aa	You need a different kind of doctor.  You are wasting your life worrying about a future event that no one can predict.|`|ZQjw9G6Oaa	well go bungi jumping or ski divin by the time you land the faer will be gone|`|qnPFY5Ejaa	You are not alone, there are many others out there that feel the same way. I also have a fear of death, I don't want to die and wish that we could all live forever! It was also interfering with my life on a daily basis and I hid it from everybody, and I still do. I have come to terms with our own mortality, and have decided that it is not going to ruin my life while I'm alive, although I still won't go on airplanes or scary carnival rides. Live for today, and not worry about tomorrow. My sister works as a care-aid in a retirement home and I asked her how she could work around people that are terminally ill or dieing due to old age  (because I can't be around that), and she told me that some of those people have told her that they are done with life...and they want to go. That kind of helped me, because when I'm 100 years old and ill, I may want to go too. <br>  <br>  If you look on the Internet, look up "fear of death or dieing" and you will find resources to help you further. Try to relax and live life day by day. I hope this helps.|`|e38a027b2d72b62c6f6219b312113f5aaa	Aw, everyone fears death to a certain extent. <br>  <br>  Whenever you think about, maybe try distract yourself and occupy yourself with some useful activity. Diseases exist but in this modern world and with so many technological and medical advances, almost anything can be cured, so rest assured. And of course, don't go to the extent of doing palm reading or anything silly like that (if you ever considered doing it).<br>  <br>  Main advice, distract yourself. All the best. |`|XqfH76PMaa	I think you may need counseling.  I know people who have had similar problems and one was actually diagnosed with OCD.  You need to talk this out with a professional.  They can help you overcome the fear.  It isn't anything to be embarrassed about or anything and it can be helped.  For your sake, seek help and do not let this take over your life.  Good luck!|`|gBlpGCsKaa	Fearing for life is natural among every humanbeing.<br>  <br>  Life will die.<br>  <br>  Only worry about what you can control|`|IvIatEg3aa	When I was six, I had an insane fear of death. Eventually I grew out of it, maybe you will too.|`|1ciXpUfcaa	It's better than being scared of life! I would talk to somebody about this.|`|bPga6QYSaa	Everyone is scared of death! has someone that you loved or know recently died? that could  be one reason!|`|WFZW9Crnaa	IT'S LIFE!<br>  You just dont wanna die.<br>  BTW im black|`|RtEfx9P5aa	Leah,<br>  <br>  Fear of death is the most widespread phobia of our time.  It is<br>  so widespread that it has become a discipline-the study of death<br>  anxiety-producting a substantial amount of literature on the subject<br>  in the past 4 decades.<br>  <br>  You are being treated by a professional and you say he/she is <br>  helping.

You should try to be in peace with yourself and instead of waisting time worried about dying you should be enjoying life.<br>  <br>  You only live once and it's a waste to live scared!<br>  |`|TTYO0tp7aa	Get to know Jesus. Read your Holy Bible. Get the NIV version or living bible version which will be more understandable. When you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior...He died on the cross for your sins so that you may live forever...You are promised to be with God in heaven when you die. In heaven, you will feel no pain, no hurt, no fear. Heaven is perfect and your God in heaven wants you to choose Him with your freewill. When you get closer to God, you will be much more comfortable. "Worry for nothing" ..so says God.|`|LUXL1Sdoaa	OK,1st I am NOT psycho!But anyway,I look forward to it in a way.To me it just means I get to see all of the loved ones I've lost.Either way,have you thought that God makes us die for a reason?He has our life worked out before we are born.Just shake it off and have fun!|`|wVzLR60Jaa	Its probably not so much a fear of death and more an anxiety/ocd thing. Go to a psychiatrist.|`|2cmgH6mjaa	im scared of death too :-(
PwgoRJfTaa	I'm 5'8" also and I'm a girl, so 5'8" for a guy seems short to me.  But I thinks its average for guys overall. <br>  <br>  Everyones different on when they stop growing.  My brother grew a couple of inches in his late teens/early twenties.  So yes you can possibly still grow some more.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I heard that males continue to grow until around 21.  Anyway you go at it, you are average.  You are about the same height as my husband!|`|VCQ2h4EHaa	average i say|`|kKLApZCiaa	Average I guess. Asian people are usually short! lol. You might not grow any more...|`|FU5sZqVVaa	You sound average.
YE3hSY8Maa	Mutation of cells!|`|4CMx1uzXaa	omg- I am doing Oncology at university at the moment. <br>  Cancer is the condition which is caused by cell mutation. Cells grow in an abnormal way. Under a microscope malignant cancer cells are joined together but some cells are not attached- they look kind of opaque- if thats the word. Benign cells are always clumped tightly together. |`|XqfH76PMaa	Cancer (medical term: malignant neoplasm) is a class of diseases in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits), invasion (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).|`|AA10838385	a global danger.
d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	There are over 200 different types of cancer and just as many subtypes . . you can begin reading about them at the American Society of Clinical Oncologist site:<br>  <br>  Cancer.net<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.net/portal/site/patient" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.net/portal/site/patien...</a><br>  <br>  The American Cancer society<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index...</a><br>  <br>  Cancerbackup<br>  <a href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Home" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Home</a><br>  <br>  |`|DZJeyCu2aa	KAPOSI SARCOMA <br>  is a cancer developing certain types of cancer because their body's natural defences have been weakened. Prior to the AIDS epidemic in the 1990's Kaposi's sarcoma was a relatively rare disease usually seen only in older men or people who had organ transplants, however, increasing incidence of the disease has been associated with the spread of AIDS. KAPOSI SARCOMA is a cancer that arises in the cells below the skin or in the mucous membrane lining of the mouth, nose, and anus. Lymphomas (Hodgkin's disease and particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) can also be aids-related, these are cancers of the lymphatic system (part of the immune system). Many chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer can suppress the immune system. Treatment for cancer in people with AIDS may need to be modified since AIDS has already weakened their immune system. <br>  PARATHYROID CANCER<br>  The parathyroid gland is located at the base of the neck near the thyroid gland. It produces a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which controls how the body stores and uses calcium. Parathyroid cancer is a condition where the cells of the parathyroid gland become malignant (cancerous). Parathyroid cancers are rare; while problems with the parathyroid gland are common, these are not usually cancer related<br>  NON MELANOMA SKIN CANCER<br>  Basal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, it occurs when basal cells (round cells found in the outer layer of skin) become cancerous. The second most common type of skin cancer is Squamous Cell Carcinoma, this is where squamous cells (the flat, scaly cells on the surface of the skin) become malignant . Cure rates are very high for both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. In addition there are a number of other, less common cancers starting in the skin including Merkel cell tumours and cutaneous lymphomas and sarcomas<br>  BLADDER CANCER<br>  Bladder cancer is a disease in which malignant cells arise in the bladder. Symptoms can include blood in the urine, pain during urination, increased frequency of passing urine, or feeling the need to urinate but with nothing coming out. The bulk of bladder cancers are histlogically classed as transitional cell carcinomas which arise in the uroepithelium (lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas. Treatment will depend on how far the tumour has invaded the surrounding tissues, and if it has spread to other parts of the body. World-wide about 260,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year. <br>  CANCERS OF THE COLON, RECTUM AND ANUS<br>  Colorectal cancer (or bowel cancer) is one of the most common types of cancer in both men and women. Approximately four fifths of these cancers are found in the colon (large intestine), and one fifth in the rectum. Prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer is important. Some of most common symptoms include a change in bowel habit (eg. constipation, and bleeding), mucus discharge, and discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen. The vast majority of colon and rectum cancers are adenocarcinomas, around 10% of these are mucinous (protein contained in mucus). <br>  BREAST CANCER<br>  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, the risk of breast cancer increases with age, it is most common after the age of 50. Each breast has 15- 20 sections (lobes), each of which has many smaller sections (lobules). The lobes and lobules are connected by thin tubes (ducts). The most frequent type of breast cancer is that starting in the ducts (ductal cancer), other types include cancer beginning in the lobes or lobules (lobular carcinoma), less common is Inflammatory breast cancer which causes the breast to be red, and swollen. <br>  CERVICAL CANCER<br>  Cervical cancer is a common type of malignancy accounting for about 6% of all cancers found in women. It is a disease in which cancerous cells develop in the uterine cervix (this is the connecting passage between the uterus and vagina). The human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the principal cause of most cervical cancers. The peak incidence of cervical cancer occurs between the ages of 40 to 55. It is rare before the age of 35, however the incidence of cervical cancer in younger women rose dramatically during the two decades after 1960. Regular Pap smear tests may detect abnormal changes in the cervical tissues, before cancer develops. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include vaginal bleeding after intercourse or bleeding between periods. However, in the early stages of the disease there are often no obvious signs or symptoms, so regular smear tests are important. <br>  LEUKAEMIA<br>  Leukaemia is the most common cancer of childhood. The body produces lymphocytes to protect the body from infection, in leukaemia these cells do not mature properly and become too numerous in the blood and bone marrow. Leukaemias may be acute or chronic. The most common type is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). There are a number of other less common acute |`|XqfH76PMaa	Go here and look around.

3fdGfZRAaa	I don't think its that you don't trust guys, its just that you haven't had a close relationship with a male figure. It also sounds like maybe you don't have the highest of self-esteems, which might make you find the bad qualities in a guy because in reality, you don't think you are deserving? Maybe I am off but I didn't have a relationship with my father and it took me a long time to "learn" how to have a relationship with guys. I figured they were all like him. I also had to learn to accept the good guys and realize that I was definitely good enough to be in a good relationship. It is a hard place to get to though, you are going to have to work at it, but you sound self aware which is a great start.|`|e0127b4e004c1977c834db9ed5e7b10caa	first of all, it sounds to me like you're a little young and inexperienced. it just sounds that way based on what you're saying here. bottom line is, you're not going to figure it all out. you learn as you go. take your time. don't jump into crap. it's going to take some years to learn some things about people and yourself. i'm 27 now, and i look back to my teenage years and honestly laugh at myself and the "problems" i thought i had. truth be told, i didn't know what problems really were until i did some more growing up. so, just relax, enjoy being young, and let yourself grow up a little. You're way more normal than you think.|`|2hOLFZOzaa	I believe you have figured out where your problem comes from and why you have guy problems.<br>  Instead of 1 to 1 with a guy, try going out with a group until you feel comfortable. You can get to know a guy with the security of other friends.Check around your school, church, community center and let the guy become a friend first.

UDW9ZiLAaa	Wow,it sounds like you and your family need counciling. There is no way that someone can say that you are right or that they are right without hearing both sides. I would strongly suggest that you seek help soon! <br>   I came from an emotionally unstable home. I have dealt with low self esteem and self doubt for years. It is not the way to live. I wish that I had someone to talk to when I was a teenager, but I didn't. I have had to learn the hard way. <br>   Emotional stress and abuse can destroy your life unless you break away from it. YOU LIVE ONCE! Each day that you live in sadness and dispair is a day that you can't make up for, it's gone.<br>   Please understand that this is coming from my heart. I WAS WHERE YOU ARE....<br>   I now work with abused and neglected children. I can't change the world, but by offering help to one person at a time I can help make a difference in their lives. God Bless and Best Wishes :)|`|430326d1cc65e12cad2454a7bedc3c58aa	you need someone to talk to other than your grandparents someone that does not know your situation.  like a teacher, priest, councler, I think foster home might help you get started on a new path.|`|AA10120665	You are at a cross road in your life.  You are in the midst of being a child and on the verge of becoming an adult woman.  Unfortunately, you cannot depend on your parents and frankly I think you are lucky that your grandparents have taken you in.  You have food and shelter and as for the rest you have to prepare yourself for being on your own at 18 and that can only be with education.  Find some career that you would like and concentrate on that.  You may want to become a social worker to help kids like yourself.  You will need your grandparents help and if you approach them as an adult they will be more understanding and helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RJGErtVKaa	i suggest trying to see a therapist.
f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	umm, i lost 40 pounds without a pang of hunger.<br>  <br>  Try eating bigger breakfasts, smaller dinners, more vegetables, and healthy snacks, like homemade trail mixes/ or oat-milk/blueberry smoothies.<br>  <br>  I also added flax seed, ground and sprinkled to about every meal that i prepared at home.<br>  <br>  apples on avg. have 100 calories, and I've never met a person who could vanquish more than 2 in a sitting.  They fill you up like none else.<br>  <br>  try bean burritos too, the beans have fiber, protein, phytochemicals, and a great, rich smooth taste, and any seasonings or veggies I added only contributed to the health profile.<br>  <br>  and if all else fails, snarf a clif bar or another healthy alternative when hunger strikes.  Yeah, they are about 250 calories, but that is much better than spiking blood sugar with non-filling rice-krispies from the vending machine or something.  And they are very filling.<br>  <br>  honestly, the weight flew off behind my back, and one day I realized was thin!|`|eitqO5Rmaa	If you're worried because you're constantly craving food, just keep a lot of healthy snacks on hand! Try:<br>  <br>  Nature Valley bars<br>  Applesauce (if you don't like applesauce (I don't), try<br>  heating it up<br>  mixing it with chocolate pudding<br>  freezing it<br>  mixing it with peanut butter<br>  spreading it on an English Muffin & toasting it<br>  Jello or Jello Pudding<br>  Gerber's Graduates (who says it's just for toddlers?)<br>  Strawberry Yogurt Bursts<br>  Banana Finger Foods<br>  Fruit Bites<br>  Fiber One bars<br>  Oatmeal<br>  Yoplait Whips Yogurt (I love Whips--it's spongy!)<br>  Carrots + Kraft Fat Free French Dressing<br>  Apples / grapes / peaches / bananas<br>  PB & J whole wheat tortilla<br>  <br>  ...the hint is eating something with a lot of grain (ignore those carb-free diets--seriously, they're bad for you). The more whole wheat and granola and stuff, the more full you'll be! Try Quaker's Simple Harvest oatmeal, Fiber One's Apple Streusel bars, Nature Valley's Almond Crunch bars, and Misión's whole wheat tortillas.<br>  <br>  By the way, you know those rumors floating around that eating at night will promote weight gain? Not true. IN THE SLIGHTEST. It doesn't matter when you eat, just what and how much...so don't worry about having midnight snacks! ...as long as they're not horribly bad for you. (: The stuff above is healthy, so chow down!
ito0aUM1aa	How long did you have the filling? Is it metal or Composite filling? Fillings should be checked regularly that's why u need to have xrays taken to find out if there are leakages in your fillings. Metal or amalgm filling will expand as it ages, creating leakages between the tooth surface and the filling itself. Sometimes you will experience sensitivity. Composite  fillings tend to shrink as it ages, creating a leakage on the margins of the filling. <br>  <br>  When there is leakage in your filling, food debris will get stucked inside causing weird taste and bad smell, Sometimes leakage is so small that you can't notice it.<br>  <br>  Consult your dentist.|`|lfZnnEKaaa	You can develop a cavity beside a filling in your tooth.  Your filling can become loose, not so much that you can fill it but loose enough so that food gets pushed down in there and will decay, causing a tooth ache.  Go see your dentist.  They can look at it, probably take an x-ray, and tell you whats, going on.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11629921	Leakage under the filling.  Happens all the time.  You probably have rotten stuff under the filling that can cause pain and will keep getting bigger.  An xray would show this.  Go to a dentist before you end up having to get a root canal and crown.  Those get expensive.  Better to take care of it while it just needs another filling.

2huxaqdKaa	There actually may be something to the idea. There's a significant theory that most people are gay because they don't get the proper amount of the right hormones in the womb and so they don't completely masculanize or over masculanize a bit. This can be corroborated with the fact that gay men's brains look like female brains and vice versa.<br>  <br>  So you may have gotten a dash extra male hormones when developing, so you're kinda stuck in the middle.<br>  <br>  A way of checking how much male hormones you got in the womb is measure the length of your ring finger and index finger from the bottom line that attaches to your palm. Most women have about equal length but most guys have a longer ring finger and so do particularly "manly" women for lack of a better term. E. g. they tested an entire female rugby team and they all had longer indexes.<br>  <br>  It's just speculation though, maybe there's another explanation. Ether way, good luck, hope you figure things out.|`|FsYUBf6faa	i'm not organised, i'm messy but i like girly things.<br>  <br>  Dear you have nothing to worry about. :)|`|pIvN6TY7aa	  In the uterus, we all start out female, until male hormones start to affect some, about the 3rd month.<br>  <br>   Your "little bump" is your clitoris.

FgPZ8Sl8aa	Smoking marijuana will have little to no effect on your child. <br>  <br>  I support marijuana and it's consistency with being a relatively safe and harmless substance for medical, recreational and spiritual purposes.<br>  <br>  But, a fetus is sensitive to all things entering your body.

thf9a3wvaa	Your approach to nutrition is dangerous. <br>  <br>  The high protein intake puts you at serious risk for kidney stones.  <br>  <br>  As proteins are broken down, calcium is one of the by-products.  So much calcium, in fact, that your body does not need all of it.  As such the excess calcium is shunted to your kidneys for removal.  The challenge faced by your kidneys is to eliminate the calcium before it crystallizes and becomes a kidney stone.  <br>  <br>  High protein diets serve to exacerbate this situation.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, your high calorie expenditure will require increased intake, not only to power the workouts, but also to power your new higher "idling metabolism". <br>  <br>  By limiting your caloric intake so stringently, you are asking your body to perform at a higher level but, at the same time, you are not eating enough nutrients to power that higher level.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is this:  lose weight gradually through reduced calorie intake and increased activity. Learn how and especially WHEN to eat!|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	If you eat less than a certain amount of calories per day, your body thinks that it is starving. Even if someone is eating salad and protein shakes, your body's metabolism behaves as if you were living through a famine. That is, your metabolism will slow down, which means when you start eating normally (you can't live off of salads forever), you will gain weight faster.<br>  <br>  Another name for what happens is "yo-yo diet." You lose a lot of weight, start eating normally and gain it all back plus some, lose more weight, gain it back plus some, etc. Eventually, you will be more overweight, and with a very slow metabolism.<br>  <br>  This pretty much says the same thing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_dieting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_dieti...</a><br>  <br>  I have heard great things about the Abs Diet. While it sounds like a scam, it's actually a well balanced diet, intended for people who want to lose fat and gain muscle. I have perused my friend's Abs Diet book, and it holds up to my very skeptical scientific mind.|`|CHQqhz7baa	yes you are starving yourself. Rigorous diet and intensive exercise causes a "starvation" mode meaning the body releases certain hormones that put the body in a catabolic state (tissue eating). The 2-3 pounds in one day was just a loss of your glycogen reserves and possibly some muscle tissue that was turned into sugar via a process called gluconeogenesis. If you do not consume enough carbs you can be sure to know that your muscles are being destroyed to fuel your exercise routine. And any protein that you eat will just be converted into sugar. <br>  <br>  Slow intensity workouts with decent carbs and protein and fat (fat is the preferred fuel for muscles), allow the body to conserve glycogen and burn fatty acids so you will more likely lose inches and not as much pounds which is much more desirable. <br>  |`|wIOhMTQtaa	For tips on how to loose weight at home without exercising <br>  u can  refer to dis website <br>  <a href="http://www.detoxmedifast.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.detoxmedifast.blogspot.com</a><br>  and u ll find so many tips for <br>  weight lose n detox diets...try them n lose weight easily|`|AA10718815	I wanted to lose 20 pounds in a month and in 1 week I exercised like a mad woman only ate veggies and fruits and  drank water in buckets....in one week I lost 9 pounds......and I was exhausted....then the next week I toned down the crazy diet food, and threw in some carbs and really toned down the exercise...and I gained 6 pounds back in 4 days.

Working out causes microscopic tears to form in muscle fibers -- this is good and normal, so long as the tears have time to heal before the next workout.<br>  <br>  Strength-building exercises (high resistance, low reps) cause deeper and more numerous tears than endurance-building exercises (low resistance, high reps).  If your workout includes strength-building exercises such as lifting weights, your muscles will need about a week to heal.  If you are performing endurance building exercises, 24 hours is usually sufficient recovery time _if_ you are not pushing too many reps.<br>  <br>  A good way to workout often while still allowing your muscles sufficient healing time is to rotate the muscle groups you work out.  Try doing arms/chest Mon, then rest Tues.  Do abs/back Weds, then rest Thurs.  Do legs Fri, rest Sat.  On Sun do endurance exercises (elliptical trainer / bike / treadmill) or just take the day off.  On Mon start with arms/chest again; that will give your muscles enough time to heal before you start creating new tears.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck!<br>  <br>  PS -- if you don't let a muscle group heal completely before working that same group again, your strength training will hit an early "plateau".  The rate at which you tear muscles down will grow until it matches the rate at which your training builds them up, and your strength development will stall below your potential.

The word alone can make someone feel paranoid, edgy and nervous. But is stress really what is wrong, or is it the way you handle your stress that needs to change? People look at the word stress as an enemy that needs to be terminated for good, even though we all know that stress is an inevitable fact of life. So the question is not so much how do you avoid or get rid of stress, but more how do you deal and handle the stress when it does come to surface (because it will)?<br>  <br>  <br>  Stress is a factor that induces bodily and/or mental pressure and tension. When you read that definition, you automatically assume that it is a bad thing, right? Why? The reason majority of people look at stress as bad is because of the place they take it to when it comes along. When the mind or body has to work a little harder than usual, people fear it because it is not something that is a part of their normal pattern or comfort zone and so that take that stress to a level of where they feel much discomfort and feel painful, angry and depressing emotions and thoughts. So the first step would be to stop being afraid of unfamiliarity or situations where you have to step out of your comfort zone- and start focusing on the positive points of the stress and use it to your advantage. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  Take exercise for example. We all know that exercise is good for you. It tones and builds muscles, burns fat, strengthens your heart and helps you live a longer life. So what makes exercise so great? Well, exercise is such an important part of life because it keeps your working and puts stress on your muscles so they can tone and burn the layers of fat that sit on them. Your heart has to work harder because of the stress and strengthens. So in order to become strong and keep your body healthy, you need to put the stress of exercise on it so that it can keep working, rather than just sitting around and doing nothing-, which no body benefits from. Can you see that stress is not the enemy here? Stress is actually a motivator that keeps you going and functioning physically and mentally. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  What keeps you on your toes at work and keeping your life in order? Having a worry-free life with pure calmness and perfection? No. There is so no such thing as perfection and everything in life was already perfect, you would not even be here, for you would have nothing to discover and accomplish. The next time you are feeling tense and stress crawling itself through your mind and body, just take a deep breath and communicate with that stress and figure out where it is coming from. Everything happens for a reason, so if you have stress, then that stress is trying to tell you something. By finding what it is and what you should do about, you will productively use that stress to your advantage and accomplish what needs to be done with the motivation and push that you need, instead of just feeling angry for feeling that stress and doing nothing about it. Put that energy to good use and make the stress work with you, instead of making it work against you. You will always have stressful encounters throughout your life; so do not make it bigger or worse than it has to be. Your body will be feel less tense and your mind will feel great and exercised, making you accomplish much more out of life instead of just feeling sorry for yourself or blaming everything on stress when it is actually a companion that can help you achieve great things.<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  |`|yvJvquo8aa	Stress lets the person know they can still have emotions and pain.

A condition or circumstance (not always adverse), which can disturb the normal physical and mental health of an individual. In medical parlance 'stress' is defined as a perturbation of the body's homeostasis. This demand on mind-body occurs when it tries to cope with incessant changes in life. A 'stress' condition seems 'relative' in nature. Extreme stress conditions, psychologists say, are detrimental to human health but in moderation stress is normal and, in many cases, proves useful. Stress, nonetheless, is synonymous with negative conditions. Today, with the rapid diversification of human activity, we come face to face with numerous causes of stress and the symptoms of stress and depression.<br>  <br>  At one point or the other everybody suffers from stress. Relationship demands, physical as well as mental health problems, pressure at workplaces, traffic snarls, meeting deadlines, growing-up tensions—all of these conditions and situations are valid causes of stress. People have their own methods of stress management. In some people, stress-induced adverse feelings and anxieties tend to persist and intensify. Learning to understand and master stress management techniques can help prevent the counter effects of this urban malaise.<br>  <br>  dynamics of stress<br>  <br>  "Nothing gives one person so much advantage over another as to remain always cool and unruffled under all circumstances."<br>  <br>  —Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  In a challenging situation the brain prepares the body for defensive action—the fight or flight response by releasing stress hormones, namely, cortisone and adrenaline. These hormones raise the blood pressure and the body prepares to react to the situation. With a concrete defensive action (fight response) the stress hormones in the blood get used up, entailing reduced stress effects and symptoms of anxiety.<br>  <br>  When we fail to counter a stress situation (flight response) the hormones and chemicals remain unreleased in the blood stream for a long period of time. It results in stress related physical symptoms such as tense muscles, unfocused anxiety, dizziness and rapid heartbeats. We all encounter various stressors (causes of stress) in everyday life, which can accumulate, if not released. Subsequently, it compels the mind and body to be in an almost constant alarm-state in preparation to fight or flee. This state of accumulated stress can increase the risk of both acute and chronic psychosomatic illnesses and weaken the immune system of the human body.<br>  Top<br>  Stress can cause headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, eating disorder, allergies, insomnia, backaches, frequent cold and fatigue to diseases such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes, heart ailments and even cancer. In fact, Sanjay Chugh, a leading Indian psychologist, says that 70 per cent to 90 per cent of adults visit primary care physicians for stress-related problems. Scary enough. But where do we err?<br>  <br>  Just about everybody—men, women, children and even fetuses—suffer from stress. Relationship demands, chronic health problems, pressure at workplaces, traffic snarls, meeting deadlines, growing-up tensions or a sudden bearish trend in the bourse can trigger stress conditions. People react to it in their own ways. In some people, stress-induced adverse feelings and anxieties tend to persist and intensify. Learning to understand and manage stress can prevent the counter effects of stress.<br>  <br>  Methods of coping with stress are aplenty. The most significant or sensible way out is a change in lifestyle. Relaxation techniques such as meditation, physical exercises, listening to soothing music, deep breathing, various natural and alternative methods, personal growth techniques, visualization and massage are some of the most effective of the known non-invasive stress busters.<br>  Top<br>  stress can be positive<br>  <br>  The words 'positive' and 'stress' may not often go together. But, there are innumerable instances of athletes rising to the challenge of stress and achieving the unachievable, scientists stressing themselves out over a point to bring into light the most unthinkable secrets of the phenomenal world, and likewise a painter, a composer or a writer producing the best paintings, the most lilting of tunes or the most appealing piece of writing by pushing themselves to the limit. Psychologists second the opinion that some 'stress' situations can actually boost our inner potential and can be creatively helpful. Sudha Chandran, an Indian danseus, lost both of her legs in an accident. But, the physical and social inadequacies gave her more impetus to carry on with her dance performances with the help of prosthetic legs rather than deter her spirits.<br>  <br>  Experts tell us that stress, in moderate doses, are necessary in our life. Stress responses are one of our body's best defense systems against outer and inner dangers.

But i'd suggest doing something better for your overall fitness, such as running. I run highschool track, and running is definatly something that you can use outside of competition.

When someone puts their hands on you - and from the sound of it, repeatedly! - police intervention should be a consideration.  <br>    Seriously.  You can never focus, work, perform in school, or frankly sleep at night, under this kind of stress.   This is beyond school bully stuff.<br>      Does your parent(s) know that this "Man" has put his hand on you aggressively?  <br>      If so, you might consider talking to the police - that is drastic, I know that, and he may get more upset and want pay back.  But then, it sounds like he is making your life miserable.  <br>        I have a young daughter,  I would NOT tolerate it and if the officials at the school could do nothing, I would make it clear to the parents of the other child that I would resort to getting a restraining order to protect my child.    <br>       If you have a friend or 2 a school that might be willing to help, maybe they could run interference for you also.   Ask to be tranferred to classes he is not in if possible.  Do what you can to avoid him. <br>      Also, keep a journal - one dedidated to encounters with him in addition to a general one.  Write down every encounter - every word he says.  Be sure you start each comment with the full date, time it occurred, and where you were when it happend.  This could be valuable evidence in the future. <br>  <br>     I hope something here helps you or that you can find a solution that allows you to relax just a bit.

RgVmmtj5aa	Hey --<br>  <br>  You should see your dentist and he/she can refer you to a specialist.  It sounds like you have TMJ ... which is a pain in the butt!  It's a problem with the joint (temporal mandibular) and you may need to have a special guard made or something of that sort.  Is there pain involved?<br>  <br>  Yeah, chewing gum is not good for it, at all.<br>  <br>  Best of luck you you!|`|tbZNMfAsaa	Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) - TMJD is a condition that affects the jaw joint as well as the muscles surrounding the jaw.<br>  <br>  It effects thousands of people. To treat it you need to go to the dentist and they will help you figure out the exact cause of the TMJD. After that depending on how severe the problem is you can go to see a well trained physical therapist or massage therapist - once they are aware of the cause can usually treat this dysfunction.<br>  <br>  You might be interested to know that tongue rings can contribute to TMJD.<br>  <br>  P.S. EVERYONE and their mother has TMJ - because that is the name of the joint. If you have a disorder it's called TMJD or TMD|`|2MVxXx1eaa	I have it too because I had some teeth pulled and my mouth was uneven.

It could vary in seriousness though. The doctor did tell me to not chew gum so much and try to avoid what types of food I eat, such as really hard candy and such. I would definitely go to the doctor's though and see if this is what you have. |`|b7ejGDAwaa	congratulations you have TMJ!<br>  <br>  Get ready for a life of pain and headaches!|`|4uXYoJa1aa	I think you should get it looked at|`|K0tT6JXMaa	It could be TMJ.

Talk with your dentist, they may recommend a night guard.  Depending on the severity, they may recommend you see an orthodontist, b/c they specialize in TMJ treatment.

I know it sounds crazy but a woman should never go below 1200 calories a day. If you do then your body goes into like a starvation mode and you will not lose weight.

I too could not loose weight after baby it's been 8 years and I finally realized my metabolism was all messed up. You must eat smaller portions more often (4to6) times a day. If you eat less your body will keep the weight because it thinks that your starving. I have lost nearly 20 pounds in 3 weeks, and I'm still loosing.

uC75y83Taa	Wow.  Your circadian rhythm is all screwed up.  That's your brain's sleep cycle.<br>  You really need to see a doctor.  If you were my brother I'd send you straight to a psychiatrist.  Not because you're crazy, (that's an old stigma) but because psychiatrists are smarter than all other doctors, and they come up with ideas before other doctors would.  They know more about sleep and medications, only if needed. They go to school an extra 4 years.  I see it over and over again.  Patients go to 20 doctors, and finally get the help they need from a psychiatrist.<br>  Please don't just blow me off.

I've honestly found that the more I care about my weight, the more I watch it, the more I put on... The weight I lose comes off when I stop caring.  I lost about 12 kilos over a year (in 2 6kg lots over about 3 months each) by forgetting about it, eating good dinners and sleeping well. (that's about 26 pounds). And haven't put any back on in over a year (maybe up and down 2-3 pounds over long times)<br>  <br>  The fastest way is to cut your calorie intake way back by eating heaps and heaps of fruit and veges, and exercise a lot with cardio/aerobic activity.  If you just eat less, you will lose weight but slow your metabolism to match so that once you start eating normally again you will just pile on weight.<br>  <br>  Losing weight as slowly as possible is the most effective, because it means you're changing your lifestyle to something you can maintain for the future.  |`|X1MjXlWvaa	Sigh. I don't mean to sound impatient. I'm assuming you're young from the 1994 in your name, but perhaps not. If you are young, I would advise you not to go on an extreme diet that will affect your growth. Trust me on this, I know from wrestling that extreme fasting and weight cutting affects your growth. I'm convinced I'm shorter than I would have been had I not cut so much weight. <br>  <br>  Now to address your question, that really depends on your height, your body fat percentage, your eating habits, and your genetics. If you're overweight and have twenty pounds of body fat to spare, I would recommend the Abs Diet, its pretty well rounded and lets you lose weight gradually.  <br>  <br>  The FASTEST way to lose fat is to build muscle, but you most likely won't lose weight. You will look much slimmer and physically fit.<br>  <br>  In reality, the only way to lose weight is to eat less and eat healthier, and to exercise more. There's really no healthy shortcuts.|`|QRYQnhQ8aa	If you are eating bad foods, then start eating healthier. <br>  <br>  The fastest way to loose weight,  is to eat less then you normaly would, and work out for Atleast a half an hour to an hour a day.  Cardio exercises such as walking, running, biking . But be sure to push yourself. The harder you push, the more weight you will lose. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you simply choose to stop eating and not work out. You will gain weight.   And if you eat healthier than you were before, you will slowly loose weight without working out. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	umm, i lost 40 pounds without a pang of hunger.<br>  <br>  Try eating bigger breakfasts, smaller dinners, more vegetables, and healthy snacks, like homemade trail mixes/ or oat-milk/blueberry smoothies.<br>  <br>  I also added flax seed, ground and sprinkled to about every meal that i prepared at home.<br>  <br>  apples on avg. have 100 calories, and I've never met a person who could vanquish more than 2 in a sitting.

It's a girl thing, at some time, when you totally un-expect it, its going to happen. Just enjoy your life how it is now, and don't worry about it! Some people get theirs at 16 or maybe even 18 years old! Its all normal. Take a deep breath and relax.

30fd94e652f782d93ba13f110bdb1aefaa	Easy: Take a nice, slow stroll. No special clothes or shoes required. Just get up off the furniture, grab a visor and walk around your neighborhood, and make sure to greet your neighbors. Social contact is very important to lessening depression. Fresh air and a chat should do it.<br>  Good luck. |`|kIzDY6cBaa	Try exercising at different times of the day to find a time that works for you.  If you force yourself to get up and do it first thing in the morning, you won't be able to talk yourself into not doing it later in the day.  Is there someone you can run with? If so, schedule a time to meet them.  You will be less likely to not go if you have someone waiting for you.  |`|f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	Try some quick exercises that get get your heart rate up, and then see if you are motivated.  I have similar symptoms, and sometimes nothing works, but more often than not, running in place vigorously for thirty seconds leaves me panting, energized, and full of endorphins.<br>  <br>  i would recommend a tablespoon of honey 15 minutes before your workout, to help you get through the initial boggy warmup.<br>  <br>  if you are labored, in pain, or just not feeling it after 10ish minutes, I've found that it is disheartening to follow through, and finish the workout, and it will serve you better in the long run to let it go for a day.<br>  <br>  exercise is without a doubt the single most effective step I have taken to treating my depression-- it worked better for me than the medications i received from my old doctor.|`|2gE4hvw2aa	Just thinking about the relief of stress after a workout should be enough encouragement for you to do it!  Don't let yourself get into a slump, as it will only contribute to your stress and depression.

The fastest absorbed foods are sugars, but they are extremely unhealthy in quantities beyond moderate.<br>  <br>  the slowest are fat and protein, so if you mix these in with your foods it will lower the glycemic index, but make the food absorbed slower.
AA10720479	Don't ever take your dogs to that groomer ever again. That's terrible, I never heard of that acually hapening, although it does say on the package about that kind of thing.

XzXghDLRaa	Yes.  It has happened to me before.  If you go too long in heat without anything to drink or hydrate your body, you become very weak and your body feels like it is going numb and it can't support itself.

Does that mean you should?<br>  You are way too young to be able to cope with what sex can do. Sure it feels great, but it's much more emotional for a girl. When that boy breaks up with you you will be even more heartbroken than you would have been if you didn't have sex.<br>  Will you even use protection? Do you know that not one contraception is 100% effective? Condoms can break and be ineffective. What about STD's? You know condoms don't protect you against cervical cancer? And then there's the pap smear.<br>  And yes it hurts, especially if you have a smaller frame.<br>  <br>  You're still a kid. Study hard so you will be able to have a career when you grow up.

You're right, practically everyone does it, but NOT everyone does it at young ages, even if that's what your friends/school/media makes it seem like. I'm nearly 20 and still a virgin, and I couldn't be happier with that! Currently I'm in a wonderful relationship with the love of my life -- we've been together for 2 years this month and have been waiting until we're both completely sure we're ready to have sex before we take that step, and I know that when we do, it will be really special and a good thing for the both of us.<br>  <br>  As for pain, yes, for most people, the first time (or even the first few times) can hurt quite a lot for females, ESPECIALLY for those who do it at very young ages, like you.<br>  <br>  But aside from that, you should know that sex comes with not only physical consequences (such as the pain you mentioned, as well as possible STDs and unplanned pregnancies), but also very intense emotional consequences. Whether you think so or not right now, sex does and will change everything. It will change the relationship between you and the person you have sex with, and the relationship you have with yourself. When you are 100% ready in every way, sex can be a wonderful and beautiful thing -- BUT, when you choose to have sex before you're ready, it will almost ALWAYS bring up emotions you never expected to feel (such as guilt, insecurity, sadness, and intense regret, to name a few).<br>  <br>  Please, please, there is absolutely NO rush to have sex. You have your whole life to experience it -- why not wait for the right person and the right time, when you'll really be ready to fully understand and enjoy it with someone you love and trust who truly cares about you?<br>  <br>  This is a great site you might want to check out -- if you can't find the answers to ALL of your questions here, they have a message board and help address where you can ask anything you want yourself! <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com/</a><br>  <br>  Aside from that, if you ever need someone to talk to about this or anything else, feel free to email me anytime at BreatheIn2811@yahoo.com. <3|`|6qDhXpWfaa	No. Not everyone does it, at least not at your age. Most people lose their virginity around the age of 16-17, VERY FEW lose at the age of 13. So wait!! If the guy who's trying to get you to do it, then he's definately an asshole. Don't even bother. You'll regret it. <br>  <br>  It hurts for some people more than others. It depends on if your hymen is broken or not. <br>  <br>  IF YOU DO IT USE A CONDOM.|`|isE3J6VTaa	With me didn't hurt at all, it was just a bit weird have something inside me, after few times i just wanted sex.<br>  <br>  But grow up first, is not fashion make sex at 13 years old.

S2KcgzQwaa	Hi Honey,<br>  <br>  Most of us seem to create dramas like this for ourselves at some stage. Go easy on yourself. <br>  <br>  You need to have pregnancy tests ASAP to make sure one way or the other. The stress you are putting yourself through and the morning after pills are more likely to do you damage than having an abortion. Morning after pills are to be used as a last resort, there not lollies. <br>  <br>  If your not pregnant see your doc about some safer more effective contraception.<br>  <br>  Get some effective emotional therapy to assist you so that you are emotionally to make decisions that are right for you. <br>  <br>  Statically having an abortion does increase the chances of conception difficulties later. <br>  <br>  My feeling is, and I don't have proof it's just what I've observed in several cases, that difficulty conceiving after abortion seems to have more to do with the emotional issues from abortion than the physical.<br>  <br>  One EFT practitioner I know has worked with 2 women who were unable to conceive. They even spent tens of thousands of dollars on IVF with no success, but after resolving the emotional issues with EFT the both conceived and gave birth to healthy babies.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do don't listen to people who are judgemental they've got their own skeletons in the closet. <br>  <br>  Get good emotional help now & see a doctor about your pills, going on and off messes up your cycles and there are many factors for you to consider.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  |`|VwnLufUAaa	You're playing Russian Roullette with your life, Honey. Please get on birth control. <br>  <br>  Abortions have a pretty low risk of complications, much lower than actual childbirth. But abortion is not a method of birth control.<br>  <br>  This isn't something to be "stubborn" about. Get to a doctor or to Planned Parenthood and get information on the various types of birth control that are available. Being on the Pill is only one option, and it can be hard to remember to take the pill every single day at the same time each day. Maybe getting the shot or the patch would work better for you.<br>  <br>  Birth control will not ruin your chances of having a baby later on, when you're ready to be a mother.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend should also take some responsibility here, as in wearing condoms or outright not having sex with you until you're protected by birth control. His future is at risk too.|`|L8RZxkzGaa	You need to stop and think right now. Take a deep breath! Your actions are very risky. Taking the morning after pill 3 months in a row puts you at a much higher risk for developing blood clots and other health risks. Do some research on the internet to educate yourself on your actions. To answer your question- chances are that an abortion will not render you infertile. Women have spontaneous abortions all the time and do not even know it. It is part of life. Pro-lifers will tell you horror stories of women who died or became infertile after an abortion, but these are VERY RARE cases. What can render you infertile is continuing to have unprotecteed sex and getting a disease from it. You know what you are doing is risky and you seem to be an intelligent girl, so I would recommend that you listen to your head and start protecting yourself.|`|kEUEHK96aa	morning after pill no, abortion only in very rare cases,  but you still should get some form of contraception wether it be condoms or the pill|`|AA10720479	Have you seen abortion videos(the one the doctors make of actual abortions)? The doctors who have made these videos sware to never do another.These are babies, not just things you can kill because it inconveniences you. It does also take an affect on your body. Please think long and hard about that.|`|73dEt59yaa	If you dont even know if you are pregnant you ant be that far along so the type of abortion you would have would be a pill, then another a few days later. that shouldn't change you getting pregnant in the future. its when your very far along and they have to kind of cut the baby out. that could affect you getting pregnant again. <br>  <br>  and use protection from now on!<br>  <br>  |`|86QV5aWQaa	yes it will somehow, but just a little cases.. but if you are pregnant, can you please spare the baby? this is the cause of the compromised you have entered in. so if your boyfriend is man enough, and really loves you, he will going to raise the baby with you.<br>  <br>  if you consider abortion, you consider killing somebody like a heartless killer mom. and will run through your conscience all throughout your life.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	you really dont want to use an obortion for birth control. you really need to stop with the sex. and or get on the pill. and he should suit old jackson up at night or when ever the little guy is exploring dark places. he might consider getting cliped. <br>  i know of gals that were way too young had obortions and then now have a couple healthy kids.|`|nfJU6jCXaa	If u get an early abortion u will probably still be able to get pregnant later on, but if u wait to have an abortion after 3 months there is a higher risk of destroying ur reproductive system.|`|mbqI6wHAaa	YES but if you did it shame on  you
66q0fV8Zaa	If she is taking a medicine for adhd or add I can see that happening and even a few bipolar medicines. It is because those medicines slow the process of sugars in the blood.

a927a58b32bbda8e5f8323434a01287daa	Don't worry! You've just started! You only need to lower your intake by 500 or so calories. Exercise too. DO exercise! You'll do fine!|`|AA10720479	Your eating sounds OK. Try to amp up your workouts. It takes a little time for your metabolism to change, you should start seeing results with in the next 2 weeks, but you really should exercise as well(if you don't).|`|0ujpiBTCaa	You are expecting change too fast. Rapid weight loss is unhealthy and WILL backfire when the weight comes back. You are NOT eating too much!<br>  The best way to lower your weight and keep it off is to progress slowly. Remember that for a diet to be successful you need to be able to keep it - if you start eating 1400 calories a day, lose weight, then go back to a regular 2000 calories, you will gain weight back. Also, please remember that your body needs about 12-1400 calories a day just to function (heart beat, digestion, mental capacity) and if you dip below that your body and mind will suffer for it.<br>  <br>  That said, my advice would be to increase energy expenditure and reduce your calorie intake in small increments. You didn't say how active you are, but if you are not getting some exercise daily, that should be a first priority. Even if it means a 45 minute brisk walk every night, or hitting a gym three times a week. Get active.<br>  If before implementing this diet you were eating 2000 calories a day, I would say try to keep it under 1800. You don't have to count every meal up! Just get a general idea of what you are eating and try to make healthy choices.<br>  Losing 2-4 pounds a month is considered "perfect". This will give you the best chance at keeping the weight off once it's gone.|`|2G56I4JUaa	 you have to eat right and not starve yourself.. that never works to lose weight.. i love the fat loss shocker diet.. lets you select all your favorite foods and it generates a 10 day diet for you.. fter the 10 days you can do it again  and get a whole new diet so you are never bored.. iv already lost 32 lbs!! love it.. its really easy..<a href="http://www.fatlossshocker.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fatlossshocker.com</a>|`|4mXqv6IZaa	In order to drop the weight you will need to start an exercise program as well as eating healthy.

g03PFEAhaa	I'm a nurse, and no you don't get it FROM a guy. But it is common for women to get UTI's after intercourse. Best thing to remember is to always urinate after sex. Some women are more prone to this, and you can't really prevent it. If you feel like you have one, try drinking Cranberry juice, even the mix kinds with apple, etc will work. Plus you can try AZO tabs, which you can get at any pharmacy. Don't freak out if you take them, they will turn your urine red or orange. It's not blood! It's just the medicine working|`|AA10720479	Yes|`|AA12161209	Yes you can. They say women should always use the bathroom after having sex.

wRVdP5Ffaa	I am glad to help you with this. Four 1/2 months ago I weighed 232 lbs at 5"4. My goal is to reach 140 lbs by July. I called several personal trainers back in August and they told me that I would be lucky to lose 50 by July that I had set my goal to high. This discouraged me big time. I stayed discouraged until mid October. I don't know how but suddenly I was motivated. I started out walking 15 mins a day and doing a 1300 calorie diet (a 1300 calorie diet is a lot of food if you do it right...trust me you will get full). I gradually worked my way up to walking 3 miles a day and I will keep increasing that as I go. So far I have lost 62 lbs. Which is more than what the trainers said I would lose. Also, on yahoo answers people would tell me that I needed to exercise 1 hour a day to lose weight. Well this discouraged me as well because I had never exercised and how was I going to exercise an hour a day! I started out at 15 mins a day and immediately I lost weight. Going from no exercise to little exercise is improvement. Its important to remember to work your way up like I did. Well I hope this motivated you. Calorieking.com will help you a lot. You can do it I know you can.|`|xAgK3w7eaa	Ithink you should continue following your goals of course their are going tobe people trying to hold you back. That kind of sucks that your bro doesn't believe in you but it should give that much more determination to prove him wrong.Oh yeah back when I was in high school I used to be overweight until I joined football and changed my life I'm telling you it isn't impossible, just stick to it and you will come out on top buddy. <br>  CYA|`|Pw1fCNvXaa	because its easy to be mean.<br>  <br>  and about your diet and exercise: set realistic goals. youre still young and got a lot of weight to go. dont worry about getting "buff", just concentrate on dropping some weight first<br>  <br>  good luck on it|`|x1qKGmzSaa	yeah, you can do it!<br>  just lift weights ALOT<br>  :)|`|pKHQ3FgRaa	dont give up bro u dont wanna be fat...lift weights...remember gaining muscle takes away body fat...use protein shakes for faster results|`|XRoQES7baa	You'll just have to prove yourself... actions always speak louder than words in a gym.|`|37bf18725f6119df0b9fb3aca9f9baa2aa	First of all, don't set your goals too high.  I'm sorry, but weighing 230 at only 5'8...that's pretty big, so most likely, you won't be "buff" by the end of July.  It just doesn't work that fast, especially since you're only 16 and still growing.  But listen.  Keep trying.  Don't worry about what others say, and definitely don't let something someone said discourage you from trying your best.  Don't tell anyone about your diet.  Just keep losing weight, and people will say "hey, man...you're losing weight, huh?"  Comments like that will boost your confidence, and eventually, you might have that "buff" body you desire.  Be energetic and motivated.  Strive for your goal.  Don't give up...ah, now I sound like Dr. Phil|`|3p6fXiFpaa	Most heaver people do not stick to their goals, leading to the popular opinion.<br>  Another factor in your life may be a negative environment and closed minded individuals. (Please keep in mind that I'm giving examples, not stating that your family is in fact any of these.) Ironically stress can lead to many factors that causes overweight individuals. Situational anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression can cause a person to over eat, neglect healthy activity, and even become exhausted. <br>  Keep yourself pumped off of their disbelief. Sounds like you're willing to prove them wrong, show them what you're made of! You've already made a proper diet and exercising plan, you're on a roll! (Please keep in mind that there is a proper amount for a person to change their diet from and for one person to lose weight it takes many different exercises and foods that another person may require.) <br>  If you're serious about this, and it sounds like you are, ask your parents to take you to the doctor and ask for his/her advice on proper diets and exercises for you to keep up with, along with proper sleeping hours as well.<br>  Getting 'buff' by july is something that I would not consider possible, BUT you can make a large change in your weight that will help you get buff! One step at a time is the best way to change your weight. Not to mention that all that time you are burning fat, you're also gaining muscle under it!<br>  Males tend to burn more fat then females, and from personal experience (keep in mind I am a female) In a few months of eating healthier, working out at the gym, and exercising 30minutes at home (before I went to bed doing simple things such as sit ups, leg lifts, push up's, ect.) I managed to lose 20lbs. Though that doesn't sound like alot at first you'd be surprised! (If you look at 1lb of ground beef every time you lose weight and think "that's a rough idea of how much i lost!" it's AWESOME! made me smile a lot thinking I got it off) <br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that no diet supplement or pill is going to make this work better then basic diet and exercise will!<br>  <br>  Protein shakes can help you lose weight, but in some cases can also cause you to put on weight! Consult your doctor before using these!<br>  I really hope things work out for you :3 Keep at it!|`|Y3OimWsoaa	its okay if people dont believe in you, as long as you believe in yourself. <br>  <br>  I just turned 17 and a freshmen in college, with a goal to become a doctor. people have too much confidence in me that i can make it. they dont know that it scares me to fail them, disappoint them if i can't do it anymore. its tiring. sometimes, i only do what i do to meet their expectations, not mine. :( sad. <br>  <br>  <br>  be whatever you want to be.|`|bXmRWbEdaa	Don't give up, but do keep your diet goals to yourself.   Join a gym by yourself in order to lose some weight.|`|8SRjELNBaa	you can lose A LOT of weight by the end of july.. no joke, You need to concentrate on just losing weight, getting buff involves putting on weight :P<br>  <br>  Look up the benefits of "HIIT"<br>  <br>  link #1 = a 12 week beginners training routine to build a base layer of muscle.<br>  <br>  Look around the site, there a lot of really good articles & stuff on the "nutrition" tab.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck & stay focused|`|hFpchZ1saa	I think July is kinda close, you should set smaller goals.

You can do it, but its going to be a long and hard process, just be ready for whats in store and the ridicule, and you can do it.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	i really don't know about your personality so i wouldn't make a judgment about your willpower. try making your goal measurable in addition to the deadline. (like losing 10 pounds or being able to run a fourth a mile) good luck.|`|hzxplycYaa	People don't believe in you because they don't believe in themselves. Think of it like this. If they were in the same situation you were in, they would think negatively and never have the motivation to reach that certain goal. Because of that doubt they have in themselves, they have in others also. and, yes, you will get BUFF! I know a lot of guys who were overweight and actually worked it off in less than a year. 2,000 calories a day is at a healthy state. But remember to stay away from junk food, fast food, etc. Those things can really delay the diet. Don't let people phase you. :)
CIqwpLKQaa	You can break bones any number of ways:<br>  Car accident, skiing, playing soccer, getting a hand caught in machinery, ice skating, falling off a bike, etc. <br>  I work on an ambulance right now so you name it and I've seen it.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the person how painful it is. On a scale of 1 to 10, it generally get's rated above a 5 for an obvious break with deformity. Meaning you can see the bone is obviously displaced under the skin or exposed through the skin. <br>  <br>  Not all breaks are obvious though as with a hairline fracture (the bone is broken but still in place). <br>  <br>  Fortunately, I've also never broken a bone so I cannot describe exactly how it feels, but I'm sure this varies by person and the type of break. It could be dull and achy, sharp and stabbing, etc.|`|WHtH70h9aa	i dont know get a f***in ***** jump high in the air and land on it head first and let me know|`|XlGjBPBTaa	I have broken my nose three times, my ankle once and all eight fingers at one time or another and all the pain came from the surrounding tissues either being slammed, crushed, or ripped.<br>  The worst was my ankle because all the ligaments in my ankle worn torn, so I had white hot pain which quickly caused me to go into shock but when I got to my feet and put weight on it I really felt no pain because the ripping was over and just standing on it didn't cause any stress to the muscles.<br>  I cannot even think about breaking a bone where the end juts through the skin without getting slightly nauseous; so I am much more careful since the ankle last August.<br>  I hope that helps your report.|`|XL9bTbANaa	Breaking a bone can be just a sharp pain, maybe not even noticeable until pressure is added (I've had my pinkie, pointer middle finger and all my toes broken)<br>  Sometimes Its enough to make you shake.<br>  Long story short: It will hurt, pretty badly kind of like a burning pain along whatever limb was broken.|`|ia3MomIOaa	for me it wasn't much pain at all. imagine falling down and breaking your fall with your wrist. you get that feeling like you can't move it and you're kinda panicked but it goes away after like 20 maybe 30 minutes. its like that, but its a little bit worse, and you generally cant move it at all. some say its a burning sensation, but i have no idea what they mean. the bigger the bone the more painful it is, but its not bad. you kinda go into shock, like you start shaking and stuff, and you cant control it, you dont want to shake, but you just do its annoying really. i broke my foot in 4 places when i was 3 or 4 and i walked on it for a week before my parents noticed i was limping, it didnt hurt all that badly if i remember. i know i had to sit down, and i remember not crying, but it hurt.|`|auOBJNEGaa	It probably depends on the bone. I broke my foot (I forget which bone, it was in the middle of my foot) by diving off the side of a pool which had a steel mini step (a ledge just before the water) and didn't clear it. I hit the top of my foot on it. Mine was more of a quick, intense pain when it actually broke. It was in the following weeks that it really started to hurt.|`|MjEcXxwFaa	breaking my nose in cheer felt like there was extreme pressure being put on it, like an elephant was sitting on my face.|`|G7NAvricaa	It feels worse than pulling a muscle<br>  i broke my arm once it wasn't pretty<br>  sorry i cant describe how painful it was
to4re3Dbaa	I sleep 4, 5, 6 hours regularly because of my schedule and function normally. But then on occasion, like the weekends, I crash and make up for all the sleep I lost. Basically, your body needs to get into that REM phase of sleep (where you dream). There's studies of people woken up every time they started to enter the REM phase and they ended up having hallucinations and acting drunk. Something like that. So if you only have enough time each night to go into the REM phase twice instead of the usual 3-4 times, it'll get back to you in a few weeks time. You'll crash and make up for it. Think of your accumulated sleep like a bank and right now you might have some defecit.<br>  <br>  So basically, it's not a HUGE deal that you don't get 8 hours, but you really won't be at your best and exhaustion/sickness will catch up with you much faster. And if you can get 8 hours instead of six, why not? There's no reason for putting sleep off. It's a fabulous thing. Hahaha.|`|LWtpXfonaa	i function perfectly normal on 5, 6, 7, and i am totally rested w/ 8|`|LHIOVjrDaa	well seems like it works fine but your lucky i gotta get more than 8 hours|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	My wife runs on about 6.  Makes her tired a lot.|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	then sleep only 6 duh|`|yiR22Gabaa	It's not necessary, but getting eight hours can help you.<br>  <br>  It's help your brain (faster, more outside-of-the-boxy.)<br>  <br>  People with more sleep tend to be more fit. There's more reasons that were in those little newsflash things that show up when you first enter Yahoo!, but I can't remember them.|`|AA10337152	Your body needs 8 solid hours of sleep. You can get by with 6 or 7, but 8 full hours is best. Good Luck !  :)|`|DscuOFIcaa	its still not healthy, you lose weight if you get enough sleep|`|a85f7296bd89d164e65c09b343ee8a83aa	in the long run, you'll feel it
XlGjBPBTaa	You are sleeping too long.<br>  Shorten your sleep time to eight hours or less and your body will not be so sluggish.<br>  Once you get to the time you need for a good rest, your body will be ready to get up.  If you allow yourself to go back to sleep then you will get sluggish.<br>  It is a discipline that takes getting used to but once you get used to it you will be jumping out of bed because you will know how much better you feel.|`|ZzySwlSeaa	I'm the same way, thankfully I'm homeschooled now so I get around 13 hours of sleep which actually seems to help.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	What I have to do is set my alarm across the room to turn it off, I also keep my room very warm because if it is cold I will just jump back in bed and cuddle under the pillows and covers and sleep through my alarm! I also bought some things to spoil myself with like new shower gel and sometimes a new cd to listen to in the car for the drive to work or a new type of coffee or tea to drink when I wake up!|`|37bf18725f6119df0b9fb3aca9f9baa2aa	I always found that when it's time to get up, you have to throw yourself out of bed.  Get up right away, and don't lie there thinking about it.  Just get up and start moving around, and keep yourself busy.  This works, trust me.  I was once in the Army.  5 am wake up.|`|c36O0naDaa	maybe for breakfast the night before prepare something really yummy, or organise to meet a friend somewhere.<br>  I dunno there is nothing much you can do.|`|xQstqSlpaa	I also used to feel gross in the mornings, no matter how much sleep I got.  Then I started exercising.  When I'm active for about a half hour, I feel much better waking up the next day.|`|WHtH70h9aa	just wake up and quit being lazy
tRXKLDvraa	It does not sound like a medical emergency. There are small capillaries in the nose that are very close to the surface of the skin. Sometimes irritants will cause your nose to have blood in the mucous. <br>  <br>  Go to the doctor if you have a bleeding that is uncontrollable. These things sometimes seem scary but they usually turn out to be okay. The weather may also be changing where you are and that can cause noses and allergies to stir up, as well. Likely you had a scab in your nose which was loosened when you rinsed it with saline.|`|qfGXtF5taa	You should be fine. Your nose may just be dry. (It can bleed sometimes when it gets dry.) Unless you actually have uncontrolled nosebleeds you probably don't need to see a doctor.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	means you've got a nasty cold - <br>  been there - - done that<br>  <br>  the salt water in a sinus rinse will be great to treat it<br>  and help it on the way to healing<br>  <br>  pappa tom said so<br>  <br>  May The Lord God Bless You and Keep you!

You could try the persons GP but if the GP has not seen the person in years they will know very little about them.

I used to be a track runner and they would tell us to eat something like that and a piece of fruit or something between an hour and an hour and a half before our first race.  Also its very important to have that time to let it digest.  Also you need to drink atleast a 16 oz bottle of aqua to wash it down.<br>  <br>  It helps digest it and break it down faster.  Good luck.

8LP57QOCaa	you cant spot reduce congrats on the weight loss though|`|YteiWSM1aa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - eat less and exercise more often - the issues appear when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of opportunities to fail in the real world don't you think?! The only method which definitely delivered for me was green tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off thrity pounds, it definitely does produce success!
R4jDg5Ksaa	Yes - the Alli pill does work. Now all pills have different reactions for different people and I cannot stress enough that you listen to your body.  If taking the pill three times a day makes you feel sick or anything, take it down to two pills. Also do not eat fried foods! I'm talking super greasy KFC style fried foods.  This is what causes the 'poos'.  I have been taking the Alli pill and I didn't (at the time) exercise. The most excerise I got was being constantly on my feet at work. Within the first three weeks the girls at work were asking me what i'd been doing because they could see I was losing weight.  I had no side effects - I didn' feel jittery, hyper, nothing. My mother, uncle, aunt, cousin, and myself are all taking the Alli pill and none of us make a point to exercise and we are all losing weight. Trust me, it's worth it!|`|ad1c8h89aa	From reading around weight loss forums and the Alli website, itself, I noticed many people were not losing weight. It seems that many people get the impression that fat grams are the only points that need to be counted. Along with the grams of fat, calories need to be counted as well. Many people neglect the calorie part, and feel that they can drink 10 glasses of soda being that there are 0 grams of fat, per serving. There is a whole math equation that goes into the whole diet, which sometimes will discourage people from following through with their goals.<br>  <br>  Many people do not realize that if they are not dieting a few days, prior to taking their first dose of Alli, they may see some horrid side effects. These side effects may range from an orange, oily discharge, cramping, loose stool, or even a little nausea. These side effects will also occur if you decide to cheat a bit on your diet. If the Alli is not completely out of ones system, the side effects will occur. <br>  <br>  The jitters are a common side effect of many diet pills. Many of us hate them, but because of the ephedrine in most diet pills, they also serve as appetite suppressants. With Alli, unfortunately, there is nothing that helps to curb a person's appetite. If you are continuously hungry, don't depend on Alli to take any of that hunger away. In the long run, many dieters are looking for a miracle that will do the controlling for them.<br>  <br>  The worst part of a diet pills is that you will depend on the pills for the rest of your life in order to sustain your ideal weight. Once you stop taking them, the weight you did manage to lose will almost always come back. With the weight loss program that i joint 2 years ago, i'm able to sustain my ideal weight without taking diet pills, hunger nor any tedious exercise. The wisdom to weight loss is knowledge about our own metabolism system.<br>  <br>  |`|ERm2AsmGaa	Ive had many people tell me that the Alli drug doesn't work...It simply makes you feel weird....<br>  <br>  The only thing i've had success with has been white tea and acai... and that too..not some super fast weight loss success...but more of a moderate and SUSTAINED weight loss.<br>  <br>  White tea tasted awesome...so you will continue drinking it and stick to it. I would suggest you get a free pack from <a href="http://freewhitetea.com" rel="nofollow">http://freewhitetea.com</a>  if they are still available.. and start on a white tea diet.<br>  You simply have to drink a few cups of it...and it will increase your metabolism rate which is the ideal and best way to lose weight...<br>  <br>  As for exercising.... even if you don't ..you will see some results... which is more than any diet pill would do for you.<br>  The good thing about white tea with Acai is that even if you leave it...your weight won't grow back.<br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|cfcmylJvaa	Weight loss drug works the same, if you don't want to go to wash room more frequently, try something else, something more scientific and would keep a balance in your body, thus would keep a permanent effect <br>  <a href="http://www.quickebuy.com/html/fat-loss-4-idiots.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickebuy.com/html/fat-loss-4...</a>
10mOHSZTaa	You gain or lose weight over a period of weeks and months, not day by day. As long as you generally eat healthy, you'll be healthy.|`|yKXxtrhsaa	I don't think you need to write everything down like that other girl said...just saying. That can cause you to be too obsessed with calorie counting. Anyway, no, eating some junk food will not ruin your diet, as long as you don't do it every single day.|`|XucDQmLUaa	no just stay within your calorie range of 1200-1400. write everything down!! and make sure to exercise later to burn off some of the unwanted calories that you consumed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  =]

If you're having difficulty sleeping, you should see your doctor.  There are better alternatives.
Dhz4XgQ3aa	MMM i am the same as you!! I treat others how i want to be treated, and you know what i got for it? Depression. Everyone who i met in a psychiatric hospital who was depressed has the same giving nature. <br>  You need to stop looking for love from these people who arent giving it to you. your never going to get it at the standard you deserve. I dont doubt your family do love you, but families dont think they have to show it. They think its just granted that you know this. so they dont have to show it. <br>  We people that feel depressed do feel let down all the time, I constantly feel like that and i STILL havent learnt any lesson from it yet as I am currently having that situation now with some friends of mine. <br>  Thing is you need to stop giving so much. It will feel odd to you at first as its probably quite unnatural for you to not do so much for others and do more for yourself. I struggled. I used to say that to me I wasnt as important to me as other people are to me. But when you do that you give and give thinking that one day someone will give back an you dont get the same care back you start to feel let down and this then leads to depression. Do you feel like your not worth anything and put yourself worth on what others think of you? Read the low self esteem link I attach at the bottom. <br>  <br>  Keep a diary to vent on. <br>  Make a list of all the things you have done for other people (people you feel let down by)<br>  make a list of the things you could have done for yourself with that energy instead. <br>  Now do them.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to go to the doctor to get some antidepressants which you probably need and even if your already on them try Omega 3, 6 and 9. Its proven to lift depression.<br>  <br>  The links below are one on suicide, which btw doesnt always go as planned and can leave you with permanent damage to your body.<br>  One on Self esteem<br>  and the last is on suicide but this lists the ways of dying, and what could go wrong, it put me off trying again, and at the bottom of that link is a list of suicide helplines.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10720479	Every one goes through a time in their life when they want to die. Keep hanging on better things are to come in the Future. People will change.|`|AA12365543	I'm feeling the same way. I wish there was something I could tell you. I care about you, really I do|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Life is so difficult and odd. It is like a constant battle against all the bad things.<br>  <br>  Yet, I beg you to not lose faith in life. - I know your feelings (I have been there) but please try to hang on a little while longer I promise that it could be worth it.<br>  <br>  A male who does not appreciate love is not much to have. - There are more fishes in the sea. I promise you. Tell him your feelings and if he not change attitude you just dump him. <br>  <br>  You should also not accept a male who abusive. Now when you feel as you do you only have one thing to care about: Your happiness!<br>  <br>  The hours you are with friends might give opportunities to find Mr Right!<br>  <br>  Your brother does probably not understand your feelings. - It is not possible to take a break from family? To live with a friend for a while?<br>  <br>  You should have someone to speak with however. You do not know anyone you have faith in? - In worst scenario you have do act like I did. - Create a "bogus name" and then go out on the internet.<br>  <br>  Remember that fantasies and imagination are excellent ways to escape the sad real life.<br>  <br>  I could continue but I beg you to chose to hang on instead. Fate will improve when you less expect it. <br>  <br>  Wish we, who all feel the same, could keep contact. Then we would not be struggling alone. - At least it would not feel like this.|`|apXxSZvhaa	first off, dump the loser boyfriend you have.  try being single for a while.  i think its horrible when families treat you like crap.  my family treated me the same way when i was young... i attempted suicide and was placed in a psych hospital (which i preferred)-  when my dad died, every last person has hated me for whatever reason since.  i dont care though.. i think it would be beneficial to you if you tried contacting a therapist (without your family knowing) and talk to them, they will help you and will not judge you either.  IM me if you ever wanna chat... from personal experience i know it sux, and i know its tough to believe but... things will at some point get better for you and get worse for those who treated you like dirt.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|jNPCT96Xaa	Since you really do know you are depressed, that's one less hurdle to conquer. If you are interested, you should see a doctor about anti depressants and medicate yourself. But I would physically remove yourself from your situation. If you live in a climate that is drab, dreary, and rainy move somewhere where you don't know a single person and it is warm and sunny most of the year. If you live somepleace sunny, move somewhere that gets a lot of rain. If you feel as though your family has essentially ditched out on you, ditch out on them. Move. Don't tell them where you're going or even that you are going, or tell them "I'll call you soon". Don't change your number, but go move somewhere by yourself. Being on your own you'll realize that you are probably a lot stronger than you think you are which will make you feel better. You wont need to escape your mother, brother, boyfriend, etc. to be with your friends for an hour of relief. You'll be away from all of that completly and maybe not having those constant reminders of how shitty they treat you will make you feel better. And you might have a great time doing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I really hope you decide not to take your own life but make positive changes that benefit you.|`|uIeIJ7aRaa	Ohmygod... I dont know if this is going to be much help... <br>  I read what you wrote and it was like i could have written it myself. I too am completelt exhausted at being walked over and treated terribly by those closest to me, my immediate family and loved ones.<br>  <br>  Only in the past month (although has been building for some time) I have 'broken', would you tolerate the treatment from a new friend? NO!!!! What makes family seem to think it is ok! So... I have just started being assertive, it was really hard at first and there have been a few blazing rows ending with me asking famly members to leave. <br>  The worst part as you regain respect and yourself back from your current position is the ISOLATION and the willingness to forgive so that you can have people in your life. Sure they care but they dont KNOW you. They dont know who you are underneath for whatever reason. It may be you have to be truely alone for a while so that when you reunite with family you can present as who you really are and be comfortable witht that and not accept any undue lack of respect. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, just reading your message made me feel hope, knowing that I am not the only one who keeps trying to promote the best in myself while others take ADVANTAGE of that. One day you will have many around you who treat you with the same love and care. But if you do not remove yourself from the negativity you will end up being the same as them... <br>  Dont know if this has helped any.<br>  Much love.
LDMV3WUTaa	Well, the masturbation could be part of the problem. Because when a male masturbates, the body doesn't feel the "need" to release any more sperm, any time soon, there after. But there could also be some type of "mental blockage" going on, as well. YOU may, very well, be putting TOO MUCH "pressure" on yourself, to "perform". And, therefore, giving yourself "performance anxiety", in a sexual sense. So, I would suggest, just "calming down", and let it C U M, naturally !!!<br>  <br>     ~Thee Raunchy Mann~|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	That could be part of the problem.  Then, too, you could be nervous & a little anxious & trying to get it just right - and nobody gets it just right the first few times.  You might be trying to be in too big of a hurry.  Slow things down, take it slow & easy & enjoy the feelings.  Consider a lot more foreplay prior to the main event.|`|YKYh9Z72aa	no that's prolly not the problem.... a good friend of mine came to me with this same problem a while ago. he had been with a few girls but none had ever gotten him off... he had a really poor outlook on relationships and of girls for that matter... he never developed any feelings for any of these girls and therefore his relationships were unfulfilling and his sex life suffered. he thought i was full of it when i told him things would be different when he found a girl that he had real feelings for ..... but now he and his FIANCE have an excellent sex life from what i hear, lol.... a lot of us just don't think about how big of an impact our heart has on us.... esp boys who think it's cool to be a player and yada yada..... that's my experience anyhow. good luck|`|2e3741216767a389faecfd74b525fe41aa	well if you think you are gonna get some, then don't jack off for a couple days before that.

You're so stressed out that you can't come.  Whether you want to give a grand show or whatnot, the mental pressure just works against you.<br>  <br>  My bf also says the difference in friction/speed.  With your hand, it is fast and continuous.  Whereas with a woman, you could slip or the speed is off.  So, it is different and this could cause you to not ***.<br>  <br>  Just relax.  You'll ***.

Most girls will want you to marry them if you get em pregnant.<br>  <br>  I could see why that might be the case but most guys don't think with the head on their shoulders.<br>  <br>  So take precautions and remember wrap up and have fun.<br>  <br>  Try to relax more.|`|MrnX6NHbaa	You should be as healthy as you can before having $3x with a girl .

d6x9WhXHaa	It has helped me, it was a trial and error getting the dosage right, and getting over the first few weeks of side effects, but overall, one of the best antidepressants I have taken. Do keep in mind it isn't a miracle pill though!<br>  <br>  Not all tablets help everyone, but give it a month at least to get into your system, and if you still don't feel any different, go back to your gp and change. It can be a long time of trying out different tablets. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rRQNDpwVaa	My husband took it and it helped him a lot.  He wasn't on a huge dose, I think 20mg to start and eventually went down to 10 before off them completely, but his was prescribed more for stress/anxiety to do with work rather than a deep depression.  I think they took about 2 weeks to kick in properly, but just knowing that someone took him seriously and was prepared to help him get better was a positive start and helped him in the initial 2 weeks while the medication was getting into his system.|`|ycdkngxlaa	For the first week or so you may get a few side effects, but after that you should be fine. They have really benefited me.|`|nG9znIxYaa	I first went on it 9 years ago and it helped me greatly.  It took some time getting the dose right and I have been on varying dosages over the years ranging from 10mg-60mgs.  I felt pretty awful when I first went on it but that could also have been to do with the depression/anxiety i was suffering at the time.  I also saw a psychologist which I think should go hand in hand with taking prescribed anti-depressants for the first time.<br>  <br>  Give it a good few weeks to take effect and to get over any side effects and you should be fine.  However i have tried to come off it several times and have suffered bad withdrawls.|`|J1stiMioaa	sorry, i had just about every side effect listed. so no, it didnt help me.

AA10720479	The hungry feeling will go away after a while(couple weeks). Try to up your water intake in between meals, to ward off that  hungry feeling. You should do fine,don't give up, it's always hard in the beginning.|`|AOr92DhTaa	If you are going to lose weight, it is likely that you will have to put up with being hungry sometimes.  Your stomach will shrink as it gets used to the smaller portions.  If you are eating enough calories, and eating good quality foods (complex carbs and proteins vs. simple carbs), and your blood sugar is testing normal, you shouldn't be feeling dizzy and shaky.
nmejm9Nmaa	You're only 15 man, why the hell are you drinking so many energy drinks? It's going to take a long time to get over it. The best thing to do is just gradually drink less, like maybe start a can less once a week, then move on to two cans less a week. If you just stopped drinking caffeine all together, your body is so used to having it that you may get really sick. Try toning it down as much as possible while keeping a steady amount to keep you from flipping out, and slowly drink less, I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|G7NAvricaa	Just get more sleep instead of getting energy drinks<br>  drink water instead of caffeine try juice|`|pPZv2tTQaa	HAHAHA ok sorry to laugh at you but man!<br>  Ok onto the serious stuff.

It will lessen the withdrawals.  Tea is not supper tasty but find a fruity one then add allot of sugar.  Keep it to 2 tablespoons not more.  Adding milk (half and half) is a good idea to.  Black teas have the most caffeine, if you can go with a red (oolong) or a green as they have less.  <br>  The object with the tea is to drink just enough caffeine to keep the withdraws at bay.  I can usually feel them starting to come on and that's when I'll take a small dose.   Then if you do get the withdrawals I use the caffeine coated Excedrin while I'm reducing my dose.    When you get your intake down for about 2 weeks go cold turkey.  Stay away from caffeinated soda and chocolate also.  If you get withdrawals don't do the caffeine coated pills do regular Excedrin.  It's a bummer you didn't hang in there a little longer.  My system is usually clean after about 2 weeks.  <br>  Your addiction doesn't sound that bad just your reaction.   My normal is to drink 4-5 16oz cups of coffee a day and I know allot of people like that.  I would think your maybe having a reaction to the ta urine and the sugar as well.  Coffee doesn't have all that in it.... well some sugar but not nearly as much.  Maybe switch to coffee for a bit.  For a cleaner high.  <br>  On a side note I suggest you go to www.thinkgeek.com and buy one of their caffine hoodies.  Gota rep your drug right?|`|tgIohzO6aa	take it slowly. Cutting down by small increments over days to weeks can help you avoid withdrawal symptoms<br>  <br>  good luck|`|HVAkWFjiaa	Just replace most of what you drink with tea, and stick to it.|`|FAKjYXoraa	you really should stop drinking caffine. <br>  no matter how bad the withdrawls are, and no matter how much you want to start drinking it again, you HAVE to stop. <br>  seriously. <br>  you're going to destroy your heart. <br>  my mom was addicted to caffine and ended up having to walk around for months with this thing monitoring her heart because the caffine was screwing it up. and didn't drink nearly as much as you....|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Hazelden in Minnesota treats all kind of addictions and has a quite good success rate.  check them out.

CIqwpLKQaa	Sitting up straight is really a misnomer as your spine is naturally curved. You should really try to sit correctly.<br>  <br>  To start you should try to find what is know as your rockers or the ischium of your hip bones. This is what you should be sitting on. Stop trying to 'hold yourself upright' and just allow your vertebra to relax into place. They will support themselves. <br>  <br>  I've found that stretching is very helpful to get a better idea of how your bone structure actually works in order to use it correctly while sitting or standing .|`|I0EpYn8Faa	i also have a hard time sitting up straight. i always end up slouching my back, but of course thts bad for you. you dont want a hunchback..<br>  <br>  i guess you can try leaning your back against the wall whenever you do something, so youre sitting up straight. <br>  push your butt further against the seat so that the back is more pressured and stands straighter.
LJkPRqN0aa	i would suggest applying the pill cinicot (spelling) to your diet. i have had the same issue but 100 times worse than you. i wouldnt go for 3 WEEKS and lemme tell ya that sucks. but i took the pill (which btw is a natural supplement so it shouldnt harm your body) and the day after i did my days worth of pills i had an extreme bowel movement. keep doing what you are doing but i would get the pills if i were you if what you are seeking is more movements....|`|mAp90hEeaa	All of the other answers have good points.  The med one answerer is trying to spell is senokot.  The Miralax is also good.  Increasing your daily intake of fresh fruits and vegetables will also help.  You do not want to be using laxatives.  The suggestions given are not laxatives but bulk-forming meds that help move the stool through your bowel.  People who use laxatives daily soon find that their bowel cannot function without their use and it becomes a lifetime dependency with increasing difficulty as time goes on because they no longer work.  Bulk-forming meds would be your best choice in addition to dietary changes.|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	As a sufferer of spastic colon since 21 and constant constipation until recently and having tried everything, I can tell you Flax Seed Meal works.

Its tasteless, you just mix it in juice or water and drink it up. It may take time to find the right dose, the normal says one cap full, but for some people that is too much. If you find its too much try less until its just right. My ped said you want to be able to go at least twice a day and it should solid but soft, not hard floating stools (that's a sign of constipation), and not watery.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

It's not like they're going to require you to produce a doctor's note (and if they do, that's some power trip someone's on).|`|NVxGp317aa	Well I'm not really sure why she is requireing the bp to be taken in a spacific arm it can be taken in either arm as well as legs or thigh area. <br>  I take a bolld pressure in wich ever arm is closest unless a spacific medical condition or injury exsist or if a pt request a spacific arm.<br>  There are times when it is necessary to check both right and left bp usually there will be a difference beteween the two.<br>  Personally I have had surgery on my left arm and my blood pressure is never accurate on the left arm since basically cause it is difficult to find a pulse.<br>  I would maybe go to class a little early and ask if there is a spacific reason she is requsting the left arm and then just tell her you have a previous injury to that arm and that you would prefer the bp be taken on your other arm where it is more comfortable to you. She dosent have to know where or the extent of injury but there are a lot of injuries that may cause a change in sensation and the act of squeezing from the cough could be very uncomfortable. But I think talking before class would help you not feel uncomfortable or singled out and she can understand your concerns.<br>  Good luck!

But if you don't have the energy for your favorite activities, or they don't give you the satisfaction they used to, or if you feel sad or empty most of the day, every day, it could be depression. Depression is a real and serious illness that may affect your appetite, your sleep patterns, the way you feel about yourself, and the way you think about things. It can make you less inclined to engage in once-enjoyable activities or even disinterested in life in general. It may occur once, but for many people it can occur several times in their lives. A common mental illness, it is estimated that depression affects about 14 million Americans in a given year or approximately 1 out of 6 adults over a lifetime.<br>  <br>  What causes depression?<br>  While many things may contribute to depression, its exact cause is not fully understood. Contributors to depression could be genetic, biochemical, environmental, psychological, or any combination of these factors. Biologically, depression is thought to involve an imbalance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain. These chemicals are called “neurotransmitters,” and they help nerve cells communicate with each other by sending messages. The three key neurotransmitters thought to be involved in depression are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. <br>  <br>  When someone is depressed, the nerve cells cannot communicate effectively. If not enough neurotransmitters are available, certain nerve messages will not be properly communicated. This is thought to result in feelings of sadness, disinterest, and other symptoms of depression.

b6804340ca2d6b7d0c5447298ae452c9aa	OXYGEN. Breathing completely in and completely out is overlooked as a tool for anxiety attacks and there couldn;t be a more accessible thing to do. Try this: flare your nostrils widely and concentrate on keeping them wide open through this breathing exercise. Sitting in a comfortable position with nostrils flared, inhale for a slow count of 8. Exhale the same legth of time and when you think you have exhaled enough, purse your lips and blow out with short bursts untiol you really empty your lungs. Now inhale again for another count of 8 and if you can inhale longer ( to 10) do that. Repeat the exhale and the blowing out any remaining air int he lungs. Sitting forward and bending at the waist helps empty the lungs more. While you are sitting back up again very slowly inhale for a count of 12 and very slowly exhale for a count of 12 without the extra blowing to empty lungs. You should find yourself in avery calm state of mind ready again to handle the world around you. |`|3K09QkOKaa	Hello there,<br>  <br>  I can sympathize with you over the dreaded anxiety attack! Yes it can really suck. Yes it feels like it will not end, and yes it can be stopped.<br>  Could I ask you first if you are a coffee drinker or if you consume anything with caffeine in it? If so, then you have to do yourself a favour and "stop". Because caffeine is a stimulant, and it can have a crappy effect on someone whom thinks too much as it is. If you do consume caffeine and stop, you will find in a day or two that your anxiety will be reduced if not disappear all together. You may be a coffee addict like me and find it a bummer to quit, but if you drink decaffeinated you will find over time it is basically the same.<br>  I hate to advise you to use meds for this problem, but if you must then go to a doctor! There are many products out there for anxiety, but we are all different, so do not be discouraged if the first medication you try fails. Just tell the doctor you want to try something else, and he will respect that and offer another variety of medicine.<br>  Are you eating right? Do you have enough foods with vitamins and minerals such as "b" vitamins and potassium? I also think it might be good for you to have natural foods as frequently as you are able.<br>  There are so many chemicals in our foods now days that you may actually be effected by some. Many people are fine with some "junk" in foods, but others are harmed by it. Many processed foods have little nutrition too. You should buy Bread with Flax...Dempsters in my opinion has very good Flax bread. You night find after eating this bread that you have more of the right substances for your body to function better.<br>  Well I hope I helped you a bit with this limited advise. Keep your chin up.

b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	You must really really love him to put up with this. People with bipolar don't realise what they're putting their loved ones through. Its not that they do it on purpose, they just can't help it. Is he on medication? If not, he should be, it will help him to achieve a normal life. Yes of course you have the right to get upset and frustrated, nobody deserves to be treated like this. But if you're willing to put up with it for the sake of loving him, then theres nothing much you can do. Just support him as best you can. But who is there to comfort and support you when it all gets too much? Hopefully you have a loving family and kind friends, because I hate to say it, but if you continue to be with this man, there is a good chance you will never get the love and support from him that every woman should get. And you will never be able to blame him, you'll end up blaming yourself and thinking you're not good enough, when the truth is, you can never please him no matter what you do, because of his illness.|`|mbuB22D2aa	What's his past ie abuse bad experience ? He might have thousand of thoughts going on in his head at once ? Try therapy |`|XqfH76PMaa	Bipolar disorder is very hard to understand.  You will never understand him 100% because he does not understand his self.  He does not mean to push you away and he does not mean to get so defensive and raise his voice.  Some people with bipolar can not do the affectionate thing.  It is very hard to trust people, and if you do trust them, it is hard to be so hands on.  Is he on his medication?  If not, that is another reason it is so hard for him.  I can not stress to you how his head is working without medication.  Even with meds, you aren't 100% "normal".  The longer you are together, the more you will understand him and be able to figure out what mood he is in.  It will also be a little easier for him to get closer to you and show you more affection.  The only thing you can do is to be patient and try to understand.  I suggest you research bipolar and try to get a better understanding of how it effects the person so you will see that it isn't you.  You haven't done anything.  It is a very hard thing to deal with.|`|cPhZKATTaa	If you want to keep this relationship, I would suggest that you learn a little more about bipolar. I have had quite a bit to do with it, and it is hard to know just which way to go at times. From what you have said, I think your partner may be feeling very pressured. He is not so much pushing you away, as he is protecting his own emotions and feelings. Is he on medication or having any kind of treatment? If so, that could be affecting him. Pick your moment and ask how you can help, rather than placing demands on him he isn't able to comply with just now.<br>  <br>  It might help you to get in touch with the organisation called GROW. They can help both patients and families/friends of those with mental illness. You need to have lots of patience and be prepared to be there for the long haul if you wish to keep this going. I understand that it is not easy, but then what relationship is?I wish you and your friend well.|`|E0jubWXkaa	Well, that's the way he is and if it makes you feel that bad, he isn't right for you. I suggest you break up with him and then maybe get back together if he ever changes.  <br>  Good Luck and I hope this helps! :) |`|Ba2HaXWUaa	Unfortunately not even top medical people completely understand this condition (it is very similar to depression but fluctuates rapidly).<br>  <br>  I think it is important for you to be supportive to your partner whilst they are suffering this condition and see that they get all the help they can.  This is a state of mind condition and so they more you can help to take his mind of it the better.  It is really hard to say exactly what you should as there is no wright or wrong answer.  Don't give up and don't 'bring it up'.  As I mentioned before, you need to take his mind off the condition not discuss it (as this will not help matters and he may go into a decline).  I would busy yourself, see your friends and make plans for you and your partner to do stuff.  It's not easy and sometimes you will feel as if you are banging your head against a brick wall.  You have to be a very understanding person that is very in love with her partner to be able to get through this with him.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you can go the distance, you may have to end things with him.  Harsh I know, but you also have the right to live a full life - even with this condition he must try and meet you half way.|`|ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer, modified for you, follows: See section 10, on bipolar disorder, at ezy build, below, and take the quiz, if unsure, and if the results are positive, ensure you get an expert diagnosis from a mental health professional, not doctors, who are much better dealing with physical ailments, and don't diagnose complex disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder often enough to develop any real expertise. <br>  <br>            Bipolar disorder usually involves major mood swings, which occur without apparent cause, and often over many months, or a matter of years, rather than days, as with most people (unless rapid cycling). I'd take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements daily, replacing 2 of them with cod liver oil supplements in the winter months, (or, as probably a better alternative to the 2 cod liver oil supplements: 1 teaspoonful of cod liver oil, with a little butter, to ensure its use; I take mine on sourdough rye bread, or toast, covered with fishpaste, and pepper, to mask the strong taste). Those people who receive adequate exposure to sunlight, daily, won't need the vitamin D from cod liver oil, but many people, particularly those in latitudes far from the equator, find this difficult, to achieve.<br>  <br>           If you decide to use allopathy, (modern Western medicine) I recommend trying Lithium Carbonate, or Lithium Citrate. (regular tests are necessary, for these) before trying the other mood stabilisers, but if you aren't good at taking medications regularly, drinking adequate water, and keeping up your salt intake, something else, such as  Lamictal,  or Depakote, may suit you better. Check out "lithium"  at <a href="http://www.drugs.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/,</a> and <a href="http://crazymeds.us/" rel="nofollow">http://crazymeds.us/</a> and always research medications first, there, and at <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askapatient.com/</a> (read, and keep the labels/information sheets) so you will be aware of the risks, and on the lookout for side effects. Personally, if I wasn't bipolar type 1, and didn't experience hallucinations, or serious delusional states, I know I'd first try the orthomolecular, and Omega 3 fish oil supplements, vitamins, minerals; a herbal remedy, and a mostly raw food diet, for several months. Note: St. John's wort, and also antidepressants, may cause mania, or hypomania, in people with bipolar disorder. I'd aso eat in accordance with my "nutritional type". Enter that term in the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a>  <br>  <br>           If not considerably improved, after a maximum of 6 months trial period, consult your primary mental health care provider: you may be one of those who need medications to prevent this serious disorder from worsening.  If you have bipolar type 1, an antipsychotic medication may also be needed. Everyone should take the Omega 3 supplements, or preferably "krill oil" for its other health benefits: use the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> . Some people refuse medication, using supplements, and a selective, mostly raw food diet (I do not recommended trying this, if bipolar 1, unless you aren't troubled by hallucinations, or delusional states). <br>  <br>           Maintain the treatments for the depressive phase, in section 2, at:  <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  Some topics in section 10 (see the BIPOLAR SUPPORTER  website) include: treating bipolar disorder with supplements, vitamins, minerals, and herbal remedies (except for St. John's wort!).  As with all medications, there are risks, and the possibility of side effects, which is why I inform people of the alternatives, to see if they can cope sufficiently well, without resorting to medications or, at least use less of them, with their attendant risks, and side effects. Don't use medications and supplements together, without medical advice, except for Omega 3, which is safe, anytime. It is not unknown for those discontinuing medication, and trying the alternative treatments, (which are not quick to work) to lose their jobs, because of unacceptable behavio(u)r, so I'd start 1 week before vacation, and closely monitor the situation, and use medical advice.<br>  <br>  In bipolar depression phase, the drive for sex, and need for contact are suppressed, so I'd want to know what treatment is he using to stabilise his moods, or does he enjoy the manic/hypomanic phase too much to risk losing it?  I suggest couples counselling, or with his therapist, so you can both have your say, moderated by the therapist/counselor.<br>  |`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	Hey honey well i am bipolar II and I love affection. everyone is different.<br>  I don't think its a big thing to ask at all. I do wonder if he is depressed.. or not taking his meds though...?<br>  To be honest if this has been going on for a while, something is def up. If he wont go get treatment or help from somewhere, I would be inclined to say walk away. You can only do so much to help him. If he is not taking his meds, is depressed (cos meds stopped working) and wont go to the doctor, you can do any more honey.

MrhVcAqZaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  You will be fine. Babies that are born "jaudice" does not necessary mean that they have liver problems. The yellowish was cause by pigment Bilirubin that is naturally present in the us( babies). And Bilirubin in high content can cause jaundice or the yellowish color for the baby. The cure is simple for that. The babies are placed in Bili-Lights and right now almost all babies are placed under bili lights. or exposed to morning sunlight to remove the bilirubin pigment. <br>  <br>  Your liver as grown up is functioning well. You are already dead if it weren't functioning normal.<br>  <br>  It can and have the capability to breakdown everything that is to be broken down. Yes, again as a normal liver as same as the one who weren't born yellowish.<br>  <br>  Take care of your liver. Don't drink alcoholic beverages too much. It can damage your liver. Not just for you but the rest of us as well. Born jaundiced or not.<br>  <br>  Btw, jaundice can be a sign of Hepatitis infection. But if the cause of your jaundice is not hepatitis you will be fine.<br>  <br>  |`|YvLVuSEcaa	You are fine now.  When babies are born sometimes their liver can't filter the way it is supposed to right from birth, and they become jaundiced.  Quite a few babies are born with it, and it goes away within weeks if not days of birth, usually with exposure to light. <br>  <br>  Adults can become jaundiced as well, it turns your skin yellow and the whites of their eyes will yellow since their liver isn't filtering correctly.  This is most common in people with Hepatitis or Severe Liver Disease, and not caused from being born with it.<br>  <br>  Even though you had it when you were born, you're fine now.  No worries.|`|XqfH76PMaa	Being born with jaundice doesn't do anything to your health now.  It was only a problem when you were a baby.  Don't worry about it.  You are fine.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Newborns often have jaundice since once the lungs become funtional, fewer red blood cells are needed for oxygen transport, so excessive numbers must be broken down by the liver (hemolysis) and excreted from the body.  In the process, yellow pigment from the iron in each cell may be released in the blood and will produce jaundice if enough accumulates.  It is a temporary condition called physiologic jaundice that doesn't affect you later in life.|`|TORBP6QIaa	It all depends what caused the jaundice at your birth...one of my 3 sons had jaundice as a newborn but it was treated in hospital and he has never had any other problems related to it...they said his was caused possibly by a fast birth and the extensive bruising he suffered when being born.

The only thing I know to suppress sex drive is medication, but you can also lower it with basic lifestyle choices.  <br>  <br>  1.  Various MEDICATIONS lower sex drive, including anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti-androgens (sometimes used with sex offenders to decrease the risk of reoffending).    <br>  <br>  2.  DIET is another thing that people have used for centuries to lower agression, sex drive, and other "yang" forces.  Eating foods like grains, vegetables, fruits and staying away from too much meat or processed food may lower your sex drive.  <br>  <br>  3.  Fill yourself with other things.  Instead of watching things that are really competitive like wrestling or sexual like pornography, try MEDITATION or PRAYER.  When I lived in Thailand, many of the monks were celibate.  They spent a lot of time centering themselves and focusing on other things.  If you're not religious, just get involved in OTHER ACTIVITIES.<br>  <br>  Different people are born with different levels of hormones.  A strong sex drive is usually thought of as a good thing in almost any species, but if it is interfering with your life, you might want to try some of these suggestions.

Also, foods high in fat and protein (like red meat) are hard to digest, so that food sits in your stomach, rots and causes gas.    Second, stress (like school) can impair digestion. Try to relax a little, school is just school.  There are a lot of rich folks who had to to it more than once or didn't graduate at all.  It will still be there after you calm down.  Also try "Beano" for gas. Lastly, laying on your left side helps you to expel gas.  Get into a private space and let 'er rip!!

ZWP0lkPjaa	Your chance of getting heart attack becomes more because this triglyceride will get deposited on the arterial wall &the passage of flow of blood will be less which may results to blockage of artery in the heart.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Triglycerides are a form of fat in the bloodstream. People with high triglycerides often have a high total cholesterol, a high LDL (bad) cholesterol and a low HDL (good) cholesterol level. Many people with heart disease also have high triglyceride levels. Several clinical studies have shown that people with above-normal triglyceride levels (greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL) have an increased risk of heart disease. People with diabetes or who are obese are also likely to have high triglycerides.  <br>  Triglyceride Level Classification   <br>  Less than 150 mg/dL  Normal <br>  150-199 mg/dL Borderline-high <br>  200-499 mg/dL High <br>  500 mg/dL  or higher Very high <br>  Triglycerides and the risk of stroke<br>  Studies have linked high levels of blood fats called triglycerides to an increased risk of strokes (1). <br>  When the researchers accounted for other risk factors for strokes, people with more than 200 mg of triglycerides per dl of blood were nearly 30% more likely to have an ischemic stroke or TIA than people with lower levels of triglycerides. <br>  Ischemic strokes, which occur when a blood clot or narrowed artery cuts off the brain's blood supply, account for about 80% of all strokes. The other 20% of strokes are caused by a rupture in blood vessels in the brain.<br>  High triglycerides and the low levels of HDL - the 'good' - cholesterol which usually co-exist are important risk factors for the main type of stroke - ischemic strokes - among patients with heart disease.<br>  It is important to note that triglycerides are only really accurately measured after an 8 to 12 hour fast. <br>  It is believed that the triglycerides/HDL ratio is one of the most potent predictors of heart disease. It is generally considered that if this number is below 2 the person is generally at a low risk of heart disease. So, the lower your triglycerides, or the higher your HDL, the smaller this ratio becomes<br>  Several studies (2,3) suggest that the level of triglycerides in the blood may help predict heart attack risk as accurately as other, more well-known, blood fats such as HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. High triglycerides alone increased the risk of heart attack nearly 3-fold, according to a report in a 1997 issue of "Circulation" (3). And people with the highest ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol had a risk of heart attack 16 times higher than those with the lowest ratio of triglycerides to HDL in this study of 340 heart attack patients and 340 of their healthy, same age peers. "The ratio of triglycerides to HDL was the strongest predictor of a heart attack, even more accurate than the LDL/HDL ratio," reported the Harvard lead study author.<br>  Lowering your triglycerides level<br>  Fortunately, elevated triglycerides is one of the easiest problems to correct with the appropriate diet. Simple restriction of all sugars and grains.<br>  Sugars and grains and require insulin secretion, which is a potent stimulus to the liver to produce triglycerides, and sugars and grains must be reduced if you are looking to lower your triglycerides.<br>  High triglycerides in the blood are often seen in overweight people. But even people who are not overweight may have stores of fat in their arteries as a result of insulin resistance. These triglycerides in the blood are the direct result of carbohydrates from the diet being converted by insulin. These triglycerides do not come directly from dietary fats. They are made in the liver from any excess sugars which have not been used for energy.<br>  The grains are rapidly metabolized to simple sugars, which studies have clearly associated with elevated triglyceride levels. (4) The right approach is to radically reduce consumption of all simple sugars and grains. In contrast to the drug options which are traditionally applied, it is inexpensive and simple to substitute green leafy vegetables, which have a low glycemic index, for sugars and grains, and there are no toxic effects. <br>  There is an almost direct correlation between triglyceride levels and insulin levels, although more in some people than others. The way you control blood lipids is by controlling insulin. By getting the insulin levels down, you achieve a reduction in the triglycerides levels. And you get the insulin levels down through diet and exercise.<br>  Unfortunately, most people have difficulties implementing changes to their diet and exercise regimen. Transcendental meditation has helped me make marked improvements in not only my health and behavior but all aspects of my life. I highly recommend you look into it <br>  Contrary to popular belief, a low fat diet is NOT the solution to lowering high triglycerides levels. The researchers Van Horn and Lichtenstein extensively reviewed the low-fat approach a few years ago (5). Their research suggests that a low-fat diet will produce a result opposite to the desired effect: triglyceride levels will actually increase. This phenomenon is not surprising if one considers that insulin resistance may be one of the d|`|eqnRyNuPaa	hypercholestrimia|`|wM0Jce76aa	High Triglycerides - Overview<br>  What are triglycerides?<br>  <br>  Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. They are a major source of energy and the most common type of fat in your body.<br>  <br>  When you eat, your body uses the calories it needs for quick energy. Any extra calories are turned into triglycerides and stored in fat cells to be used later. The excess calories are stored as fat regardless of what kind of food you eat-fat, carbohydrate, or protein. If you regularly eat more calories than you burn, you may have high triglycerides.<br>  <br>  In normal amounts, triglycerides are important to good health. When triglyceride levels are high, it is not clear whether these high levels directly increase your risk for heart disease. But high triglycerides are often part of a group of conditions called metabolic syndrome.<br>  <br>  Metabolic syndrome is the combination of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much fat around the waist, low HDL ("good") cholesterol, and high triglycerides. This syndrome does increase your risk for heart disease as well as for diabetes and stroke.<br>  <br>  Triglycerides are measured as part of a blood test that measures your cholesterol. Normal triglyceride levels are below 150. High levels are 200 or above.<br>  What causes high triglycerides?<br>  <br>  Conditions that may cause high triglycerides include:<br>  <br>      * Obesity.<br>      * Poorly controlled diabetes.<br>      * An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).<br>      * Kidney disease.<br>      * Regularly eating more calories than you burn.<br>      * Drinking a lot of alcohol.<br>  <br>  Certain medicines may also raise triglycerides. These medicines include:<br>  <br>      * Tamoxifen.<br>      * Steroids.<br>      * Beta-blockers.<br>      * Diuretics.<br>      * Estrogen.<br>      * Birth control pills.<br>  <br>  Certain types of high cholesterol and high triglycerides are caused by genetics.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  High triglycerides usually do not cause symptoms.<br>  <br>  Sometimes high triglycerides have a genetic cause. But this is not common. In this case, high triglyceride levels may occur along with visible fatty deposits under the skin called xanthomas.<br>  <br>  In rare cases, people who have very high levels of triglycerides may develop inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). This can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever.<br>  How can you lower your high triglycerides?<br>  <br>  If you are overweight, losing weight may be the best way to lower triglycerides. You may be able to lower your triglycerides by eating fewer calories and increasing your activity. Other diet changes that might help include limiting fats and sugars, and limiting or not drinking alcohol.<br>  <br>  If increasing your activity and watching calories do not work, you may also need medicine. Medicines called statins are commonly used to lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol. But drugs called nicotinic acid (or niacin) and fibrates seem to work better for lowering triglycerides. If you have high triglycerides, high LDL cholesterol, and low HDL ("good") cholesterol, you may take more than one type of medicine that lowers cholesterol.

AA10766729	Insertion can be a little tricky and once it is in, you shouldn't feel a tampon at all.  You may either have it mis-positioned or you're using one that's too thick.  <br>  To insert (while sitting on the toilet), you should relax, take deep breaths, and angle the applicator toward your lower back (not up toward your belly).   Then push the plunger and remove the applicator.  You should be ok then.  If it's still a bit uncomfortable, give the strings a little tug and see if you can get it shifted a bit.<br>  <br>  The removal is another story.  Again, what may be happening is that you're using one that's too thick (they come in different absorancies).  To remove it, you may need to get some lube (like KY) and insert a finger along the side of the tampon and provide a bit more lubrication to help it slide out.<br>  You also need to RELAX.  When you start to stress and freak out, your vaginal muscles tighten up involuntarily and it makes it VERY hard to get the tampon out.  Take several deep breaths, sit on the toilet (or lay down on the bed) and pull GENTLY and SLOWLY on the strings.  It will probably hurt a bit, but it will eventually come out.<br>  <br>  If you want to try it again, I recommend a plastic applictor tampon (like Playtex) and use the lowest absorbancy available until you know how your flow is.  You shouldn't have to change a tampon more often than every 4 hours - if you're doing so more often than that, you need to graduate to the next absorbancy.  <br>  Also keep in mind that you will probably use different absorbancies during the beginning, middle, & end of your period.

Maybe you are using the wrong size, if you don't have heavy periods then get regular or light.  You may not be inserting it far enough inside of you and that can cause discomfort as well, be sure to relax though, if you are tense, it's harder to insert the tampon to where it should be.  read the diretions of the brand you are using...I personally like pearl tampax, they glide reallly easily and are comfortable.  If it hurts when you pull it out, you are changing the tampon too often, it needs to have some blood on it (i know that sounds gross), in order to for it to come out easier.|`|62299fab96300b0401996bb71d3fd9f1aa	no you are nervous and your vaginal muscles are tense, take deep breaths and relax.

Do NOT skip breakfast....in fact it is MOST important for losing weight...it starts, or revs up your metabolism for the day! Your plan sounds great....however, do this plan for 3 days, then take a break (and eat what you want the fourth day!) Splurge up to the 1,500 calories you'd normally eat. The next day, go back to the 3-day diet! <br>  <br>  This is the only way to diet, or loose weight and keep it off (with regular excersise of couse!) This diet is most effective b/c it doesnt slow down your metabolism and your body doesnt know your on a diet! Of it does....it'll stop the weight loss--for survival reasons!!!! The 3-day diet works best b/c you are able to TRICK your body (metabolism) by eating that 4th day! Then it'll NEVER know what's up (or realize your onto the weight loss!!) See? GREAT!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, the three days you are dieting (watching what you are eating.....try and eat like 80% veggies and fruit!!!!!! They will fill you up!!!!!!!)

It seems that diet is more important, at least for me.  Try to get some exercise in, though, even if it's just once a week.|`|FCWntPqNaa	The less you exercise the less calories you burn and thus the less calories your body actually needs.  If you stop exercising but eat the same your body will slowly gain weight even if your eating healthy because your still taking in more calories then needed to maintain the current weight.<br>  <br>  Basically as a female you should try to maintain a diet of around 1500 calories a day, less as you age, slightly more if your pregnant.  Even with only moderate exercise (ie short walks, walking up stairs instead of elevators) if you keep your calorie level in that area you should be able to maintain a healthy weight.<br>  <br>  Also remember that eating five or six smaller meals a day is actually better for losing or maintaining weight then eating less.  Your metabolism stays active longer and thus more efficiently burns calories that way so you store less fat and thus gain less weight.<br>  <br>  Of course your body type and genetic history play a part in all this as well.  Some people naturally gain a little extra fat in different areas as they age.  Others are jsut naturally skinnier.  As long as your at a healthy weight for your age and height don't stress it.|`|UUPGRGvyaa	i don't know every body is different and exercise keeps you healthy with a balanced diet

ldOSz7WEaa	Tae Kwon Do wasn't made as a weight loss program, it won't help you lose weight or fat at all. I (being a martial artists) know plenty of extremely talented martial artists that are overweight because they don't work out, but it doesn't make them any less of a great martial artist, because martial arts weren't designed with weight loss or fitness in mind. <br>  <br>  That being said, I suggest you run longer than that, like maybe find a track at a local high school and run several miles, then go eat lunch or something and go back and run a few more miles, so that you're running for 30-40 minutes with an hour break, then another 25-30 minutes. also you may want to weightlift a bit as well to help burn calories and look more tones and less chubby. Furthermore, jump-roping is a great workout thats really quick but helps a lot. get a good jump-rope and jump-rope as fast as you can for as long as you can (probably going to be between 1 and 4 minutes) then stop, drink some water, and do it again. repeat several times. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, you definitely don't want to drink sodas or eat fast food at all. If you do drink sodas (1 a day at MOST), drink regular sodas, not diet sodas (they are linked to heart problems, headaches, and loss of sleep).<br>  <br>  I believe if you're intent enough on losing that weight and train hard enough you can easily do it. However, if you notice you do look different but haven't lost weight, it is probably because you lost weight in fat, but gained weight in muscle (a relatively good thing, so don't fret).|`|Nr0c0JQgaa	it probably take you 2-3 weeks if you keep excersicing.|`|yXkk28TLaa	normally, after a week of intense exercise and diet, but that's just water weight. 5 lbs. of weight in fat takes about three weeks to a month to lose|`|uKZ8yA5Raa	Oh!

n21Ec5Xjaa	The first and best way to burn fat is to modify your current diet. There are three simple ways <br>  you can begin to modify: reduce calories, reduce sodium, and reduce fat.

I do body cleansing.  I lost 13 pounds in  9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. Cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities.  Impurites come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives etc.  The impurities get stored in the fat in our body.  To shrink the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow.

Et ces comportements seraient en hausse depuis quelques années. Pourquoi ce besoin de se faire mal ? Comment en sortir ? <br>  L'automutilation est un problème sous-estimé. Pourtant, il toucherait un nombre croissant d'adolescent et de jeunes adultes, essentiellement des femmes. Plus d'un jeune sur dix serait concerné.<br>  <br>  Pourquoi se faire mal ?<br>  <br>  L'automutilation consiste, comme son nom l'indique, à s'infliger des blessures de manière intentionnelle. Cela passe par de petites coupures avec un rasoir ou un cutter, des br?lures, des morsures… L'ado s'impose généralement cette souffrance à l'abri des regards de son entourage, en se cachant dans sa chambre ou la salle de bain. Ces blessures pratiquées de manière répétée n'ont pas pour objet d'attirer l'attention, mais semble-t-il de permettre de contr?ler ses émotions, ses angoisses, ses colères… à moins qu'il ne s'agisse d'un moyen de se réapproprier son corps. Il faut souligner une sorte de "mode" de l'automutilation - certaines stars, tel que Marilyn Manson, n'hésitant pas à se scarifier sur scène - qui n'est peut être pas sans rapport avec l'augmentation du nombre de cas.<br>  <br>  Anorexie, boulimie et automutilation<br>  <br>  Il semble y avoir des liens forts entre l'automutilation et les troubles du comportement alimentaires. Ainsi, ce besoin de se faire mal est souvent observé dans les problèmes d'anorexie. On le retrouve également dans les cas de boulimie. Cela semble logique, car troubles du comportement alimentaire et automutilation ont des causes similaires : expression d'un mal-être, volonté de ma?triser les changements de son corps… A noter, l'automutilation est également liée à l'abus d'alcool et de drogues. Mais bien s?r, il n'existe pas de règles en la matière.<br>  <br>  Le dialogue essentiel<br>  <br>  Généralement, l'automutilation s'atténue avec l'age, et dispara?t après quelques années. Mais dans quelques cas, elle peut constituer le signe annonciateur de troubles plus graves. Les parents qui découvrent ce problème ne doivent pas hésiter à orienter leur enfant vers un psychologue ou un psychiatre. L'aide d'un spécialiste aidera le jeune adulte à comprendre les raisons de son comportement. Car l'automutilation traduit un malaise profond. Et un psy peut aider à se réconcilier avec son corps, et limiter les dégats. Mais il faut aussi que la famille repense sa relation avec celui qui s'automutile. Car ce comportement dénote d'un manque d'écoute. Il est donc essentiel de réinstaurer le dialogue et d'essayer de comprendre ses appels à l'aide qui ne disent pas leur nom..

In my opinion that's superficial and conceited. If people focus on the way others look then that means they're self conscious about their themselves. My advice is to focus on the positives things about you and not the things you dislike about yourself, and you'll realize you're an awesome person with unique thin arms which you can use to reach for things which are in small places.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	OK, PMS lasts a few days to a week, at the same time every (lunar) month. The symptoms have very littl ein common with Bipolar Disorder.<br>  <br>  Bipolar is a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. These drugs are heavy duty psychiatric medications and are not to be taken lightly, and most if not all of them have a range of side effects including lethargy, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment (dumb as a box of rocks), weight gain, hormone problems, hair loss and blood problems. These side effects have to be weighed against the benefits of mood stabilisation. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|4e309178eb9eead935f22beee55a5204aa	PMS happens a week or two before a girl's period.<br>  <br>  Bipolar symptoms happen all the time.

When I was fourteen, I was plump and thought that I was too fat.  My brothers made fun of me and called me Piggy, & Hoggie.  I hated the way I looked.  I still have issues with my body wieght and struggle with it.  The good news is that you should be able to lose weight relatively quickly at your age.  Exercise and drink lots of water.  Also stay away from junk foods, and fast foods. Fine something that is physical that you can enjoy, even something as simple as taking a walk through the woods daily or jumping rope. Eat three small meals a day and snack on fruits like strawberries and carrots or celery. You'l  be alright.  Learn to love yourself as you are no matter what.  That always helps.  Sexy will come later, when you're older kid.  Take it from one who knows, and smile!
d2a0990475e0f667c5ad93ab48d28197aa	I have been on Lithium for 10 years and it really has helped.  I do have acne and my hair has gotten really coarse.  I tried Lamictal but it did not work for me and it is much more expensive.  I am also on Depakote, which helps alot as well.<br>  <br>  Some things you can do to help with the side effects of Lithium:<br>  1) Drink lots of water for the acne<br>  2) Wash your face a couple times a day<br>  3) Use strydex or other cleansing pads every day<br>  4) Talk to your hairdresser about the change in your hair (They actually know alot about things to help)<br>  <br>  Have you been drinking alot more since being on the Lithium?  Sometimes the weight gain is associated with drinking more sweet drinks.  Try water.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor if your blood lithium levels are too high!!!!   <br>  High levels can increase the side effects!<br>  <br>  The older "mood stabilizers" which include Lithium, Depakote, and Tegretol are cheapers and work for most people.  Talk to your doctor about trying Depakote or Tegretol.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	Well, you know the answer about stopping lithium. Don't do it unless you have another mood stabiliser, or you will lose it again.<br>  <br>  The side effects of Lithium are what they are. You might try asking on <a href="http://www.crazyboards.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.crazyboards.org</a> to see if any of the inmates there has a suggestion to counteract the sucky side effects.<br>  <br>  Conversely, you could look to different meds - I owe my life to Lamictal. It is no way as cheap as lithium, but you can at least get generic from Canada now, and again some of the crazyboards folk know other ways to get meds cheap/free.|`|8cd0cd4e6b518ea055a8676f0dcd2ea4aa	hi there, well many of you are probably going to scream in horror but i was on lithium for 5 yrs when one day i got this manic thought that i was going to cure myself and throw away my pills its a good job the kids phoned the hospital up when i went crazy i have refused point blank to go back on lithium i was getting like a fat barrel i take tegrotol retard, lamotrogine cyprilex I'm OK at the minute i take it you are American i am English so the advice on affording a more expensive drug is unknown to me so i wont give bulls*it advice i have read your first answerer's advice (altraist) many times and my god he is good look at his answerer's and questions|`|AA10304566	I'm sorry that you're not feeling well.<br>  <br>  I've been diagnosed bipolar/bpd and I've taken Lamictal and Depakote.  The Depakote is working really well, where I take 2000mg daily.  Unfortunately, Depakote is also known to produce hair loss in women.  I've heard some great things about Lamictal and know a few people who've had great success on it.  Lamictal has been around for a long time as well and is available in generic form, so it won't cost you too much.<br>  <br>  As per the side effects of Lithium - There is no reason to live like this.  I would be assertive in expressing these views with your Dr. and ask them if it would be a good idea to switch to Lamictal.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|493063d6139840a25805427e0c89ce9aaa	Try Lamictal if you haven't already. I gained 35 lbs. in a short time on lithium, it affected my thyroid functioning and I was put on Synthroid to correct this. Lithium is murder on your kidneys. I had to pee every ten minutes. It's toxic at levels too high and requires blood tests. Lithium interacts with too many other foods and medicines. You shouldn't be stuck on lithium because of the cost of the newer and better drugs. Talk to your doc about Lamictal and how to get help paying for it. I have no side effects on Lamictal and it is well documented as being as effective as lithium without the annoying side effects. There's a RARE fatal rash that can occur, but they start you out on low doses to avoid this risk. One doc refused to take me off lithium when I asked her for Lamictal so I found a better doc.|`|AA10594267	Hi! I've been on Lithium now for two years. In addition, I use Risperdal. I can really relate to your struggle because I recently dropped Risperdal due to side effects. I felt I was getting better and therefore wouldn't miss it. But in the three months that I was off the Risperdal I had a real crisis. I got worse than before. I had really severe obsessive thoughts which escalated into anxiety and panic attacks. Because of this, I decided to go back on the Risperdal. The benefits clearly outweighed the risks, in my case. <br>  <br>  My side effects were mainly hormonal but I have decided to live with these. I do also have acne (I am 40 and never had it before), but I never realized this could be ddue to meds. I am willing to put up with acne if it means I can live in peace.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would talk to my psy doc about it. Tell him that cost is an issue for you. You might be able to go to a lower dose of Lithium in conjunction with another drug (Risperdal costs me $30 for a months supply of 1 mg tablets). Or taper down off the Lithium and taper up on another drug. I took Depakote for a while and it wasn't that expensive. One thing to definitely think about is where you are in life right now. Is this a very stressful time? If so, wait a few months before you consider changing meds.<br>  <br>  Hopefully your doc will listen and work with you. Good luck!
62565fcbe02eb11d89970b3b07df5120aa	I have heard that there is an actual condition, and you can get medicine or surgery. But you'd have to ask a Dr. or find out more on the internet.|`|ffe49c6d56b9db1118e6668191643be6aa	i really don't have any advice;you have 2 ask a doctor as soon as possible
AA12209194	Sit ups WILL NOT help you lose fat.<br>  <br>  You need to do some fat burning exercise like walking, running, swimming, or rowing machine.  <br>  <br>  You CAN NOT target areas for fat loss, except if you have liposuction.<br>  <br>  Sit ups will make your stomach stronger, but you will never see those muscles unless you lose the fat.  It is unfortunate that there are so many phoney products and advertisements that suggest otherwise.<br>  <br>  You need to do a good half hour to an hour 3-4 times per week if you want quick results.  Make sure you eat well, and concentrate on a gradual progress towards fit and healthy habits.<br>  <br>  If anyone suggests a method of 'targeting' that fat on your lower stomach, then they are misinformed.  Like when your body puts on fat, you have no control.  You can't say oh, please put this pie on my breasts, my *** is big enough already!!!  :)    In fact, it seems typical that the first place you put on weight is the last place you will lose it.  It is also common that women will have trouble with their any of: upper arms, thighs, stomach, or buttocks, whereas men will mainly have trouble with the stomach area.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you CAN target muscle groups to improve in strength, which is what sit ups are for.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Be patient, and exercise every day moderately, or every second day if you are being more intense in your exercise.<br>  <br>  Posture is also important for women - that doesnt mean 'suck it in', it means that you should concentrate on standing straight which will improve your appearance and make you look more attractive, powerful, and confident too.|`|Ujazp3txaa	try leg lifts it works do it every other day|`|84978RbJaa	Read this article for exercise ideas on how to lose belly fat<br>  <br>  all the best<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/cat/lose-belly-fat/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/cat/...</a>|`|AA11102993	Winsor pilates it great for the stomach.<br>  one good workout for the lower pooch is laying on the floor your feet and a 90 degree angle  put your hands behind your head and lower your legs down to a 45 degree angle (the lower you go the more work)<br>  do that everyday about 20 times<br>  and it should help!|`|d0YmmreJaa	To lose body fat, you need to add more cardio.  As for a lower ab exercise, do knee-raises.  They can be done with a chair at home, or at the gym (see link).  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thefinalsprint.com/images/2006/12/knee-raises.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefinalsprint.com/images/200...</a><br>  <br>  As for spot reduction of body fat, the true answer is that it is possible.  However, the increased reduction is minimal (~1-3% more).  Exercising a given area causes more blood to circulate to that area and promotes more efficient fat reduction.  But again, the increase is minimal and you would hardly notice it.  <br>  <br>  In short, get outside and break a sweat.
ThfxNwmSaa	I had some teeth pulled by an oral surgeon and I have to tell you I dont think you would want to be exercising 2 days after you get your teeth pulled. For one the mouth is so vascular and they bleed easily. Once the clot sets in you do NOT want to disturb it for you can get a dry socket syndrome and I heard it is sore. Another thing is you have to eat soft foods and gargle a lot. You might have to take a week off and need some pain killers depending on how many and how bad they are after.<br>  <br>  If I were you and speaking from experience, take at least a week off and take care of yourself in a different way. Rest and take it easy. trust me it will be well worth it. Goodluck!|`|t74kntjeaa	I'd be amazed if you felt like doing any exercise ,after having my four wisdom teeth removed i wanted to die ,the pain was the worst Ive ever felt,  i was counting the minutes before i could take my next painkiller, i have girlfriends who have said that as well and they have had babies, also i once caught my d**k in the zipper of a sleeping bag and had to have five stitches and that wasn't as painful , so the chances of you feeling like doing a couple of miles on a treadmill are pretty slim your best idea is rest for a week and my heart is with you. there is one added bonus you wont feel like eating so you'll lose weight anyway and without your wisdom teeth your cheekbones look higher good luck!|`|Jr8A4zFkaa	Quite honestly I would take it easy for about 5 days then do some cardio.

f78e22236cf1782ee68c8eb13601bb23aa	You didn't mention breakfast. In order to lose weight you NEED to eat breakfast. It kickstarts your metabolism. You need to eat more. Not eating only causes you to OVEREAT later, thus totally foiling your plan of not eating a lot. What you should eat is pretty self-explanatory. But you need to eat three meals or you can snack about 5-6 times a day. Eat healthy stuff like: fruit, vegetables, nuts, yogurt, salads, meats, cereals. Try and knock out fast food(if you eat any). Or at least eat it in moderation, maybe once every 2 weeks if you REALLY have to have it. (which you really don't, but i can understand if you crave) You musn't feel like your restricting yourself, you should eat what you want, but in moderation and at appropriate times. You shouldn't eat cake for breakfast even if its a small piece. You should try to cut out most sweets anyways, and watch your bread intake also, don't overload on it. Drink PLENTY of water, all the time, water water water. But way to go on the walking, thats great! Trust me, I know how you feel, i have the same weight goal of about 120. If you want, we can keep in touch and let each other know about our progress. Good luck though. I know you can do it!|`|WdcF8DpXaa	Diet tips<br>   <br>  <br>  To effectively lose weight you must eat a healthy and balanced diet.  Fad diets, pills, and other gimmicks are not effective or healthy.  While these products usually produce short term results, they have more side effects than benefits.  <br>  <br>    <br>   <br>  <br>  Here is a simple breakdown.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Carbohydrates should be 60% of your daily diet <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy.  You must consume enough carbohydrates daily to remain healthy.  Restricting your calories with low-carbohydrate diets decreases your energy. <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Types of Carbohydrates<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Simple carbohydrates like (sugars, including glucose and fructose from fruit and vegetables, lactose from milk, and sucrose from cane or beet sugar)<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Complex carbohydrates like (carrots, broccoli, corn, potatoes, bread, cereal, pasta, rice, and beans) which contain glucose, fiber, and other nutrients. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Fat should be 30% of your daily diet <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Fat adds flavor to food, and is an important component of a healthy diet.  Fat is necessary for energy production, transporting fat soluble vitamins, protection of internal organs, insulation, healthy skin, hair, and supplying the linoleic acid[1].  <br>   <br>  <br>  Types of fat<br>   <br>  <br>  1.  Triglycerides  are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They're also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.  Saturated fats come primarily from animal sources: <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  EXAMPLES<br>   <br>  <br>  Butter, whole milk, dairy products, and meats.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Coconut and palm oils are also high in saturated fat.  Saturated fat raises cholesterol[2] levels more than any element in your diet.   Less than 10% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat sources. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3.  Unsaturated fats can be either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Monounsaturated fats. This type of fat can reduce LDL cholesterol without affecting beneficial HDL’s.  This is the preferred form of fat in a diet.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Examples include olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, and avocado oil. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Polyunsaturated Fats are divided into omega-6 vegetable oils and omega-3 fish oils. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Examples include sunflower, corn, and sesame.   The omega-3 oils come from fish like mackerel, halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, and whitefish.   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Benefits of Omega-3 oils are decreased blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood clotting.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  THE PROBLEM:<br>  <br>  Most people eat almost twice as much fat as the human body is designed to handle.  36% to 41% of total daily calories often come from fat. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Protein should be 10% of your daily diet <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Protein builds and repairs muscle, red blood cells, hair, and other tissues.  Protein is also necessary for the synthesizing hormones.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Examples from plants include: Fruits, grains, and vegetables. <br>   <br>  <br>  Examples from legumes include: Dried beans or tofu with rice or bread. <br>   <br>  <br>  Meat is a good source of protein, but too much may lead to high cholesterol.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Here are some less fatty cuts of meat<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Beef…………….Top round, eye of round, round steak, rump roast, sirloin tip,    short lion, strip steak lean, lean and extra lean ground beef. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Pork……………Tenderloin, sirloin roast or chop, center cut loin chops<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Lamb…………   Foreshank, leg roast, leg chop, loin chop <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  HOW TO PLAN A DIET<br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  STEP 1<br>  <br>    DETERMINE YOU’RE EATING PATTERNS<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Take a few days to record what you are eating and drinking, being specific as possible.  Logging your diet will give you an idea of what and when you are eating.  Tracking your diet is important in determining the changes needed.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Visit www.thebrim.com/fitness and use the calorie counter to determine the breakdown of calories for most foods.

Give them one days rest, over the counter pain medications like Aspirin Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen will help, as will stretching, a warm bath soak. <br>  <br>  DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) can come on 24-48 hours after working out and is normal, but can be up to severe. If the pain is severe take an additional day before going back to exercising, as the pain is caused my microfibre tears in the muscles, they need to re-build! <br>  <br>  Something else that works: a body builder taught me - eat protein the day after a workout and sleep up to 10 hours a night. Rest and rebuild and you'll heal faster. <br>  <br>  Preventative: Warm up before crunches and stretch after!|`|hlI2hgk4aa	it wont but u haf to waiit 2 days b4 doing them again

I was put into  a runaway home a few times.  My stepmom got me fired from my job when I was fifteen, and I was the only one in the house with a job, and going to school.  It was very difficult.

Chaque montée sur la balance sera une résurrection. <br>  <br>  Maintenant pour ce qui est de mes conseils, je te recommande de ne surtout pas te prendre la tête au quotidien. Dis toi que cela ne doit pas te ronger l'esprit du matin au soir.  Appréhende la chose sereinement.<br>  <br>  Ensuite réduit un élément dans tes repas ou une habitude qui selon toi ta fait prendre beaucoup de kilos, ou qqch sur lequel tu te vengeait pourrait-on dire. Je pense notamment au fromage, le plus souvent , qui peut charger le repas.<br>  <br>  Ensuite pense à manger un maximum de légumes et un fruit au moins ou un yahourt.

Laisse donc parler ton corps, ne cherche pas à calculer le nombre exact de calorie ingérée.<br>  <br>  Pour la suite je préconise de te faire plaisir au moins 2 fois par semaine si ce n'est plus, en tous cas jamais deux fois de suite car les cellules de ton corps risqueraient de s'habituer et par voie de conséquence d'en redemander. <br>  <br>  En somme il faut que tu habitues ton corps, tes cellules, petit à petit à changer d'hygiène de vie.<br>  <br>  L'idée c'est de tenir au moins trois mois comme ?a sans que ce soit non plus une torture et tu verras par la suite que ton corps te réclamera beaucoup moins et que tu ne penseras même plus à aller fouiller le coin à gateaux ou le frigo.<br>  <br>  Enfin pour finir, tu dois erradiquer le grignotage. Si tu fais un régime, tu devras vivre sans, en tous cas pour commencer.

S2we6bYVaa	Cuma sharing aja. Dulu aku juga pernah punya pengalaman seperti Anda. Sebelumnya, Anda sendirilah yang harus mendiagnosa diri Anda sehingga Anda nggak pernah nyenyak tidur malam, sementara tidur malam itu penting buat recovery semua sel-sel tubuh. Mungkin karena Anda terlalu cape bekerja, tingkat stres yang tinggi, terlalu banyak pikiran/beban, dll. Cara yang menurut saya cukup ampuh adalah sebelum tidur, saya menuliskan semua uneg2 saya di buku khusus yang terkait dengan hari itu. Kebanyakan sih rasa bete dan marah. Lepasin aja semua beban pikiran. Kalau udah, coba deh untuk matiin lampu (atau kalau nggak berani :D), ganti aja pake lampu yang agak redup kira2 10 menit sebelum tidur. Setelah bersih2 seperti cuci muka, cuci kaki, dll, mungkin ada baiknya Anda matikan semua alat elektronik seperti tv yang ada di kamar tidur atau kalau nggak mau (karena sepinya) bisa aj Anda putar radio. Biasanya jam2 10-12an malam gitu, lagunya dah lagu pengantar tidur alias lagu slow. Setelah itu berdoa lah sebelum tidur. Kalau mau juga, Anda bisa meminum segelas susu putih hangat sebelum tidur. Mudah2an resep saya bisa juga diterapkan ke Anda. Semoga berguna...Have a nice dream|`|9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  Ada beberapa hal yang membuat anda kesulitan untuk tidur, yakni stress, lapar atau haus, sirkulasi udara yang kurang baik, dan lainnya.<br>  <br>  Cara mengatasinya yaitu:<br>  - Makan dan minum secukupnya sebelum tidur,\<br>  - Buang air,<br>  - Hilangkan pikiran-pikiran berat yang dapat membuat stress, - Buka pintu kamar anda (jika perlu agar sirkulasi udara berjalan dengan baik),<br>  - Singkirkan tumbuhan dari kamar anda (jika ada karena tumbuhan memproduksi CO2 atau Karbon Dioksida pada malam hari),<br>  - Aturlah tata cahaya kamar anda sesuai dengan kenyamanan anda sendiri,<br>  - Pakailah selimut (daripada menggunakan obat nyamuk semprot atau bakar yang dapat mengganggu pernafasan anda, dan selimut dapat membuah tubuh anda terbebas dari hawa dingin),<br>  - Berdoa sebelum tidur.<br>  <br>  Jika cara diatas tidak berhasil, cobalah simak televisi atau membaca koran atau majalah dengan posisi terbaring dengan posisi leher dan kepala berada lebih tinggi diatas dada anda dengan disangga oleh bantal (supaya mata tidak rusak), dengan cara ini mudah-mudahan anda akan tertidur dengan lelap.<br>  <br>  Komsumsi obat tidur kurang baik bagi kesehatan :)<br>  <br>  Jangan lupa sediakan air minum di dekat tempat tidur anda, hal ini mengatasi anda berjalan jauh untuk mengambil minum jika terbangun di malam hari.<br>  <br>  Semoga jawaban diatas dapat membantu anda,<br>  Terima kasih.|`|AA12026968	bercinta dulu sebelum tidur. :D|`|I4OqkQP0aa	untuk bisa tidur nyenyak setiap malam ada beberapa cara; pertama usahakan kondisi pikiran dalam keadaan tenang, dan jangan berpikir menjelang tidur, karena pikiran tersebut akan mempengaruhi kondisi anda pada saat tidur dan mengakibatkan pusing pada saat bangun esok harinya. kedua, anda bisa mengatur suhu ruangan kamar sekitar 26-28 derajat celcius, dan sebisa mungkin menggunakan penerangan yang redup untuk merilekskan keadaan.

AA12381247	Everything about periods is right here…scroll down til you see what you’re looking for.<br>   <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm</a><br>  Hi. Welcome to the Q and A part of the site. Here's a chance to get answers to your questions without actually having to ask them out loud. There's also a list of other resources at the end of the section. If you're still thirsting for knowledge, talk with a parent, teacher or other trusted adult.<br>  <br>  * When will I get my first period?<br>  * Good question. Most girls get their first period between the ages of 9 and 16. Most means the majority - not everyone will fall into this category. Anyway, it follows the development of breasts, hips, waist, pubic hair, and a growth spurt. Put those clues together and they usually add up to imminent period alert. In addition, a girl will often weigh at least 100 pounds before menstruation begins. Genetics also plays a role. If possible, find out when your mom got her first period to get an estimate of when yours may arrive.<br>  * What will happen when I get my first period?<br>  * Usually a first period is very light. It will probably be a few spots of bright red blood or a brown sticky stain that shows up on your underpants. If you are out in public and don't have a pad with you, don't panic. Remain calm. This is a time when true female bonding occurs. Hopefully, your mother or other adult relative will be close by and can supply you with a feminine product. If not, try Plan B. Ask a friend or other woman if she has a pad. It's a well-kept secret that every woman at some time in her life has had to ask another woman for a pad. Yes, it's embarrassing, but you can rely on other women to see you through this situation. And in all honesty, first periods were designed really well because it is usually so little that it won't seep through to your outer clothes.<br>  * How long will my period last?<br>  * Everyone is different. It can last between two and seven days. Most girls have it for about five days.<br>  * What should I do when I get my first period?<br>  * In addition to what's covered above, it's a good idea to have feminine products ready for that first period, and to know how to use them. (See the Kotex products section of our site for more information about these products.)<br>  * What if I get my period at school?<br>  * If you have a pad with you, go to the girls' room and put it on. If you don't have one, go to the school nurse, the office, or wherever you can get a pad. How about keeping a pad at school in case of emergency? If you don't need it, maybe one of your friends will and she can return the favor some day soon.<br>  * What if my flow is really heavy and I have to use lots of pads?<br>  * It's probably just a heavy flow, which can happen during a period's first day or two. Some girls normally experience a heavy flow. If you have a prolonged heavy flow, call your doctor.<br>  * Will I have to stop activities such as sports when I have my period?<br>  * No. These days it's hard to use a period as an excuse to get out of gym class. Believe it or not, the more active you are, the less likely you are to have cramps. And, if you're worried about leaking during sports activities, check out the Kotex products section of the website to find out how to help prevent leaks by using a pad or tampon that fits you and your period.<br>  * How often will I get my period?<br>  * Cycles range anywhere between 21 to 45 days. The average is 28 days. At first, it will probably be irregular. The time between when you get it, the length and time you have it, and the amount of flow will all vary. As your body finds its own internal rhythm, your period will settle into a pattern. It can take a year or two. Mark your periods on a calendar to get used to following your cycle.<br>  * Can I go swimming when I have my period?<br>  * Yes, but don't wear a pad. It will swell up like an inflatable raft. If you want to swim, you should wear a tampon. But first, talk it over with your parent or other responsible adult before trying this (the tampon, not the swimming).<br>  <br>  Please see Questions and Answers about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Or, check out Important Information about Toxic Shock Syndrome.<br>  * Can I take a bath when I have my period?<br>  * Yes. In fact, a bath or a shower is really important at this time to keep you clean and to fight off any odors that may occur.<br>  * Will getting my period hurt?<br>  * The actually bleeding part doesn't hurt. The menstrual cramps are uncomfortable but manageable.<br>  * What do cramps feel like?<br>  * You've probably already guessed this, but cramps don't feel good. Cramps are a pain. And they're particularly a pain around the area of the uterus that is below your belly button. Sometimes they lodge in your lower back. Cramps are caused by the uterus contracting. You can get them just before and during your period. Some girls have a few cramps, some have lots, and then there are those who have none. The intensity of the cramps varies, and you may not get them every time you have your period. They can be managed with over the counter pain relief medication. Ask your doctor for more information.<br>  * What is menstruation, anyway?<br>  * This is strictly a biological explanation so hold on. Menstruation is your monthly opportunity to create a baby. When your body first becomes able to produce a child, usually between the ages of 9 and 16, it begins preparation once a month for possible motherhood. This time in your life is known as menarche ("muh-NAE-key"). A tiny egg matures in one of your ovaries, then travels down a fallopian tube toward your uterus. Your uterus, meanwhile, has been preparing for the egg's arrival, and its lining has gotten thick and velvety. If the arriving egg is fertilized by a sperm, your uterus is all set to protect and nourish the developing baby for the next nine months. If the egg doesn't get fertilized - because there is no sperm present, then your uterus has no use for that thick, spongy lining. So it sheds the lining and flushes it out - along with some blood, body fluids, and the disintegrated egg. For 2 to 6 days each month, all this stuff flows out of your body through your vagina as reddish-brown menstrual flow. After the onset of menstruation, you'll usually have a menstrual period about every 28 days (except during pregnancy) although your cycle may vary anywhere from 20 to 35 days. Flash forward about 40 years, when your body enters menopause. Your ovaries stop producing eggs and your periods stop.<br>  * What does it mean if my period is late or irregular?<br>  * Irregular periods for the first couple of years are normal. But, after that, when you've started to menstruate regularly, missing a period may be a sign of pregnancy (if you are sexually active). Other causes of irregularity include a change in diet, increase in exercise or drug use. The best advice is to chat with your health care provider if you're concerned.<br>  * Will other people know I'm having my period?<br>  * When you're having your period, you don't want the world to know. Regular bathing, proper use of pads and/or tampons and loose, comfortable clothes are a good strategy to keep your period from sticking out in a crowd.<br>  * Why do I feel crabby and sad right before my period?<br>  * PMS. Those three little letters pack a punch, don't they? Moodiness, anxiety and depression are all part of premenstrual syndrome's big bag o' tricks. Again, some women don't get PMS and no guy on the planet "gets" PMS. So if you're suffering with headaches, backaches, pimples, nausea and food cravings, call a friend, the kind who will understand, and talk about it. She may have some advice on ways to find relief. Or, visit "lets talk" to chat with other girls who might be going through the same thing.<br>  * What causes PMS and why do I feel so darn fat?<br>  * PMS symptoms are caused by hormonal changes that take place prior to menstruation. As hormone levels even out, PMS symptoms gradually disappear. The emotions and problems that seemed overwhelming suddenly feel manageable. Get to know your cycle and you will know when to head off PMS.<br>  <br>  As for the "fat thing." Here's the skinny. Just before and during your period, your body tends to retain water. This added fluid might make you feel bloated or your breasts feel tender. It's normal to gain a couple pounds during this time of the month - and ditch them when your period is over. If you feel like a water balloon, pull on some loose, comfortable clothing. Don't even think about using a pair of pliers to pull up the zipper on your favorite jeans. It's not worth the discomfort. Avoiding salt immediately before and during your period is also a good idea. Salt increases water retention.<br>  * What if I bleed through my clothes?<br>  * Ick. Ick. Ick. And it has happened to almost every woman. First step is damage control. Tie a sweater or jacket around your waist or untuck your shirt. If that's not an option, have a good friend walk directly behind you on the way to the bathroom. Find the closest tampon or pad. When you get to the bathroom, check to see if you can blot out any noticeable spots. If it's a hopeless situation, take a trip to the nurse's office and see if someone can bring you a change of clothes from home. If you are at work or out shopping, try to call it a day and head home. Soaking your underwear or other clothes in cold water and using a stain remover can usually get out any blood stains. O.k., now an important word about preventing this from ever, ever, ever happening again. Being proactive can keep this from being a worst-day-ever type of situation. In the future, stash an extra pair of underwear in your locker and wear dark clothes on days when you're expecting your period or when your flow is at its heaviest. Plan on changing your feminine product on a regular basis. Don't wait until it's too late because you're busy. Wear the right product for your flow.

And do you go back to having the same kind of cycle as before pregnancy? Friends have told me that after childbirth, cramps are lessened. <br>  Brown: Each woman is different. Some women find that they no longer have cramps; others claim there is no change. If you are not breastfeeding, you generally will start menstruating six to eight weeks postpartum. If you are breastfeeding, you may not menstruate until you wean the baby. Other women get their period back but continue to breastfeed. Your first period after childbirth is often much heaver and lasts longer than usual. <br>  Breastfeeding is not a form of contraception. It is the sensation of the baby sucking that sends a message to the brain to suppress the hormone that stimulates ovulation. This means that the baby needs to be almost continuously sucking for the brain to block ovulation. In Western societies, most women do not go around with the baby at their breast all the time. <br>  In some cases if the baby sucks its thumb or a pacifier, this may be enough to diminish the intensity of his sucking. <br>  <br>   <br>  Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)<br>  Introduction<br>  Even if you're not familiar with the term "dysmenorrhea," if you're a woman, chances are you've experienced it at some time in your life. Dysmenorrhea is simply the medical term for menstrual cramps, that dull or throbbing pain in the lower abdomen many women experience just before and during their menstrual periods. For some women, the discomfort is merely annoying. For others, it can be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities for a few days every month.<br>  Dysmenorrhea can be primary or secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea involves no physical abnormality and usually begins within three years after you begin menstruating. Secondary dysmenorrhea involves an underlying physical cause, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids.<br>  If you have primary dysmenorrhea, there are some measures you can take to ease the discomfort. You can also take comfort in knowing that cramps tend to decrease in intensity as you get older and often disappear after pregnancy. For secondary dysmenorrhea, managing your cramps involves treating the underlying cause.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most women experience menstrual cramps at some time in their lives. Cramps become problematic when they're severe enough to keep you from going about your day-to-day routine.<br>  If you have primary dysmenorrhea, cramps most likely began within three years after you started menstruating. They may persist through your 20s or until you deliver a child and, for unknown reasons, they're likely to decrease in intensity or go away entirely. With secondary dysmenorrhea, cramps may start or return later in life, but can begin anytime after you begin menstruating.<br>  Signs and symptoms of dysmenorrhea, whether primary or secondary, may include:<br>  ·Dull or throbbing pain in your lower abdomen<br>  ·Pain that radiates to your lower back and thighs<br>  Less common signs and symptoms include:<br>  ·Nausea and vomiting<br>  ·Loose stools<br>  ·Sweating<br>  ·Dizziness<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  CLICK TO ENLARGE<br>   Normal ovulation <br>   <br>  To create a nourishing environment for a fertilized egg, the female sex hormone estrogen causes your uterine lining (endometrium) to thicken every month. Soon after, a follicle — a tiny sac in your ovary that contains a single egg (ovum) — ruptures and releases its egg (ovulation). If the egg becomes fertilized by contact with a sperm on its way to your uterus, the egg implants in the lining of the uterus. However, most often the unfertilized egg passes through your uterus and out of your body. Shortly thereafter, your uterus releases the lining, and your menstrual flow begins.<br>  To help expel its lining, your uterus contracts. Prostaglandins, hormone-like substances involved in pain and inflammation, trigger the uterine muscle contractions. No one knows for sure, but many experts believe that prostaglandins cause menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea).<br>  A number of conditions can cause secondary dysmenorrhea. They include:<br>  ·Endometriosis. In this painful condition, the type of tissue that lines your uterus becomes implanted outside your uterus, most commonly on your fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis.<br>  ·Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This infection of the female reproductive organs is usually caused by sexually transmitted bacteria.<br>  ·Use of an intrauterine device (IUD). These small, plastic, T-shaped birth control devices are inserted into your uterus. They may cause increased cramping, particularly during the first few months after insertion.<br>  ·Uterine fibroids and uterine polyps. These noncancerous tumors and growths protrude from the lining of your uterus.<br>  Risk factors<br>  You're more likely to have severe menstrual cramps if you have one or both of the following:<br>  ·Early onset of puberty (age 11 or younger)<br>  ·A family history of painful periods<br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  If you've started menstruating within the past few years and are experiencing cramps, chances are your menstrual pain is primary dysmenorrhea and not a cause for concern. However, if cramping disrupts your life for several days a month or if you're older and just started experiencing severe menstrual cramps, see your doctor. If you have secondary dysmenorrhea, pinpointing the underlying cause is the first step to successful treatment.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a physical examination, including a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam, your doctor will check for any abnormalities in your reproductive organs and look for indications of infection.<br>  To rule out other causes of your symptoms or to identify the cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, your doctor may request diagnostic tests, such as:<br>  ·Imaging tests. Noninvasive tests that enable your doctor to look for abnormalities inside your pelvic cavity include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>  ·Laparoscopy. This surgical procedure involves your doctor viewing your pelvic cavity by making tiny incisions in your abdomen and inserting a fiber-optic tube with a small camera lens.<br>  ·Hysteroscopy. In this procedure, your doctor inserts an instrument through your vagina and your cervical canal to examine your cervical canal and the inside of your uterus.<br>  Complications<br>  The complications of secondary dysmenorrhea depend on the underlying cause. For instance, pelvic inflammatory disease can scar your fallopian tubes and compromise reproductive health. The scarring can lead to an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tube rather than traveling through the tube to implant in your uterus, or it implants somewhere else outside your uterus. Endometriosis, another possible cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, can lead to impaired fertility.<br>  Treatment<br>  For secondary dysmenorrhea, you'll need treatment for the underlying cause. Depending on the cause, treatment could include antibiotics to treat infection or surgery to remove fibroids or polyps.<br>  You may be able to reduce your discomfort from dysmenorrhea by using an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or naproxen (Aleve). Self-care strategies also may help relieve discomfort. For severe cramping, your doctor might recommend low-dose oral contraceptives to prevent ovulation, which may reduce the production of prostaglandins and therefore the severity of your cramps.<br>  Self-care<br>  You can try a number of self-care strategies to reduce the discomfort of primary dysmenorrhea. Once the pain begins, soaking in a hot bath or using a heating pad on your abdomen may ease your cramps. You can also make some lifestyle changes to improve your overall health and possibly decrease the severity of your cramps. Try these tips:<br>  ·Exercise regularly. Exercise results in an increased release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers.<br>  ·Get adequate rest. Your body may be less vulnerable to pain when you're well rested.<br>  Complementary and alternative medicine<br>  Some women find relief through massage, yoga or meditation, all stress-relieving activities that may help to lessen pain and aren't likely to harm you. Some women find acupuncture helpful for pain relief. The National Institutes of Health issued a consensus statement in 1998 stating that acupuncture may help relieve certain types of pain, including menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  We hear a lot about the menstrual "cycle," which can make it sound as though it happens like clockwork. And we say that a woman who gets her period every 4 weeks is "regular," as though there's usually something abnormal about women who don't. In fact, most women don't get their periods at exactly the same number of days after the last one.<br>  Let's take a look at what happens when a girl gets her first period (also known as menarche, pronounced: meh-nar-kee). For most girls, this happens between the ages of 9 and 16.<br>  Your menstrual cycle occurs in stages, which doctors often talk about in terms of 28 days. But 28 is just an average figure that doctors use. Women's cycle lengths vary - some have a 24-day cycle, some have a 34-day cycle. The only thing you can usually count on is that if you're not pregnant, nursing, or ill, you will get your period again.<br>  The first day a girl's period comes is Day 1 of her cycle. Around Day 5, her pituitary gland tells the ovaries to start preparing one of the eggs they contain for release. One egg will mature completely, and at the same time the lining of the uterus gets thicker. The lining becomes thick to prepare a nesting place for the fertilized egg in the event that the girl becomes pregnant.<br>  On or about Day 14, the egg breaks loose (this is called ovulation) and makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If the egg hasn't been fertilized by sperm, it will disintegrate. About 2 weeks later, the lining and egg leave a girl's body as her period and the whole thing starts all over again - that's why we use the word cycle.<br>  All this sounds very neat and orderly, but your body may not follow this schedule exactly. It's not unusual, especially in the first 2 years after menarche, to skip periods or to have an irregular menstrual cycle. Illness, rapid weight change, or stress can also make things more unpredictable because the part of the brain that regulates periods is influenced by stuff like this.<br>  Some girls always have irregular periods; others get theirs every 28 days like clockwork. Many are regular most of the time, but occasionally skip a period or get an extra period during times of pressure or stress. In fact, you may notice that when you go on a trip or have a major change in your schedule your period is late.<br>  The length of your periods may also vary - sometimes your period may last 2 days, sometimes 10. That's because the level of hormones your body manufactures can be different from one cycle to the next and this affects the amount and length of bleeding.<br>  So how can you tell when you're about to get your period? If you're not regular, you'll want to pay attention to the clues your body may give you. These include:<br>  ·back cramps or stiffness<br>  ·heavier breasts or breast soreness (this will happen after ovulation and before you get your period)<br>  ·headaches<br>  ·acne breakouts<br>  ·disturbed sleep patterns<br>  ·mood swings<br>  If you're not taking birth control pills, you're not pregnant, and you're not having other symptoms such as stomach pain, then it's very likely that your irregular periods are part of the normal changes that can happen when you're a teen. At some point as you grow, your cycle will probably settle into a recognizable pattern. This should happen by 3 years after your first period.<br>  Some teens may develop irregular periods - or stop having periods altogether - as a result of a hormone imbalance. Disorders of the thyroid gland can cause menstrual irregularities if the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood become too low or too high. Some women have irregular periods because their bodies produce too much androgen, which is a hormone that causes increased muscle mass, facial hair, and deepening of the voice in males and the development of pubic hair and increased height in girls. High amounts of androgen can also cause hair growth on the face, chin, chest, and abdomen, and is sometimes associated with excessive weight gain.<br>  If a girl has one of these problems, or if her periods are irregular for 3 years or more (or for other reasons), the doctor may prescribe hormone pills or other medications that will help her to have regular periods.<br>  In the meantime, if your periods are irregular, try keeping some pads or tampons in your backpack, just so you'll have them handy in case your period comes when you're not expecting it.<br>  It's important to see a doctor if you're sexually active and have missed a period - this could be a sign that you're pregnant. You should also see your doctor if you start having periods that last longer than 7 to 10 days or periods that are accompanied by severe cramping or abdominal pain.<br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/irregular_periods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a><br>  <br>  Irregular periods<br>  by Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP<br>  To begin with, let me reassure you that most irregular periods are benign. Missed periods, too frequent periods, spotting, or bouts of heavy clotting and bleeding are usually caused by an underlying hormonal imbalance that is easily treated.<br>  Most of us have missed a period at one point or another — some with anticipation of a pregnancy, others because of anxiety or tension. At the clinic, we see women who menstruate like clockwork, while others report never having had a regular cycle. One thing is a given, however: shifts in hormonal balance will alter whatever pattern a woman has experienced in the past. Such shifts are especially common in perimenopause.<br>  What is an irregular period?<br>  At the clinic we answer questions all the time about irregular periods. A textbook period happens every 24-29 days, but in truth what is “regular” covers a wide range. Cycles between 23–35 days are very common. A woman may get her period only one to four times a year. Or she might have periods that occur two to three times in a month and involve spotting or extremely heavy flow. Alternatively, she may have heavy episodes of bleeding every two to three months. Irregular periods are simply what is irregular for you.<br>  For the most part, we don’t worry at the clinic about a missed period or two over the course of a year. More variation than that may indicate to us the beginning of perimenopause or a disruption of the natural chain of hormonal events that controls menstruation. A wide variety of factors can be responsible for irregular periods, among them:<br>  ·Significant weight gain or loss<br>  ·Over-exercise<br>  ·Poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates)<br>  ·Smoking<br>  ·Drug use<br>  ·Caffeine<br>  ·Excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone) <br>  ·Eating disorders<br>  ·Increased stress<br>  ·Polycystic ovarian syndrome/estrogen dominance<br>  ·Uterine abnormalities (fibroids/cysts/polyps/endometriosis)<br>  ·Hormonal imbalance related to perimenopause<br>  ·Medications<br>  ·Chemotherapy<br>  ·Recent childbirth, miscarriage, or D&C <br>  ·Breastfeeding <br>  As you can see, there are many different ways a woman can be irregular for as many different reasons, and it can be very confusing when it happens.<br>  Why does being stressed out cause irregular periods?<br>  When we are under stress, regardless of the source (danger, personal relationships, work, environment) our adrenal glands are designed to secrete the hormone cortisol (see our articles on adrenal fatigue). Cortisol has a direct impact on the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA. Eating disorders, dieting, drug use, and reliance on stimulants like caffeine and alcohol are also interpreted by the body as kinds of stress. Poor nutrition seems to physically change the proteins in the brain so they can no longer send the proper signals for normal ovulation.<br>  Am I in menopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  No — irregular periods are generally an indication of hormonal imbalance, not necessarily related to menopause. Strictly speaking, women aren’t considered menopausal until they have gone for one year without a menstrual period.<br>  If you have not had a menstrual period for a full year and then experience bleeding, this is different from irregular periods. We explain this in more detail in our article on post-menopausal bleeding.<br>  By the way, it is a myth that a woman goes into menopause because her body runs out of eggs. If this were true, then women who experienced menarche (the first period in a woman’s life) earlier would enter menopause earlier. In fact, the opposite is true — early menarche is associated with late menopause. In the same vein, women who had more pregnancies and thereby fewer periods, would have menopause later, and that doesn’t happen, either. If you are experiencing increasing irregularity, you may be suffering from hormonal imbalance or entering perimenopause, and should be evaluated by a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Am I in perimenopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  Not necessarily, but irregular periods are one of the most common signals of perimenopause. That’s why it’s best to check in with a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Women entering perimenopause often have irregular periods due to an imbalance of progesterone that upsets their cycle. Because progesterone regulates the amount and length of bleeding, periods can last longer and be accompanied by very heavy bleeding (also called menorrhagia or hypermenorrhagia). However, shorter or spottier periods can also indicate perimenopause. Click here to learn more about irregular periods in perimenopause.<br>  What does it mean if I miss a period or two?<br>  The most common type of irregular period we see at the clinic is anovulation, or a cycle in which a woman does not ovulate (i.e., does not release an egg). This is frequently the cause of a missed period (an anovulatory cycle) and is considered normal if it occurs only once or twice a year. Clotting is also considered normal if it is cyclic.<br>  Sporadic episodes of poor diet, high stress, emotional trauma, illness, or strenuous physical exercise are the usual suspects behind occasional anovulatory cycles. Sometimes something as simple as a family holiday or a week with the in-laws will play havoc with a menstrual cycle. Monthly periods are quite susceptible to dips and spikes in our emotions and our health. For the most part, once our lives return to normal, so do our periods.<br>  On the other hand, a woman will sometimes skip her period for a few months and then start a heavy period that lasts for days or even weeks. This can be a sign that a woman is entering perimenopause (see above).<br>  More and more we are seeing patients of all ages who come in to the clinic with irregular periods due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), an easily recognizable and treatable condition that frequently occurs with insulin resistance. With PCOS, the ovaries produce a quantity of follicles that generate high levels of estrogen but never release an egg. The excessive estrogen stimulates the uterine lining to thicken to a point where it must slough off. Women with this condition are not having what are considered “real” menstrual periods because they do not regularly ovulate. For more information, we recommend you start with our article on insulin resistance, where you will find other helpful links about this topic.<br>  What if I’m just spotting or not getting a period at all?<br>  We’ve all heard stories from friends who’ve suddenly lost a lot of weight or begun a strenuous exercise regimen, then stopped getting their period. Anorexic women or those who exercise two to three hours a day can find their menstrual cycles diminish or stop due to a decrease in body fat. These women have low estrogen and are not ovulating. This is called stress-type hypothalamic amenorrhea, and it occurs when poor nutrition and stress alter the brain’s chemistry and hormone pathways. The brain can’t trigger the right hormones for follicle development, which make the necessary estrogens. Women with this irregularity tend to be at higher risk for bone loss (osteoporosis) and other degenerative conditions and should be evaluated. Click here for more information about amenorrhea.<br>  Why does my period come twice a month?<br>  In addition to missed periods, we also see women who get more than one period in the span of a month. The causes for this are relatively unknown, but stress and lifestyle seem once again to play a major role. Ingesting medication or other substances that disrupt the luteal phase may be a factor, as well.<br>  I bleed really heavily when I get my period. What does this mean?<br>  Low progesterone, PCOS, or another form of hormonal imbalance may be the culprit. If a woman has two or more successive months of heavy bleeding, a check-up is called for. <br>  Any kind of heavy bleeding can contribute to anemia. When a patient has anemia, we try to stem the heavy menstrual flow and prescribe an iron supplement. Depending on the severity of the situation we may choose from a range of progesterone therapy options along with diet and exercise modifications to help rebalance the hormonal equation. Bioidentical over-the counter, compounded, or prescription formulations are often adequate. A more serious scenario may call for a synthetic progestin such as Aygestin or Provera to bring the bleeding back under control. We will also often suggest acupuncture for relief. Click here for more information about irregular periods in perimenopause.<br>  What can I do about my irregular periods?<br>  The first step is to talk to a healthcare practitioner if you are experiencing any of the symptoms described above. It’s a good idea to do the following:<br>  ·Have a complete physical, including evaluations of thyroid function and blood pressure. Also, a complete blood count (CBC) test is quite important for the diagnosis of anemia.<br>  <br>  ·A pelvic exam is critical to rule out any uterine abnormality, a cervical polyp or fibroid, or a uterine infection. These are less common causes but should be considered. Often an ultrasound will be required to evaluate the uterus, the ovaries and the fallopian tubes. Ultrasound of the uterus is useful and painless — you may already be familiar with this technique from pregnancy. If infection is a concern, antibiotics will be prescribed.<br>  <br>  ·If you are trying to become pregnant, consult with a fertility specialist or a qualified ob/gyn practitioner for further testing.<br>  What is the treatment for irregular periods?<br>  Most of the time, simply decreasing our stress, improving nutrition and adding adequate nutritional supplements can provide a natural way to restore regular menstrual cycles. These steps alone give the body a much needed boost and will support the natural hormonal balance and monthly cycles we are meant to enjoy… and appreciate!<br>  If the issue stems from an anovulatory or perimenopausal condition, a doctor may prescribe birth control pills or progesterone to normalize the cycle. This is often successful. For most patients, we’ve seen a big improvement when positive steps are made to change their lifestyle, including:<br>  ·healthy dietary modifications<br>  <br>  ·supplementing nutritional gaps with a good multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, and fish oil<br>  <br>  ·decreasing intake of refined carbohydrates<br>  <br>  ·moderating your exercise (this may require increasing or decreasing your current level of exercise)<br>  <br>  ·stress relief through exercise or other relaxation techniques<br>  <br>  ·reprioritizing one’s commitments<br>  <br>  For the majority of women who make these changes, a normal menstrual cycle returns without a hitch. In short, we think that most irregular periods are usually nothing to worry about and can be successfully addressed with straightforward, practical measures available to every woman.<br>  <a href="http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation/irregularperiods.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation...</a><br>  Missed or Irregular Periods <br>  <br>  Topic Overview <br>  <br>  <br>  Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual periods each year. You may be different: You may have more or fewer. Missed or irregular periods must be looked at in terms of what is normal for you.<br>  Periods are often irregular during the first few years after menstruation starts. It may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance.<br>  Menstrual periods also may be very irregular at the other end of the menstrual years. Many women realize that they are approaching perimenopause and menopause when their otherwise regular periods become irregular. Menopause occurs when it has been 12 months since you have had a menstrual period.<br>  Pregnancy is the most common cause of a missed period. If you might be pregnant, treat yourself as though you are pregnant until you know for sure. Use a home pregnancy test as the first step to finding out whether you are pregnant.<br>  If you are not pregnant, other causes of missed or irregular periods include:<br>  ·Excessive weight loss or gain.

It is also called menses, menstrual period, or period. When a woman has her period, she is menstruating. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus (womb). It flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days. <br>  What is the menstrual cycle? <br>  Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle, which helps a woman's body prepare for the possibility of pregnancy each month. A cycle starts on the first day of a period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. However, a cycle can range anywhere from 23 days to 35 days. <br>  The parts of the body involved in the menstrual cycle include the brain, pituitary gland, uterus and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina. Body chemicals called hormones rise and fall during the month and make the menstrual cycle happen. The ovaries make two important female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Other hormones involved in the menstrual cycle include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), made by the pituitary gland. <br>  What happens during the menstrual cycle? <br>  In the first half of the menstrual cycle, levels of estrogen rise and make the lining of the uterus grow and thicken. In response to follicle-stimulating hormone, an egg (ovum) in one of the ovaries starts to mature. At about day 14 of a typical 28-day cycle, in response to a surge of luteinizing hormone, the egg leaves the ovary. This is called ovulation. <br>  In the second half of the menstrual cycle, the egg begins to travel through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Progesterone levels rise and help prepare the uterine lining for pregnancy. If the egg becomes fertilized by a sperm cell and attaches itself to the uterine wall, the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg is not fertilized, it either dissolves or is absorbed into the body. If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the uterus is shed during the menstrual period. <br>  In the illustration below, an egg has left an ovary after ovulation and is on its way through a fallopian tube to the uterus. <br>   <br>  Image Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration <br>  What is a typical menstrual period like? <br>  During the menstrual period, the thickened uterine lining and extra blood are shed through the vaginal canal. A woman's period may not be the same every month, and it may not be the same as other women's periods. Periods can be light, moderate, or heavy, and the length of the period also varies. While most menstrual periods last from three to five days, anywhere from two to seven days is considered normal. For the first few years after menstruation begins, periods may be very irregular. They may also become irregular in women approaching menopause. Sometimes birth control pills are prescribed to help with irregular periods or other problems with the menstrual cycle. <br>  Sanitary pads or tampons, which are made of cotton or another absorbent material, are worn to absorb the blood flow. Sanitary pads are placed inside the panties; tampons are inserted into the vagina. <br>  What kinds of problems do women have with their periods? <br>  Women can have various kinds of problems with their periods, including pain, heavy bleeding, and skipped periods. <br>  ·Amenorrhea - the lack of a menstrual period. This term is used to describe the absence of a period in young women who haven't started menstruating by age 16, or the absence of a period in women who used to have a regular period. Causes of amenorrhea include pregnancy, breastfeeding, and extreme weight loss caused by serious illness, eating disorders, excessive exercising, or stress. Hormonal problems (involving the pituitary, thyroid, ovary, or adrenal glands) or problems with the reproductive organs may be involved. <br>  ·Dysmenorrhea - painful periods, including severe menstrual cramps. In younger women, there is often no known disease or condition associated with the pain. A hormone called prostaglandin is responsible for the symptoms. Some pain medicines available over the counter, such as ibuprofen, can help with these symptoms. Sometimes a disease or condition, such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis, causes the pain. Treatment depends on what is causing the problem and how severe it is. <br>  ·Abnormal uterine bleeding-vaginal bleeding that is different from normal menstrual periods. It includes very heavy bleeding or unusually long periods (also called menorrhagia), periods too close together, and bleeding between periods. In adolescents and women approaching menopause, hormone imbalance problems often cause menorrhagia along with irregular cycles. Sometimes this is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Other causes of abnormal bleeding include uterine fibroids and polyps. Treatment for abnormal bleeding depends on the cause. <br>  At what age does a girl get her first period? <br>  Menarche is another name for the beginning of menstruation. In the United States, the average age a girl starts menstruating is 12. However, this does not mean that all girls start at the same age. A girl can begin menstruating anytime between the ages of 8 and 16. Menstruation will not occur until all parts of a girl's reproductive system have matured and are working together. <br>  How long does a woman have periods? <br>  Women usually continue having periods until menopause. Menopause occurs around the age of 51, on average. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating (producing eggs) and therefore can no longer become pregnant. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and may take several years to occur. Some women have early menopause because of surgery or other treatment, illness, or other reasons. <br>  When should I see a health care provider about my period? <br>  You should consult your health care provider for the following: <br>  ·If you have not started menstruating by the age of 16. <br>  ·If your period has suddenly stopped. <br>  ·If you are bleeding for more days than usual. <br>  ·If you are bleeding excessively. <br>  ·If you suddenly feel sick after using tampons. <br>  ·If you bleed between periods (more than just a few drops). <br>  ·If you have severe pain during your period. <br>  How often should I change my pad/tampon? <br>  Sanitary napkins (pads) should be changed as often as necessary, before the pad is soaked with menstrual flow. Each woman decides for herself what is comfortable. Tampons should be changed often (at least every 4-8 hours). Make sure that you use the lowest absorbency of tampon needed for your flow. For example, do not use super absorbency on the lightest day of your period. This can put you at risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but potentially deadly disease. Women under 30, especially teenagers, are at a higher risk for TSS. Using any kind of tampon - cotton or rayon of any absorbency - puts a woman at greater risk for TSS than using menstrual pads. The risk of TSS can be lessened or avoided by not using tampons, or by alternating between tampons and pads during your period. <br>  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following tips to help avoid tampon problems: <br>  ·Follow package directions for insertion. <br>  ·Choose the lowest absorbency for your flow. <br>  ·Change your tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. <br>  ·Consider alternating pads with tampons. <br>  ·Know the warning signs of toxic shock syndrome (see below). <br>  ·Don't use tampons between periods. <br>  If you experience any of the following symptoms while you are menstruating and using tampons, you should contact your health care provider immediately: <br>  ·High fever that appears suddenly <br>  ·Muscle aches <br>  ·Diarrhea <br>  ·Dizziness and/or fainting <br>  ·Sunburn-like rash <br>  ·Sore throat <br>  ·Bloodshot eyes <br>  For more information… <br>  To learn more about menstruation, contact the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) at 1-800-994-9662 or the following organizations: <br>  Food and Drug Administration <br>  Phone Number(s): (888) 463-6332 <br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/</a> <br>  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Resource Center <br>  Phone Number(s): (800) 762-2264 x 192 (for publications requests only) <br>  Internet Address: www.acog.org <br>  Nemours Foundation <br>  Phone Number(s): (302) 651-4046 <br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.nemours.org/internet" rel="nofollow">http://www.nemours.org/internet</a> <br>  All material contained in the FAQs is free of copyright restrictions, and may be copied, reproduced, or duplicated without permission of the Office on Women's Health in the Department of Health and Human Services; citation of the source is appreciated. <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Premenstrual Syndrome<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/pms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/pms.htm</a><br>  <br>  What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?<br>  What are the symptoms of PMS?<br>  How common is PMS?<br>  What treatment is available for PMS?<br>  What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?<br>  <br>  See also…<br>  <br>      * Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle<br>  <br>  What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?<br>  <br>  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS symptoms occur in the week or two weeks before your period (menstruation or monthly bleeding). The symptoms usually go away after your period starts. PMS may interfere with your normal activities at home, school, or work. Menopause, when monthly periods stop, brings an end to PMS.<br>  <br>  The causes of PMS are not yet clear. Some women may be more sensitive than others to changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Stress does not seem to cause PMS, but may make it worse. PMS can affect menstruating women of any age.<br>  <br>  PMS often includes both physical and emotional symptoms. Diagnosis of PMS is usually based on your symptoms, when they occur, and how much they affect your life.<br>  What are the symptoms of PMS?<br>  <br>  PMS often includes both physical and emotional symptoms. Common symptoms are:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        breast swelling and tenderness<br>      *<br>  <br>        fatigue and trouble sleeping<br>      *<br>  <br>        upset stomach, bloating, constipation or diarrhea<br>      *<br>  <br>        headache<br>      *<br>  <br>        appetite changes or food cravings<br>      *<br>  <br>        joint or muscle pain<br>      *<br>  <br>        tension, irritability, mood swings, or crying spells<br>      *<br>  <br>        anxiety or depression<br>      *<br>  <br>        trouble concentrating or remembering.<br>  <br>  Symptoms vary from one woman to another. If you think you have PMS, try keeping track of your symptoms for several menstrual cycles. You can use a calendar to note which symptoms you are having on which days of your cycle, and how bad the symptoms are. If you seek medical care for your PMS, having this kind of record is helpful.<br>  How common is PMS?<br>  <br>  Estimates of the percentage of women affected by PMS vary widely. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, up to 40 percent of menstruating women report some symptoms of PMS. Most of these women have symptoms that are fairly mild and do not need treatment. Some women (perhaps five to ten percent of menstruating women) have a more severe form of PMS.<br>  What treatment is available for PMS?<br>  <br>  Many treatments have been tried for easing the symptoms of PMS. However, no treatment has been found that works for everyone. A combination of lifestyle changes and other treatment may be needed. If your PMS is not so bad that you need medical help, a healthier lifestyle may help you feel better and cope with symptoms.<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Adopt a healthier way of life. Exercise regularly, get enough sleep, choose healthy foods, don't smoke, and find ways to manage stress in your life.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Try avoiding excess salt, sugary foods, caffeine, and alcohol, especially when you are having PMS symptoms.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Be sure that you are getting enough vitamins and minerals. Take a multivitamin every day that includes 400 micrograms of folic acid. A calcium supplement with vitamin D can help keep bones strong and may help with PMS symptoms.<br>      *<br>  <br>        In more severe cases, drugs such as diuretics, ibuprofen, birth control pills, or antidepressants may be used.<br>  <br>  Although PMS does not seem to be related to abnormal hormone levels, some women respond to hormonal treatment. For example, one approach has been to use drugs such as birth control pills to stop ovulation from occurring. There is evidence that a brain chemical, serotonin, plays a role in severe forms of PMS. Antidepressants that alter serotonin in the body have been shown to help many women with severe PMS.<br>  What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?<br>  <br>  PMDD is a severe, disabling form of PMS. In PMDD, the main symptoms are mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, tension, and persistent anger or irritability. These severe symptoms lead to problems with relationships and carrying out normal activities. Women with PMDD usually also have physical symptoms, such as headache, joint and muscle pain, lack of energy, bloating and breast tenderness. According to the American Psychiatric Association, a woman must have at least five of the typical symptoms to be diagnosed with PMDD. The symptoms must occur during the two weeks before her period and go away when bleeding begins.<br>  <br>  Research has shown that antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help many women with PMDD. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two such medications to date for treatment of PMDD - sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Sarafem).<br>  For More Information…<br>  <br>  To learn more about premenstrual syndrome, contact the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) at 1-800-994-9662 or the following organizations:<br>  <br>  National Institute of Mental Health<br>  Phone Number(s): (301) 443-4513<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/</a><br>  <br>  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Resource Center<br>  Phone Number(s): (202) 863-2518<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.acog.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acog.org/</a><br>  <br>  American Psychiatric Association<br>  Phone Number(s): (202) 682-6000<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.psych.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psych.org/</a><br>  <br>  The Hormone Foundation<br>  Phone Number(s): (800) 467-6663<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.hormone.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hormone.org/</a><br>  <br>  All material contained in the FAQs is free of copyright restrictions, and may be copied, reproduced, or duplicated without permission of the Office on Women's Health in the Department of Health and Human Services; citation of the sources is appreciated.|`|358b7cfe9b12186d7ae5f6e9e52f0e1aaa	hot water bottle on the belly<br>  paracetomol.|`|AA11804775	1.

Your hormones are different, and you have blood coming out of your vagina.  (yuck)  (I've always hated my uterus and thank God I had it removed in 1994-outside of marrying my husband, it was the best thing I have EVER done.)  Motrin definitely helps (as does Advil or Aleve).  They help reduce the level of the prostaglandins and decrease swelling.  They will however, increase your flow due to their "Aspirin-like " qualities that thins the blood.

Eventually...at 17 his mood swings were so unbearable i had him put on meds for bipolar which he does have.  He also is ADHD.  He take Abilify and Concerta for school but that is it.  Tharapy is a must also.  Please seek another opinion and tell the Dr. why you wanted a second opinion.|`|1303b5dd4ca633e7664ee837f0fd6ad8aa	Yes you do. And you should. If he has any kid of problem he will need all of his families love and support. I have Bipolar. I started going to see a doctor when i was 17. I tried to committee suicide.  I have always had problem of these kinds since around the age of seven. My parents were very involved just didn't know what to do. And I had no idea what was wrong with me. That's why I tried to end my life. Sometimes ADHD turns into Bipolar. If he does have these problems then its good that you ex caught on. A doctor wouldn't put him on those kinds of meds just because. Do everything you can to be part of his life. He is going to need you. Try to go to his doctors app. with him get informed, ask questions. This will not only help you but him in more ways than you can even think of. But plz don't just throw it out and fight about him being on medication. There's nothing wrong with it if he needs it. And yes a lot of these meds make you gain weight.|`|313fe15495d2bba870825181ed5d8d55aa	My sister's son was diagnosed with ADD and she put him on a Low GI diet - cut out white bread, white rice and substituted them with wholegrain foods. Also significantly cut down his sugar intake. He's now a perfect angel and no longer has behavioural problems or ADD.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it, sounds like half the battle is your ex|`|6b584f2dd0a2b5d857ec7b1c526118e6aa	Well, there a couple of things that are left out of your question.  First, why did your wife think your son needed to be on medication to begin with?  I assume there were some behaviors associated with this.  Secondly, is the Dr. your wife took your son to a psychiatrist or just a regular m.d?  If your son is being prescribed those type of drugs by someone that is not specializing in pediatric bipolar that is a very big problem.  Only 1 to 2% of the world's population is thought to be Bipolar.  It is however gaining a certain popularity and that is causing it to be claimed by many people, however, doctors are generally very hesitant to diagnose someone with this illness.  I would first contact the doctor that made the diagnosis and they should allow you to see whatever testing was done, if there wasn't testing, etc,  you see yet another problem.  It takes a lot more than a family member having "bipolar" to get a bipolar diagnosis but make sure you tell the diagnosing doctor about this issue in case it did play a part in the diagnosis, as heredity is one of the possible causes of bipolar.  As far as the weight gain is concerned there are other meds that do not cause the weight gain such as Topamax that are just as effective.  The reason he probably sleeps ok when he is with you is because it would take a couple of weeks without meds to really start affecting his sleeping patterns and behavior because it takes that long for it to exit the system completely.  If your son is Bipolar you are not doing him any favors by denying it to project an image of "normalcy."  It's a very scary thing not being able to control your own feelings and emotions, especially as a child.  I don't think that if he is on a mood stabilizer and what not he should need to take a pill to sleep though because that would be a symptom of the mania and should be treated with the stabilizer but your doctor would have an explanation for that.  I hope that helps.  You do have rights to all this information regardless of divorce, etc, and most doctors would know that.|`|f042d5858101a174bc32f20a4461ae66aa	I am bipolar and have been on meds. forever. Risperdal is a pretty powerful drug used for psychosis. I was only on that in the hospital, it seems extreme for a child. As a parent, regardless of physical custody, you have a say in all decisions affecting your child. You should check your divorce decree to verify that. I would talk to a lawyer if your ex won't listen to you. It sounds like your child does not need these drugs and they are doing more harm than good. You may need a court order to intervein, but you could be saving your child. I'd look into it a.s.a.p. Good luck.
75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	I think there may be indirectly. The reason I say this is that I am bipolar, and bipolar disorder is treated with two types of drugs. The first class is anticonvulsants and these are ant-epileptic drugs. The second class are antipsychotics, used in the management of schizophrenia. Both of them act as mood stabilisers in bipolar patients.<br>  <br>  FWIW, I take both.<br>  <br>  There's also a fairly good discussion group for this at Crazyboards: <a href="http://www.crazyboards.org/forums/index.php?showforum=82" rel="nofollow">http://www.crazyboards.org/forums/index....</a>|`|7f49b540d0451eeda1e5fd962d0c516caa	Yeah, in the middle ages.

3e3e51d217c13985c39ac867cdf61759aa	you must be talking about when you eat ice cream & it gives you a headache,<br>  sometimes called an ice cream headache or brain freeze. <br>  When something very cold touches the center of the palate or roof of your mouth, the cold temperature can set off certain nerves that control how much blood flows to your head. The nerves respond by causing the blood vessels in the head to swell up. This quick swelling of the blood vessels is what causes your head to pound and hurt. Some people call this a "brain freeze," even though nothing is really happening in the brain - it's all in the blood vessels of the head.<br>  <br>  And ice cream isn't the only food that can make your head hurt. Anything that's very cold, like ice pops, slushy frozen drinks, and even cold soda, water, milk, or juice can make the blood vessels swell.<br>  <br>  A headache from ice cream or another cold food usually lasts about a minute or so, although it can feel like much longer. This kind of headache almost never lasts more than 5 minutes, and it goes away on its own. And although you may feel pain, it's not dangerous and doesn't mean that anything is wrong in your body.|`|AA11897359	LOL...the roof of my mouth has never hurt!|`|a8235eea7292412b2f10bddd55e6a50eaa	Not had the problem myself , other than drinking something to hot to keep out the cold and scalding the inside of my mouth|`|5900fcd5fa80a625fa2e03e29e12a2f4aa	I cant say that the roof of my mouth has ever hurt in cold weather !!!

En ese momento también la digestión demanda consumo de oxígeno  pero no hay actividad física que lo provea, por eso es necesario hacer una peque?a y ligera caminata después de comer. Otra razón es que hay que brindarle energía de facil absorción y la mejor fuente segura son las frutas.

The best work out you can do to add muscle is a low repetition-high weight workout. Concentrate on doing a maximum of 10 reps per set, if you can do more than that then you are too light. Your body will start growing once it feels challenge with large amount of weight. Try to find a workout partner this way you can do more weights than what you would do otherwise.<br>  <br>  Question #2. Actually there are two types of protein that are extreamly good, in their own way. 1) Whey protein- this is the most common type. In your case, since you want to gain weight, you want to find a weight gainer. Wight gainer are whey protein with high amounts of glucose, the kind of carbohydrate that makes your body absorve the protein very fast. Thus, you want to take it right after your workout. 2) Egg Protein- this is by far the best type of protein, it is the cleanest, and it stays in you body a lot longer. So it is a good idea to take this kind of protein right before you go to sleep, or one hour before your workout. <br>  <br>  ****It is very important that if you decide to take that weight gainer. you must workout otherwise you will end up getting fat.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|d63cebb0c4c8434a38333ffb21f8543caa	the best workout is to eat alot of the greese from bacon, then have a peice of good cheese cake then wave ur arms around in the air.|`|eb1c8953904446f91a41b186b1f86544aa	go to the gym and also visit those health store and ask for protein supplements.

9nElIoMiaa	Actually, you may not have reached a plateau. What is entirely possible is that you are gaining muscle mass and losing body fat simultaneously.. the nett result being no weight change.<br>  <br>  That's a good thing. You could try increasing your diet intake to say 1500 Cals (which is still a calory deficit so you won't gain fat) and see if your weight increases. It will probably be muscle if it does. You should start measureing your % body fat from now on. All those workouts are likely to be turning you into a tight ball of lean muscle .. which is a lot heavier than a flabby rotund beach ball of the same height...

Qlmk0cOZaa	Yes, a woman can still have her period while being pregnant, it's actually not as rare as you would think. When you are done with your period make sure you go get a pregnancy test. And you don't have to get the real expensive ones, just don't get the absolute cheapest either. Somewhere in the middle is good enough because they all have about the same percentage of error. Also, make sure you test when you pee the first time in the morning. You have a higher chance of getting a good reading this way because your urine has stored over night and your hormones have gathered in the urine. This is the easiest way of finding out you are pregnant. Also, having your period while pregnant usually doesn't mean anythying is wrong. But do let your gynecologist know, especially if you really are pregnant because she can make sure that everything is going smoothly.|`|S7lwl6pzaa	you r not suppose to but some people still have it but you're not suppose to cause it can kill the baby....don't worry i'm sure everything is ok|`|AA11882450	my mom had her period for five months when she was preg. with me but rom my last preg. i know that the mind is a powerful thing and you can trick ur body into having symptoms of preg. without meaning to.

Your periods are just regulating. There are other reasons besides pregnancy why girls might have a late or missed period. These reasons include:<br>  eating disorders, <br>  excessive exercise, <br>  travel, medications, <br>  premature ovarian failure, <br>  menstrual disorders, <br>  breastfeeding, <br>  birth control pills or hormonal drugs, <br>  Illicit drug use,  <br>  stress, <br>  hormonal problems, <br>  changes in hormonal levels, <br>  illness,<br>  a diet that's too low in fat, <br>  changes in sleep patterns or exercise, <br>  or just a menstrual pattern that hasn't become regular yet. <br>  <br>  Stress is the most common cause of a late period.

Dann ist es m?glich auf tiefliegenderen Ebenen sein Bewusstsein arbeiten zu lassen, wie etwa beim Schlafen und Tr?umen. <br>  <br>  Ich müsste jetzt genauer wissen, welche Yoga-Schule du genau meinst. Die im Westen verbreitete Form des Hatha-Yoga versucht beispielsweise, dem Praktizierenden Schmerzen zuzufügen. Das Bewusstsein verarbeitet mit der übung dann schneller Schmerzen (auch seelische und im Alltag) und macht es darauf aufmerksam, dass wir dauernd anderen Schmerzen zufügen. H?here Yoga-Schulen, wie z. B. das Jnana-Yoga suchen z.B. die Vereinigung mit dem Absolutum "brahma", was also bedeutet, dass Sein und Bewusstsein in eine h?heren Form verschmelzen, was zuerst zu Erkenntnis, Liebe und Klarsicht (skr. jnana, hindi jana = Wissen, Erkennen, Durchblicken) führt. Ich tendiere eher zu den oberen Stufen, da sie vorwiegend allein mit dem Geist arbeiten.<br>  <br>  In verschiedenen Stufen soll die Erfahrung des "brahma" (im Tantra-Buddhismus des "bodhi") erreicht werden; dazu geh?rt die Gleichgültigkeit des Bewusstseins gegenüber Ph?nomenen wie Akustisches, Optisches, der Atmung oder der Zerstreutheit. Das ist ein schwieriger Schritt und gelingt ?u?erst selten auch erfahrenen Yogins.<br>  <br>  Yoga bewirkt bei mir mentalen Ausgleich im Alltag, sowie ein harmonisches Verh?ltnis zu den Mitmenschen und dem besseren Verst?ndnis der Welt.

SwP3tE2Uaa	Yes, you should.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what you put in.  If you consume a lot of food, especially simple carbs like soda, cakes, pizzas cookies and french fries.  You may just not lose weight.<br>  <br>  Mainly it is a  question of calories in < , > or = energy expended. <br>  <br>  While you are doing all those exercises, eat more veggies and lean meat and reduce your simple carbs.

AA10299265	Here’s all you need to lose weight and get healthy. First, you have to realize there is no quick, long lasting weight loss plan or pill that is going to do the trick. It’s purely mental. You have to learn to “Eat to live, don’t live to eat”. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? It is, if you understand that you are going to be reprogramming how you think about eating for the next few weeks. Old habits die hard, right? Not really. You get rid of bad habits by replacing them with good habits. If you learn to count your calories, keep calorie intake lower than output, exercise moderately, and eat only healthy food, you will lose weight. That’s a fact. All it takes is repetition. All success stories have this in common: The successful folks among us know how to be patient, persistent, and consistent. Set a goal and stick with it. The benefits of feeling good will outweigh any sense of sacrifice you might feel about having to push away that cake and ice cream. Here are some helpful and healthy links to help you get started on your way:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/weightloss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/weig...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.chetday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chetday.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmcdougall.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.phifoundation.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.phifoundation.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|AA12017298	walk to work. eat a good meal b4 u go then u shouldnt have to snack on your break. <br>  cut out all junk food.|`|ca827b1afdaa87f995da7fcc4eda444eaa	to be honest the best way is not to go on a diet as ive tried them all and diet pills and they dont work lol but just change your diet and go swimming 4-5 times a week for about an hour each time it tones your tummy and all your body up wonderful too ! i lost just over 2 1/2 stone since may its great and i eat loads too im just eating the right foods but instead of swimming try aqua arobics its great and really fun ! great question goodluck !|`|e9dsg0KQaa	eat more smaller meals.  You should have a break during your shift... bring something healthy with you and eat it on your break.<br>  <br>  skipping dinner and then eating toast after midnight isn't going to help you... it's more likely going to do more damage.  You don't want to eat just before you go to bed... especially not carbs.  And you never ever want to skip meals, it messes with your metabolism, slowing it down and making it even harder to lose weight.<br>  <br>  The best way to lose weight is to plan all your meals while you're not hungry, in advance, and eat those meals on a schedule.  Eat 5-6 smaller meals per day.  Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner for instance.<br>  <br>  Don't plan what you are going to eat after you're already hungry, because then your body will crave the unhealthy fast calories that come from pastas, breads, and sugars, etc.<br>  <br>  Make a plan, stick to it, and plan for treats, or else you will just end up binging.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! And don't forget to exercise too (although your job make you fairly active, so you shouldn't need to do too much).|`|fd7f7760fab598ddb7f5fd26f811c2baaa	Diet on its own is not much good, you need to exercise more as well.

195N5Y3gaa	ballet won't make you lose weight, you'll probably just gain muscle. also, remember that everyone loses weight differently and at different paces. have you been eating healthy? if you are eating packaged or fast food, exercise can only do so much for you! try to not just rely on ballet to make you lose weight. unless you are taking at least 3 classes a week, it won't do much. <br>  <br>  i suggest taking things into your own hands and doing some aerobic/cardio activities like jogging, swimming, biking etc. if you notice that a lot of the girls in your class are skinny, it's probably because they have been taking ballet since they were little, so they've had time to get in shape. also, some girls just naturally have the ideal ballet body. if you don't, you're just going to have to work a bit harder!|`|ENA3SJAQaa	Ballet alone, does not reduce your weight.<br>  <br>  Should watch your diet & do exercises that really "burns fat"|`|lRa1yQZraa	OK. listen to me. i have been taking dance for 9 years. you don't necessarily loose weight.. you kind of gain weight cause of gaining muscle. if you know what i mean. and that isn't bad cause that means most of the fat you had before.. is now muscle.. so in the end it turns out fine. =] also if you really wanna loose weight. try exercising on the bar with a jacket on. but when you get into jumps and stuff. take it off.<br>  <br>  good luck!

If you want to look good than you have to target certain muscles other wise they don't really get the work out you need. If you have back probs you might want to talk to the doctor first or just take it really easy and don't over do it for the first month or so. You may not be getting buff in that month but you will be conditioning you muscles for working out harder. Or you could do what i did and find an indoor swimming pool that has helped me out alot. Yoga works too me and my wife do it some times. Makes your body feel good and loosened.<br>  Just remember to take it slow or your going to do more harm than good..... |`|XeKmgiTnaa	Yoga is supposed to be better. I don't know about that bowflex.

vip2FIEUaa	Are you allowed to bring backpacks to class with you?  In that case, keeping it in your backpack is fine -  it shouldn't have to be strapped to yourself as long as it is in within easy reach. <br>  <br>  If you aren't allowed to bring backpacks, try buying a cute pencil case.  They are the perfect size for epipens.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work for you, you only have problems when you eat, right?  In that case, I don't see a need to keep it with you during every class.  Try bringing a bagged lunch from home with food you know is nut-free.  If you need to buy lunch at school, it would probably be good to keep it with you during that time (and depending on how quick your reaction is) maybe for the class directly after lunch.  Try carrying it in a fashionable purse or small messenger bag, or just snag your backpack from your locker in your way to get food.|`|8299447d689b3abb4ef3ef0613c537e3aa	You certainly won't be the only person in school with an epi-pen, and you have nothing to be embarrassed about - if your allergy is that severe, that pen could make the difference between you choking to death - not a pretty way to go - and surviving.  You won't look like a dork,  how do you think diabetics feel?  They need their meds to keep them alive and healthy, and you need your pen - WITH YOU!! - for the same reason!  Don't lie to your parents, that will just make things worse if you ever do have a problem.|`|VxE46bSFaa	One of my friends has to use an epipen due to a nut allergy.

BOCqxUagaa	This is so strange, i pretty much have been asking this same question on yahoo answers for...a while now. I understand completely.  Its almost like, this evil thing takes over and you want to make them feel insignificant, but when you come to your senses you feel so bad. And its almost as if you enjoy being mean to them sometimes. <br>  <br>  Let me ask you this: Do you have an attachment after you make your mom feel bad about this gift, maybe afterward your cherish that gift more than you would have normally? I mean, like being extremely over the top sentimental about it?<br>  <br>  I have looked all over the Internet, everywhere and i have never found anyone that has had the same symptoms as me. Everyone always said i was crazy or just hormonal but this has been happening to me since i was 3 1/2. And even now,(i'm now 20) i've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and i'm still posting questions seeing if anyone out there has this same problem. Few do. And my Dr helps. But i dont think i will ever fully understand it. I wouldnt brush it off as  being "normal" behavior, it can be destructive. And i'm really really sorry you have this problem too. Thinking about it....makes me want to hug all those toys i at first told my mom i hated. Even now. It makes me want to cry. <br>  <br>  My advice, talk to someone about it. And in a few years when your hormones go away (or sooner if you cant bear it) if its still there, see a professional.|`|glbZk7QTaa	its normal dont worry|`|f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	it's normal i got that too, and it will pass, but keep this in mind:<br>  <br>  this sensation of malcontent you feel is more valuable than gold, in that as soon as your "hormones settle down" it is still there, just less obvious, and will drive you crazy.  That's why adults are always so unhappy, and boring, because they let the malcontent settle down, even though it's still there.  Strive to be rid of it.  Find a passion, and use your anger/craziness.<br>  <br>  I'm working through an identity crisis too, and it sucks.  i can totally relate.|`|w7qEwaDyaa	yes that happens to me too! and its irritating because i dont want to cry<br>  for example i try to do something, i fail and i think deeply about it and i end up crying.lol.|`|7uil7W2Paa	its normal, its hormones, i used to do that all the time, im 18 and i do that still but only when im close or on my period, but your at the perfect age when your hormones are shooting out of every pore on your body, the next year or two are prolly going to be the hardest because of hormones, at least they were for me but stick int here and don't do anything dumb please!|`|ycjopsAYaa	Its perfectly normally its just your hormones you get through it but it will take a while . . . So basically your just growing up|`|Puf6XhYaaa	aww cool im glad you posted this question , well im 13 and i get the same thing ?? so i gues it must be normal <br>  <br>  do you feel like that al the time? i usualy  feel like that when i am tired... <br>  <br>   all the best - *HUGS*|`|eifBb1R7aa	I think so at least 4 me it is..I do this like every day..I am like always crying over something!lol!so yes i think so!i'm so moody too!well have a happy new year!
ltMbMIPlaa	yep. that's alcohol. is gonna take you a long time to get back to normal. the feeling you have are the nerves that you killed by alcohol and now you are feeling it. more you drink, more you lose the normal feeling.|`|eSf4jWm4aa	Hun, Im pretty sure that you are ok, it is probably the fact that you feel guilty or bad about drinking alcohol, which at 13 is too early you are still young and developing.

Gall stones tend to act up more at night, whereas an appendix normally just hurts.<br>  <br>  While pain from an appendix can come and go in some people, once it becomes acute there is no more going. This is not a subtle event. You will be in severe pain, probably with diarrhea and puking. <br>  <br>  Gall stones usually bother people at night when their liver "cycles". For most folks this is around 4:00am, give or take a couple of hours. This can be mild or extremely painful. Eating fatty foods at any time will make the problem worst.<br>  <br>  Either way, if the pain goes acute, go to the hospital. An exam with a blood draw can diagnose an appendicitis. A simple ultrasound will show if gall stones are present. If the scope is used, both operations are about an hour long, with the recovery time being about the same.

Ntb4QfKKaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about going on Yasmin.<br>  <br>  It is a birth control pill that it prescribed to people with acne. (people use it even if they don't want birth control)<br>  <br>  The added bonus and different to the other pills is that it will not make you gain weight and it acts as a small dosage of a dieuretic which means it helps control bloating caused by fluid retention. My doc prescribed this to me for that reason. <br>  <br>  I have been taking it for almost 3 years now. <br>  <br>  The downside is that it is more expensive. It's just over $20.00 a month to be on it, whereas regular pills would only be about $5.00. If you have the money then it's definitely worth it though!|`|1yqucDzaaa	It depends, all women react differently to the pill. Some can experience less acne, while others it doesn't help. Some women gain weight on the pill and others do not. It's more or less trial and error to find the pill that works for you. Personally none of them helped my acne, and a few of them did make me gain weight.

I started wearing graduated bifocals (no lines) in September and it took about a full week to adjust|`|U31gt85xaa	When I changed from spectacles to contact lenses, I was advised to build up the length of time to wear them.  e.g. try wearing for 2 hours, give them a rest, then try 3 hours and gradually increase until you can wear them all day.<br>  I do not think it it a good idea to try to wear contacts all day at the outset.  Always remember to place them in your container with cleansing fluid every-time you take them out, even if it only for a short time, like having a bath/shower, as it will not only cleanse them of the protein build-up but it will also moisten them for further use thus saving the "dry eye syndrome".<br>  Good Luck and keep persevering and all will be well.

Condoms don't protect 100 percent of the genitals where an std can affect, they can also break, slip off or tear.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Yes, some STDs are skin to skin contact.|`|pCLIL7Uxaa	Yes you can still get stds with a condom but chances are very small unless the condom breaks but still the chances are reduced|`|tSi10jneaa	Yes you can.

If you are trying to loose weight, that won't do it. You need to exercise and eat about 5-6 small portions a day to make your motabolism faster. Plus, you need nutrients from real food. Eating that stuff won't get you any nutrients. Most vitamin supplements and protien shakes are all BS.

qKwaLBFNaa	Ok, first thing you need to do is quit eating fast food. Eat fast food once or twice a month. And if you want to lose weight, just run outside for 30 minutes everyday, and try not to stop when you are running. Don't eat food that has a lot of fat in it between meals. Eat healthy food and try to quit fast food. I hope that I helped you. Good luck|`|9YqEYVO5aa	I really don't know how long it will take to lose 40 pounds, but it may take over a year. I say drop the fast food. You will not be able to do it cold-turkey. try eating it just once or twice a week. make it that one night you go out with your husband if you have to. other than that, try to eat healthier. healthy food can be alot taster than fast food ! try throwing together a quick salad, with a bowl of romaine lettuce, your favourite salad dressing, and some bacon bits or crutons instead of ordering a pizza =) it'll be worth it ! also, you could try joining a gym and going twice or even three times a week, hey, maybe you could make THAT your date night with your husband , depending on what he likes to do.|`|B0uJ6hIjaa	Easiest way to lose weight fast and safely is to cut your calorie intake by eating more on fiber, fruits and vegetables. You'll feel full with fewer calories on them. Fruits, vegetables and fibers are packed with nutrients but less on calories. <br>  <br>  I lost 10 pounds in just 2 months using these tips.<br>  <br>  Here are Tips to help speed up your metabolism plus help you lose weight without being miserable. they worked for me =)<br>  <br>  1. Fill up on Fiber and Lose Weight Fast<br>  <br>  Fill up on Fiber - Foods rich in fiber will make you feel satisfied and help curb your appetite, helping you to lose weight fast and safely - so make sure to pack your diet with fruits, vegetables and whole grains.<br>  <br>  2. Boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50% by sipping coffee<br>  <br>  Sipping coffee before a meal can supress appetite by 35%, plus boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50%, according to extensive research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The study-proven dose : 250 mg of caffeine daily, taken either in supplement form or by sipping to cups of coffee or 4 cups of tea.<br>  <br>  3. Lose Weight just by eating Yogurt<br>  <br>  Yogurt is a calcium-rich food. Research links calcium with lower cortisol production, and it has been proven that women who increase they're intake lose up to 40% more weight than calcium avoiders.<br>  <br>  Plus Yogurt has live microorganisms which helps proper digetion and absorption of nutrients we take. Make sure to get yogurts that says "with live microorganisms in labels/packages". <br>  <br>  4. Try this Hunger-Taming Trick<br>  <br>  Cut fat and you'll cut cravings. Consuming a high-fat diet may supress your body's natural satiety signals, according to a new study from Pennsylvania State University. Animals who'd been consuming a diet rich in fat ended up eating 40% more of a high-calorie snack than those on average diets. Keep your fat intake to less than 30% of total calories.<br>  <br>  5. Feel full on less food.<br>  <br>  Apples are rich in pectin, a soluble fiber that slows the digestive process, so you'll feel full on less food.The result: You'll eat just enough food to make you happy, reducing calorie intake.<br>  <br>  6. Studies suggest people pursuing a healthy weight could lose more weight and burn more fat by including 24 ounces a day of low fat or fat-free milk in their reduced-calorie diet, instead of 8 ounces or less.<br>  <br>  7. Speed fat burn with Cranberries. <br>  <br>  The ascorbic acid in cranberries helps thin liver bile, making it easier for the organ to emulsify fat so so it can be quickly flushed out of the system rather than stored in cells.<br>  <br>  8. Boost your protein intake and lose almost a pound a week without hunger. <br>  <br>  You can try protein smoothies. Packed with nutrients and low in calories, smoothies are a fast, easy and great tasting way to achieve good health.<br>  <br>  You can find a wide collection of healthy fruit smoothies at : <a href="http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com</a><br>  <br>  By boosting your protein intake from the typical 15% of total calories to 30%, you may be able to cut your daily calorie intake by 440-enough to lose almost a pound a week without hunger, according to a recent University of Washigton study. "A high-protein diet appears to fool the brain into thinking you've eaten more than you have," says the study's lead author, Scott Weigle, M.D., a professor of endocrinology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Stick with lean protein rather than high-fat, artery clogging meat and dairy products. For breakfast, use low-fat milk instead of water in your oatmeal and sprinkle nuts on top. Eat plenty of beans, fish and skinless chicken breast.<br>  <br>  9. To counteract a binge, keep your body's fat-burning furnace running on full blast by drinking Green Tea. <br>  <br>  Green Tea contains caffeine and the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) , which is proven to boost metabolic rate. In fact, in a recent 3 month study, participants who took Green Tea extract lost 4.6% of their body weight without changing their diet. To get the benefit, drink at least 3 cups a day. <br>  <br>  Whenever I ate too much, I just drink green tea and I don't have to worry gaining weight.<br>  <br>  10. Speed weight loss and double energy levels by eating Coconuts.<br>  <br>  This tropical treats contain medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a unique fat that is shuttled straight to the liver and immediately burned for fuel. Research shows this little detour revs metabolic rate by up to 50%, speeding weight loss and doubling energy levels<br>  <br>  Plus my favorite tip : Before you eat, drink a glass of water. This will help you feel fuller without additional calories (water has no calories). <br>  <br>  <br>  More of these Fast Weight Loss Tips Safely from: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.braveh...</a>  - great tips really <br>  <br>  Others:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://all-about-health-and-beauty.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://all-about-health-and-beauty.blogs...</a>|`|aDFStyrXaa	Personally I think you should take pills for losing weight because it won't matter  what you eat.

I don't think it's anything serious to worry about, but, for immediate relief, go to Walmart and buy a product called Thermacare heat pads. They come in forms of wrist, shoulder and neck. You could try ice but that's more for an inflammation. I would try taking 2 aleve or 2 ibuprofen, even tylenol if you have it available. But if nothing helps then you might want to schedule yourself an appointment with your doctor or be seen at the walk-in clinic. Hope that helps some.

You could possibly have a disc bulge, disc protrusion or disc herniation, These are not always seen on plain film sometimes an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is needed to diagnose the problem. If at all possible try to see a doctor as soon as possible. In the mean time, do as little as possible. Take it easy in other words. I hope all turns out well for you,|`|VCBUppwnaa	Hi, dont panic,, but care about ur back. This sometimes also reflects as pregnancy induced back ache. <br>  Apply some local application such as pain relief spray/gel.<br>  <br>  This may be a weak back muscle happened after your minor injury which has been exaggerated after your pregnancy. and sometimes it may be a disc bulge. Not to worry always maintain an erect posture. avoid direct bending.. bend by folding your hip and knee. Visit a orthopedic and take an advice for Interferential therapy with a help of a physical therapist for your pain to subside and start up with mild exercise for lower back. Ly flat on a hard bed. Be careful on your posture during shower.<br>  <br>  Hopefully everything will come down. Good luck|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Wow yes it sounds like you are going to have problems.  Actually sometimes things don't show up on X-Rays.  I was missing two discs entirely in my back and it never showed on the X-Rays, they did MRI's and CT Scans and a CT Myelogram where they injected die into my spine.  <br>  <br>  Because you are pregnant you have to be careful about what you take as far as medicine goes, but you should definitely talk to your doctor about this problem.

So if you know you have good form, try new shoes with better support. Also, try to run on a track or on grass, it's easier on the body than concrete. Shin splints can lead to stress fractures so make sure they heal properly!|`|1WYt9afNaa	awwe i know wat that feels like, but i know how to make it SO much better :) it will be better by tomorrow.<br>  If youre able to go to the pharmacy, I highly recommend  you to go and get rub A535<br>  Looks like this :<br>  <a href="http://www.wekenshop.com/images/3826.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wekenshop.com/images/3826.jpg</a><br>  <br>  it works SO well for joint pains andd muscle pains.<br>  Try it, it works.

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Dizziness and ringing in your ears is a sure sign of blood pressure changes.  It sounds like you need to see a doctor to determine if your blood pressure is too low.<br>  <br>  You probably won't feel nauseous, but you may feel woozy, unsteady and weak from it.|`|6SIjchQUaa	It could be an inner ear infection, see your doctor.|`|XtyR8FrGaa	It's time to see a Doctor.<br>  <br>  The ringing I believe is called tinnitus.  The can have a variety of causes.  It is common, an old saying is that when your ears ring it means people are talking about you.<br>  <br>  Dizziness can be caused by an inner ear infection or something disturbing the fluid in your "middle ear"<br>  <br>  I also know that your sense of position in the world is controlled by the cerebellum this is also referred ti as the (little brain).  It is responsible for telling you if you are upright, horizontal, leaning left/right or forward/backward.<br>  <br>  Try to explain to the doctors as specifically as possible the type of dizziness you're experiencing not all dizzy episodes are the same.<br>  <br>  Your vision problems must be made known also.  Try to write it all down and give details.  Such as time of day type of activities engaged in prior to the fact.  Writing down what you have been eating won't hurt.  Don't worry about being too wordy you can always edit your journal, but don't throw the originals out.  There could be something in there that seems insignificant to you but may be important later.<br>  <br>  It may be something very simple to remedy<br>  <br>  In my case it was quite serious and went undiagnosed for years.  I am just now able to go back into the work force after three years of having vertigo ( a type of dizziness) to the extent of not being able to walk un-assisted.  Do your best to catch it as soon as possible.  Even if the symptoms subside, look for answers.  In grade school I would have sweeping dizzy sensations.  The doctors didn't know what caused it.  It would come and go for several years. Years later in my mid 20's I would lose my vision on my right side, become disoriented and confused.  I didn't comprehend what I was seeing on the news.  I shook it off and just dealt with it myself, that was a mistake.  About 5 or 6  years ago I started to just get dizzy and fall over.  Sounds funny, looked funny to my friends but it was frightening. You don't need to know what I was diagnosed with.  Preconceived ideas can lead to self diagnosis and trouble. There are too many variables to consider.   Let the pros handle it.  Be very open and honest  with your answers.  Keep after them until you are satisfied with thier answers.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
xmibEEdcaa	The two main ingredients in both of those products are menthol and methyl salicylate.<br>  <br>  Menthol is made from mint oil. It has minor anesthetic qualities, feels icy on your skin, and smells pepperminty.<br>  <br>  Methyl Salicylate is found in birch bark and wintergreen, among other plants. It's a rubefacient, which means that it causes your capillaries to dilate and blood to flow to areas where it's rubbed in. It smells sort of like wintergreen. <br>  <br>  Methyl Salicylate is the really good stuff, in my opinion. I wouldn't bother with a lotion that contained only menthol.<br>  <br>  So, here are the breakdowns of the active ingredients in Icyhot products: <br>  <br>  patches<br>   - 5% menthol<br>  <br>  balm<br>   - 7.6% menthol<br>   - 29% methyl salicylate<br>  <br>  sleeves<br>   - 16% menthol<br>  <br>  Chill Stick<br>   - 10% menthol<br>   - 30% methyl salicylate<br>  <br>  Foam<br>   - 5% menthol<br>  <br>  cream<br>   - 10% menthol<br>   - 30% methyl salicylate<br>  <br>  And here's the breakdown of the active ingredients in Ben-gay products:<br>  <br>  original<br>   - 10% menthol<br>   - 15% methyl salicylate<br>  <br>  Ultra Strength/Muscle Pain<br>   - 10% menthol <br>   - 30% methyl salicylate<br>   - 4% camphor<br>  <br>  Ice Extra Strength<br>   - 10% menthol<br>  <br>  Muscle Pain/No Odor<br>   - 15% Triethanolamine Salicylate<br>  <br>  Arthritis Extra Strength<br>   - 8% menthol<br>   - 30% methyl salicylate<br>  <br>  So it looks to me as if the Icyhot balm, Chill Stick, and Cream are more or less the same as the Ben-gay Arthritis Extra Strength. <br>  <br>  The Ben-gay Ultra-Strength is the same as well, except with the addition of camphor. Camphor smells like Vick's Vapor Rub, and is both a cough suppressant and a topical anesthetic.<br>  <br>  So the Ben-gay Ultra-Strength (which is what I use) is the strongest, but the camphor probably isn't absolutely necessary, and some people really hate the way it smells.<br>  <br>  For a less stinky cream, Icyhot Balm, Icyhot Chill Stick, Icyhot cream and Ben-gay Arthritis Extra Strength are all the same in terms of how they work. They may smell a little different, but that's just cosmetic. So you can take your pick. :)|`|hI0ZWBycaa	I prefer Icyhot. I have it and use it. Works instantly. I have never tried bengay.

You are starving your body and not getting the proper nourishment. People die doing this sort of thing, because your body literally begins to eat itself, and you lost muscle mass and organs shut down. You should lose no more than 2 pounds per week, anything more is unhealthy and damaging to your body. There's no need to rush, just take your time. Do something like eating 250 less calories a day and burning off another 250 through exercise. That's 500 calories a day which is 3500 a week and 1 pound of fat.|`|z09g8ZVWaa	NO!!!! Your consuming too little.

You'll lose a bunch of weight in the first week, but then the weight loss will slow down dramatically. You'll also start feeling sick, fainting a lot and suffering other unpleasant side effects, because your body has gone into starvation mode and will hold on to every calorie it possibly can. To lose weight, a female should be eating AT LEAST 1200 calories a day to avoid these side effects (which is still really low).<br>  <br>  If you lose faster than 1-2 pounds a week (2-3 pounds if you're really obese), it's pretty much impossible to keep that weight off for very long.

But aiming for 2 hours of exercise a day is perhaps a bit ambitious, an hour a day will be fine. If you're looking for sustained weight loss you shouldn't loose more than 3 pounds a week (the first few weeks of a diet can be faster though) otherwise you run a serious risk of bouncing back up as soon as you come off the diet and the weight loss won't be healthy!<br>  All that said, good luck!|`|6ohGilDCaa	well i used to eat 500 calories a day for three months and lost about 20 pounds without any exercise when i never even need to loose any weight at all, if you eat 700 cal. you will just suffer from anorexia and most likely never be satisfied with yourself dont bother trying to loose weight unless your so life threatening large just live healthy and love yourself for how you look know you will be so much happier with yourself 20 pounds heavier and healthier. by the way tabitha vv that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard, its not precise   ice at all, i doubt id be able to eat 46,000 calories a day haha. wow |`|2GuTXFiCaa	you are considered to have anorexia if you do that (just to tell you) and you would probably lose (depending on your current weight and size) <br>  15-30 pounds in 3 weeks....<br>  i don't wanna be mean but it is really unhealthy and I wish you wouldn't do it because theres healthier ways to lose weight.. =( well i hope everything goes well and I hope I helped.|`|fwjHHRFwaa	yes, you will lose weight.

The correct answer to your question is found in knowing what really causes bad breath. Up to 90 % of bad breath comes from bacteria that grow on the top of your tongue and produce the bad smells. This bacteria can often be seen as white stuff on the tongue, especially in the back of the tongue. This must be removed to cure bad breath. I use an OraBrush because it is both a brush and a scraper. It really gets to the back of the tongue to remove the white stuff. Brush and floss the teeth and then clean the tongue. You will really notice a great difference. Twice a day should do it if you use and OraBrush and really clean the back of the tongue.<br>  Here is the website if you are interested: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|3lsL9YWHaa	Gargle sault water.

TAufQoc7aa	Hey there. I'm going to be honest with you<br>  <br>  Your story sounds so similar to my fiance's. When he was 17 he was on the swim team basketball and soccer team, very very fit, but he always got chest pains, after running and also when he was lying down. Then when he was 19 he collapsed and it turned out it was a heart attack. It was very random and he did not drink or smoke and as I said he was very fit. Anyway it turned out he had a blocked artery and they put a stent in to keep it open and now he is on medication. Im not trying to scare you but I really think you need to take this seriously. Just go to the doctor and explain this. It usually is sporty people who have these kinds of trouble. It is a form of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome kind of like cot death in adults. Last year 3 boys aged between 11 and 17 died in my area while doing PE, I dont know why but it always seems to be the sporty ones. Please just get checked out. It could turn out to be nothing but your health is your wealth and you really dont want to mess with your heart...<br>  <br>  xx<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lRSemsJGaa	Well it doesn't help that your family has heart issues. The pain could be something called angina. It would be called stable cause its brought on by exercise. It is the narrowing of your coronary arteries. This could be what the pain is.Could be vasospasm. One reason why vasospams are undesirable is because they cause ischemia. This resulting loss of oxygen supply to vital organs can lead to angina, myocardial infarction and even death. Go to a cardiologist. Get an MRI. Check yourself before you wreck yourself. Paramedic- Pete|`|Qdb5LZMCaa	please see your doctor. It is probably nothing but its better to be safe.|`|c07v7O80aa	You can indeed have heart problems at 17. Many of them can be corrected. But chest and arm pain is always fair warning, and you shouldn't ignore it. If you think being treated for a heart problem at 17 is bad, think about having part of you heart muscle die at 17. Get a referral from your family doctor to a cardiologist. If it's nothing, fine. If it's something, he might help you get from 17 to 77.

The cingulate system is our switching mechanism and when it is overactive it essentially gets stuck.<br>  <br>  This can cause obsessions, compulsions, irritability, depression, and anxiety. Usually serotonin based SSRI's such as lexipro will help calm the system down. OBSESS-care is a natural supplement that also helps calm that part of the brain.

You can't base things like that on what your friend who I doubt even graduated from high school yet, diagnoses you with.<br>  So go to the doctor, tell them your symptoms, what you've been feeling. And if you get diagnosed then they will give you medication and probubly therapy.<br>  <br>  But just because you cut doesn't mean you are schitzophrenic. I don't know where your friend got that.

What it does mean for you is that cutting is a coping mechanism for you at the moment and in order to stop, you need to find out ways that will give you good support and help you to stop.  Talking to someone is a great idea, especially someone you trust.  Would you consider looking for counselling?  That would give you some good insights into what might be a problem for you right now.  You could also seek other forms of professional help too and I would advise that.  If you have a doctor you trust, you could start there, or a trusted friend who could recommend somebody to begin with?  In the meantime, you could maybe think about why you cut, what can trigger you to cut and what might help you at these bad times?  Maybe ringing someone you trust, finding a relaxing activity, writing things down?  Just suggestions..  Best of luck and please do keep looking for good support..you deserve it and it will help.|`|ql8YkYmuaa	uh... you probably dont have scitzofrania. you're probably just really depressed about life.<br>  to me... that really would not make sense for you to have scitzofrania.<br>  and if you want to know what it is.. just look it up on google or something, cuz i have no clue lol.

mQhqRbRQaa	Not necessarily.  A lot of prescription medication just doesn't work.  <br>  What you need to do, (it works miracles), go to any Natural Food store and buy a lotion called DMSO.  It works wonders.  I had acne on my face for 2 years, and that inexpensive, infamous lotion got rid of all of my zits and pimples.  Trust me, try it out.|`|gn0LrrSRaa	You should go see a dermatologist. If not, get over the counter products.

I don't know if that is only meant for the face though.|`|DHdhdis6aa	Often, acne can be caused by how you wash your hair. Whenever you put conditioner in, you have to be really thorough with washing it back out- it's meant to stay in your hair and "condition" it, whereas shampoo is meant simply to clean any dirt out beforehand, and as a result washes out more easily. Anyway, if you wash your hair by tilting your head back and letting the water run over it, you may very well be getting conditioner on your back, which could in turn clog your pores. I suppose it could also clog pores on your thighs as well, causing additional acne. Usually, rinsing hair is the last thing people do in the shower, and so the conditioner on the back just sits there, which is a pimple waiting to happen. Next time you wash your hair, and for a week or so afterward, try rinsing your hair by tilting your head forward and letting your hair run in front of your face, like Samara from The Ring- that way your hair will still become clean but without any conditioner residue on your skin.<br>  <br>  If that's not the problem, however, I would recommend seeing a dermatologist. They can help troubleshoot with you, and proscribe medications if necessary.|`|kTTMftB2aa	yeah doctors can give you some good pills for that but proactive really works as good as they say it does it cured mine completely, it's pretty expensive but if you search proactive knock offs on google you can find cheaper ones that work just as good i forgot what it's called|`|0cnzZIATaa	- this is all you should need to cure your spot problems quickly:  <br>   <a href="http://nomoreacne.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://nomoreacne.notlong.com</a>|`|rEs4Y5Niaa	i just use my normal face wash for zits... it does the same thing on any part of your body!!<br>  it may sound weird but just try it!|`|u0S5N5wDaa	yes see a dermatologist.. they can prescribed you great topical creams, lotions and other things..|`|guxQ6NPHaa	Retina A creme will remove them as they removed mine.|`|eSGBXFEjaa	Sounds painful!

bvUMwDgyaa	The best thing to do is to not touch it. Touching it can cause it to become irritated; which will make it red, puffy, or it could possibly pop and cause more zits or just become a bigger, nastier, zit. <br>  If you have a acne wash, gently wet a wash cloth with water and squirt the acne wash onto the wash cloth and lather. GENTLY rub the soap on your face, being very sensitive and cautious so as not to irritate the zit. Don't use your hands when washing with the acne wash because the oils that naturally occur on your hands will just make your face more oily. Wash all the soap off and go to bed. Your skin should feel a little bit dry because of the wash, but don't put lotion on it. <br>  When you wake up in the morning the zit should be dryed out, and from there, you're on your way to being zit free.
F9Ll7oLJaa	see a good specialist of the topic|`|vWm1l9nuaa	Acupuncture is not a science. It is more of a philosophy. Or rather a group of philosophies. There are numerous acupuncture systems, each with their own set of meridians and acupuncture points. If you applied all acupuncture systems at the same time, there wouldn't be many spots on the body that wasn't an acupuncture point. In short, acupuncture isn't an exact science that can be used to treat diabetes.

Instead of trying to learn about what makes them afraid, they would rather act like it doesn't exist. Part of acting like it doesn't exist is treating people differently because in the person's mind they are different and because they aren't sure how to act around someone that frightens them.<br>  <br>  I know becasue I have both a physical disability and a psychactirc one.

RgEtKVaKaa	Yes, Paxil can cause bradycardia - a slow heart rate.  Conversely, it can also cause tachycardia - a rapid heart rate.  Are you experiencing symptoms - dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, shortness of breath?  A slow heart rate in and of itself is not a problem; the question is are you having symptoms related to the slow heart rate?  Please keep in mind that blood pressure machines in pharmacies, grocery stores, etc, are not very reliable.  These machines are not calibrated frequently - hospital machines are calibrated on a schedule.  You are a big man, so I would expect your heart rate to be higher.  Are you taking any other medications?  <br>  Obviously, this is causing you distress so by all means, call your doctor.  His/her reassurance will ease your mind.

AA10582987	My mother has it also. I can give you a ton of information on it.<br>  <br>  Pretty much your mother has these spots on her brain which effects certain parts of her body. They make some parts of her body not able to function as much or as well. It makes scars inside her body. No, you cannot see them. But they are there. For example, when you want to pick up a cup, you brain sends a signal to your arm to lift your arm and to put your hand around the cup. For someone with MS, they signal will go down to the arm and then because of the scars there the signal will never make it all the way there, making it go back to the brain, and he/she will not be able to grab ahold of the cup.<br>  <br>  It is not lethal. Your mom will probably have to get a shot monthly if not weekly and will have to take medicines. It makes her a lot more tired and weaker. If she takes that shot on a monthly period, then hopefully her MS will not get worse or it will grow slowly.<br>  <br>  She should be able to have a normal life to the most. She should never let it get her down, and neither should it for you. You need to help out your mom a lot more since she is going to be a lot more weak. But it got my family a lot closer in a way and I care a lot about my mom and I'm very interested in learning everything I can about her disease.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped out.

These patches distort and interrupt the messages that are sent along these nerves. ‘Sclerosis’ means scar and the disease is labelled ‘multiple’ because the damage usually occurs at a number of points.<br>  <br>  MS can progress in different ways. Some people with MS may become seriously disabled. Others may have one or two attacks and then remain symptom free for the rest of their lives. The frequency and severity of attacks cannot be predicted.<br>  <br>  MS can damage the central nervous system in many different locations, which means no two people will share the same symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms include:<br>  <br>      * Blurred or double vision<br>      * Numbness or pins and needles<br>      * Weakness in the arms or legs<br>      * Loss of balance<br>      * Tendency to drag one foot<br>      * Loss of coordination<br>      * Extreme fatigue<br>      * Continence problems<br>      * Hand tremors<br>      * Loss of mobility<br>      * Problems with or changes in memory functioning<br>      * Speech difficulties and slurring.<br>  <br>  There are different types of MS (explained more fully on website below). In the most common type (relapsing - remitting), people have an attack of symptoms, and then recover for months or years before another attack. Over the years, this may change into the secondary relapsing - remitting type where some of the symptoms remain all the time.<br>  Unfortunately, it is impossible for anyone, even doctors, to predict exactly how MS will affect your mum. Treatments are available that can reduce the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. MS is a serious condition; but it is a fairly slow moving disabling disease rather than a quickly lethal one. It is not uncommon for people to live with it for thirty or forty years.|`|dZjkuw74aa	its not really that big of a deal.<br>  while its still a disease, there should be no problem.<br>  my aunt has it in her hand and it only affects her ability to write real neat.<br>  but she will be ok.<br>  i wouldnt worry about it too much.<br>  but best of luck to your mother.|`|AA11048920	Modest mouse, Most of the people who answered your question did not give you accurate information. They did not do that on purpose though. They just answered your question on the basis of the case of MS that a member of their family has. The truth is that multiple sclerosis varies a lot from person to person. I have had MS for 20 years. In general all of us suffer from fatigue and pins and needles. We also have a form of the disease in which the symptoms come and go. We might have symptoms for a few days, weeks or months, but then they go away for a period of time that can vary from a few weeks to as long as decades.  The majority of us live normal lives just as the rest of society does. This disease does not kill people. There are some progressive forms of the disease that do render a person disabled but they are the exception and not the rule. It will take time to know how the disease will effect your Mom. The best thing that you can do is to go to a reliable website to read about the disease. Yahoo Answers is a fun place to go but not a place to go for good, accurate information.  You can go to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website at NMSS.ORG. This website is an excellent source of information. They also have an 800 number so that you can call them for free to ask a question. Do not hesitate to call them. Good luck to you sweetie.|`|TDRiKHFmaa	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a variety of symptoms.

Good luck.<br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com/tools/bmi.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com/tools/bmi.php</a>|`|bXmRWbEdaa	You are at a good weight.  You do not need to change.|`|6xMkf08eaa	I just found this out the other day, but there are three types of body types that people have.  Ectomorph, Endomorph, and Mesomorph.<br>  Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you are an Ectomorph as I am, which means you are naturally skinny. It doesn't mean you are unhealthy or have an eating disorder.   For you to gain the weight, you are going to have to eat well beyond your means and not work it off,  you are fighting a high metabolism.<br>  <br>  Anyways, look up these three types, maybe this will make a bit more sense|`|6rNmAqXnaa	exercise. get all of your required nutrients per day. <br>  <a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/healthyaging/caregiving/images/food_pyramid.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohsu.edu/healthyaging/caregiv...</a>
86VgnUmQaa	This is pretty bad. EVERY TIME she gets her period? Dude, she has gotta go to the doctor!|`|vVEnCP0faa	I think she probably needs to go on a higher dose of the birth control pill.  My pill wasn't helping and it contained 20mg of hormones, so I switched to a pill that had 35 mg of hormones.  This might help her.  If she has already had a yearly physical at the gyno office, then she doesn't have anything to worry about.  They won't do a physical exam on her.  They will probably just ask her the symptoms and switch her pills.  She could also go to a general physicians office.  This is where I went the first time I was put on the pill and I didn't have to have a physical.  Good luck to her!  Untill she sees a gyno the most she can do is take ibuprofen, eat alot of bananas, and stay in bed.  Hope everything turns out ok!|`|q6hOg022aa	yes its true some girls may have these symptoms but very rare i would force her its for her own good. it may be serious, ovarian cancer etc u never know take her shell hate u but later be happy n luv u more.|`|WchGezIAaa	TAKE.HER.TO.THE.GYNO.<br>  <br>  now.<br>  <br>  good gravy.|`|wZzWmXU0aa	this is serious! go to the doc. she may have fibroids on her uterus!|`|0jh9SnIEaa	I get this way sometimes.  I never get so bad that i faint, usually when i feel really light headed and like i might faint i sit down and wait a few minutes for it to pass. I get the headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, cramps... the works.  <br>  <br>  A new pill might help. Usually these symtoms are due to the hormonal changes a girls body goes through around the time of her period. Most birth control pills work by leveling out hormones during the month.  If the pill is to weak or too strong, she may have problems.<br>  <br>  During that time some people have an iron deficiency, like i do, due to blood loss. Potassium helps with cramps, as well as heating packs and warm baths. Ibuprofen can help with headaches.  I take an iron supplement around this time if i feel really weak, as well as taking a multivitamin every day. It helps.<br>  <br>  Either way, she should atleast call her gyno. She may not even have to go in.  Sometimes you can get a prescription changed over the phone, as well as have your questions answered. If the gyno asks her to come in, she should. Go with her, it's better to make sure it's nothing serious than to wait.  It'll be even scarier for her if she's lets something serious go for too long.|`|f890d82e3b2cb1a15aa475ff75321c1aaa	She most definitely should not be avoiding her gynecologist... Gynecological appointments should never hurt. That it hurts for her could be a sign of a deeper problem, like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or endometriosis.<br>  <br>  If it isn't PCOS or endometriosis, it might just be very painful periods... Apparently, they're quite common and not a lot works for them. Prescription-wise, she could probably get muscle relaxers and/or pain meds. If she's more into the natural thing, chamomile tea, plenty of water, and heating pads will help. Magnesium supplements may also relieve the cramps a bit.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some. I can't imagine what I'd do if I had it that bad =[.|`|vywlxU0yaa	About 8 percent of women have nausea and 3 percent have vomiting with their menstrual periods. You don’t mention pain, but often the vomiting is accompanied by menstrual cramps. It seems to relate to how certain bodies react to the prostaglandins produced during menstruation. Medications with anti-prostaglandin effects can often help. These include ibuprofen (such as Motrin?), naproxen (Aleve?) and the most recent formulations of cramp medications like Midol? for instance. If that hasn’t helped, it would be best to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your problem and perhaps try prescription medications.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	try switching what pill she takes. some (i think yaz) are supposed to help more than others with severe symptoms. also make sure she takes a multivitamin. she will need the extra iron and potassium. have her drink extra fluids as women dehydrate durning their cycles too. and really try to get her to the doctor. something worse than pms may be wrong with her.|`|RMVvU6Vcaa	She needs the doctor so he can give her a note saying she can't work/go to school for 3-7 specific days a month. Sounds like there might be a remedy that a doctor can give. But only a doctor. It is uncomfortable but it doesn't really hurt.|`|d6Uncd6iaa	I'd suggest taking her to the doctor as it sounds like toxic shock syndrom.  I'm not a doctor, so it is not real sound advice, but if i am right, if not treated can be fatal. not sure why she doesn't go, but try to make her|`|TA4VaUx0aa	sounds 90 percent normal but still get checkup from a Doctor.|`|RV5EOUKlaa	awww...at least you care that is good....just be there for her....|`|auVg3SbDaa	She might have fainted because of dehydration (you mentioned that she'd vomited several times--when you lose a lot of fluid from the top (eg vomiting) or bottom (eg diarrhea) it can cause dehydration which makes you feel light-headed. Get some gatorade into her if she's having problems keeping solids down. I'd still go to the doctor. If she's really vomiting so much that she's fainted, she may have developed a minor electolyte imbalance and they could check for sure with a basic chemistry panel. If they think she needs it, they could also replace her fluid loss a lot quicker than you could with at home gatorade. <br>  <br>  I'd also pay a visit to the gynecologist. Better safe than sorry. Plus, if it's just severe PMS or PMDD she can get meds for it or switch her pill to one that helps with this condition.<br>  <br>  PS-Before you take any of this advice, make sure she just had her period. If not, she may be pregnant in addition to having PMDD or severe PMS.
Ldra6te8aa	There's just a few things to be sure of:<br>  <br>  -Have snacks, you get the munchies, ALL food tastes great.<br>  -Have some chilling music like reggae, it sounds great!<br>  -Don't do it in bad weather, or you might start panicking and freaking out. (This only happens to some people)<br>  <br>  Just be with some friends, relax, and have a good time, it is great. You feel happy, relaxed, all your troubles go away, you see that THERE IS good and hope for peace in the world.|`|1JSblCBsaa	put your emails on and I will tell you honestly. I don't feel the need to broadcast it here though|`|aVxUT1cYaa	First of all, sorry Chris B, I meant to give you a thumbs up, not a thumbs down.<br>  <br>  Well, f you're trying it for the first time, MAKE SURE TO INHALE. I can't stress this enough. You can't just hold it in your mouth. You gotta really push it down into your lungs. <br>  <br>  As for the effects, you'll feel "altered." Things will seem funnier and more interesting, and your senses will be altered. You'll be really damned hungry (and food will taste amazing), your eyes will likely get red, your vision may be somewhat affected, your mouth will get dry (just plain water is best for this I've found), music will sound great, things will feel different (btw, orgasms are magnified by about ten times when high) and depending on the strain/the amount you smoke/your tolerance, you'll either feel inspired and social, or you'll feel the famous "couch-lock" effect. Both are nice.<br>  <br>  In short, you'll be hungry, happy, and sleepy.<br>  <br>  Oh, and PLEASE don't start stereotypical stoner conversations. "Dudes.......what if like......we could fly, and like.......dragons were real n' ****, so we could like ride them and be like....HOLY **** I'M RIDING A DRAGON!" <br>  You know the sort. Just relax and enjoy a nice chilled out high.|`|siuPYTplaa	Different types of bud will give you different highs, but most likely if its good bud you'll get a nice body and mind high. You'll be happy and confident, ehh kinda hard to describe. If you close your eyes and turn on some music it'll be like a music video in your head you'll take a trip like into your head with like a story and crap. Your body will feel a bit shakey your first time, depends on you and the type of bud though. Normally ur bodys kinda fuzzy and well theres a lot of different posibilites. If you can know what your getting and post, and i know what it is i can give u a much better description.|`|vzlQiZNwaa	Imaging feeling like there is no gravity. All your worries go away and you feel happy. It's great to relieve short term stress and would recommend it to anyone|`|82f7229d874223ffc501636d6a689c93aa	just pretty chill. it doesnt do much.<br>  makes you calm and relaxed.|`|DuRKaZsjaa	Hopefully the people you are smoking with have experience with it, when I smoked weed for the first time I had no idea what I was doing, I didn't hold the smoke in, and I didn't get high at all. Let them show you exactly how to do it. Also do it somewhere you can enjoy the high, marijuana isn't bad, just don't get carried away, and do be an idiot. If your somewhere where your constantly worried about being busted then you are going to be paranoid the whole night, and not be able to relax at all. <br>  Depending on what you are smoking (whether its shwag, regs, mids, dank) the high will vary. While you are high you will probably be forgetful, everything will be hilarious, and you will be very relaxed. When I first got "superhigh", when I walked it felt like I was on a treadmill, I would be moving, but it didn't feel like I was going anywhere. <br>  <br>  Oh and don't drive, I admit I am guilty of it, and to the experienced smoker it really isn't a big deal, but my first time getting extremely high I tried to drive home and had to just pull over and come down for a bit, it's best to just not mess with it. As long as you don't get paranoid, anything you do is going to be enjoyable. <br>  <br>  Have fun, and be safe. Oh and don't go on to anything harder! If your going to do a drug just smoke pot and let that be it please.|`|1mFA8Iq9aa	some people dont get high their first time, so make sure you smoke a lot :)<br>  make sure you have some snacks and juice also because it makes your mouth dry and you get hungry.<br>  your gonna laugh at everything, its the best feeling in the world.<br>  your going to think of things in a way you've never thought of them before.<br>  music is gonna sound amazing, and if you have itunes, watch the visulizer, its great hahah. <br>  <br>  <br>  the only bad thing about it is its illegal so be careful, getting caught with it on you would be baddd.|`|UJ4uSNIcaa	Depends if it's a sativa or indica blend. wow. too much info for a first timer :)<br>  <br>  It feels relaxing. Slightly hazy the first time, but you feel good, grounded, happy. Giggly, hungry (first time at least. you get over "munchies" pretty quick), a loving. <br>  <br>  Have some chill music, and do some yoga. It feels amazing!|`|kJ7YyGt2aa	you shouldn't try it. it probably feels like your dying. if you need help contacting poison control go on wikipedia. i do have the police "drug-buster" people on speed dial. better be careful.|`|p3NrRfBhaa	Go for it champ, just don't freak out when you have already done it because that is the worst thing you can do.  You don't feel like urself, but it is fuckin awesome.|`|8j6Az9mXaa	noooooooooooooooooooooo being high doesnt feel bad at all unless you eat a ton. nut since its your first time you probley wont get high but mostly you just feel kind of hot and hungry and really good most thing are funny and your face feels weird but it is amazing|`|HZHWWPCwaa	For the most part you are just relaxed.  Don't drive, make sure you have a lot of snacks and most of all just have relax and have fun.
fk9AvB25aa	I believe syphilis is usually sexually transmitted. If you have not come close to having oral or regular sex then I doubt that is is syphilis or any other std. It could be in grown hairs, boils, regular pimples, pearly papules, or infected follicles.<br>  You could have cold sores or canker sore in side of your mouth. You can get those things with out having sex You can get cold sores from kissing some one who has them or sharing things that go from a mouth with cold sores immediately to your mouth.<br>  If your worried about the bump down south then have a doctor look at it.|`|StRqfVgvaa	yes if you've had any sexual contact with someone that does... but if youi have sores in your mouth its just probably a gum or skin that has been aggraviated... and with the private part its might be a broiler.

Avoid artificial sugar and dairy food as well<br>  Eat curd everyday with food. One bowl with lunch and one with dinner.<br>  Eat more vegetables and fruits like apple or watermelon or oranges to move that bowel easily and drink 15-20 glasses of water.<br>  You have no problem just diet needs to be changed for few months until you see improvement and have a effectual bowel movement.
hBmafVYoaa	If you are in agony or really worried yes they can help. But I don't know how much they can do. If you are seeing a neurologist my best advice would be to call his office in the morning.|`|nAp688tZaa	You can go to the ER or an Urgent Care center and they should be able to give you something for the nausea and something else to stop the migraine.  After that, you need to call the neurologist and get an appointment as soon as they have one available, or even ask if the doctor has any emergency appointments available.  Let them know that you were seen in the ER and you need to be seen for a follow up very quickly.  When you see the doctor, let him know that the abortive medication that you were given is not working and that you need to try a different one.  Try and stay away from taking narcotic pain medicine since they cause horrible rebound headaches which are usually worse than the original migraine you started out with.  If you start taking things like Vicodin and Percocet every time you get a migraine, you will never get rid of them.  They only make things worse.  I have had migraines for many years, and sometimes the only thing that you can do is go to the ER and have them medicate you.  But after that, you need to see about getting on a preventative medication to reduce the frequency and intensity of the migraines.  If you get nausea with all of your migraines there is a medication called Maxalt-MLT.  It melts under your tongue so you do not have to worry about throwing up any pills you have taken to get rid of the headache. They work very quickly to relieve the pain.  After that, all you do is lay down for a nap and when you wake up, you will feel better.  For now, go to the hospital and get treated, then follow up with the neurologist.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You can go to the ER.  They will give you nausea medicine and pain medicine that's amazing and this stuff WILL help.  I know what you're talking about, it's hard to get a grip on pain.  They will do some tests to see if there is a reason for your headaches specifically, if not (they dont see anything bad)  they will let you go home and will give you pain medicine and probably a prevenitive to try and keep them away.  I was having a lot of headaches a while ago too...I'd go get checked out so you know that there's nothing really bad going on (not trying to freak you out) and you can get some relief.  Good luck hun, I know pains no fun...well, it is once you get the medicine lol, jk, but it really does help.  have someone drive you there because they wont give you pain medicine if they know you drove by yourself because that's some strong s$$t and you cant drive on it.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	They will give you medicine to relieve the pain so that you won't feel like throwing up, tell them you are having a bad migraine headache.  They most likely won't keep you.  Also if you have like an Urgent Care in your area that may be cheaper and faster than going to the Emergency Room.|`|wowfwe9Uaa	yea the emergency room can help u all they will do is give u some medicane and send u home if it is not to bad
V8GrFx0jaa	Take them into the bathroom and run the shower on HOT. You're putting them in the room with the steam, not in the shower with the hot water. The steam should help in both cases.|`|s8TwWPdDaa	The steam in a great idea..also get a vaporizer for them to keep in their rooms at night..fill it with water and add a little salt. Also put a little vicks vapor rub on there chests...helps with any cold or flu. dont give them cough medicine though..even if its childrens. Try motrin instead of Tylenol helps the fever and the overall flu symptoms better! Hope they feel better!
A4tNCj8Eaa	Snacking is probably the worst thing you can do to your teeth, brushing is important and certainly required after any meal. However what really matters is when to eat/drink, rather than what to eat/drink. Drinking a sugary drink with your meal and then brushing well after will have no bad effect; however drinking/eating sugar in between the meals is what causes decay. Teeth go in a cycle of demineralization / remineralization, they get demineralized every time you eat and drink, as PH goes down and mouth becomes acidic and teeth get more susceptible to caries this way, and if you supply the bacteria with carbohydrates at this stage decay will start. your teeth need minimum of 4 hours to remineralize, and that's why we recommend having distinct meals without snacking in between, your teeth need this time between meals to recover from acidity and remineralize to maximize their calcium content and resistance to decay. Drinking sugar and snacking all day will not give your teeth the time they need to recover and you are simply providing the bacteria with the ideal situation to start decay which is acidity and carbohydrate supply.  Brushing is important, but it does very little help to protect your teeth if you are snacking all the time, <br>  If you want to drink/eat something in between meals it's certainly has to be sugarless, and water being the best, and vegetables or cheese as food. Vegetables as a snack are great due to high content of fibers, some studies suggest that cheese protect teeth against decay. In real life this can be really hard to do, but establishing good habits is not easy and in case you really have to drink/eat something in between meals, try to brush immediately after, and flossing is even more important as most caries start in between the teeth and that's where your tooth brush doesn't reach.|`|uiTkwGBNaa	eat raisins<br>  Raisins Promote Healthy Gums and Teeth<br>  <br>  Raisins, despite being sweet and sticky, not only do not cause cavities and gum disease, but actually promote oral health. The phytonutrientss in raisins, specifically one called oleanolic acid, are highly effective in killing the bacteria that cause cavities (Streptococcus mutans) and periodontal dental disease (Porphyromonas gingivalis).<br>  <br>  Plus, the sugars raisins contain-mainly fructose and glucose-are not as likely to contribute to cavities as sucrose, the main culprit in oral disease. So, add raisins to your morning cereal, lunch time fruit salad, or tossed green salad with dinner. You can satisfy your sweet tooth without sacrificing healthy teeth and gums.<br>  <br>  <br>  or.. Rinse with Stevia and water.|`|D3hLhqR7aa	Brush your teeth 2 to 3 times a day.|`|BZNzbKw4aa	I'll try to make this simple: <br>  Bacteria feed on those snacks which therefore creates acid which breaks down your teeth. <br>  <br>  If there's no bacteria, then you can snack safely. <br>  <br>  So brush before you snack. <br>  <br>  Here are two other things you can do to protect your teeth- chew gum with Xylitol (like Orbitz) and use ACT mouthwash after you brush. <br>  <br>  -Alex <br>  <a href="Http://www.lacosmeticbraces.com" rel="nofollow">Http://www.lacosmeticbraces.com</a>|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Apparently so yes, I've been advised to brush my teeth before breakfast especially as the sugar in the food starts attacking the enamal fast, so brushing them straight away will 'corrode' them faster if you like.<br>  I wouldn't recommend brushing them more than 3 times a day, the toothpaste you use should take care of your teeth for hours after use so there really is no need to brush after everything you eat.|`|kZNB4912aa	i would just drink water or milk after snacking

Don't ask me how but someone told me that they have learned how to do this.<br>  My concern is that you also have bad breath because you are not properly cleaning the top of your tongue.  The bacteria that are there produce a "soft plaque" which often moves to the teeth and then hardens.  This material could also move to your tonsil area and lodge there.  By regular cleaning the tongue you will eliminate the source of the material that lodges in your tonsil area.  I suggest using OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and scraper and really cleans to the back of your tongue. Twice a day should to the trick.  It only costs a few dollars and is very effective. <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>

318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	9 calories, just like any other fat.|`|b85e2a0d3cb07c2893e69855e0a90655aa	From all you hear, you'd think fat and calories are really bad for you. It's true that today's teens may be eating more fat and calories than they need. But we all need a certain amount of fat and calories in our diets to fuel our growth and activities - everything from solving a math problem to racing up and down the soccer field. So what's the truth on fat and calories?<br>  <br>  What Are Fat and Calories?<br>  Fats, or lipids, are nutrients in food that the body uses to build nerve tissue (like the brain) and hormones. The body also uses fat as fuel. If fats that a person has eaten aren't burned as energy or used as building blocks, they are stored by the body in fat cells. This is the body's way of thinking ahead: By saving fat for future use, it plans for times when food might be scarce.<br>  <br>  A calorie is a unit of energy that measures how much energy food provides to the body. The body needs calories to function properly.<br>  <br>  Fat, Calories, and Food Labels<br>  Calories<br>  Food labels list calories by the amount in each serving size. Serving sizes differ from one food to the next, so to figure out how many calories you're eating, you'll need to do 3 things:<br>  <br>  1. Look at the serving size.<br>  2. See how many calories there are in one serving.<br>  3. Multiply the number of calories by the number of servings you're going to eat.<br>  <br>  For example, a bag of cookies may list 3 cookies as a serving size. But if you eat 6 cookies, you are really eating 2 servings, not 1. To figure out how many calories those 2 servings contain, you must double the calories in 1 serving.<br>  <br>  When you start looking at food labels, you may be surprised at some of the serving sizes. For example, on the labels of 6 cold breakfast cereals, the serving size ranges from 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) to 1 3/4 cups (414 milliliters). You would have to more than triple the smallest serving size (1/2 cup, or 118 milliliters) to compare the calories in that cereal with the calories in the cereal with the largest serving size (1 3/4 cups, or 414 milliliters). A small bag of corn chips may contain 2 or more servings - although most people would eat the entire bag! That's why it's always important to check the serving size of all foods on the label.<br>  <br>  Fat<br>  When it comes to fat, labels can say many things. Low fat, reduced fat, light (or lite), and fat free are common terms you're sure to see on food packages. The U.S. government has strict rules about the use of these phrases: By law, fat-free foods can contain no more than 0.5 grams of fat per serving. Low-fat foods may contain 3 grams of fat or less per serving. Foods marked reduced fat and light (lite) are a little trickier, and you may need to do some supermarket sleuthing.<br>  <br>  Light (lite) and reduced-fat foods may still be high in fat. The requirement for a food to be labeled light (lite) is that it must contain 50% less fat or one third fewer calories per serving than the regular version of that food. Foods labeled reduced fat must contain 25% less fat per serving than the regular version. But if the regular version of a particular food was high in fat to begin with, a 25% to 50% reduction may not lower the fat content enough to make it a smart snacking choice. For example, the original version of a brand of peanut butter contains 17 grams of fat and the reduced fat version contains 12 grams. That's still a lot of fat!<br>  <br>  It's important to figure out how many of the calories you're getting come from fat. U.S. dietary guidelines recommend that the average person gets no more than 30% of all his or her daily calories from fat. But food labels don't always show the percentage of fat in a food. It is easy to calculate, though. Divide the number of calories from fat by the number of total calories and multiply by 100:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For example, if a 300-calorie food has 60 calories from fat, you divide 60 by 300 and then multiply by 100. The result shows that food gets 20% of its calories from fat:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4, 4, and . . . 9?<br>  The calories in food come from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. A gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories. A gram of protein also contains 4 calories. A gram of fat, though, contains 9 calories - more than twice the amount of the other 2.<br>  <br>  That's why 1 food with the same serving size as another may have far more calories. A high-fat food has many more calories than a food that's low in fat and higher in protein or carbohydrates.<br>  <br>  For instance, a 1/2-cup (118-milliliter) serving of vanilla ice cream contains:<br>  <br>  178 total calories <br>  2 grams of protein (2 grams times 4 calories = 8 calories from protein) <br>  12 grams of fat (12 grams times 9 calories = 108 calories, or 61%, from fat) <br>  15.5 grams of carbohydrate (15.5 grams times 4 calories = 62 calories from carbohydrate) <br>  Compare this to the same serving size (1/2 cup, 118 milliliters) of cooked carrots:<br>  <br>  36 total calories <br>  1 gram of protein (1 gram times 4 calories = 4 calories from protein) <br>  0 grams of fat (0 grams times 0 calories = 0 calories from fat) <br>  8 grams of carbohydrate (8 grams times 4 calories = 32 calories from carbohydrate) <br>  So fat makes quite a difference when it comes to total calories in a food.<br>  <br>  But let's face it, who's going to choose a heaping bowl of cooked carrots over ice cream on a hot summer day? It all comes down to making sensible food choices most of the time. The goal is to make trade-offs that balance a higher-fat food with foods that are lower in fat to keep the fat intake at 30% for the day. So if you really want that ice cream, it's OK once in a while - as long as you work in some lower-fat foods, like carrots, that day.<br>  <br>  Not All Fats Are the Same<br>  Although all types of fat have the same amount of calories, some are more harmful to your health than others. Two of the most harmful fats are saturated fat and trans fat. Both of these fats can increase a person's risk of heart disease.<br>  <br>  Saturated fats are listed on food labels. And, by 2006, all food companies must also list trans fat amounts on food labels.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saturated and trans fats are solid at room temperature - like butter, shortening, or the fat on meat. Saturated fat comes mostly from animal products, but some tropical oils, like palm kernel oil and coconut oil, also contain saturated fat. Trans fat is also found in whole dairy and meat products.<br>  <br>  Trans fats are often found in packaged baked goods, like cookies, crackers, or potato chips. They are also in fried foods like french fries and doughnuts. Because saturated fat and trans fat raise blood cholesterol levels, increasing a person's risk of developing heart disease, a gram of one of these fats is worse for a person's health than a gram of unsaturated fat.<br>  <br>  Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats can be polyunsaturated or monounsaturated. Polyunsaturated fat is found in soybean, corn, sesame and sunflower oils, or fish and fish oil. Monounsaturated fat is found in olives, olive oil or canola oil, most nuts and their oils, and avocados.<br>  <br>  Fat and Calories in a Healthy Diet<br>  Fats should be eaten in moderation. The American Heart Association recommends that people get as much of their daily fat intake as possible from unsaturated fats and that they limit saturated fats and trans fats - or at least keep their consumption of these fats to no more than 10% of their daily diet.<br>  <br>  It's a bad idea to try to avoid fat completely, though - especially for teens. A certain amount of fat is necessary for development, especially during puberty when the body grows very quickly.<br>  <br>  Fats are also needed to absorb certain vitamins that are essential for proper growth. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat soluble, meaning they can only be absorbed if there is fat in a person's diet. Also, fat cells act as insulation to keep the body warm and help protect the nerve cells.<br>  <br>  Like fat, you need a certain amount of calories in your diet to fuel your body. In fact, nutritionists do not recommend calorie counting (keeping track of the number of calories in everything that you eat) for teens unless a doctor has specifically recommended it. So if you are concerned about your weight, speak to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Maintaining a healthy weight means choosing foods that are low in fat (such as low-fat dairy products) and high in complex carbohydrates (such as whole-grain cereals and breads). Think about substitutes for foods you eat that are high in sugar, fat, or calories. For example, you may want to drink water or skim milk instead of soft drinks, or choose mustard instead of mayonnaise on your sandwich.<br>  <br>  Being aware of the amount of fat and calories you eat makes sense, as long as you eat a balanced diet. Establishing sensible eating habits, choosing foods wisely, and exercising regularly are the keys to long-term good health.

UKHDlvM5aa	Yoga is awesome for many reasons, but it's not a good calorie burner. You'll only burn 50-100 calories in a 30 minute session, depending on what kind of shape you're in. It is excellent for flexibility, however. After just a month of yoga, I noticed that I could stretch way farther than I used to be able to. Believe it or not, it also helped with my sex life (no joke). The flexibility also decreases the chances of injuring yourself during other activities, since you'll have better balance and an increased range of motion.<br>  <br>  For weight loss, though, you'll need to do some more intense cardio.

4kSKhu4Eaa	try to eat a balance diet get all the fruits veggies meats dairy and grains you're suppose to, try to eat lean meats poultry and fish instead of red meat(for instance i use ground turkey instead of ground beef and turkey bacon instead of pork bacon)or at least get lean beef, avoid fast food[fried], grill or bake foods as much as possible instead of frying, eat whole wheat bread instead of regular<br>  <br>  snacks:<br>  nuts(try to avoid too much salt), airpopped popcorn is great if u dont or at least watch how much salt and butter you put on it, fruits, veggies, dry cereal(corn flakes, shredded wheats, cherrios),oatmeal, yogurt(watch the sugary ones)rice cakes, salads....if you really need to cheat get baked chips instead of regular, oatmeal[raisin] cookies instead of oreos and chocolate chip, or look for 100 calorie packs they have like oreo flavored baked wafer snacks which is a pretty fair size and taste with only 100cals in the whole bag<br>  <br>  drinks:<br>  alot of people get a good bulk of their daily calories from what they drink so avoid sodas, watch sugary fruit drinks and juices, i recommend you drink at least one cup of tea per day(preferably unsweetened). tea has no calorie(if not sweetened) green tea is better known for its aiding weight lost but if you do not like the taste white tea has a milder taste and snapple has tea bags that are infused with natural fruit flavor(still calorie free) which tastes pretty good, and of course water you pretty much cant go wrong with water very healthy<br>  <br>  allow yourself a cheat day every once in a while dont pig out but you can bend your diet a lil(bend not break). your body will eventually adapt to your new eating habits. i'll tell you from experience once i started really getting in shape for kickboxing i stopped eating junk food and fast food and im at the point where not only do i not crave it any more but actually eating it makes me feel sick<br>  <br>  healthy food is expensive becuz its easier to keep artificial and processed foods longer, while healthier foods go bad faster. take trans fat for example worse fat you can eat it has no nutritional value but its used becuz it has a much longer shelf-life(though many people are starting to stop using trans fats). think about what last longer a bag of doritos in the pantry or strawberries in the fridge? what about the urban legend that a twinkie can survive a nuclear blast? junk foods are easier to manufacture and keep therefore costing less<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you reach your goals in a healthy manner|`|Obi53Pg6aa	Eat wholemeal products with unsaturated fatty acids<br>  <br>  A) Calorie intake:<br>  <br>  The body has to burn more calories than its intake. The norm is an intake of about 500 calories a day. Don’t punish your body and starve it for food. Get a bit easy on it. Eat only as much as it wants. Know what is to be eaten and in what quantity. If one has a sweet tooth, they mustn’t quit eating sweets altogether. Instead, they can steadily reduce the intake or go for lesser-calorie alternatives. A good example of this would be sugar-free chocolates.<br>  <br>  A sudden decrease in food intake would only weaken your body and you would not feel energetic while performing your daily chores. The metabolic rate in one’s body also tends to decrease in such a situation, and the body starts to store the extra fat. So you see, you would end up getting fatter than you were! So, one must not lower the calorie intake than the figure of 500. Stick to that and see for yourself how good you would feel from within!<br>  <br>  B) Frequent, but lighter meals: Another elementary basic for a successful weight loss is to have many meals in a day. What this means is, that instead of having 3 heavy meals in a day, one can opt for say, 6 meals, comparatively lighter in terms of fat and calorie content, and equally nutritious. These can be taken at a gap of about 3 hours each. This way, you would end up eating lesser than you used to do, and also, would not feel lost for energy. The body’s metabolic rate would not decrease and hence no excess fat is produced. This is so, as their will be a constant inflow of calories all day long.<br>  <br>  This also helps the digestive process and no food content would be “stuck” inside your body. Most over-weight people have the problem of Constipation. Frequent meals come in very handy in this regard. Also, no bad toxins are inducted into the bloodstream as a result. Another benefit of frequent but lighter meals during weight loss program is that one could refrain themselves from the craving for fatty food.|`|f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	whole grains, vegetables and fruits, and nuts.  small portions of meat are good too, but avoid dairy and eggs.  pretend you have egg/milk/soy allergies to keep yourself from eating the terrible options that pop up daily in everyone's life.  <br>  <br>  Cut back on sugar.<br>  <br>  Never use artificial sweeteners- they cause your body to store many times as much fat as regular sugar, they slow your metabolism, and they cause cravings later in the day.<br>  <br>  exercise a little before and after each mini-meal, it will maximize calorie usage.  Even something as simple as tensing all of your muscles discreetly, or a "bathroom break" where you dance like a madman in the stall will work.<br>  <br>  Sitting with good posture increases metabolism, as well.<br>  <br>  it is better to drink too much water than too little.

As far as painkillers, I guess laudanum (opium) was the drug of choice at the time, so maybe a small dose of that for pain.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	you'd make a split out of flat boards(or what you had) on each side and bind it with strips of cloth. think of what a boyscout would do today in the woods, similar concept|`|eSf4jWm4aa	They would splint it, like we would now for temporary measures. For pain they would be given brandy(but I dont think she can tell the class that)
qVhqc019aa	You are still growing..dont take any pills...it can mess up your hormones and not only that, you are still developing..totally dangerous!

auVg3SbDaa	There are other options (such as an infection), but this is the worse case scenario that YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE:<br>  <br>  Sharp pain in that area may indicate a twisting of the testicle (it's called "testicular torsion"). If the twisting lasts for a long enough time it may cut off the blood supply to the testicle and then the testicle dies in under a day (sometimes in under 6 hours). <br>  <br>  Go to the ER now! <br>  <br>  They can do an ultrasound that will tell if the blood flow is still intact. If it is, it may indicate that the testicle twisted and then untwisted itself (causing sharp pain then no pain). <br>  <br>  Sometimes a surgeon may do an operation to anchor the testicle to the base of the scrotum so it does not twist and cause you pain again.<br>  This will help prevent this in the future and will also ensure that you do not become impotent (which can happen if torsion goes untreated in both testicles).<br>  <br>  This is considered a medical emergency. Please go to the ER now!|`|NToiXYjFaa	crabs.|`|I1knk17zaa	Definitely need to see your doctor.

tluT02tvaa	honestly it is very hard to even lose 1 pound a week.Much less than 5 a week like you are trying to.You would have to work out close to 5 hours a day,vigorously.A better option for you,since we are both the same weight almost.Would be to find out how many calories you burn each day,and than take away about 500 calories (very easy,no more soda,chips,candies,sweets,sport drinks).And start to work out some more each day,like taking a long walk,or just run in place in your own room.Get your heart racing! and you will lose all the excess weight.I have already lost 2 inches of my waist since i started.Good luck!|`|P6trt7u4aa	try doing the elliptical in front of the TV, you dont really notice you are exercising when something interesting is on TV|`|OAAnIeFraa	The formula for losing those extra pounds is easy - eat less and workout more - the issues surface when we actually try to put that into practice!

T3JmWOZHaa	Just because your heart jumped up when you got on a treadmill and walked doesn't mean jack, any ones will. However I think that a 24 hour halter monitor would do you some good. All you have to do is wear the monitor and write down what you are doing and every time your heart feels funny you just push a button and it records what your heart is doing. I just think that is awfully slow for someone in your shape and age.|`|JaOetMxGaa	your heart rate should not be that low unless your a marathon runner. walking for thirty minutes a day is not going to give you that kind of heart rate. your rate went up on the treadmill, i mean were they expecting it to go down? personally i would get a new doctor.

6yoCcGBWaa	Mel's advice is exactly correct.|`|Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi brandy,<br>  <br>  Your dog should not be given preventative medicines if he has tested positive to heart worms. He should be getting injection twice a day for one month.<br>  <br>  This  kills some of the worms straight away while others will die after a month.<br>  <br>  During this time as they decompose they are carried to the lungs where they group together in blood vessels and are reabsorbed into the dog's body.<br>  <br>  It is essential that he is not exercises during this period and complete rest is required  to allow his body to absorb them,otherwise the worms will be dislodged from the the blood vessels where they have lodged and get carried to the lungs and cause death.<br>  <br>  He should be watched carefully for 7 - 8 weeks after treatment to see that he is not coughing up blood, and that he is not going off of his food. If this happens get him back to the vet because he will need cage rest and an intravenous infusion.<br>  <br>  As long as all these steps are followed he should make a full recovery.<br>  <br>  I wish him well.Please one plea from me.....if you are in a position where you are unable to cope with the vet fees for his treatment, please please allow the little darling to be put to sleep rather than allow him to suffer a long and distressful death....!!! He will not get better without treatment.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X

xmibEEdcaa	It's fine to take the antibiotic and the pain killer together.<br>  <br>  Sometimes vicodin can take a while to kick in, especially if you've never used it before. For most people I know it takes about a half an hour, but for me, it can sometimes take up to an hour before I can really fully feel the effects. <br>  <br>  Keeping an ice pack on your jaw, if you aren't already doing that, can help numb the pain a bit while you're waiting for the hydrocodone to kick in.<br>  <br>  For the next few days, as you're healing up, you might want to keep in mind that the vicodin can sometimes take a long time to work, so it's a good idea to take it the instant you first notice pain coming on.  I know the instinct can be to wait until it gets "really bad" before taking one, but it will work better if you take it before things get really bad. Don't worry - you won't get addicted over the two or three days it takes to recover from oral surgery. :)<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon!|`|B4YESGmwaa	Yes the dentist probably should have told you to take them together or as prescribed. As far as the Vicoden it usually takes between 15-30 min. Usually once you take the second dosage (at the correct time from the first) you will start to build up a level in your system and it will start working better. Feel better.

e3b4913f44cd6f4d8fa6eb99cb4520caaa	To be diagnosed with diabetes you need to have two fasting blood sugars over 100. You eat nothing after midnight and go to the doctors office in the morning and get a finger stick two times. 100-125 is pre-diabetes and requires further testing. Over 125 is diabetes. It is pretty simple. To answer your question directly, early signs of diabetes could be frequent nighttime urination, unusually clear large volumes of urine, sweet smelling urine, dehydration, drymouth, fatigue, weight loss followed by weight gain. Why guess....get tested. If you fast overnight and your finger stick is in the 125 plus range, you are probably positve. I thought I might be diabetic and had the blood test which turned out to be negative. I have a strong family history of diabetes and was worried as are you. The good thing about an early diagnosis of prediabetes is that diet and exercise and some weight loss can sometimes get rid of it. good luck|`|7oYpbSjIaa	only sometimes?  type 1 diabetes doesn't come and go.  if you had "most if not all the symptoms" of type 1, you would be really really sick. you would be skeletal, suffering from hellish unquenchable thirst and yet unable to get off the toilet from peeing so much.  you'd also feel incredibly fatigued and achy.  you'd feel like you were dying. type 1 is hardly inconspicuous,<br>  <br>  if you're worried about type 2 on the other hand, take charge and work on getting at and maintaining a healthy weight and diet.  talk to a dietitian about what you can do.|`|x1gtaqwVaa	the main cause for type one diabetes is the pancreas either fails to produce natural insulin for the body or it produces very little... which is why when a diabetic eats and doesn't have insulin... the blood sugar raises because there is no insulin to cover the intake of carbohydrates. (therefore we must inject it through insulin shots)  a normal person's body produces insulin naturally when food is ingested.<br>  <br>  <br>  i was 14 when i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.<br>  <br>  the most common symptoms that i encountered were<br>  -EXTREME weight loss. i was 67 lbs!<br>  -frequent urination; i was peeing 20 times a day and had to get up in the middle of the night just to relieve myself.<br>  -i was ALWAYS thirsty for water. i even had to take a cup with me in the car.<br>  -I was extremely hungry ALL the time and had a LARGE appetite.<br>  -i was also really really tired, to the point where i couldn't get out of bed; fatigue.<br>  <br>  once i found out i had it, and began taking insulin shots, i gained 6 lbs in 2 days and 20 lbs in 2 weeks!<br>  <br>  i would recommend anyone who has any of these symptoms to go see your doctor asap....or you'll slowly whither away. its a very serious thing if its not treated. hope this helped :]|`|592bf650f6628a032c176b936ea5cb9baa	HI< <br>  1st of all i hope u don't hv  diabet<br>  hv a look on this site it will help you 2 got all what u want and try to do the test with your GP<br>  <a href="http://www.diabetes.org.au/d_info.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetes.org.au/d_info.htm</a>|`|UI4dpdgnaa	symptoms:frequent urination dizziness extreme thirst urine seems sticky vomiting, diabetes can be present with no symptoms if your worried get a blood test if your sugar is above 200 you probably have it|`|NRQXmIcwaa	check your blood sugar.

AA11765949	He's using both of you, have some respect for yourself, give him the flick and find a real man.|`|x3EPqezJaa	The only harm you are doing is to yourself--the continued relationship with him keeps you in limbo, hoping he'll come back to you. But would you want him? NO! That would not be healthy for YOU. He's treating you badly, and instead of you focusing on finding a guy who will treat  you right, you are thinking of his needs. Frankly, he's also treating his current girlfriend badly, by carrying on an "emotional affair" with you. You need to grow a backbone where your wishbone is, and stop being his emotional toilet to whom he can release his waste to every once in awhile, before he goes back to his normal life. People don't change except if they really really want to change, and if they work hard at it. Tell him you really want him to get over his panic attacks, but you doing this for him is not helping either of you. Talking to you keeps him in his comfort zone and gives him enough security to continue with his dysfunctional life.

d3WiJVk6aa	My daughter has eczema, and it can be a constant struggle.  As far as I'm able to find, they don't really know what causes eczema, much less how to cure it.  The best most doctors have been able to do is prescribe steroid creams, which as you probably know, is only a temporary fix that addresses the symptoms but not the cause.<br>  <br>  I have been reading a lot about coconut oil helping eczema, but I would suggest you google "coconut oil eczema" to read about it yourself and find out if it applies to you.<br>  <br>  Some of my own research has lead me to believe that eczema can be a sign of allergies, either from food you eat or other things you come in contact with daily.  If you haven't already (and you'll need to talk to your parents, I'm sure) get blood testing done to rule out food allergies or other common allergies.  If it turns out that you're not allergic to anything at least you'll be able to rule it out and look for other resources.<br>  <br>  You may be interested in reading "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Allergies and Asthma" (I'll try to find a link and post it).  It has some theories about the root causes of eczema and what to do to address them.  <br>  <br>  Remember, because you're under age, have your parents' help when you're deciding on any treatment or action involving your health.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I know it's frustrating, I hope you're able to find the help you're looking for.<br>  <br>  EDIT>>> I had the title of the book wrong, it's fixed now!|`|Mw0eSZdTaa	I've had badass eczema for many years. It sucks. Tell people your mother was a lizard. Learn to just make a joke out of it, and then if they keep pressing you can tell them the real reason.<br>  <br>  Cure-wise, start wearing cotton clothes only. Stay ultra moisturised at all times (try vaseline/ petroleum jelly) and instead of using soap try things like emulsifying creams or some new-agey exfoliants. Bug your parents to take you to a dermatologist, [s]he can give you ointments or topical steroids like protopic or hydrocortizone which are a big help. I've given up eating meat and meat products, which has helped my eczema a heck of a lot and i know someone who gave up all dairy and switched to soy only which cured her eczema completely. Give it a try for a few months if you're serious about it.<br>  <br>  Btw, if you're having trouble sleeping try taking anti- histamines before bedtime, you can buy them over the counter, but make sure your parents know you're taking them.|`|w6b0lL6Paa	Yes.  I'm 13 years old and I had it too, only on my arms though.  Don't worry about it.  My eczema pretty much disappeared after I bought and applied a cream from a company called fougera.  The cream is called Hydrocortisone Cream USP, 2.5%.  But don't put too much on!  There are some strong stuff in there (including steroid!), and it's not good for you if you just put a whole glob on!

It's a virus, so once you are infected you will always have it.  What will happen is that your immune system will supress the virus, so it doesn't cause a wart to form.  When that happens, the warts go away.  However sometimes it takes a while for that to happen, and the warts can hang around.  Folks don't tend to like the look, so they have the doctor treat them with a topical medication to remove the external wart.  In many cases there is only the one outbreak, but they can always return later on.  Unfortunately, you will need to go to a clinic to have an exam and have the spots cultured to determine if they are actually the result of an HPV infection.  You also need a pap smear and culture to ensure you do not also have one of the versions that cause cervical warts and lead to changes which are linked to cervical cancer.  There really isn't anything you can do to improve your immune function, although a decent diet and lifestyle can help there just aren't any things you can do otherwise.  Stress can certainly contribute to outbreaks, and relieving stress can help the immune system concentrate on supressing the virus.  But it will not make it go away in the sense that you are cured.  You will always harbor the virus, always be at risk for having a wart or warts show up, and you can also share the virus with other sexual partners.  Unless you are in a committed relationship, you really do need to insist your partner use a condom.  For now, you need to locate a clinic and be tested and checked out.  While you are there, the doctor can treat the warts to remove them if that's what they are.  Meantime, it's best if you avoid unprotected sex.|`|N5f9wJEJaa	It is important to know that even though the treatment for genital warts was successful in terms of removing the symptoms, the warts may recur because there is not cure for the root of the problem, which is HPV. HPV can lie dormant in your system for a long time and this can result in another outbreak of genital warts anytime. The good news here is that even if genital warts recur, they do so in varying persistence. This means that some people will experience several recurrence episodes, while some will only have a few. It seems that our immune system gains some control of the HPV, thus decreasing the chance of genital warts resurfacing. In fact, in most cases, the chances of recurrence happening is completely eliminated within two years.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	There is no cure that will get rid of the HPV virus completely. But treatments can reduce the number of warts — or help them go away faster. When the warts disappear, the HPV virus is still there, though it may not spread as easily. If you are having sex, think you may have genital warts, or if you have had a partner who may have genital warts, you need to see your doctor or gynecologist. If the warts are not obviously visible, doctors can detect the presence of HPV in girls through a Pap smear. <br>  <br>  Your doctor will do an examination, make a diagnosis, and then provide treatment, if necessary. There are a number of different treatments. Depending on where the warts are located, how big they are, and how many there are, your doctor can treat them in several ways. Some genital warts can be treated by putting special medications on them. If warts are large, the doctor may carefully "freeze" them off by using a chemical or laser treatment to remove them. People with a strong and healthy immune system will often keep the virus dormant or inactive.

If there's ever pain, switch to the crutches. Try to give it as much rest as possible.

Some causes are easily treated, some require antibiotics, and some cannot be treated at all -- you just have to wait out the cause, although over-the-counter medicines can help relieve the pain.<br>  <br>  Sore Throat Due to Dry Air<br>  This is actually quite common -- I get them a lot myself in the winter, especially in cold weather when I forget to fill up the humidifier tanks with water. If the air is dry, your throat can dry out a bit with your breathing and become sore. Solution: drink plenty of fluids and make sure your house is humidified properly. (I have noticed that furnace humidifiers do not do a very good job of keeping the house properly humid. Even with a furnace humidifier you may still need table-top humidifers to stay comfortable.)<br>  <br>  Sore Throat Due to Coughs, Colds, and Runny Noses<br>  <br>  Coughing by itself can make your throat feel sore. So can postnasal drip -- mucus from the nose dripping down the back of the throat.<br>  <br>  If you have a dry cough, cough suppressants -- some of which you can buy without a prescription -- can quieten the cough and cut down on throat irritation. If you are coughing because of postnasal drip, I believe you should not use cough suppressants -- I have seen people get pneumonia that way, since if the suppressants work you may not be able to clear your lungs properly. Sometimes decongestants can help reduce the postnasal drip and thus reduce the cough, but with viral colds decongestants may not do very much. Humidity and drinking fluids will help, since they will keep the mucus from getting thick -- thick mucus is much harder to cough out than thin mucus.<br>  <br>  Sore Throat Due to Viruses<br>  There are several viruses that attack the mucus membranes of the throat, the tonsils, or both. These viruses will often make your throat feel sore. Some of these viruses, like the adenoviruses, will also cause pus to accumulate on the tonsils just like strep does, and we need to test to see whether strep is the problem. Since there are no antibiotics for viruses, we still need to wait until the body gets rid of the virus itself, although humidity and fluids will soothe the throat and Tylenol will help with the pain.<br>  Sore Throat Due to Streptococcus<br>  (and Scarlet Fever, too...)<br>  <br>  Although there are other bacteria that can attack the throat, the most common bacterial cause of strep throat is Streptococcus pyogenes, or "group A strep". (As with other bacteria, there are several different kinds of strep, which are similar overall but differ in some biochemical details -- and, because of those details, in the way they infect people. S. pyogenes, or group A, is the kind that usually infects throats and causes scarlet fever.)<br>  <br>  The classic strep throat is very red (the description in some textbooks is "beefy red" or the colour of raw beef). Often you will see white or green "exudates" or pus on the tonsils, which are also swollen. You may also see little dark-red, almost purple, spots on the back of the roof of the mouth and on the uvula (the little "punching bag" that hangs from the center of the back of the mouth). The tongue may be very red with little white spots, like a strawberry (the "strawberry tongue") or white with little red spots, like a strawberry dipped in white chocolate. Sometimes a person with strep throat will have very bad breath, but this is not always true.<br>  <br>  Usually a person with strep throat will have swollen and tender lymph nodes at the front sides of the neck, and the throat will hurt so much that even swallowing liquids is painful. Coughing is rare with strep throat, unlike viral or dryness-related soreness. Temperature may go up to 103 or more.<br>  <br>  There are other things that can happen with strep throat. Scarlet fever is the best-known: this is a combination of strep throat with a rash, usually on the lower abdomen and spreading from there to the trunk, that consists of fine red bumps with a sandpaper-like consistency. The more important complications of strep throat, which usually do not happen unless the infection is left untreated for a long time, include<br>  <br>  Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease<br>      Rheumatic fever is an inflammation of connective tissues which occurs sometime after an untreated group A strep throat. It can affect joints (hence the term "rheumatic") and one of its hallmarks is swelling and pain of large joints (shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, for example), but the biggest problem with rheumatic fever is in inflammation of the heart valves, which can ultimately lead to heart failure. <br>  Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis<br>      This is inflammation of the glomeruli (the blood filters of the kidney), again occuring after a strep infection. Often the first symptom is red or cola-coloured urine, since damage to the filter causes red blood cells, either intact or dama|`|aPMEiScnaa	A virus.  there is nothing you can do other than to let it run its course.

q1GpAqZnaa	Hey, you need to understand, no one is out to get you. Though, this world may make it seem like that, it is the truth. People may seem like they are jerks, but they never intend for anyone to get hurt. Sometimes, i do get a little angry and i will take it out on myself, it is like a stimulate. But that is not a regular thing for me. You need to learn how to control this impulse of torturing. It is mind over body, and your body is winning, you need to think before doing, though, your mind may trick you, go with what you know. Hitting yourself will not solve anything, maybe punching or throwing a nice pillow, or even just cussing out loud. You can not blame yourself, and put yourself in a position against yourself. You must learn how to accept things as they are. I quote i read once said, If you do not like something change it, if you can not change it, then change your attitude. In this case your attitude should be a habit of trying to remain as calm as possible. Only in certain times, should your body be above your mind, it should not be day to day. Just as you had said, if you are scared of hurting others and yourself, you know the problem, you must be mind over matter, think of this question before it happens. <br>  hopefully this all helps, let me know in additional details if it helps at all.|`|86VgnUmQaa	Your are freaking yourself out!

5jf5tcMnaa	What the dentist did was called a Pulpectomy, he removed the pulp from the tooth. He did not do a root canal and should not have charged you for a RCT 1 canal. <br>  A pulpectomy is about the first third of a root canal. After the root canal has been accessed, the nerve and blood vessels are removed. Then the canal is shaped like an inverted ice cream cone and it is thouroughly debrided or <br>  cleaned out. Lastly the root canal is plugged <br>  and sealed up with rubbery-waxy orange cones called gutta percha. That is the root canal. After that the hole into the tooth is closed up.<br>  It is NOT a Pulpotomy...a pulpotomy is done on a baby or primary tooth.  Simply removing the tissue in the pulp chamber of an adult tooth and not removing the tissue further down the root will result in problems.<br>  Your tooth is starting to hurt because the root canal needs to be finsihed, the hollow tube needs to be plugged and sealed so that bacteria can't use it as a space to grow into an infection or an abscess.<br>  An antibiotic dose at this point would be a good idea.  It will remove the discomfort again temporarily, but ultimately the root canal needs to be finished sooner than later.<br>  <br>  Update:To the idiot who gave me a thumbs down...please tell me why??|`|0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	It sounds like what he did was what is called a pulpotomy.   You will return for a second visit when they will then remove the nerves from the canals. It could have infection in the tooth and you would need antibiotics. I assume since it's been a couple weeks, you likely have an appointment soon? If not, call the office in the morning and explain to them that you are in pain and would like to get in immediately if possible.  Try some extra strength pain reliever in the mean time. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  From dentalid.com: <br>  <br>  In pulpotomy all of the coronal pulp tissue is removed from the crown (visible portion of the tooth above the gums) but the pulp tissue in the root canals remain. This is different that pulpectomy in which all of the pulp is removed from both the root canals and crown.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope it feels better!|`|U4cYbkNQaa	A root canal goes all the way down the root for cleaning, then it is crowned to make it a permanent structure so food and bacteria cant seep into the tooth. Just because your tooth felt better with the first cleaning and the removal of the nerve doesn't mean that the tooth is healed from the source of the decay. You have to have the tooth fixed by a root canal and crown.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	could be infection under it.. might want to get that checked out|`|dDPFWyPjaa	Talk to your regular dentist about it.

Bipolar usually means you have episodes of mania where you have seemingly unlimited energy and creativity.  Then that is followed by the oncoming of the depression.  It's like highs and lows.  Medication usually tries to balance those out.<br>  <br>  One can be considered bipolar without having episodes of mania, however, and just be more on the depressed side all the time.  Many times it is genetic.  <br>  <br>  Lots of bipolar patients are very creative, artistic and extremely intelligent.  The depression they experience is all the more frustrating for them because they are unable to accomplish things they want to do.  This is also a reason that many patients will take a break from their medications.<br>  <br>  Severe depression can give you mood swings as well and cause someone to act out.  Hormonal changes can also do it.  It might not necessarily be bipolar disorder.  Sounds like she is also under a great deal of stress and the condition of the economy is certainly making that worse for her.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It is the bipolar that is the problem - you need to give her a break. Bipolar is a very severe mental problem to get, and is very painful.  Hopefully within a few weeks to months, she will find meds that help her & can get her kids back again. The bipolar is more severe because of the sexual abuse, so she probably has a severe case of it.  She is still a really nice person, this is mental illness, and her bad behaviors don't mean anything, except she has severe symptoms right now.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go to the library & get a couple books on bipolar & read them. There should be one specifically for family & friends of folks with bipolar.<br>  <br>  When i have depression or mixed moods, I think everyone hates me, so it is difficult to avoid taking things the wrong way.  If this has started only since she started new meds, perhaps she is having a reaction to the meds. Ativan and other benzos can cause paradoxical aggression (well known side effect) and antidepressants can cause anger in some people. I've had problems with some other meds, too.  I had an evil temper for like 10 years & the docs all said it was the bipolar, but it turned out 95% of those episodes, it was the ativan. <br>  <br>  You probably need to give your friend time & read up on bipolar. And try not to take it personally if she snaps at you. She will get better eventually.  She might be getting counseling for the sex abuse now, too, and that stirs up stuff & for awhile, you can get worse.<br>  <br>  PS the cause of bipolar is not known. It is a genetic disorder that is brought on by stress, usually.  There is a defect in the way chemicals are processed in the brain, and also other things that are not understood hardly at all.  Some of the gray matter in the front of the brain (where emotions are processed) is dying, autopsies show. Bipolar disorder causes uncontrollable, severe mood swings.  IN most people, the moods last weeks to months.|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	Bipolar disorder, once known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that creates severe mood swings ranging from mania (overly up and/or irritable) to depression (overly down, lethargic and hopeless). Episodes vary in length and can be moderate to extreme. <br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose, and many people suffer for years as their symptoms are explained away or mistaken for other disorders. for more information and treatment maybe you can try this <a href="http://setmind.info" rel="nofollow">http://setmind.info</a>|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	it is a chemical imbalance in the brain. My cousin has this. As long as she is on her meds she is fine.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	oh.. i didnt see where you asked what bipolar is.. but its a disease that makes you not know what you're doing one moment.. kinda like multiple personalities.. except you don't think you're a different person, you're just either really sad, happy or mad.. sometimes it makes you really creative and/or not wanna do things you planned on doing the night before or forget things.. like you'll do something and regret it... kinda like being drunk <br>  <br>  trauma, genetics, chemical imbalance in the brain causes bipolar disease.. <br>  <br>  can take medicine for it..and when you dont take it your bipolarness is worse than before..|`|9hpuBMuIaa	It is a chemical imbalance in the brain that effects both sides( hemispheres) of the brain.  There is nothing that can cure it, but there are various medicines that can help control it. It usually takes awhile before the correct dosages can be discovered, but once they are then the person can lead a fairly normal life. That is, as long as the medicine is taken on a regular basis.  Unfortunately there can be some side effects that make the person feel funny, sleepy, feel like they are sleepwalking or similar things that aren't very pleasant and so the person will stop taking them which makes the symptoms come back. Some people are lucky and have no side effects so it is easy to stay on their meds.<br>    Yes it can make a person change a lot.  They will go from happy to sad, to angry and just can't function like a "normal" person would. Most people can't understand why the bipolar person acts like they do, but they can't help it, and can't change it without therapy and medecine. Just telling them to shape up won't work, they don't like it any better than family and friends do but hopefully new meds will be developed that will help even more than the ones on the market now.
e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Are they literally bumps or like red circular marks? Just type razor burn in yahoo images, and see if that's how it looks. It hurts really bad, and is really sensitive for a day or two. But if they are actual bumps, then it may be something else..
z6mbVz8maa	I think the dermabrasion procedure will work, you may have to repeat it. It cost about $100 per procedure. I know of some natural things but for this you would have to read this book, I simply don't remember: <br>  God's Medicine Is Best by Linda Wise.<br>  <br>  And I am not being paid for this, but I can believe that some people might be paid...<br>  Good Luck.<br>  Andrew|`|7X28owjxaa	The first answerer is right. But I know there are facial spas that offer micro dermabrasion and chemical peels. I think the micro derma is around $75-$100. But beware, you'll have pinkish redish skin for a few days.|`|i3FX0uClaa	Sista, ignore the solicitation of advertisements (those ppl get PAID to do that stuff). Logic tells you no cream can FILL in holes. Go see a dermatologist, or, the advice on microdermabrasion/chem. peel is probably your best bet, but $$$. Still... better than dishing out hundreds for creams that just don't REALLY work!|`|y42LEQL3aa	They're called acne scars or pop marks. Unfortunately they are not easy to get rid of. You'll probably have to see a dermatologist and have an expensive procedure like microderm abrasion or a chemical peel.
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Oh, that's hard. Do you have an aunt or an older friend that you could talk to? Or even your dad. I know that sounds like a HORRIBLE idea, and you'll feel awkward, but he'll be there for you if you need him.<br>  <br>  Your period shouldn't last more than a week, most likely, so I hope it's over by then. You could try the "teen" tampons if you're feeling up to it, but if you aren't, wear some shorts over your bathing suit and just swim. You'll stop bleeding in the water, and a pad will just soak the water up and be useless. It's like soaking a cotton ball in water.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Oh sweety you ok, well if you are bleeding from down there you probably on your period. Pads are fine but no you can't wear them to swim you neeed tampons.And your period usually last from 5 to 7 days it really depends on the person.Make sure you write down when you start and when you stop.This will help you keep track of when your next period will be usually between every 28 to 30 days.Look on the internet and try to find as much information on menustration as you can ok,but you really need a female relation to help you out ok sweety and answer your personal questions on this have a close girlfriend you can talk too.|`|AA10363258	Sorry to hear about your mom. If you want to swim, wear tampons, you can't wait pads swimming. I don't know how soon your trip is, but chances are your period won't last that long, up until the first 2 years your period can be really irregular, so there is no telling how long it will last or how often it will come. Hope this helps!|`|3goRDv0gaa	Google it.:)|`|j6kyAhQOaa	Ok so first off, congratulations on getting your period! Welcome to the club :)<br>  <br>  No, down to business. You absolutely cannot wear pads when swimming. Everything that they are there to absorb will leak out all over the place!! Yikes!<br>  <br>  For swimming, I would buy some tampons and learn how to use them. Pad are generally ok, but if you can use tampons, you can wear them when you're swimming. You'll also find they're more comfortable for certain things like running and sports. They're tricky to put in at first. Get some that have applicators to start with, like tampax Pearl. It will probably take you a few shots to get one in, don't worry about that, it takes practice!<br>  <br>  <br>  Periods typically last 4 - 7 days, and occur every 28 days, but especially when they first start, they can be all over the map! Don't count on it being regular to start with, and don't worry if it decides to go away for a couple of months before starting back up again. <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions at all, please ask :)|`|d3n5Wchvaa	im 12 too lol :)  u cant wear a pad while swimming, then the pad like wont work and youll bleed everywhere and sharkies will eat you...  haha sorry im retarded...  ok so, um if you have a sister talk to her about it, and go to google and look up how to do a tampon but you might be a little early for that. so um ur stomachs gonna hurt real bad, take aspirin, and heating pads on your stomach (u know those electric things) and yeah.  good luck on whatever =)|`|vBLb6JiVaa	no you cant swim while wearing pads.<br>  but you probably wont have your period then depending on when your going.<br>  <br>  a period usually last 4 to 6 days|`|IqK0wcTLaa	Wow thats really tough to go through. Try to find an aunt, a friend whos gone through this, an older sister, your dad, even a guidance counseler, FInd some one you trust and talk to them about it. Well it usually lasts about a week and then you get it every month. If you go into a pool with just a pad on then you'll get blood everwhere and you'll see the pad. You could try a tampon but I heard they hurt (I've never tried them). You should wait until your older probably but you could try it and see if your comfortable. You should get medicine for back pains, cramps, headaches, etc. Try midol, pamprin, or Aleve. You should use a regular pad not a deodorized one because it can cause iritation. You should change your pad every 2-3 hours. Well there is so much more to say but we'd be here forever! lol well I reccomend buying/renting and reading books on this kinda stuff like The Care And Keeping Of You by American Girl or The Body Book by Zonderkidz. Good luck!|`|6juV48RWaa	periods only last about a week and happen once a month. but since you're new to periods, it will be irregular for awhile so you can't predict when it will come up again. when you go swimming, use tampons. it might hurt when using a tampon for the first time, but keep practicing putting them in and you'll be a pro for florida :)
KkZE2NDYaa	I think it is normal human nature to feel anxiety about the possibility of bad things happening even if you have no control over related events. However, needless worry is a form of stress and can't be good for you. That is why people have developed relaxation techniques and meditation or other calming rituals that help focus energies in a more productive way. Or just staying busy with a task to keep your mind from obsessing about pointless thoughts.|`|ParFJxnSaa	No. Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi ying Yang,<br>  <br>  Blood pressure in your arteries is either high, normal or low.<br>  <br>  Do you know what the reading is?

This is why so many people die prematurely from heart disease.<br>  <br>  Blood pressure is the force which the blood creates against the walls of the arteries by the pumping action of the heart. It is measured in units of millimeters of mercury - mm/Hg<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure is too low it can cause problems because insufficient blood reaches the parts of the body that are furthest from your heart. You can get symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, blurred vision and nausea. <br>  <br>  Low blood pressure is also known as 'hypotension' which is the opposite of the more familiar term 'hypertension' - when blood pressure is too high.<br>  <br>  Hypotension is usually defined as a blood pressure reading of less than 90/60 millimeters of mercury.<br>  <br>  Extremely low blood pressure can be very serious, and can, in very rare cases, cause the body to go into shock and become a life threatening condition. <br>  <br>  Take care, and look after yourself.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  <br>  Malcolm.|`|AA12266052	Low blood pressure, or hypotension, occurs when blood pressure during and after each heart beat is much lower than usual.

All I could find..........read the Url.<br>  <br>  What are the signs and symptoms of tonsillitis?<br>  <br>  Pain in the throat (sometimes severe) that may last more than 48 hours and be associated with difficulty in swallowing. The pain may spread to the ears.<br>  <br>  The throat is reddened, the tonsils are swollen and may be coated or have white spots on them.<br>  <br>  Possibly a high temperature.<br>  <br>  Swollen lymph glands under the jaw and in the neck.<br>  <br>  Headache.<br>  <br>  Loss of voice or changes in the voice. <br>  <br>  If the sore throat is due to a viral infection the symptoms are usually milder and often related to the common cold. If due to Coxsackie virus infection, small blisters develop on the tonsils and roof of the mouth. The blisters erupt in a few days and are followed by a scab, which may be very painful.<br>  <br>  If the sore throat is due to a streptococcal infection, the tonsils often swell and become coated and the throat is sore. The patient has a temperature, foul-smelling breath and may feel quite ill.<br>  <br>  These different appearances are however very variable, and it is impossible to tell by looking at someone's throat whether the infection is due to a virus (which cannot be helped by antibiotics) or a bacterial infection (which might be helped by antibiotics).|`|fqjcjorAaa	It sounds like strep throat and I'm very surprised that that's not what you have.

This is only Monday, give it time to work.|`|xGr2QYWDaa	I think you may have tonsil stones.

Use ibuprofen to bring the swelling down, and keep taking your antibiotics for the whole 10 days.

I believe he did the chemo (sp) for about 6 months after he was diagnosed but since then has had no treatments. He feels fine last I heard.|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	There is no way to say. Lung cancer can be very aggressive; it is usually pretty far advanced when it is diagnosed. Treatment options and prognosis vary depending on how far advanced it is when diagnosed. I know a few patients (very few) who've been lucky enough to have it surgically removed, and survive for years. Refusing treatment? That's another story and again it all depends on what stage it is and whether or not it has spread anywhere else. It can also depend on if he has any other diseases that can complicate things. Look at Dana Reeves...she died within 7 months of diagnosis. Peter Jennings....four months from announcement to death with aggressive treatment. My best friends mom died last month, just one month after diagnosis and no treatment. She, like Dana Reeves, never smoked. It just depends. I'm sorry for you and your friend. He will definitely need your love and support in the weeks and months ahead! Best wishes!|`|zMD0VeOmaa	there is no definitive time-line especially since you don't know what stage cancer he has. once cancer reaches the later stages and metastasizes(spreads) to other parts of the body many people will live a year or less. However, the prognosis(predicted outcome) is much better for cancer that is caught in the early stages.<br>  <br>   In the early stages, lung cancer can be cured by radiation and/or chemotherapy. It may even be possible to surgically remove any carcinoma. You should encourage your friend to fight the cancer if there is any chance for a cure. To do otherwise would be foolish even given his family history.<br>  <br>  good luck but I think you need more information.|`|5boLbxzdaa	That all depends on what stage he's in now.  I'm so sorry to hear about your friend Flor.  That's never news that's easy to take.  Honestly depending on the stage he could live 6 months or he could live 5 years.  And it also depends on the type of cancer that's in his lungs.  Lots of variables.

I know first hand its not something easy to take into our minds.  I can't say how long your friend would have with, or even without treatments for that matter.  From personal experience tho, I can tell you that my oncologist told me I would have 2-4 months to live without treatment, perhaps a year with chemo ( I am inoperable).  My dx, was on May 15, 2006... so you see, I have outlived my prognosis that he dr's made.  Its really such a wide range of survival, depending on the person.. even just changing life style to a certain extent may help him survive longer.  If he ever needs someone to talk to about this.. please feel free to give him my email addy.  Sometimes it helps to talk with someone who is in the 'same boat'.|`|BI6iR0wjaa	my mom was diagnosed with lungcancer and she died 6 months later. my mom's best friend was diagnosed 2 years earlier and died when my mom died.

She lost her husband and her best friend on the very same day!!!<br>  <br>  It depends if it's small celled cancer or large celled cancer.

Yes all the doctors are able to do is draw upon their limited experience with his particular cancer, in that particular stage. Perhaps he'll live to bury all those doctors, it has happened countless times. <br>  There's just no way to predict how that individual, unique body, containing a unique DNA and a unique immune system, will fight the cancer. What others wouldn't be able to overcome, perhaps he is that person that will. I have heard it now too many times not to seriously believe it...people told they have so and so to live that are still alive or have lived much longer than predicted. <br>  Wanna predict how much he's gonna live with lung cancer..get a crystal ball. This is not BS, I am speaking from close proximity with cancer and its many victims.<br>  <br>  There's nothing more powerful and upright than a man's faight in God, than God's mercy and than the man's ultimate, sheer will to live. If he thinks positively and wants to live, encourage him and believe with him and pray for him. Do not think that you can guess any timeline. Please.
juhim6Bhaa	You could try the elimination diet. When I cut gluten and amines out of my diet, I stopped having asthma attacks as much. Also, you may grow out of it somewhat. However, there's plenty of things you can still do as an asthmatic. The next time you see your doctor you need to just say, flat out, "I really want to get my asthma under really really good control. I want to be ****** after I graduate and I need to be able to breath to do it"

I38WF5aFaa	You need to learn how to cook inexpensively.  Some healthy inexpensive foods are beans.  Buy dried beans and learn how to cook them.  Rice is cheap.  Regular pasta and the cheap sauce in a can doesn't cost much.  Hot cereals like oatmeal are the lowest cost breakfast you can eat.  Don't forget fruits and veggies to make a balanced diet.  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Meat will leave you feeling full longer than a vegetarian diet but it usually cost more.  The least expensive way to buy meats is whole chickens when they are on sale.  A typical sale price is about $1 per pound.  By making use of leftovers a roast chicken can provide a base for meals for about a week.  Don't forget to make soup; from the carcass.<br>  <br>  Consider a part time job in a restaurant.  Many will include a meal with each shift and you will have more money to buy food.|`|dKq7DZkbaa	I don't know if you can fit it in your budget, but whenever I drink a cup of coffee I am not hungry for hours, especially if I drink a ton of water afterwards, but it causes frequent urination!<br>  <br>  And you can eat like hotdogs, lunchmeat, raviolis, hamburger helper, oatmeal, and a few other cheap foods.

This can be done 3-4 times daily for up to 20-minutes at a time. <br>  <br>  Also, tea tree oil works well too.<br>  <br>  Make sure to WASH YOUR HANDS, boils can spread very easily.

XsDMokYKaa	the real question that comes to mind is what were you doing that allowed you to make this discovery?|`|jvOixxxyaa	First of all, don't panic! Everything will be okay. I don't know what it is. You'll probably have to go to a doc. to find out. You should get a Gyn. especially if you are sexually active. It's probably nothing. If it makes you feel better the first time I had a yeast infection (i was 15, I'm 20 now) I freaked out thinking I had some horrible disease. Finally I told my mom I had to see a Gyn. It was really embarassing to tell my mom, but the appt. wasn't bad at all.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	k, don't panic about the first comment written, in fact ignore it. you don't need to go see your family doctor - when you book an appointment ask for a female doctor (you have the right to choose)... then you won't feel as uncomfortable about talking about it.<br>  <br>  and i suggest you not take any medical advice from on here - as there will be only guesses..|`|nR5ZJQRiaa	If you shave you'll get alot of little bumps, so it could just be one of those that are bigger.

If not, then perhaps it is just swollen for some reason.  Either way, keep an eye on it for a week or so, and if it gets bigger or does not look like it is resolving, tell your mom, and have her schedule an appointment with a gynecologist.|`|adbe30c4db31f92dd2b1cdced05c307baa	I have one too.  I was told it was a mole with no color.  That may be what you have too.  At your next doc appointment ask the doctor to bring in a female nurse to take a look..  I am not sexually active either.|`|6juV48RWaa	are you sexually active??<br>  if you're not, go ahead and tell your mom. she'll find a gyno for you and make an appointment. or even the male doctor you have right now could find a gyno for you. <br>  but if you are sexually active and you're scared to tell your parents, i don;t know what to tell you.|`|bql2RJzWaa	It could also be a cyst. No matter what, you should get it checked out.<br>  Doctors are doctors. They see all sorts of things. <br>  What if it was something serious & you never got it checked because you were too shy...?!|`|0nLdwZP2aa	If you went to a doctor for this, you would be sent to a gynocologist, not to your family doc.  <br>  <br>  I know this is a stupid question, but - are you sure it isn't your cervix?  Feel around in there and see if you can locate your cervix - it should be near the back.  But depending on how you sit, it can move forward a bit.  <br>  <br>  If you can't find anything else, then the bump you felt might just be your cervix.  If you are a virgin, it could also be your hymen - they aren't always shaped the same way.<br>  <br>  But again, 15 is not too young to start going to the gynecologist.  Most women have yearly visits, starting when they become sexually active, or age 18.|`|q0PrrEeeaa	it could be a gland thats swollen. but go to planned parenthood. they are free and will take good care of you. a bump doesnt sound like much but you should start going to the gyno expecially if your sexual active so you get checked for diseases and preganacy. they will get you on birth control too if needed.  and i dont mean you have disease its just routine part of taking care of yourself and knowing your safe and sound. ps it sounds like a swollen gland, it happens. so dont worry and do the mature thing and start going :)|`|vffZ3is4aa	Just tell your mom that you have a bump that you didn't have before and you want to see a female gyno.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	could be from shaving, underwear rubbing against you or vaginal secretions causing skin irritations

There are so many different ways:standing, crunches, scissors, "biking"<br>  Standing sit-ups-While standing, put your elbows behind your head and touch one elbow to the opposite knee and so on. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps.<br>  Crunches-self explanatory<br>  scissors can be done a couple ways. But either way, lay on your back. One way-move your legs up and down one at a time(ex-left leg up, bring down then right leg up...) other way-cross legs one over the other left to right so first your right leg goes over your left then your left goes over right.<br>  "biking"Thats what i call it lay on your back then move your legs in midair as if you were riding a bike.<br>  I hope I explained O.K.|`|ySa4WW1caa	Well if your still in school I would say try to do your best in P.E tell yourself that you can do it and there's no reason to stop and that your stopping yourself. <br>  <br>  Idk if this will work  but maybe you can lay on the ground or on a flat surface like your bed and lay on your back and slowly lift your legs up (keep your legs straight) and then put them down and repeat this.<br>  <br>  Or just be more active like play sports umm or like take walks around or walk to places like work or school.<br>  <br>  Or try the basics everyday do like 50 jumping jacks because there not that hard and do sit ups and push ups till your tired you dont need to push yourself that hard just repeat that everyday and try to do alittle more everyday.<br>  <br>  And dont be lazy|`|mzz9Icdjaa	cardio! specifically, you could run the straights on a track, and walk the curves. interchanging between pushing yourself hard and resting slightly is great for making belly fat go away. just don't overdo it. Don't start with crunches and situps because it will make your stomach stick out more. You have to get your heart pumping if you want to lose fat. Work out the stomach muscles once you lose the fat if you want a six pack|`|GucrpVR5aa	Well that one blue ball that you can buy at Target, when you do stretches on it that sometimes helps.

eoL9PxPiaa	If you had a catheter placed, everyone will have some sort of bladder retention. Sometimes the bladder becomes lazy and you have to coax it into working again...many times in the postpartum unit we have to re-cath women b/c their bladders become lazy and dont want to excrete all the urine. Try running warm water over your perineal area, placing your hand in warm water or turn the shower on while you sit on the toilet, one of the three usually work great!|`|jvOixxxyaa	What kind of surgery?

YteCvUZJaa	Washing your face often can actually cause pimples to happen as well, so you should watch out for that. Sleep early and to get rid of my pimples when they were going crazy my family put me on a steamed/bbq fish, rice, and loads of veggies diet. It wasn't that happy of a memory, but it did clean out my system and worked really well. Took about 2-3 weeks for a lot of them to clean up.|`|vPpy4zK9aa	Firstly, I don't think you should be getting a chemical peel in summer.<br>  Why? Because the chemicals and the sun don't go together, and the sun will leave more scars on your skin if you get it.<br>  <br>  And you can't get rid of Acne quickly, because it's a condition that you will always have. They'll leave with time.<br>  <br>  BUT, if you have PIMPLES, not ACNE, my advice is to live as naturally as possible. Eat fruit, drink orange juice.<br>  Stay away from butter, peanut butter and oily stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!
ZBwmdm0qaa	Skipping meals isn't good.<br>  <br>  Chinese food is full of saturated oils and fats. These clog your arteries and cause a host of problems not limited to simple weight gain (your memory and state of arousal are even affected!)<br>  <br>  White rice lacks nutrition and will not keep you full. Whole grain foods (like brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole wheat cereals) will keep you full longer for the same amount of food and are better for you.<br>  <br>  Chicken is good, but not when it's fried in oil (as it is in any fast-food implementation you will find) <br>  <br>  Anything where you're heating oils or fats is really really bad for you.<br>  <br>  KD isn't really bad for you, but you could have had a healthier meal in its place.<br>  <br>  And that banana is great for you, but it packs a pile of calories if you're really concerened|`|WcioB4JFaa	Yes I think you did fine! you stuck to thhe serving sizes, but remember to get in 5 servings of fruits and veggies every day.|`|lwBYNN84aa	Well to be perfectly honest no<br>  <br>  First of all eating breakfast sets you up for the entire day of eating because if you have a healthy brekki you would obvislithy want to carry this on.<br>  <br>  Your lunch is not fatty as such and isn't bad for when you have it everynow and then but eating rice is very bad escpecially the ones in chinese shops. You can avoid this dillema by eating a hearty sandwhich with lettuce, tomaoto bacon/low fat shaved chicken and minmal sauce/mayo.<br>  <br>  Your dinner is very convinent but not up to proper standards because it isn't enough meanig you probally get a bad day the next day if choose not to eat breakfast again. Having just enough is not acceptble especilly for males, you shoud sit up and eat and get up see if you need more till you get a slight bloat feeling<br>  <br>  Also in betwwen you should have fruit ( 5 plus a day keeps the docter away) and have a drink bottle handy because dehydration reduces your concentration and performance ina nayhting<br>  <br>  That would be what i usually eat most days in the rowing season|`|b79af8d71c3fb7f061fd539eed26af0aaa	Yes. I almost always skip breakfast. I don't know why that's so important. At least you didn't go to some fast food place for lunch or dinner. A little mac and cheese won't kill you in moderation. You didn't mention what you drank, I'd at least try to squeeze in some juice somewhere.|`|894aXFYUaa	yes it can be unhealthy <br>  i would recommend eat breakfast<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
Nw6DbfCcaa	No, if you don't inhale it can't have any effect on you. But I would recommend that you start inhaling - you will enjoy it so much more, and you won't look like a child when you smoke.<br>  <br>  The throat thing is probably from the pollution, making your sinuses excrete mucus that runs down the back of your throat and makes it sore. If you start inhaling your cigarettes, try to exhale the smoke through your nose a lot and this will make your sinuses less sensitive and will make your throat feel better.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4EZ7sTEJaa	well, first off you could be getting throat cancer. since you dont inhale it and it just clumps in the back of your thorat. cigarettes effect everyone differently. some people smoke all their life and never get cancer, others get cancer and die within years. check with your doctor.<br>  <br>  but if you want my honest answer, QUIT. i'm a smoker but i actually INHALE. youre doing it to fit in, not because you are addicted. if you were addicted you would inhale. thats a bad waste of money.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	If you don't inhale you really aren't getting nicotine into your system meaning you aren't really addicted to them.

Just the second hand smoke alone!  Did you know that for every 4 cigs your friend smokes, YOU smoke 1??  It's true.  Not to mention mouth or throat cancer, rotting and yellow teeth. If you did inhale, your chances of getting lung cancer would be greater, but that's still a possibility, because some smoke is getting to your lungs just by the second hand smoke, and you smoking at all. <br>  Of course your teenage friends are just "fine" so far!  Check back with them all when they're in their 20's or 30's. Things won't be so "fine" then!<br>  Just stop, hon.  Your friends will be jealous. I bet a couple will follow your lead.  Just say you got smart and hated stinking and wasting all your money, and now you're proud to say, "I don't smoke!"  Guys will like kissing you a LOT more when you quit too!  Here's a star to get you started!!  C'mon!  Be a leader!  If your friends won't like you anymore, they're hardly friends, right?  :)|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Some people who smoke for a very short time end up with cancer, while there are some who are ninety years old and have smoked since they were your age. You never can tell. Although if there is cancer in your family, you may have a better chance of getting cancer from smoking. You can't go by your friends. <br>  I won't say stop smoking. You'll do that when you're ready. <br>  First, don't convince yourself that you need to smoke. The psychological addiction, I believe, is harder to break than the physical. If you don't convince yourself that you need it, it may be easier when you decide to quit. It was for me.<br>  Second, don't believe that if your friends smoke that you have to. I'd be willing to bet that some of them are doing it just to look cool. If you were to take the lead and quit at some point some of your friends may end up following you. <br>  Third, stay active and eat well. By well I don't mean eat alot. I mean eat good foods. Quality not quantity.<br>  Fourth, breathing exercises are good. Take deep breaths in through the nose and exhale through the mouth(slowly).<br>  Of course these aren't as good as actually quitting, but they may make it easier to quit later. Until then they can help to lessen some of the effects of smoking.|`|9KOjKZoMaa	Hi Sweet P,<br>  <br>  As with all things in life there is risk, smoking being one of them. Unfortunately no one can know how fate will rule but it is a well know fact that smoking is harmful and often fateful. It is a very addictive and pleasant drug and only smokers can understand how difficult it is to give it up. I still smoke but wish I didn’t and only you can decide what you want to do but seeing as you are very young and have the strength and willpower to overcome, I would try to quit, as you don’t seem addicted and would find in time you don’t even miss them. <br>  As for your symptoms it could be none related but I wouldn’t take the risk, go and get checked out and be honest with your doctor and put your mind at rest.<br>  Here is a link with some info, which you might find helpful. :)|`|0uDuXHtcaa	Eww, you must have yellow teeth, bad breath and a wrinkled face. Go brush your teeth.<br>  <br>  And yes you are literally dying by each cigarette you light.<br>  <br>  <im being mean to make you quit.>|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	honey, of COURSE it's already affected you|`|jV99kgWbaa	Congratulations on being smart enough to think of the damage this may be doing to you.<br>  <br>  You obviously know the bad things that can happen from smoking, but I'd like to encourage you with some good news:<br>  <br>  When you stop smoking, this is what happens:<br>  <br>  Within 20 minutes your blood pressure and pulse returns to normal. <br>  <br>  Within 8 hours nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in blood reduce by half, oxygen levels return to normal and circulation improves. <br>  <br>  Within 24 hours carbon monoxide and nicotine are eliminated from the body. <br>  <br>  Within 48 hours the ability to taste and smell improves. <br>  <br>  Within 3 days your breathing becomes easier as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. <br>  <br>  Within a few weeks your fingers lose their yellow stains and your skin looks better. <br>  <br>  Within 1 month your appearance improves - skin loses its greyish pallor and becomes less wrinkled. <br>  <br>  Within 3-9 months coughing and wheezing declines. <br>  <br>  Within 1 year the risk of heart attack reduces by half compared to that of a smoker. <br>  <br>  Within 10 years the risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker. <br>  <br>  Within 15 years your risk of coronary heart disease is the same as a non-smoker.
cDLjGvEuaa	Perhaps you shouldn't be thinking to far ahead. Try to think about the next hour or two as your thoughts are pretty much running a muck with you as it is. Just to be able to get the suicide thoughts out of your head for a few minutes is hard enough but sometimes just keeping yourself occupied will help. Saying to you to relax is pointless but if you can, try to write down the pros and cons of suicide but be honest with yourself and then later, this can be in 2 3 4 or how ever many days, write down what goals you would like to achieve and follow this up by how you will achieve them, then go back to your pros and cons of suicide and you may find yourself adding to your list.<br>  It's never easy when you hurt but it does get easier if you allow yourself time.... Good luck, I wish you all the best.

Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin and as such our bodies can neither store or produce it and we need to ingest it on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  eat more foods and their juices rich in vitamin C ie ~leafy and green vegies (also rich in calcium and magnesium), citrus fruits such as lemons, limes and oranges, strawberries, blackberries and red and green peppers etc...<br>  <br>  Vitamin C reduces inflammation, reduces fever, stimulates the immune system and restores the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract.......... In addition, vitamin C creates an environment in the digestive tract that helps control the overgrowth of yeast, bacteria and parasites.<br>  <br>  Vitamin C deficiency can contribut to digestive problems, as well as bleeding gums, bloody noses, bloodshot eyes, increased susceptibility to infection, joint pain, unexplained bruising and lack of energy..... hmm, vitamin C the magical potion i reckon...........;0)<br>  <br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Here are a few simple home remedies that will help to overcome cough.

wOecmtrzaa	Actually, many dentists take out wisdom teeth themselves.  Its not a big deal, really.  <br>  <br>  It is relatively inexpensive, especially if you only are having the one out.  Your DDS will probably take a panoramic xray to make sure the other ones arn't going to cause a problem, too, and if they are in a bad place you will want to get them out all at once (I mean generally thats how its done).<br>  <br>  What actually happens during the surgery: you are numbed with a local, and perhapse put on NOx, and then your DDS will remove a bit of bone and "scoop" up your tooth.  Since your tooth is "under" another one, (s)he will just be more careful and may angle the extraction a different way than usual.<br>  <br>  If your tooth is more boney (it sounds like yours has calcified, since it hurts and is coming in) its more like removing any other tooth, but the same basic procedure is used.  I had out a partially boney and 1 fully boney impacted wisdom teeth.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YBcB0732aa	You go to a dentist and they give you a referral to an oral surgeon.

s19XuGlUaa	There must be a specific reason/reasons why you feel the way you do. Examine yourself. Maybe you are not fixing yourself up to the best of your ability.  Treat yourself to a makeover one day. If there are things you do not like about yourself, such as features, remember that we are all beautiful and created in the image and likeness of God. Everybody has traits or features they don't exactly love about themselves. If you know that there is room for improvement, make an effort.   <br>             Anyone who does not want to be friends with you or be interested in forming a relationship with you because of your looks are just losers. That is really immature to not be friends with someone because of their appearance.<br>            Also take a look in the mirror and state positive things that you like about yourself. This will help in your beginning to fully accept yourself. This will make your self esteem higher. <br>             We are all beautiful in God's eyes. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Remember that. =]|`|ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".|`|TjkZqzwDaa	It is actually the other way round - if no one wouldn't want to be friends with you, its probably bcos of your low self esteem.<br>  <br>  You can raise your self esteem by quitting such negative self talk.

The best results I have ever gotten is strengthening your immune system - have him take a multi-vitamin formulated for men, along with at least 500mg of Vitamin C daily.  Also, there is an immune system strengthening spray called "Sovereign Silver", which is basically a spray that tastes like water that contains silver which is supposed to help strengthen your immune system.  Just be sure not to take super high doses of it, only what is recommended.  You can use the spray right on the genital warts for the best results, and it has worked wonders for me.

LV75kgwraa	Okay, so don't bite my head off when you read my post. This is just my honest, professional opinion. You're probably not going to like my answer, and that's okay. So, here it goes: <br>  <br>  Sleeping in your contact lenses is never a good idea...period. Any eye doctor or optician (that's me) will tell you this. There's way too many risks involved: infections, corneal ulcers, peeling away of the corneal layers, etc... Also for many other reasons as stated in another post. But your also not allowing your eyes to get enough oxygen! Your eyes DO need to breathe! Your eyes will get some oxygen while wearing contacts but never 100%. So basically, wearing contacts will cut off some oxygen supply. And on top of that, closing your eyes at night to sleep is cutting off the rest! Catch my drift? This is why your eyes are red and watery. And since you slept in them for 2 days, the lenses are also dirty. No oxygen + dirty lenses...need I say more? Your eyes are probably feeling a little swollen and you have photophobia (sensitivity to light) as well, but you didn't mention that. These are all symptoms of over-wearing your contacts which CAN lead to infections, although you say you don't have one. So YES, sleeping in your lenses has a lot to do with your eye problem. And YES, you do need to give your eyes a break and wear your out dated eyeglasses! It's better than not having anything to see with. Let alone risk the chance of losing your eyesight from irresponsibility. You need to update your eyeglasses for this reason alone. Sorry, not trying to be rude just being honest.|`|jhKa4Zohaa	Persistent sleeping contacts will definitely cause many bad things to happen from bacterial infections especially if you don't properly clean your contacts.<br>  <br>  Sleeping in the contacts probably caused the protein on the contacts to build up and since you sleep in it and didn't clean away these deposits, The protein probably caused a corneal abrasion and proteins might have gotten lodged in the abrasion causing your eye to hurt and be irritated and water to try and flush out. Might feel like you have a grain of sand in it or feel like there's a sting in it or just hurt to blink like stabbing in eye.<br>  <br>  Also consider buy dailies if you don't like to take out your contacts and wash them. Will save your eyes from possible infection that is caused by leaving contacts in and gathering bacteria in your eye.|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	You can try hold your finger in front of your face, as close as you can get it with it being in focus.<br>  Focus on your finger, then immediately focus on something considerably further away.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Katrina,<br>  <br>  Yes it certainly could be the detergent.<br>  <br>  If you have sensitive skin it is not a good idea to use biological washing powder. Non bio is much better. You can use bio if you need to, but always do a second wash in non bio afterwards.<br>  <br>  Wear panties which have not been washed in your new detergent and get some Vagasil or Canasten cream which will relieve your itching.<br>  <br>  Love mel.X|`|AA11839888	yes,most definatley, i couldnt have bubble bath either and dish soap breaks my moms hands out.<br>  try some ivory snow or dreft, or a clear detergent. get some aveeno soaps.|`|y9pMH1h3aa	I have always been allergic to certain detergent's and don't feel bad i couldn't have bubble bath's either . If you have never used the detergent  before then it might be your problem . Change your detergent and see if that helps at all . The only other thing i could suggest is that maybe you have a yeast infection specially if your not itching or breaking out anywhere else on your body .|`|4EZ7sTEJaa	this can cause a bad allergic reaction. switch back. if you dont want to be stuck with the same detergent, try dilluting it maybe
d3GUVXjlaa	Actually I’ve found that the lower someone’s self-esteem gets, the more that person loses control of themselves.  You mentioned that you don’t have a good self-esteem; this could be the reason why you don’t feel in control.  I think you need to start improving your self confidence.  <br>  <br>  You mentioned that you don’t feel smart or pretty.  This is negative self talk and will lower your self-esteem.  You need to talk positively to yourself.  <br>  <br>  Okay, I have an exercise for you to do.  I would like you to write down all the things that you don’t like about yourself. <br>  <br>  OK, and then I want you to think of how you can improve those areas.  Let’s say you write down that you feel ugly….okay, then think of ways that you can improve your appearance.  What about make up?  Really, no girl in the 21st  century should have to feel ugly about herself.  There are plenty of cosmetics and beauty enhancers and beauty tricks on the market that can get anyone looking fabulous.   <br>  Okay, now that you have come up with a positive to counteract that, think about how you feel.  You should feel slightly more positive because of some hope.  Okay, let’s say that you write down that you don’t feel smart, okay, now ask yourself what is the definition of smart?  I’ve found that really smartness is all based on someone’s frame of reference.  Also I’ve found that when someone improves their self-esteem, they will act and feel much smarter than they thought they were before.  You really need to think positively.  Successful people, popular people, smart people all have one thing in common.  They all think positively about themselves.  This is key!  I cannot stress this enough!  <br>  <br>  You are beautiful!!!!  You are intelligent!!!!  You are energetic and full of life!!!!  You are CUTE!!!  You are gorgeous!!!!  You are popular!!!  Keep going!  :) :)|`|Px990WYDaa	you should try and see a therapist. I'm sure they can help you. they can teach you some coping strategies and such. or you can try doing some research on ways to help with the bad anxiety. i think you should really consider it. a lot of people go through that and getting help is honestly the best thing.|`|VYpVrPluaa	you need to go to a doctor for a check up to stop you're worrying about being sick and then you need to either tell a parent or guidance counsellor, call kids help line or see a therapist. excercise is a good way to boost your confidence when it comes to your appearance and it releases endorphins which make you happy.|`|AA11226501	well the biggest source of help is patience<br>  but if u want to calm down and get better you beed a psychiatrist or psychologist<br>  for now, you can talk to me<br>  i just went to a retreat and it has helped me a lot, its not a cure, but a start|`|fbeJMYt7aa	You should talk to a therapist. I know you probably think thats unreasonable, bur you cant do it alone. First you need to bring your parents in and tell them everything. Then tell them you want to talk to a therapist|`|lvn1vFGRaa	GET CONFIDENCE AND GO TO THE DOCTORS AND LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST|`|gn0LrrSRaa	Read the Bible, and obey it. You will be much happier.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Ok, you're gonna probably have to talk to a counselor. These are issues that need to be worked on by a professional. I used to work at a mental health place. Here's the thing to remember. You're stressing. You know when you feel like you're just THIS CLOSE to being pushed off the edge of a cliff by it all? ALways act before you reach the edge of the cliff<br>  <br>  Some people reach the edge and it's really REALLY hard to recover. however, if you talk to someone and maybe get meds, your life might start IMPROVING. You feel like you have no control? Taking action to improve your situation will help that feeling go away as well.<br>  <br>  In my case, I found my anxiety reduced when I started taking lots of flax seed oil for hormones. I also react to a chemical that forms when food cooks, and which is found in a lot of good foods, called amines. This chemical was basically the source of my anxiety. I had to do what's called the elmination diet. You can google that. Good luck|`|eRqZZoaSaa	You just need to work on your self-esteem. every day find 5 bad things about you and 10 good things. Then ask all your friends what they like best about you. You shouldnt worry about things like that. I some times do that too. your not the only one. One day I stayed home from a foot ball game because i was too depressed. But i got over it. You may also want to keep a notebook, and talk to your friends about this it may help.|`|bWpYLSKSaa	I think that you should talk to your parents or a councilor about this problem. Therapy actually does help, because you receive medication and talk about your problems. You question what you are truly thinking, which gives you a good look at life. It might be embarrassing to talk about at first, but believe me, it will help in the long run. Don't be afraid to get help from those that you trust, because they will love you no matter what happens.|`|0OW4IWCaaa	Try talking to a counselor. When I was depressed, I did this and it helped me a lot. I wouldn't recommend antidepressants as they tend to make things worse for some people. <br>  <br>  Have you taken a vacation in a while? If not, you should go someplace warm like Florida and enjoy the warm air and sunshine, as that tends to make me feel better.|`|ANJ8oRCjaa	admitting that you have an issue means that you are not to far gone.  You need to get professional help, be it a therapist, anti-depressants, a day of relaxation, etc.  Finding the root of your issues is going to be the next real step in your recovery, but a few anti-depressants will help you keep your head above water until a more permanent solution can be found.  Keep your head up!|`|uAgBwWuSaa	hi hun how are you today first of all i have had the same problem as you you need to see a doctor and a counsler i did and get out and do some fun thangs with your family and friends i did and it help you should try it|`|Wb6l1nKEaa	if u want to talk i'm online on aim or yahoo messenger and my screename is TheBTPYoda.  i think u need to see a psychiatrist.  u need someone to talk to and u may need to take some medication too.|`|Wvcf4Nn5aa	this is somewhat like depression, but its your hormones messing with you because of puberty.|`|dT1LdsPcaa	Yea. Just remember that your beautiful.|`|P2127Tt8aa	I myself am dealing with depression but because of a traumatic advent when I was younger that just recently came up. I have learned that talking can usually help but then again not always. I am on medication for depression but also for anxiety because mine is really bad. I would suggest going to see a doctor to see if they medication is right for you. As for the hypochondria, that usually is caused because there is something you are not talking about and are trying to avoid by convincing yourself that there is something else wrong to hide what is really bothering you. I could be very wrong but maybe talking to someone or not even that. Try writing in a journal and figure out why you are depressed and why it is getting worse; you never know what you might discover when writing. The low self esteem and not thinking you are smart or pretty is a part of depression (I feel the same way about myself) but it can be fixed with the right tools: talking, writing, medication, or all of these at once. <br>  <br>  The one thing I would have to recommend you doing is to give everything people suggest a chance. You won't know until you have tried. <br>  <br>  Always remember people care about you a lot even if you dont think so or dont want them to, they do and they will help you however you need it. <br>  <br>  Anxiety, depression, and hypochondria are linked together like a cycle. It is very rare to have just one of the three.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you in some way. I know it helped me to hear/read that it wasn't all in my head and I just needed to find my voice.- Maybe that is all you need too.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|gdW8rZt8aa	You really need to get with some friends who are positive influences and have outgoing personalities, maybe that would help to bring out some self-esteem in you.  I have been there and when I hit 16, I started to come out of my shell a little bit.  I had a new group of friends and I made friends with all different people.  You can be helped with the anxiety attacks, if you see your doctor.  Your regular doctor can help you with some medication until you get them under control.  Just tell him you have anxiety attacks and feel depressed.  He will probably tell you to see a counselor, but he/she may be able to prescribe something in the meantime.  It can get better, trust me.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	You need to get professional help. This problem has been going on a long time, and nobody here is going to be able to get to the bottom of it. Counseling is really helpful - if you want to give cognitive behavioral therapy a try for free, there is computerized CBT at moodgym.anu.edu.au. You start out taking some little tests to see ify ou have 'warpy thinking' that is making you interpret events in a way that makes you miserable, then you work on your cognitive style.  I suspect if you have a lot of issues, they will show up on these tests.|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	Yep. You deffinately have hypochondria.<br>  Just relax.<br>  Take it easy.<br>  You only think there's something wrong with you because you feel you can't control anything that goes on in your life.<br>  You should really take a good look at yourself and ask what you could do to make yourself a more confident person.<br>  No one's perfect.<br>  And no one expects you to be.<br>  Just decide who you are and be comfortable with that person.<br>  If you can't do that, then transform yourself into what you would want to be.<br>  Appreciate your flaws.<br>  They're the ones you learn from.|`|eSGBXFEjaa	I think I have the same thing as you only not as bad but might get to it.

54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Getting a positive reaction on the tb skin test does not mean he has tb.  It just means that he has been exposed to tb and He will probably be given a further test to see whether he does.  Most likely he doesn't.  But if he does, he will be given directions at that time, about what precautions to take.  And of course he will be treated for it.  <br>  And, it's not necessarily too soon to show; plus, a little reaction doesn't always count as positive.  Redness doesn't count as positive; only a raised, hardened area is measured to read the tb test.  It has to be a certain width to count as positive, depending on conditions.  See the info link below.<br>  So don't panic; just make sure he follows up on it.|`|USoqyjaAaa	An early reaction may not mean anything.  He needs to get it read between 48 and 72 hours after it was placed.

0bYcYz2jaa	Leafy greens like spinach, mustard or turnip greens, or dark fluffy lettuce like romaine or green leaf are high in iron.  I think broccoli is too.  You may also be coming down with a cold or just eating too little.  If I go too long without eating a meal, usually over 10 hours, then I get light headed.  You may want to consult a doctor for this though.  Even go on a site like WebMD to see if it could be something you need to worry about.  If the leafy greens work though, your friend may be right.|`|gRwYBmKQaa	you should see your doctor,and get your blood checked,to make sure you don't have diabetes.
Z8d9ipxmaa	You're feeling the pain because of the nerves in your fingers. Cold weather messes up the circulation in the hands and feet. <br>  The reason the pain has been belated is that adrenaline makes your hands feel numb, or just painless, so you cope with your environment when you're actually in it... Your brain produces  adrenaline to keep you going when you're actually in the cold. But later, when you come into a warm room, your body adjusts to the new temperature and stops producing the adrenaline... Then you feel the pain, when the adrenaline has gone. <br>  <br>  It's normal and nothing serious. It will ease off.|`|wZuBbA2Xaa	It's probably frostbite--just keep your fingers warm and keep them gloved when you go outside.  Frostbite happens when the moisture in your skin cells freeze, and it eventually kills them.  If it starts to turn any darker color seek medical attention As soon as possible.  People can actually lose limbs from frostbite.
I6dcRgD6aa	It sounds like it could be so many different things I wouldn't let any here tell you. Kidney problems could cause the dark urine, diabetes could be the cause.

3lYYQWJtaa	There's a couple possible answers.  Any soreness should be gone relatively quickly, so something isn't quite right.  If you're not stretching properly, ensure that you're doing that before and especially after weights.  After is very important, and will make your work-out much more effective.  Second, make sure you're properly hydrated and you're doing the lifts correctly.  Do multiple sets, and wait 1 minute between sets.  Any soreness you have should go away within 36 hours of lifting, at the latest.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Your just out of shape :]<br>  <br>  Google search "getting in shape" and read every website on page one.|`|al0cCPb6aa	it is okay to lift weights everyday as long as you're switching. You need to do lower body one day and then upper body the next and keep switching. If you're doing full body everyday then you are pushing yourself too hard. Soreness is usually good thing though as long as it's not just straight up pain.|`|LrAd0OQZaa	still lift when your sore just do it every other day and if you want to get bigger muscles fast on your off days do some cardio (run, swim etc) its good when its sore because it tell the body to send more proeteins to the muscle as they are "ripped"<br>  cheers

It doesn't.|`|R9KvEhMxaa	Completely unfounded, and completely false.<br>  <br>  I'll spare you my usual rant and just summarize. There are people out there who think that because this vaccine protects against a disease that is primarily transmitted sexually, it's alright to lie and propagandize about it to stop people from getting it, because that will vicariously stop people from having sex.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	If there was any chance of the vaccine making you sterile or infertile it wouldn't be on the market.<br>  <br>  Tests of the vaccine showed only very minor problems.

5V8yqwdWaa	I do not know.  I think that people who are not able to sleep, are more likely to have nightmares.  I do not think that nightmares are a result of not sleeping.|`|Yj4mQJtLaa	I think dreaming sometimes is your body balancing out all the stress you go through being awake... I know sometimes I have dreams that I feel like I needed to experience and then I feel better afterward, like talking to someone or going somewhere, and then when I wake up I'm happier and kind of fulfilled even though I know it wasn't real.  I feel like this happens more when I don't get much sleep because it's almost like I've been away from the dreaming so long I need more of it to feel comfortable again.

0bYcYz2jaa	Sounds like the flu.  A cold usually won't make you vomit.  When I'm sick I have to avoid milk and eggs or it makes me nauseous.  Try drinking lots of hot tea with honey and lemon.  For the sore throat/cough, gargling salted water can help clear it up.  Try to get lots of vitamin C, orange, grape and cranberry juices are good sources, and it helps boost your immune system.  If you have the money, a Vick's humidifier can help with your congestion.  It's basically a humidifier you can add Vick's vapor rub to.  Adding humidity to the air will also help your sinuses fight the sickness and keeps them from drying out and giving you nosebleeds.  Ibuprofen or Tylenol will help with the fever and aches, and keeping wrapped up and warm will also help.  Even when you feel super hot, just stay wrapped up.  And oh yeah, your sense of smell and taste will be jacked up until it's about gone.|`|F08HDRvraa	You have the flu it sounds like.  It usually takes 7-10 days to get over it completely.  Take tylenol or ibuprofen for the fever and body aches and try to at least drink plenty of liquids even if you don't feel like eating a lot.|`|vAM1GhBiaa	Lol sucks I had all those symptoms yesterday but I threw up like four times... It was cool! And I am a 16 year old boy but now I feel better but I still got coughing and my headache was a freaking harsh sob!    <br>  <br>  It should be normal not to smell or taste. Hopefully you get better and get some rest. You should visit doctor or stay warm.
3M3UtNyvaa	I really don't understand how it works, but yes. <br>  <br>  If I don't eat, the next day I can literally see and feel the difference in my waist. But not on the scale. Generally when I diet, I will start noticing my clothes being looser before I see any actual weight loss.<br>  <br>  But the "experts" insist you must lose about 6 lbs just to lose one inch. Well, I totally disagree!|`|uwZ9AL38aa	If you get hit in the head with a frying pan. Other than that, no. You dont grow shorter, that didn't make sense. You loose weight. you can not get shorter.

dpgXzMenaa	Almost certainly you were trying to push it *up* instead of backwards... it was hitting the front wall of your vagina and *scraping* it... and of course as you'd expect, that HURTS.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|onfX2jqLaa	your hymen might not have broken. it can break from a fall, or from riding a bike or losing your virginity. you can break it with a tampon and dont worry youre still a virgin!<br>  <br>  if it isnt that then you might want to put a little petroleum jelly on it to make it easier to go in. it will make it much more comfortable. and try lifting one leg on the toilet or counter and try to put it either furter back or further forward.<br>  good luck!|`|dMy2gXgEaa	I used to have this problem. I actually found that I was over thinking it.. try from a different angle.. it may be because your still a virgin and its kinda easier when your not. . in my opinion (and my mother always told me that also.) . . i read some ways online once.. and like putting one leg on the toilet and one still on the floor (like climbing a hill) and then try putting it in.. helped. also, maybe its the brand. cardboard is not my favorite, plastic is much better-- or maybe a teen brand!<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|vVEnCP0faa	I had the same problem.  I could not use a tampon at all until after I lost my virginity.  Now they're a breeze to use.  I'm not recommending to go out and have sex just so you can use a tampon obviously though...  There's nothing wrong with you though.  Totally normal.|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Practice more.Get a smaller size to begin with.
aYgj4cIBaa	Honestly-I hated tampons until after I was married(read had sex). They hurt soooo much I couldn't stand it. Once I had sex, they didn't hurt at all & I use them all the time.(& no I'm not an old woman whose had tons of sex-it's only been 3 yrs) I personally use organic unbleached cotton ones because I'm afraid of all the fragrances & stuff they use in the regular ones, especially if I'm sticking it up there. Hope that helps!|`|ULkqriEhaa	Pads are my choice. I have been using pads since i started my period 10 years ago. because i think blood needs to come out, not stay in and absorb. <br>  <br>  You wouldn't get turned on, they aren't used sexually at all, don't worry.<br>  <br>  But i like pads much better, you can get thin pads that absorb and change them often and you won't have a smell, so there's nothing gross about it.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	i started using tampons at 14years, and i WILL NEVER GO BACK! i agree pads are like nappies and gross, <br>  <br>  you should be able to find tampons with a 'ease cover'? or something similar? sorry im in NZ and we have a brand with 'silk ease' which makes tampons smoother and easier to use<br>  <br>  maybe use applicator tampons? they are super easy and you don't have to use your finger ! i used to use those when i was younger too|`|vfN8TWXGaa	tampons are easy to insert if you use some lubricant & use slender ones.|`|ml8Gamoraa	I have used tampons for a long time now. No, they aren't just for older women, and they are way more comfortable than pads! When inserted correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it. They also have added benefits - you can go swimming with them in, and less of that "diaper" feeling. <br>  Are you sexually active? If not, it may be because you need time to adjust to having something there. The components of tampons are natural and will not get stuck, stretch you out, or any of the myths you may have heard. <br>  Just read the directions included in the box and relax. Good luck!|`|K5BLCZPkaa	Tampons are the best. And no, they are not for older women who have had sex a lot. That guy is clearly misinformed. You most likely will not get turned of my tampons, unless you do the motions if you know what I mean, and hopefully you do. And as far as it hurting goes, you most likely put it in wrong, but just try until you get it right. Its not that hard.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	I didn't start using tampons until I was 17 either and I started on my period when I was in like the 5th grade :(  <br>  And, I wasted a whole box of tampons before I finally learned how to wear it properly.  I read a lot online and I tried all sorts of different tampons.  I found the plastic ones to be the easiest and I though that the lights are the easiest to learn with.  <br>  And that guy was an idiot haha....|`|dpgXzMenaa	Tampons with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert.

If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>

3meIiIsmaa	I would think that after 10 years - this would not be having an effect on you. Coughing immediately after would be normal - since there were probably chemicals in the water as well.  Since then you have had a lot a time to be exposed to other things -- Do you smoke? are you around chemicals or other irritants? do you have allergies? You might want to see a pulmonary doctor to check you out - and he will prob. send you to an allergist --

CThiAnFlaa	It depends actually. Some viruses incubate during a fever and once this has passed the infection is no longer contagious. However, the statistics vary depending on the type of illness, the age of the individual and other factors. So, if you are feeling much better with no signs of a persistent or severe illness (vomiting, rash, body ache, headache, unusual behavior, blurred vision or moderate to severe discomfort) you may be fine. HOWEVER, most schools require students be fever free for at least 24 hours before they return. This is understandable and justified I think. Specifically, if you are ill you are not only a threat to the rest of the student body (by spreading a possible germ around) but also making a successful recovery more difficult for yourself. For example, if you happen to have a contagious illness and do go back to school this is likely to infect a lot of other people, which may come back to you once again, thus creating a vicious cycle. The other concern is returning to school with a weak immune system (because the body was not allowed a full recovery) making you more susceptible to other illnesses--on top of what you may already have which can really put a lot of stress on the mind and body.So, if you think you are fine then go back but if you want to be safe then wait it out.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Yes.  Sometimes, your body does a wonderful job by killing off germs by raising your body temperature in a short period of time.  Often, though, it takes a day or two before the fever is completely gone and you don't need to take tylenol anymore.  See what your temperature is in the morning and then decide.
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Your symptoms can change. I used to get really sore before my period, and now I don't hurt, but they get REALLY heavy.<br>  <br>  Not a big deal.|`|jb9guNo3aa	If you've had sex, it could be a sign of pregnancy. If not, don't sweat it. Sometimes we don't have pms symptoms for a month, and sometimes we have them 10 times worse than normal. If you skip your cycle for a month and are not sexually active, then don't worry about it unless you miss several cycles--in that case, it would be wise to go to a gynecologist.|`|jnOiqcAlaa	Yeah, same with me. Sometimes my breasts hurt REALLY bad for some periods, and some none at all.

NK9skvrOaa	I doubt that you can buy testosterone pills at 17.<br>  <br>  To increase your testosterone levels naturally:<br>  <br>  Have sex/masturbate in the morning<br>  Eat nuts (peanuts, etc.)<br>  Exercise (but not too much)<br>  Get enough sleep (7 hours or more)<br>  <br>  <br>  All of these things have been shown to increase testosterone levels in men.
7j9MfenOaa	I prefer the type with plastic applicators.  The cardboard kind can sometimes be hard to get positioned correctly, and can be hard to get to insert properly.  No, they don't leak easily, as long as you have the correct absorbency.  I usually opt for a multi-pack which holds super plus, super, regular, and light absorbency (though some of them consider regular to be light, which is just as good).  They don't hurt...you pretty much can't tell they're there as long as you have them in far enough.<br>  <br>  The package usually recommends changing them about every four hours.  The first few days, when the bleeding is heaviest, I recommend using a panty liner.  They're really thin, and not nearly as embarrassing to carry as a pad, and are practically invisible, but they will protect your panties in the off chance you do leak a bit before you can get to the bathroom to change it.  Sometimes teachers won't let you go, or you can't leave your work station...and sometimes you just forget because you don't feel them.<br>  <br>  I usually use them during the day, and switch to pads at nighttime because it gives your body a break from the tampon.  Though it's very rare, Toxic Shock Syndrome can occur if you don't change them enough or use too high an absorbency.  So I opt for pads at bedtime.|`|2726bb12d3c7f9da263ec05507148036aa	tampons are definitely much better than pads. i used to have a terrible time with leaks because of pads, but i have never once leaked from a tampon. people will tell you it is best to start with a slimfit tampon since you have never used them before, but those do not work for most people because they are too small so they cause leaks! just start with a regular absorbency. if your period is very heavy move up to super absorbency for those days. the amount of time you can leave them in varies on your days. so if your second day is really heavy, you might have to change them every 3 hours. you can leave a tampon in for as long as 8 hours, so you can sleep with them in at night so you don't have to worry about how you sleep and leaking. <br>  <br>  overall, if you use the proper absorbency tampon and change it as often as necessary, you should not leak. of course it takes time to tell when to change them, but the nice thing about tampons is that if you start to leak by chance you WILL KNOW IT because you will feel the wetness, whereas pads are just wet and gross all around. so even potential leaks are not that big of a deal.<br>  <br>  good luck! :]|`|Y5FyAekkaa	Make sure that the kind you first try is a good brand like Tampax Pearl. In my experience the cheaper ones don't do a good job. They come with very easy to follow instructions and although it may take a few tries are very easy to use. Tampons should be changed after no longer than 8 hours but i try to change mine more frequently. Until you find the brand that works best for you always wear a backup pad to avoid embarassment.|`|AA11839888	i hated them when i was younger too, but now they are a life saver at work.<br>  tampax pearl or sport are good, iuse the super max because my period is heavy.<br>  slim tampons are the only small ones, the rest just absorb different amounts, even with a super absorbancy, i have to change every 2 hours, always wear a thin pad to catch the leaks, you will learn to feel the differnce when they are full and need to be changed.<br>  they leak when they are full.|`|K5F9T4vNaa	tampons are really such a breeze once you get the hang of them.  When buying them, at first youm ight want to go with a regular or lite size, just so you can get used to it. and then change as needed. there recommended to be changed every 4-6 hours. so they sh ould be changed regularly.  and if you do take care of regular replacing them, you shouldnt have a problem with leakage. there a hell of alot better than pads and if you play sports its a lifesaver.  just take your time and get it right. youll be glad. good luck !|`|7ki9mfh6aa	don't get cardboard<br>  <br>  get tampax PEARL<br>  -they slide in sooo easy-<br>  <br>  <br>  &get the leakage protection you think you need.<br>  it sounds like you need heavy or super heavy.<br>  <br>  if they are not in right, or are in too long they can leak. <br>  if  you have not used them, use  a liner with the tampon just in case. <br>  <br>  change depends on how heavy your cycle is.<br>  you said quite heavy so prolly every<br>  3- 5 hrs.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|2JW4qsRAaa	Ive been using tampons since the begning of my period pretty much.<br>  Pads were getting really gross...so i switched to tampons!<br>  <br>  After a while you get used to them.Trust me.And they are definetly better than pads.No odour.<br>  They could leak especially if you flo is heavy.They have diffrent sizes tho..Light regular super etc...Start with Regular see hiow it turns out.Try it for a while.<br>  For extra safety and to make sur eit doesnt go through your underwear wear a panty liner..\<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uojR7vmEaa	i am 14 and i use tampons you can do it ok just shove it up there i wear them by choice!!!EWWWWWW i cant believe i just put that on here!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4g1N02Bwaa	Tampax Pearl is an easy one to use. People have spread rumors that they are unsafe, but this is not true. I have looked into it. There are also Tampax slinder that are very thin if you are afraid at the size of regular ones, but you would have to change them frequently like every 2 hours to 4 hours. Its the same thing with the regular tampons, they say they last for 8 hours, but I would not trust that. Probably 3-5 hours would be best depending on how heavy the flow is. PS They are way more comfortable than pads. Once you start using them, you will be glad you did.|`|zico37Kkaa	the easiest would be probably tampax pearl or something like that. and don't worry because in all the of tampax boxes there are directions and safety notes. Its kind of weird at first and you might get uncomfortable for the first 2-3 days but there so easy. You should change them every 4-8 hours, depending on your flow and which size you have. The sizes are pretty much just like pads so that conversion is easy. and for the first times that you wear them you might want to wear panty-liners just so there is no chance for leaking to show. But once you have used them more than once or twice you shouldn't be leaking. If you're really freaking out about it you could always ask your doctor or a nurse.|`|20AlHJ47aa	I suggest playtex sport tampons, they are very easy to use. DO NOT USE CARDBOARD TAMPONS! Depending on how heavy your flo is, the more frequently you need to change your tampon. They can leak if your not careful, so you need to wear a pantyliner as well. Tampons are much more efficient, and i'm sure you'll get the hang of them.|`|6AV9XbjCaa	get plastic for sure,<br>  any kind will probably work<br>  get regular for your first time<br>  and you should change it at least every 4 hours<br>  and yeah they'll leak if you leave them in long enough to get totally full<br>  when you buy them read the box<br>  it tells you everything<br>  and really they arent bad<br>  cant feel them at all after you get used to them<br>  and MUCH better than pads|`|pgAh5kdlaa	I only use them during the heavy days of my period. And I use them along with pads. It depends on how heavy your flow is. I change mine every 2 hours. They do leak if you wait too long in between changing them.<br>   If you use the regular ones and change them frequently, they will not harm you, also don't use them overnight to sleep. Stay away from the supers also, just use regular or slim.<br>  <br>  Check this site out for more info about tampons.<br>  <a href="http://www.tampax.com/products.php?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=tampons&utm_campaign=Tampax%20Category&OVRAW=tampons&OVKEY=tampons&OVMTC=standard&OVADID=40061779522&OVKWID=197328556522" rel="nofollow">http://www.tampax.com/products.php?utm_s...</a>|`|kQMBImLLaa	well to tell u the truth  its not good to wear tampons when ur period is heavy....its recommended to wear tampon only at the begging and on the last days of ur period....if u wear tampons when ur heavy it bad for u and also it is not good for u because ur are not lettin out the blood that is not nesseary in ur body|`|Z0PqY7soaa	you should the tampax light ones<br>  they should probly be changed like every 8 hourse but i change them like every 6 hours<br>  and also you should wear a pad just in case you leak; you feel totally dry though!|`|Yek5D2Chaa	age has nothin to do wit u using tampon now.. u should always use watever suits ur needs n makes YOU confortable. i didnt use them till i was in h.s school. n eventhen i hardly ever did. basically i started formally using tampons around your age. i think i was 17, and that was because i began workin n felt very unconfortable using pads, then bein a sports person tampons felt alot better than pads. so dont feel embarrased about it.. i know plenty of chics dat dont like tampons at all or simply have never tried them cause they feel skeptical bout them...<br>  so dont tripp.... its easy n a lot more confortable to use tamps..personally i would recommend playtex sport. those provide better protection againts leaks. especially if u tend to be a lil heavy at times. changing it varies with your type of period. usually  around every 4 hrs. but you'll feel when its time for u to change it. its easier to feel if u have a lil leak about to happen when ur wearing a tampon vs, a pad.(advice: wear a panty liner or very thin padlike for added pretection) besides it keeps your area cleaner. but do not jst stick to full time tampons, its not healthy to use them all the time or leave them on for long periods of time. my doctor always told me to combine to use of pads to tampons every period..so i tend to start off with a tampon an as my flow slows down i then switch to a pad to allow air to circulate n normal flow. it avoids any possible infections due to lack of air flow or ur vagina being too dry...oh n avoid using any scented tampons or pads(especially scented tampons) they eventually cause irritations... good luck!!|`|SHoIWZ56aa	eww that kid is disgusting but i find tampons kinda scary though<br>  i'm around your age|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I would recommend playtex.  They have plastic applicators that are rounded and feel much more comfortable (in my opinion).  They can be worn for up to 8 hours, but 6 is about the most I'm comfortable with.  Sometimes they do leak, but if you wear a panty liner as well or change them often enough, it's not really an issue.  When inserted probably, you shouldn't feel anything.|`|jb9guNo3aa	I recommend Tampax Pearl. You should probably get a multipack so you can start with regular or lites, because they're thinner and easier to insert. They should be changed every 4-8 hours, but really, if you leave it in an hour later, it's not going to kill you--TSS risks are quite low. Just don't forget about one and leave it in for a day. Tampax pearl are pretty good about leak control. They have a braided string, so even if a little bit gets around the cotton, it gets soaked up in the string before it can stain your underwear. I've been using them for like 3 years. I used to use cardboard Tampax, and I'd never go back. They're harder to insert. The only plus is that you can just flush the applicator away. Any plastic applicator tampon will be more comfortable for your first time. It's not a huge deal, just don't tense up while you do it and follow the instructions included in the box. :)|`|AA10363258	they won't leak if you make sure to change them regularly, like every 2 to 4 hours depending on how heavy your flow is. You could try the playtex sport ones, they are slim and slide in easily. Once you get used to them, you will be so glad you switched! Pads suck!  Good luck and I hope this helped.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	you could try tampax which are really good and just try the regular ones for now. just read the instructions. they aren't as bad as you think they are. they don't leak till the tampon gets full and you might need to change them frequently, depending on how your flow is.|`|ulsIrphnaa	just use a shamwow  should stop the heavy flow<br>  <br>  <br>  i have nightmares about bloody tampons in a dark room hanging from the ceiling lol

FDj6rzl9aa	Many bacteria and viruses have an extremely narrow temperature range in which they are able to survive.  Often, by a slight increase in the body's temperature, some of the invaders are able to be killed off. It can actually be very beneficial in the disease fighting process.  The reason we try to lower a fever is because if it gets too high it can be harmful and cause seizures and brain damage.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	The foreign body after getting inside creates the problem, and the WBC counteracts with the foreign body, and when it fails are during counteracting the fever takes place.|`|stUzx5VVaa	It's all part of your inflammatory process.

DtGFWUP5aa	Crying, sort of like orgasm, or laughter, is the release of a build up of some sort of tension. We all carry tension throughout the day, and need to be able to cycle down and get to a level of calm so that we can sleep. Crying, for you, maybe releases tension from your body and mind and enables you to cycle down and relax. <br>  <br>  I would recommend a bed time routine. I would exercise daily, and really build up a good sweat. Do this at least 2 hours before bed time. Then I would take a hot shower, do some yoga, turn off any electronics, dim down the lights, and read fiction until I was tired. If you lay down and can't sleep within a half hour, get back up and read again. You have to train yourself that the bed is for relaxation, and train your body to release tension, and your mind to wind down in other ways. <br>  <br>  That's all I can think to do if it's not linked to emotional problems, or any other physical problems.|`|mAp90hEeaa	This has become a behavior pattern for you and you get satisfaction from doing this.  You might try an over the counter sleep aid to help you re-establish a normal falling asleep ritual and see if you can break this cycle.  It might be embarassing as you get older and still continue doing this when you have a new boyfriend in the bed beside you.  Old behaviors can be changed if you want to.
e7wD8sUiaa	Focus on your studies. I know that's not what you want to hear, but a good, well rounded education can open lots of doors. Or should I say it can give you the option to open many more doors for yourself. If you want meaning in your life that's a good place to start. I didn't realize until later just how important it can be. I spend alot of time now going over things I should've learned when I was in school(as well as some things I did learn and forgot).<br>   Also sports and martial arts can help you focus if you make an honest effort.|`|fgo4uXfraa	Maybe a school group or club (sounds dorky, I know).
NVxGp317aa	Yes you can get it removed. I had surgery in 2002 and had two plates placed in my arm one on the ulnar side one one the radial side. I had the ulnar one removed due to the placement and everytime I would accidently hit my arm up against something it was super painful.<br>  The radial one is still in place and haven't had any issues.<br>  I would look ingot it but some doctors may not be willing to remove it if it is not medically or physically causeing any problems. So I would check to find out what your doctor would do in your situation.

QPnBOom2aa	fevers are the worst.. and 102.9 is pretty high.. but unless she is getting considerably worse, then you shouldnt worry about taking her to the ER.. <br>  i recently had a fever of 104.5 degrees and made it through without having to go to the emergency room. <br>  here are some ways to get rid of the fever.. <br>  lots and lots and lots of cold ice water.. <br>  sometimes taking showers will reduce a fever.<br>  resting and staying in bed is good, but try to get her up and walking around, it really helps to rapidly reduce fevers.<br>  make sure she is taking some kind of fever reducer, like ib profin.<br>  icepops are a good way to ease the throat and reduce a fever. <br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|z9HEbM40aa	Honestly it depends on her age! Infants any fever warrants immediate medical attention. As they get older its ok up to 103o. As older kids and adults I have been told its ok up to 105o. In my opinion if my kids or myself have a fever of 103o and have some kind of other symptoms (such as your sisters) I get myself or my kids seen asap.<br>  <br>  Here is some good info on fevers and ages:<br>  When Can a Fever Be a Sign of Something Serious?<br>  <br>  In the past, doctors advised treating a fever on the basis of temperature alone. But now they recommend considering both the temperature and the child's overall condition.<br>  <br>  Kids whose temperatures are lower than 102° Fahrenheit (38.9° Celsius) often don't require medication unless they're uncomfortable. There's one important exception to this rule: If you have an infant 3 months or younger with a rectal temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Celsius) or higher, call your doctor or go to the emergency department immediately. Even a slight fever can be a sign of a potentially serious infection in very young infants.<br>  <br>  If your child is between 3 months and 3 years old and has a fever of 102.2° Fahrenheit (39° Celsius) or higher, call the doctor to see if he or she needs to see your child. For older kids, take behavior and activity level into account. Watching how your child behaves will give you a pretty good idea whether a minor illness is the cause or if your child should be seen by a doctor.<br>  <br>  The illness is probably not serious if your child:<br>  <br>      * is still interested in playing<br>      * is eating and drinking well<br>      * is alert and smiling at you<br>      * has a normal skin color<br>      * looks well when his or her temperature comes down<br>  <br>  And don't worry too much about a child with a fever who doesn't want to eat. This is very common with infections that cause fever. For kids who still drink and urinate normally, not eating as much as usual is OK.<br>  <br>  ---edit---<br>  Oh I would also like to add what my ped told me. Don't necessarily go by fever temp, go by how they act/feel. Sometimes my toddlers can have temps of 102o and be ok, while other times they can have a temp of only 100o but act lethargic etc. My ped said if they act like that regardless of the severity its time to get seen. So just something to keep in mind.|`|yjE63BzHaa	104 degree and onwords  temperature is consuderd dangerous at this time patient should admit in hospital.|`|7fe0cbf361c24bbe8e34eb867acd5686aa	Are you giving her tylenol and alternating with motrin?  She should be having something for a fever every 4 hours.  Do you know her weight?  It's very important to know her weight, as those medications are weight based, and most parents under dose their kids for fevers.  Is she dressed in light clothing and not bundled up with blankets?  Are you offering her plenty of fluids to drink?  Preferably Pedialyte or water?<br>  <br>  Also, how old is she?  Infants under three months old should NEVER run a fever, it they do, they need to be evaluated.  Keep in mind that 99 degrees rectally is NOT a fever.<br>  <br>  It sort of sounds like the flu, and it can probably wait until the Doc's office if you can control the fever and if she isn't an infant under three months of age.|`|0WnZD5acaa	Hey hun, take a deep breath. I think it's time for a trip to the ER<br>  <br>  **********************************<br>  <br>  A fever is defined as a temperature 1° or more above the normal 98.6°. Minor infections may cause mild or short-term temperature elevations. Temperatures of 103° and above are considered high and can signal a potentially dangerous infection. Contact your doctor in case of a high fever or if a lower fever doesn't resolve with simple treatments.
alAtUXvyaa	its prbably pms....giv it a coupla days and see if it goes away|`|1RnWLGnmaa	if you don't think they're developing still then usually your boobs can get 'tender' or 'sore'  during the weeks or days before your going to get your period.<br>  <br>  so, i wouldn't worry. but if you are still worried then you should talk to someone you trust about it, like your mum or aunt or doctor or sister or something.  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|a3bq277Gaa	Just because you're a C doesn't mean your boobs are done growing.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're going to start your period soon/|`|DuGAysygaa	Stop touching and rubbing them.|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	You are most likely still growing, just because you are C doesn't mean your boobs have stopped growing, trust me I know from experience. Don't worry about it so much though, I am sure its completely normal. Also if you're doing a lot of running and not wearing a supportive enough bra or just exercising in general that may be a cause. Try to stay away from really tight push up bras also since your boobs are hurting, that may help a lot. If this continues make sure to consult a doctor. Also girls boobs tend to hurt close to their periods so that could be another possibility! Good luck.|`|pCBymUayaa	Breasts can be sore during different phases of development and shifts in your hormonal cycle.

You're meant to give them 5 minutes or so to settle, but if they're still weird after that, they're probably not going to get any better. Unless you're using a different solution or something, your eyes could be reacting to that?<br>  <br>  Contacts are all a bit different, so some'll be fine in your eyes and others won't be. The only way to find out is to try. These could be a bit harsh, it sounds like they're drying your eyes out a bit.<br>  <br>  Don't keep them in- contacts that feel a bit uncomfortable could be scratching away at your cornea and doing long-term damage- mine did that.

P9MtNi2laa	I am an ex-smoker.  My non-smoking anniversary is January 1, 1991.  I have reached a point where I can be in a room with smokers and not have the desire to pick up a cigarette.  But it's not easy to get here.<br>  <br>  If you can go 2 weeks without any nicotine at all, you can go the rest of your life.  There are no shortcuts to quitting smoking and I absolutely do not recommend using anything in pill form.  The only way to quit smoking is to quit smoking.  That doesn't mean you can't use things to curb the withdrawals.  But let me emphasize that.  Using any product does not make you quit smoking, it only curbs the withdrawals.<br>  <br>  I think your husband needs a strong motivating factor in order to quit.  He has to really want to quit in order to do it.  He can use the patch, gum, or lozenges for withdrawal control, but in order to quit, he can NEVER smoke another cigarette, or cigar.<br>  When using nicotine substitutes for withdrawal control it is important to follow the directions to the letter.<br>   <br>  The best thing I can say is that no one quits smoking unless they REALLY want to.  There needs to be a strong motivating factor.  For me it was singing.  About 6 weeks after I quit, my voice was WAY better, I could breathe better and I could taste things better.  After 6 months I didn't miss them and after a year I could hang around with smokers and not want to light up.  Everything is better since I quit. <br>  <br>  Another thing that helps in the first few weeks is to stay busy.  What's the first thing a smoker does when he gets bored?  Try making an impossibly long "honey do" list and tell him it will help to keep his mind off smoking.  Don't hang out with smokers unless you have to for the first year and make a habit of going to places where smoking is not allowed.  Being in the company of non-smokers will also help.  Don't allow anyone to smoke in your house or car and avoid places where cigarettes are sold as much as possible.|`|bY58V3oraa	Have you heard of the new electronic cigarettes?  There was a story about them on Yahoo about a week ago.  I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  And I bought two packs of cigarettes today that cost me more than $12.  That’s just crazy!  So I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.|`|J1kJb98Maa	chantrix baby it works!!<br>  edited to add<br>  it works after you stop taking it too<br>  not sure what the other poster was trying to say there<br>  any ways <br>  i smoked for 15 years and never tried to quit before took chantrix and quit with in three weeks have not had a cig in 12 months this week!!<br>  husband had smoked for 20 years "quit" a hundred times ( no more than two days in a row ) took chantrix and he too stopped with in the three weeks and he too is now at the one year mark<br>  my father in law smoked for over 40 years he took chantrix and he is now at 14 months of no smoking<br>  i can be around smokers doesnt bother me but if i have a drink a smoky smoke would be nice ...but i have not given in<br>  saving over 300 bucks a month not smoking!!! yeah for me and my husband|`|cKKUViZCaa	Chantix has a good success rate and gives you WEIRD dreams.

The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	A DIET IS WHAT YOU EAT....there for we are all on a diet....<br>  THINK LIFESTYLE CHANGE<br>  <br>  You got the change the way you think and feel about food<br>  <br>  TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  The first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your body adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  <br>  Don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package....<br>  .....THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD.....<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  NO white BREAD or SUGAR<br>  <br>  NO FRIED FOOD...<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat<br>  <br>  Take a multi vitamin at night|`|d5d2b25d7dff81f28e959f71ce105eb5aa	(First of all, check with your physician, who should be able to tell you how to lose weight healthily while taking into consideration your particular physical status and any health issues you may have.)<br>  <br>  There are many fad diets, but it all comes to this: picture a half-filled bath tub, a faucet filling it, and water leaving it through a partially closed drain. To get the water level of the tub to go down, you can either start to turn off the water going to it from the faucet, or open up the drain. If you want the level to go down quickly, you shut off the faucet and fully open the drain.<br>  <br>  Your body is the bath tub.<br>  Your body mass (weight) is the water in the tub, <br>  the faucet filling it is the food you eat (calories taken in), and<br>  the flow down the drain is the sum of what you excrete and the energy spent (calories out.)<br>  <br>  To lose weight, minimize calories in and maximize calories out; close the faucet and open up the drain. Keep it healthy - don't do anything drastic.<br>  <br>  Slow the in-flow from the faucet: look up your daily caloric intake requirements on a table, and make sure that the food you eat (to give you the caloric intake you need) is what your body needs for energy and sustenance - no junk food. Before you put food in your mouth, ask yourself "will this build muscle or provide energy, or do I just want it because I'm hungry and it tastes good?" There you go, now your tub is not filling as fast.<br>  <br>  Now you need to open up the drain a bit (calories out.) I think most people can do this: walk. I have found that I can drop body fat just as easily (and I really think quicker) by walking at a rapid pace instead of running. I like the treadmill for the reason that you can find the best combination of speed and incline for you, such that you break a sweat but are not "out of breath". That's the point you want to reach, your body starts to sweat to eliminate heat, and that heat comes from burning fat. If you're not sweating, you're not burning enough fat to meet your goal. Another note, the sweat needs to be from the heat your body generates from physical activity, not from wearing some kind of thermal suit. As you warm up, you may have to increase the speed/incline to keep working hard (but not too hard - you should be able to converse.) Walk at a slightly faster than normal pace for 10 minutes, then bring speed/incline up to the point of sweating, breathing hard/but not out of breath, do that for 45 minutes, then back to normal walking pace for 5 minutes to cool down.<br>  <br>  If you can't do 45 minutes at first, then adjust your speed/incline so you can do at least 20 minutes, and over time work up from there.<br>  <br>  For me, doing the treadmill every day and minimizing caloric intake, I dropped 5 lbs. the first week and over 10 months went from 29% body fat to 14%, and from 229 lbs. to 180 lbs. About 6 months into the cardio/aerobic and diet, I started strength training with weights, and went up to 192 lbs at 12% body fat. I'm in my 40's.|`|be7153f78e74d32be993910224fe6aaeaa	Quickets way to lose weight is to do more exercises and lot of walking everyday.<br>  Am sure you can lose your weight for sure..|`|QFjbbkHJaa	any form of speed. but then again you said without using those stupid "fad diets"|`|f06aacf8002deeba6f9f116a6498bea2aa	Don't target losing more than about 2 lbs per week. If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.|`|u3u9RQG3aa	Diet and exercise. A combination of both. NO CHEATING. That's the tricky part...<br>  <br>  If you want it to work, you have to do it. Low cal, low fat, eat less, you get the idea, watch what you eat. ... Meanwhile, keep active.

V0Vj564Jaa	when i had my gallstones, i had a scheduled surgery date and ended up with a severe attack about 2 weeks before. i was vomiting bile and was in severe pain. i waited for a call from my doc, who was in surgery, all day. finally it got to the point where i told my husband to load his gun, i was not kidding at the time either. anyway, finally my surgeon called back and told me to go to the ER. they ended up admitting me and giving me good pain meds and they gave me a choice to wait for the first opening to have my surgery or wait until my original surgery date, i waited until the next morning and had it done. that was the best surgery i ever had and i was out of the hospital the next day and ready to go back to work in 2 days, but they made me recover for at least a week. just not having that pain was recovery enough for me! good luck.|`|QuuLZrwSaa	Probably severe cholecystitis.

R0CUhaAtaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It is not for me to judge at what age a girl gets breast implants. But...<br>  <br>  Now to your question. <br>  <br>  1. Get them placed under the muscle. <br>  <br>  2. Depending on your height and weight, make sure you get the right size/big enough. At least 350-400 cc or you will regret having gone too small. Unless if you are super petite, like 4'11" and 95 lbs. However, for most women the proper size is somewhere between 350 and 500 cc.<br>  <br>  3. And for the last bit of important information, have the bags put in with a small cut below the nipples...for best placement of the bags and proper nipple alignment.<br>  <br>  That pretty much covers the most important points on breast implants.<br>  <br>  love.cc|`|WMOyTIgHaa	Yeah, yeah.

See here for the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans (head of the penis) dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  Most men worldwide are intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/</a><br>  <br>  There aren't any benefits.

If you want to have it done to fit in then I would have to disagree with it, But if you wanted to do it for the cleanliness of it then that would be fine. You should also ask your parents if you can why they never did it. Maybe there is a good reason behind why you were never circumcised. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|gzpaMVnqaa	Circumcision at 20 is not an enjoyable procedure. If you haven't got an actual problem with your foreskin and you keep it clean, I would advise against it. Lots of guys are uncircumsised. Be comfortable with who you are, Nothing to be ashamed of.|`|EEVx7gKeaa	Don't do it! about 98%girls don't care...and also if you are uncircumcised the head of your penis is supposedly 10 times more sensitive so it will feel better during sex.

Honestly, they feel more pleasure than circumcised men. As long as you take care of your penis and clean it well, there's no reason to be "cut" now. If a woman rejected you just because you haven't had an altered penis, then would you really want to be with her? Also, circumcision is supposed to be a lot more painful at such an old age. Just a few things to think about.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Ok this is what happened to my older brother he was the only one who wasn't circumcised.<br>   This story was told down thru the family.He was around your age actually when he got married,well in the mist of him and his wife doing the do he began to bleed really bad,I mean bad.It scared my brother so bad because he thought he had done something to his wife,needless to say it was a unwelcome event,But honey it's your body and your faith I can only say do what you think is right for you,|`|GqTSa85daa	I'm uncircumcised.  No girl has ever objected or complained, and I've been with many throughout the world.  Just clean it daily.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Actually, the practice of male circumcision is not common in most places around the world. The U.S. is unique in this practice, and it's a barbaric one. Don't get cut! An uncut penis is the way nature intended it. I refuse to allow doctors to mutilate my child's penis, if I have any sons.<br>  <br>  In regards to sex, you will lose a LOT of sensation in your penis. Sex will be far less pleasurable for you as a cut guy than if you remained uncut.
89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	People do wait a while at hospitals...alot of it is probably because people come in there with ridiculous reasons for being there. I see it on this yahoo answers thing all the time......people recommending that other people go to the ER simply because their foot hurts and their doctor isn't open or they've got a semi-high fever...just stupid stuff like that making the wait long for people who really do need to go to the hospital.<br>  <br>  You should also probably find a better doctor.

K5BLCZPkaa	Sadly, people don't stop making junk food because it is cheap, for the most part, and right now with the recession happening its all some people can afford. Also, I don't think that junk food companies would go out of business just because people are gaining weight. To most, eating fatty foods is just a choice that people have to make. You either do, or don't. McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Sonic, etc. are all thriving right now because people don't feel like making a home-cooked meal, or that was the closest thing by them, and I don't think that all of those restaurant's will close just because people are gaining weight, and becoming obese. Large companies like that don't really care about what is happening to their consumers, as long as they are receiving business. Sorry if this doesn't make sense or anything I'm  only 14 so this is just what I have to say, which isn't much.|`|8SRjELNBaa	demand... supply...|`|F8EnH6JQaa	Because the malefactors wont make any $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$|`|GqdEfuo8aa	Well, junk food makes a lot of people really happy. :) Some people just have the will power to not overdo it on the foods that are unhealthy, and eat them in moderation and just enjoy (I am not one of these people, btw. lol) The main reason though is because junk food companies make lots and lots and lots of money, and they don't care about what their product is doing to most consumers.|`|u3u9RQG3aa	Because this is the land of the free and the home of the brave.

I forgot what it the procedure was called but it was an alternative to getting a hysterectomy.  Definitely talk it over with your gynecologist.

7j9MfenOaa	It might be mono, but don't freak out.  "The Kissing Disease" isn't really necessarily a disease you get from kissing.  You can get it if someone who has it drinks from the same glass/soda can/bottle, etc...using utensils/plates after an infected person...or even being in the same close vicinity with an infected person who has it when they are coughing or sneezing.  It's also transmitted through tissues, touching an item that they have touched after coughing, or any number of ways.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me that you may just have the beginning of the flu.  A lot of kids are coming down with it here at my daughter's school.  If it doesn't go away within a few days, ask your folks to take you to the doctor.  <br>  <br>  You won't die from mono.

Although, you can catch Mono from drinking after someone who has it or from being around someone that was coughing by you that had it. It sounds to me like you have the flu.

I1knk17zaa	If an air bubble gets into a vessel in the heart and is large enough, it can keep blood from getting to a portion of the heart muscle.  When this happens,  the heart muscle begins to starve for oxygen as it is not getting any due to the air bubble blocking flow.  This starving is known as Ischemia. It often causes pain in individuals, (sometimes not)  If the blockage does not subside,  the cells in the heart that are being deprived of oxygen will eventually die.  This is infarction or "heart attack".   These heart attacks are also caused when the vessels in the heart are occluded by blood clots, fat, and cholesterol build up. Some heart attacks can also be caused by chemicals -  cocaine,  methamphetamines and can also be caused by other co-morbidities. For example, if a person is extremely anemic (not enough blood),  the low blood volume may also be a cause for a heart attack simply because there is not enough blood to deliver oxygen that the heart muscle requires.|`|AA12266052	Arterial gas embolism is a potentially catastrophic event that occurs when gas bubbles enter or form in the arterial vasculature and occlude blood flow, causing organ ischemia. Arterial gas embolism can cause CNS injury with rapid loss of consciousness, other CNS manifestations, or both; it also may affect other organs. Diagnosis is clinical and may be corroborated by imaging tests. Treatment is immediate recompression.

Do not feel guilty about the thoughts you think, only actions matter. I had a similar problem where I felt bad about certain thoughts and my therapist told me that it's a 100% OK to think whatever you want and whatever makes you feel better. You obviously haven't turned all the hostility away from yourself cause your still punishing yourself with the guilty feelings. You're guilt tripping yourself a lot and that's not a good way to go. Read your question again, maybe you'll see what I see.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|cDLjGvEuaa	With any illness but especially depression the first to be in line of attack are the ones you love the most. This is because we don't want them to see us in pain and at times out of control we basically don't want to see them hurting because of how we feel. There may also be some other underlined problem that hasn't arisen just yet. Try to involve those around you in some of your positive thoughts and by doing a few smaller activities together and excuse yourself once you start to feel aggitated and go to a quiet area to collect your thoughts or what ever. I'm sure they will understand. If the therapist did do as you say, something is very wrong as focusing hostility on other people no matter who they are has never been acceptable in any shape or form.

Don't worry about the extractions. You will be numb, you won't feel anything while they are working on you. You will be sore after, but they will give you pain meds to help you handle the aching you'll feel.<br>  Tell your parents you're having a problem and take Tylenol or Motrin as a pain reliever until you see the doctor.

Anxiety is the body’s natural response to danger, an automatic alarm that goes off when we feel threatened.<br>  <br>  Although it may be unpleasant, anxiety isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, anxiety can help us stay alert and focused, spur us to action, and motivate us to solve problems. But when anxiety is constant or overwhelming, when it interferes with your relationships and activities—that’s when you’ve crossed the line from normal anxiety into the territory of anxiety disorders.<br>  <br>  you are probably experiencing a panic attack which is somewhat different than an anxiety attack.....<br>  <br>  Panic attacks are very sudden, discrete periods of intense anxiety, mounting physiological arousal, fear, stomach problems and discomfort that are associated with a variety of somatic and cognitive symptoms.[1] The onset of these episodes is typically abrupt, and may have no obvious triggers. Although these episodes may appear random, they are a subset of an evolutionary response commonly referred to as fight or flight that occur out of context. This response floods the body with hormones, particularly epinephrine (adrenaline), that aid it in defending against harm.[2] Experiencing a panic attack is said to be one of the most intensely frightening, upsetting and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life.[2] According to the American Psychological Association the symptoms of a panic attack commonly last approximately thirty minutes. However, panic attacks can be as short as 15 seconds, while sometimes panic attacks may form a cyclic series of episodes, lasting for an extended period, sometimes hours. Often those afflicted will experience significant anticipatory anxiety and limited symptom attacks in between attacks, in situations where attacks have previously occurred.<br>  <br>  Panic attacks are commonly linked to agoraphobia and the fear of not being able to escape a bad situation. Many who experience panic attacks feel trapped and unable to free themselves.<br>  <br>  The effects of a panic attack vary from person to person. Some, notably first-time sufferers, may call for emergency services. Many who experience a panic attack, mostly for the first time, fear they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown.<br>  <br>  while both arent deathly dangerous. if it happens again you should try to calm down and see if the feeling passes....|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	I have. My chest clenches up to the point that my arms go numb. What's worse is that the first time it happened I was asleep and supposedly relaxed. I awoke and freaked that my chest hurt (I was nearly 30 and the thought of a heart attack scared me.) I found that I couldn't breathe without adding to the pain.<br>  When I went to the ER and was told that it was simply an anxiety attack I didn't believe them because it started when I was asleep. However, all the tests for my heart and other vital organs showed that I was okay and that I simply needed to concentrate and breathe slow and deep when attacks come and they'll go away. <br>  The first few times it happened after that, I panicked and hyperventilated and made it worse. My husband had to coach me into breathing properly so my chest would relax. Now when I feel one coming on I focus on breathing deeply, even if it hurts at first, and the clenching goes away quickly.<br>  They come on without warning and I may be perfectly calm when they strike, but suddenly my chest will tighten and I have to fight the fear that I am dying so I can focus on making myself better. <br>  I know it's strange that anxiety attacks can happen when one is calm, but that's the cause of a lot of false alarms that freak people out and they go to the ER complaining of heart problems.|`|Z9Df2SYqaa	the first 3 panic attacks I had, I went to the emergency room thinking I was dying.  I felt like I was for sure having a heart attack!  But, they would always check me and everything would be okay.  After the third time, I thought I must just be crazy, and that I was losing my mind.<br>  Eventually a friend showed me an article in a magazine about 'panic attacks' and that was the first time I had ever heard the term 'panic attack'.<br>  <br>  I think these days people are more familiar with panic attacks, so emergency room staff should be more knowledgeable and hopefully more helpful.  <br>  <br>  But don't feel bad if you end up going to the E.R. - panic attacks are terrifying things to deal with, and LOTS of people have gone to the E.R. because of them.<br>  <br>  Hang in there|`|cDLjGvEuaa	Yes, I took my partner in as he was absolutely certain he was dying of a heart attack. I wasn't to call an ambulance because it would take to long to get to our place, so I had to drive him then half carry him into the ER but we were lucky because they thought he was having a heart attack as well and bypassed everyone in the waiting room.

I am a sycessful executive at a major corporation and traveled the world multiple times.  Good luck to you, although it is a tough road, it is one that you can be succesful on.
QbJ04Zqiaa	Yeah, it could be a pinched nerve.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Yes because pain radiates, meaning it could be that something is wrong with your lower back, but it moves to your legs and hips because it doesn't just stay in one place.  Also, all the nerves in your body are in your back and the spinal cord is the main nerve in your body, so if there is a pain in your back it would affect the nerves in your back too.|`|weDd8uuDaa	Yes. What Trixie said. Pinched nerve, or pinched muscle. Something the likes. My hip always locks when Ive been rough on my back.
856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	When a woman/girl is on her period she has all kinds of water retention.  NOTHING GROSS ABOUT IT.  Part of being a girl.  You will notice that your fingers may be swollen and your rings are tighter, your ankles may feel bigger, and your belly will feel bloated.  Every month.  It is not uncommon to hold almost ten extra pounds during and right before your period.  Never weigh yourself right before your period.  It's always depressing.|`|m2aznd8xaa	yes it very normal to have a bloated and noticable tummy also my breasts  seem to get bigger too.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	big time.

So can substances like caffeine and certain medications such as decongestants.<br>   You might also want to have your thyroid checked.|`|qEy34ueZaa	Regardless of our best intended advice, you ought to describe it to a doctor. However, stress and anxiety are in my opinion the best candidates for your situation, described by some persons as their heart trying to jump out through their throats.<br>  You should keep a blood pressure monitor handy, the cheap type sold at CVS for about $20 (stethoscope, cuff, etc.). Learn how to use it, and check yourself when it happens, and again in between. A normal blood pressure is 130/70 (varying with age). The 130 will be the first heart beat you hear, and the 70 the last. For anxiety, slowly take really d-e-e-p breaths, and exhale slowly. For my stress, I just take a 5 to 10 minutes brakes, before readdressing whatever situation caused it.<br>  Today's lifestyles and moving pace, come at a cost!|`|2RygPGRaaa	you should get that checked out.

Yes, your chest will shrink some, but they wont be saggy.|`|zBSPaC70aa	You will probably lose a cup or so. However, your waist is bound to shrink as well, and I can say from experience that people will probably notice the smaller waist more than the smaller cup.<br>  <br>  If you are working out properly, your chest will not look saggy, but more toned - there are a lot of excercises for your chest area, and they won't shrink your breasts, like some people say - they actually make them look higher and fuller.|`|DC4Civrvaa	where you lose weight first depends on where you gain it first.  if the first place you lose weight is in your boobs, that's the first place you're going to lose it.  i personally gain weight in my thighs and butt first so when I lose weight that's exactly where it comes off.  good luck!|`|7cyqgJQnaa	As a guy i will say that even if your boobs shrink if you get a body lik that you will gain a lot more than you will lose|`|513708e4dfd3b88a9b7ce59087ef82aeaa	Personal experience... because my proportions are different from yours I can give you my personal experience, and then my advice =)<br>  <br>  Experience- I was 135 lbs and Im 5'4'', nice round butt, cute full B's, thick thighs, flat stomache. BUT I wanted to loose weight because for some reason though I do not accumulate weight in my stomache I do in my face and arms. So I lost about 10 lbs. What did I lose? My butt and my boobs. Now Im back to 133, my butt is back but its not the same roundness, my boobs are back but they feel a little saggy. And now, my stomache is bigger as well. Now that I've experienced both ends, I perfer to be toned versus 'thick'. I miss my abs, and even though my butt will be smaller I will have it firm, and to be honest i think in the long run thats more attractive any healthy for my body. <br>  <br>  My advice: Dont concentrate so much on losing weight, concentrate on toning, because you will be toning, and muscles weigh more than fat, you may feel like your staying the same weight. Reduce your fat by eating healthier, CUT SUGAR, the only sugar you should be eating is from fruits. Serisouly, all that 'NO FAT', or 'Low carbs' stuff, just ignore it, just eat healthy/smart. You cut sugar and you basically cut the fat. Burn off carbs by working out. In my opinion I think your boobs are too big aswell, I think Cs are perfection, and I dont think they will be saggy. Just dont drastically lose the weight. I lost those 10 lbs in weeks, so also got STRETCH MARKS =(. Do it gradually and be patient. If its gradual it will reduce the chance of stretchmarks and sagginess. Hope that made sense.|`|Xtuoxblfaa	Learn how to drop 10 lbs fast and easy <br>  with no exercises, pills, potions or lotions..

AA11589772	Oily skin can be a factor of genetics, diet and your face/skincare routine. As for any possible chemical imbalance that leads to oily skin, the solution is consistency. Skin is naturally sensitive and it needs a regular routine to be able to maintain itself in a healthy state. To keep your skin at its best, there are a few things you can incorporate into your daily regimen.<br>  <br>  Be sure to use a mild and oil-free cleanser. A mild cleanser will not strip your skin of natural oils. Scrubbing away every ounce of oil will not benefit you in the long run.<br>  If you strip away all the oil with harsh products, you will have even more excess oil because your body is making up for what you took away. I like neutrogena, for example.<br>  <br>  Moisturizing is an important step towards oil-free skin, believe it or not. It may sound strange, but your skin needs moisture to maintain health. Look for oil-free moisturizers.<br>  <br>  Truly it's about finding the right products for your skin, which, unfortunately, sometimes requires a bit of trial and error. But it's SO worth it! :)<br>  <br>  This little trick/tip may sound odd, but I know both women AND men who have tried this and now swear by it. You can actually use an antiperspirant on your face. If you have REALLY sensitive skin I wouldn't try it. I don't, and I only use it when I'm going out for a special occasion or when I know pictures will be taken of me. BE SURE TO USE A BRAND NEW STICK...ONE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN USED UNDER YOUR ARMS NOR WILL EVER BE USED FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR FACE. I would recommend women's antiperspirant because it's usually softer, milder and not sticky at all. I personally love Dove in the Fresh Powder scent. It's not a scent that stands out..it smells soft...and keeps the shine away all day. I would stick with the white solids and ones that do not leave a white residue behind, and not the gels for obvious reason. Also, don't use one that is heavily perfumed. Dove is perfect, I think. :) Again, I don't recommend that to be used on a regular basis. Just when you need EXTRA shine control, and only in the areas that get shiny/oily the most. And ladies, it's undetectable under liquid foundation! :)<br>  <br>  This little trick doesn't help control oily skin, but if you're out and about and your skin gets oily, you can use blotting papers to take away the shine, or when you're in a bind, you can even tear off a piece of a toilet seat cover/sanity cover. It's not gross...all it is is tissue paper, and it works exactly the same. :) <br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps!! :) And don't forget...even though oily skin is a pain in the rear now, it may keep you looking younger longer! Dry skin wrinkles quicker and easier. Someone who's skin isn't dry stays supple longer. :) Take care! And if you have any other questions, feel free to email me.|`|t9Nw86Plaa	Why? Everyone's skin is different... some people have oilier skin, some have drier skin (both are equally annoying). Also, your skin will change slightly throughout your life, and can be affected by hormones and diet. <br>  <br>  How do you get rid of it? I also have oily skin, and have tried just about everything under the sun to get rid of it. The best product I've found are the tea tree oil products from the Body Shop (I've stuck with these for years now, and my skin looks great!). They stock a lot of tea tree items, but the most important ones to get are the facial washes and toner; use these every day or two and your skin will be a lot less oily (and you'll almost never get pimples). Most of the other tea tree products they have are more spot-fixers and aren't necessary every day.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	An oily skin , as the name implies, is one in which the sebaceous or oil-producing glands are over active.

Another thing, that if nothing is wrong if you do plan on going to the doctor, maybe doctors are going to want for you to go on the b/c pill. I had a friend who had her period every day for a couple months, but it was b/c she was on the shot (birth control shot)...not sure what she did, but it was a period for a while. Good Luck!|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	This is really bad and it means that your body is sending a message that something isn't right that there is an imbalance in your system. It could be that you're anemic, have uterine fibroids, a hormonal imbalance, your iron and potassium levels may be too low. I'm not trying to scare you but my cousin ended up in the hospital for this and it turned out she was anemic and had to get blood transfusions and had to go on birth control pills for awhile so that she wouldn't get her period so that her blood count could remain stable. If she didnt end up going to the doctor sooner she could have fainted at any moment. <br>  <br>  It's very clear at this point that you need to go to your doctor or gynecologist to see what is causing your period to be going on for such a long time, more than 10 days, you shouldn't wait, its good that you realized the length of your period now sooner rather than later. A period for more than 2 weeks isn't healthy, you're only supposed to lose like a pint of blood during a normal period. Get help as soon as you can.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

All changes to brain cells go away when you return to your normal state.|`|BovpXrk1aa	no effect|`|AA11001595	You're looking at it from the wrong angle.<br>  <br>  Weed doesn't kill brain cells in the same way people say that alcohol does, but the killing of brain cells isn't really the reason why weed is dangerous.<br>  <br>  Smoking weed and the effects it has on a person's life are remarkably misunderstood by people in today's era. Weed is so much more dangerous than people currently think.<br>  <br>  People look at cigarettes and see that they can hurt in a very clear immediate way (physically can lead to cancer). Weed doesn't affect you this way. It is safer and less harmful to your lungs and body than cigarettes.<br>  <br>  People look at alcohol and see that you lose brain cells, get into driving accidents, damage your liver, say things you regret, and a list of other similar things. Weed doesn't affect you the same way at all.<br>  <br>  People look at weed and see that it stimulates different parts of your brain and allows you to be creative in ways that you hadn't been in the past.<br>  <br>  People see that so many other people smoke weed all the time; people in Hollywood make movies about it. Musicians make songs about it. They all talk about how much they love it.<br>  <br>  And yet...the government considers it to be dangerous enough to be illegal. They post commercials trying to portray people as being stupid or lazy or wasting their life to hopefully stop people from smoking. The problem is, that people have to relate very closely to those commercials for them to be effective, and they aren't hitting home for many people because they are poorly done.<br>  <br>  Here's why weed is so dangerous. It affects you in a way that is impossible to measure, and yet more harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. When you smoke weed, for a period of 24-48 hours, your brain has trouble retaining information. When you smoke weed multiple times over a week or longer, your brain has trouble retaining information for days at a time - until it is out of your system. "Retaining information" is another way of saying "learning."<br>  <br>  So here's the problem. If you take a few hits one day, you will have essentially gone the next 24 hours without learning anything complicated that was presented to you. Some straightforward things can still be learned, but the fact is that most of life's lessons are anything but simple. There are often many factors that you have to take into account when you make a given decision. It's learning things like that that your brain just can't handle when you're baked. If you smoke weed one day in your life, that's not that big of a deal. You will probably learn what you missed out on in one way or another...but think about it. YOU LEARN SO MANY INTRICATE, NEW THINGS EVERY DAY, AND THEY ALL BUILD ON EACH OTHER. I'm not talking about things that your teachers teach you in school, or things that your boss teaches you at work. I'm talking about the fact that there's a difference in maturity between a parent and a child that comes from learning things like how to handle relationship issues, and how to avoid upsetting someone by not learning how to be aware of issues a friend of yours is sensitive to, and other things along those lines. I'm talking about all the things that you instinctively aren't good at, that you have to work on getting better at. It's those things that your brain can't improve when it's affected by weed. For example, a lot of people out in the world who smoke weed regularly hit 30 years old before they learn how to not make poor financial decisions. Sure, some people who smoke weed make good financial decisions, but almost without exception, those are the people who already naturally paid attention to money. It's the people who don't have that natural tendency who would have otherwise learned by thinking about it on their own or talking it through with other people who don't end up learning till later if ever. Someone who has a natural tendency to be good with money, may have more trouble learning how to relate to the emotions of the opposite sex or something else that isn't as naturally simple to them. When you're baked, you almost never reflect on things that happened to you in the same way you do when you aren't.<br>  <br>  So back to the statement I made earlier "It affects you in a way that is impossible to measure, and yet more harmful than alcohol or cigarettes." It's impossible to measure the effects of weed because you can't take a person who has smoked weed a bunch in their life, and compare how smart they are to themselves had they never smoked. The fact is that they are likely less socially graceful in the way they interract with their peers and co-workers, less motivated to improve themselves as individuals, and they have missed out on a ton of learning that would have improved the quality of their lives, their children's lives, and the lives of everyone around them.<br>  <br>  Think about how many things there are in the world that you understand. You learn hundreds, if not thousands of things every day. If you get rid of a day, you miss out on a lot. I|`|fAKKv0ytaa	Evan B is mostly right, but it really depends on the person. Some people can stop smoking and feel nothing but for others it harder to quit, but not anywhere as bad as other drugs.

If you eat right and keep that up then you will probably lose around 5-7 lbs. if you are seriously serious about it. And when I say eat right, i don't mean eat less. You need to make sure you healthy foods, in medium amounts every 4 hrs or so. If you eat less, your metabolism will slow down and u wont see the results you are looking for.

KUIZrM0Yaa	Insomnia can be really hard to deal with and there is no quick fix. However, if you do these things every day for at least two weeks you should notice at least some improvement.<br>  1. Cut out caffeine and stimulants: coffee, cola, energy drinks, pep pills, guarana, chocolate, tea, appetite suppressants, cold tablets with pseudo ephedrine, illegal 'uppers'. People who don't sleep well often drink lots of coffee to give them energy to make up for their lack of sleep. This then makes them sleep less well, which makes them drink more coffee, which keeps them awake longer, which makes them more tired, and so on. You will feel worse without coffee for a few days, but try to stick with it. If you really can't cope without it, have one cup first thing in the morning and then no more.<br>  2. Get at least half an hour of exercise every day. It doesn't have to be a heavy workout. Just walking would be OK. Don't do it straight before going to bed.<br>  3. Don't watch TV in bed, and ideally not for half an hour or so before going to bed. It's too stimulating and keeps your mind buzzing.<br>  4. Also, don't read in bed, eat in bed or use your laptop in bed. Train your mind so that you associate going to bed with going to sleep.<br>  5. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day so that your body can develop a natural sleep/wake rhythm.<br>  6. If you can't sleep, GET UP! This is really hard to do, but it actually works. Get up, go into another room that is quiet (no TV, no music, no other people) and read something that is not too exciting for 30 minutes only. Go back to bed. If you aren't asleep in 15 minutes get up and do it again. I know it seems weird to tell someone who isn't getting enough sleep to deliberately get out of bed, but this technique worked well for me.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	Same here, but I am in my 40's.

It's all in your intestinal tract!<br>  <br>  It is very likely that you have a food intolerance -- sounds to us like celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and/or lactose intolerance.  Saturated fats can also trigger the unpleasant symptoms you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  The solution?  Try avoiding gluten for a couple of weeks and see if your symptoms improve.  Gluten is an allergenic protein found in wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt & kamut.  Your best bet is to switch to a rice-based diet and substitute your normal carbs for brown rice, gluten-free bread, corn tortillas, brown rice pasta, quinoa, buckwheat, and rice crackers.  If you do indeed feel better going gluten-free, you might consider getting tested for celiac disease.<br>  <br>  If your symptoms continue, try avoiding all dairy products for a couple of weeks to see if that helps.  Also be sure to avoid chocolate, fried food, butter, cheese, ice-cream, and any other high-fat foods that could be causing irritation.  Coffee is another irritant that can cause a good deal of pain to an already inflamed gut.<br>  <br>  To read more about food intolerances, celiac disease, and intestinal disorders, please visit:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/sept/050900celiac.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/s...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com/med_colitis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmcdougall.com/med_colitis.h...</a><br>  <br>  You can listen to Dr. McDougall talk about "leaky gut syndrome" and it's relationship to the development of autoimmune disorders at:<br>  <a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com/star.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmcdougall.com/star.html</a><br>  Scroll down to the testimonial by Phyllis Heaphy and hit the play button.

Your intestinal lining is literally being irritated, perforated and damaged by whatever it is that is ailing you and, if you have celiac, gluten is causing permanent damage to your small intestine.  There are many nutritionists focused on holistic health who can get you on hypo-allergenic & medical foods that will help to heal your intestinal tract.

Make sure he is checking his stool for black as it could be dried up blood from an ulcer. He could have irritable bowel syndrome (would explain the diarrhoea). The fact that he has had it for 3 years is really scary! He could die from this. Diarrhoea leads to dehydration because you absorb a lot of your water from what you eat (up to 90% of your food is water). It could also be Crohn's disease as well which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the gastrointestinal tract. It also depends on what type of food he is eating. Does he get a lot of fibre in his diet? I'm pretty sure it probably isn't his diet but this could be it. Or stress! I'm pretty sure his colon is going to be severely damaged and he will probably have to get an endoscopy to see what the outlook is in there. I would definately recommend going to the Doctor as this is seems very serious! I wish you both the best of luck and I hope everything turns out okay!|`|uauJyxJNaa	He MUST go to the doctor.

It dehydrates the body which can cause damage to ALL of his body's systems, it weakens the immune system, and will make him less able to recover from sickness and injury.  It could be a parasite, ulcers in his stomach or intestines, or damage to his nervous system.  Changing his diet may help the problem, but nothing will replace a qualified medical professional's care.  Please try to get him to see a doctor.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	You need to get him to the doctor ASAP!

I do not mean to make lightly of your flatulence problem as it can be embarrassing for us women, especially in a public place.<br>  <br>  How long have you had this and is it mild or severe?

Good luck.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	I'd say the main thing wrong with it would be those closes to you.  <br>  <br>  A fart consists of 5 main chemicals: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen oxygen & methane.

Live Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus which may be useful in reducing flatulence). L. acidophilus may make the intestines more acidic, thus maintaining the natural balance of fermentation processes. L. acidophilus is available in supplements (non-dairy is reputedly best). Prebiotics, which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharide, generally increase flatulence in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.<br>  <br>  Medicinal activated charcoal tablets (brand name CharcoCaps) have also been reported as effective in reducing both odor and quantity of flatus when taken immediately before food that is likely to cause flatulence later.

People who have anxiety problems or panic attacks spend a lot of time thinking about themselves and overestimate the importance of their symptoms which then gives them the attacks.  These are of her own doing so she is bringing them on herself.  She is getting attention of some sort by doing these and that is why they continue.  The more attention she gets, often the worse the attacks get.  As a friend, you might need to learn to ignore the symptoms or leave when she starts one of these attacks which then might stop the progression.

0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	Your orthodontist should have had you referred to an oral surgeon to have the wisdom teeth removed.  While the retainer is worn, the teeth will NOT erupt because the retainer will not allow them too. However, you will not wear these retainers 24/7 for the rest of your life, obviously. So at some point they are either going to fully or partially erupt and put pressure on your other teeth causing them to become crowded and out of alignment. <br>  <br>  I would have your parents address this concern with your dentist and see what they recommend.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|K34MFR6Zaa	i'm confused with your question. a retainer could straighten your teeth to possibly allow room for your wisdom teeth,but i don't see how it could prevent them from coming in.|`|xbyQAU4haa	Call your dentist!!<br>  <br>  They know the true answers!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	I assume that what you are describing to me is what is known is layman's terms as Brittle Bone Disease.  A old friend of mine had it.  She told me all about the same stuff you are saying now.  But, when I was hanging out with Michelle, she was already a Lawyer and living on her own and all that.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine the pressure you must be under trying to make these decisions at an 8th grade level.  You have all this pressure being in 8th grade and then on top of it, all the health issues.  I give you a lot of credit.<br>  <br>  So, I'm wondering, can you push the situation as long as possible?  The leg is already bending even with the rods bending right along with it.  You don't want to miss out on some stuff coming up for you.  Can you find ways to keep off the leg, like do the wheelchair thing temporarily, or use crutches, until you have to have the surgery.  Can the surgery wait until summer.  I know that's even worse because you'll be hotter in the cast and you'll miss out on hanging with your buds and all, but, if you had to weigh the options, which is better?<br>  <br>  Also, when you are isolated in the house, is there an OI website or chat you can hang in for support?<br>  <br>  I hope I helped somewhat...I'm so sorry you are going through all this right now.  And as far as the pain, I would talk to the doc about some medicine to help control the pain better especially if you are thinking about postponing the surgery for as long as possible.  You are right, at this point, your body has a very high tolerance to pain, so you are probably in more pain than you even think.  Talk to him/her and see if something can be prescribed for your age/height/weight, etc.<br>  <br>  Feel free to post more details here as I often come back to questions that I have answered to see if more has been added so I can also add more.  I'll feel like a real schmo if this is not Brittle Bone!!<br>  <br>  Also, feel free to email me anytime.  I hope I was some help on giving you some options.<br>  <br>  Take Care!<br>  <br>  *EDIT*  I'm glad you feel comfortable using the wheelchair to give your femur a break - lol... sorry, that wasn't supposed to be funny, but it was!  O.K... serious now, but the part about camp is very important especially because you can only attend two more summers and when you are there, you don't see yourself as disabled.  Man, if I could go somewhere where I didn't see myself as disabled or feel disabled, I would LOVE it!!  <br>  <br>  So, my next question for you is:  When is camp and how long is it?  Is it possible to work the surgery around camp... like when is the last day of school and when does camp start.  And even if you don't know the exact dates, thats ok - but maybe there is enough time between the end of camp and the start of 9th grade to have the surgery?  Maybe...?|`|FDj6rzl9aa	If the surgery is just to alleviate pain, then wait until after your party.  If by waiting you risk greater harm to yourself, then have the surgery as soon as possible.  The party may be something to look forward to and could be a very memorable experience, but it's not worth risking your health or well-being over.  I know it seems like a big deal at the time, but in ten years you probably will not even talk to any of the people you are friends with now.  You are at a time in your life where things start changing quickly for you socially, which may be all the more reason to go to the party as well.  I suppose it all boils down to whether waiting to have the surgery will cause you physical harm.|`|amMAThVLaa	I think you should do the surgery I know you don't want to miss out on your 8th grade dance and you don't want to be away from you friends but your health comes first. But again it's your decision.|`|Pn2Mdy34aa	Okay, I'm voting you go get the surgery. But before you judge me and say "Oh, you wouldn't know because you've never been in this position" listen to me...I've been there! I was in a car accident that nearly shattered my femur a year ago. As a matter of fact, in two days I'm getting the rods removed from my leg. Anyway...get the surgery.

I've done a lot of research into the profession, and I have a lot of inside knowledge that many others don't have (unless they are a DC).  I don't like writing a quick answer here because chiropractors are actually a pretty diverse group, so I hate to generalize them...but I will anyway.<br>  <br>  Chiropractic is based on the healing beliefs of a guy from Davenport, Iowa over 100 years ago.  He wanted to heal people, but didn't have a medical degree (sound familiar? - you'll see that combination throughout this board).  In short, he invented this profession of "adjusting" people's spine to correct misalignments that he termed "subluxations".  In his theory, correcting these subluxations would restore the flow of energy he called "innate intelligence", which would allow the body to heal itself from any illness, and he believed all illness was caused by subluxations.  His son carried on his profession and took it to a whole new level.  Chiropractic grew and eventually chiropractic schools starting popping up throughout the country.  Historically medical scientists have considered chiropractic to be another form of "quackery", and in the 70's and 80's they began speaking out about chiropractic because it had somehow become quite popular.  However, chiropractic has done well from a political and legal standpoint.  They sued the AMA for "boycotting" their profession and preventing them from being able to run a business.  They won, and now the medical profession is legally "gagged" and aren't allowed to speak out about chiropractic.  But in general, scientists have not been able to demonstrate that "subluxations" are real, nor does adjusting the spine appear to be of much benefit.  That doesn't deter would be students of chiropractic.  Most of these students don't really have a clear picture of what this profession is before they enroll in the expensive chiro school, where they are indoctrinated into the profession.  In school, they are often taught that drugs are dangerous and unhealthy, and that the only way to really treat the underlying cause of disease is to adjust the spine.  They are mislead to believe certain things about mainstream medicine, while believing that their education is equivalent to a mainstream medical doctor's.  Chiropractic schools have much lower admission standards than other graduate schools, which means the quality of practitioner can vary quite a bit when compared to other healthcare professions that only select the best and brightest.  At some point during their education students begin to form their own system of beliefs regarding chiropractic (and this can be influenced by the specific school they attended).  Some believe that adjusting the spine is the only thing necessary to cure all disease.  That group is referred to as "straights".  Other chiropractors incorporate a variety of treament methods including spinal adjustment, which means they must not truley believe in the chiropractic philosophy as much as the straights.  That group is called "mixers".  Mixers make up the largest portion of the profession, but probably aren't as "loud-mouthed" about chiropractic subluxation theory as the straights are.  The last group of chiropractors are called "reformers", and they actually do not believe in subluxation theory at all.  But they do believe that adjusting the spine can provide musculoskeletal benefits to patients who are in pain, etc.  Reformers are downright hated by the rest of the chiropractic community, and are looked at as traitors.  In addition, reformers have fewer patient visits because they don't require their patients to come back 3 times a week forever.  This means it is much more difficult for reformers to earn a living.  The financial stresses put on chiropractors is enough to cause many of them to adhere to the philosophy as a way to recommend additional treatments.  Not to mention that there are legal implications regarding subluxation theory.  It is this theory that defines the profession.  Other healthcare providers can adjust your spine.  So chiro's need this philosophy as a way to justifiy their existence.  Without it, they would be providing a service that can be provided by other existing professions.  So there are many reasons that chiros will keep their mouth shut even if they don't believe in subluxations.  This makes it difficult to estimate the exact number of "reformers".  I would also say that the chiropractic community is trying really hard to become "mainstream".  Doing so would likely increase their patient flow, and possibly silence some of the nay-sayers.  But in order to do this, most of them do not use the magical terminology of "innate intelligence" anymore.  Instead they make it sound scientific by saying that nerves innervate every organ in the body and if they are inpinged upon, it can cause the body not to function optimally.  This sounds scientific, but the theory that the spine is impinging upon ou|`|2Yw1zCZfaa	quackery. <br>  <br>  chiropractic deals with "healing" things called subluxations of the vertebral column. no chiropractor has ever been able to identify these on an x-ray. <br>  also, they say that ALL illnesses are caused by these imaginary problems. <br>  <br>  what bs.

Exercise till u get exhausted before sleeping.<br>  2. Only sleep once per day (at night).|`|ParFJxnSaa	There is no true decaf tea; and only 1 completely decaffeinated coffee: Folgers; all the rest have some caffeine; enough to affect sleep adversely. Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of  warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to master, (Progressive Muscular Relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day. An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, saying to yourself: "Even though I sometimes have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. <br>  <br>  Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm</a>  The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective. Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.<br>  <br>  Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea.  I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, in section 3, on page A, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. Get strong light, preferably sunlight (even if overcast) soon after waking in the morning, to reset your circadian rhythm. Your bedroom should very dark, after lights out, and a good sleeping temperature is 70 F, or 19 C. No daytime napping. Have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3.
j6kyAhQOaa	I think it's ok. You sound pretty clear-headed and responsible for 14, you're planning to be on it "just in case" so that you know you'll be prepared! That's awesome!<br>  <br>  If you have problematic periods, that would be the angle I'd emphasize with the mother, but she might still freak out at the thought of her "baby girl" having sex! Haha, that is pretty normal, though. I went on the pill by going to a walk-in clinic and telling the doctor I was going to have sex and wanted to be on the pill first. There was no "wait til you're older" discussion, nor should there be. Doctors are there to deal with your health.<br>  <br>  Regarding the boyfriend, men are ever hopeful. Especially young men! I would have a clear discussion to tell him why you are doing it (for you) and that when you're ready to have sex, you promise you'll let him know!|`|6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	A doctor will probably be reluctant to prescribe BC to you unless you have some SERIOUS period problems, because you are still young and adjusting to your hormones. Talking to your doctor about why you want it wouldn't be a bad thing though. You can get your questions answered. Just be prepared for them to say, "wait a year or two."|`|AA10363258	Even if you aren't planning on sex right away, it should reassure your mom that you won't end up with an unwanted pregnancy.

Most birth control pills are psuedoestrogens and or psuedoprogestrones.  Some are low dose, which is better, but neither should be used if you are not sexually active, or have some other complication.  If you really want clearer skin, be as physically active as you can, eat and drink organic products and make sure your diet is full of nutrients--no empty calories, tons of veggies, moderate fruits, moderate proteins, minimal whole grains--no processed, refined, otherwise tampered with foods.  Occasional cheats are ok, but keep them to a minimum.  No fake sweeteners either!  They actually make you fat.

Don't believe the crap that those "pro-life" groups say.|`|EgRt4LMfaa	no i dont---if its dirty in there leave asap. they give u a pill b4 the procedure-if its dirty or un safe go to e.r. asap. its those who stay in a trash hole that get infections and have un safe sex after.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	No, that is definitely not a reliable source for un bias information about fatal abortions.  Especially because the slogan on the bottom of the page reads "Abortion is the un-choice. Unwanted. Unsafe. Unfair."  They are obviously going to provide information strongly siding to pro life views.  <br>  As the answerer before me stated, abortion is a very safe procedure.  Of course there are risks because it is a medical procedure, but still it is very safe.  <br>  Look here instead, <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/safety.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/sa...</a>

57j6hSjNaa	Usually when someone is getting blood checked it's for a specific reason. They will purposely find out if a certain disease is negative or positive in the blood...<br>  <br>  HIV is such a serious disease that his doctor may want to check for the virus just to make sure there's nothing detrimental affecting his health in addition to his existing condition (heart murmur).. <br>  <br>  But I would specially ask him what STD's did he get tested for.. Sometimes people will get checked for HIV and not for diseases like chlamydia, syphilis & gonnorhea and vise versa..|`|o2n7XEY4aa	IF they are looking for it, yes.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	it wouldnt show up unless they were testing for stds and stuff|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Diagnosis of HIV can not be done by any test except an HIV test.  HIV testing is never automatically included with other blood testing.

AA12266052	Vaginal yeast infection suspected.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	It could be something as simple as a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis, both treatable.  They need to be diagnosed by your doc though, because they require different treatments.  You can have either of those without any unusual discharge, and burning and itching is common.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	You should have been screened for yeast infection a long time ago. Yeast will cause plenty of itching and mild irritations for women. They can give you Diflucan or some other anti-fungal medication to resolve this. <br>  <br>  I'm surprised the doctor didn't tell you this during your prior STD screening. Trich and bacterial vaginosis can cause a fishy odor and some discharge too so you may want to get checked for those also.|`|57j6hSjNaa	If you received a full physical and the results came out negative, then I would assume you have either a mild yeast infection or VB (vaginal bacteria).. <br>  <br>  Neither are STD's, though VB is considered one, but they are both easily treatable... So go back to the doctor and get checked specially for those conditions..<br>  <br>  The medications are easy to take and the itching and burning will go away within 3-7 days..|`|kT4kibqnaa	That sounds icky. Ewwww.<br>  <br>  I think maybe you should stop having sex with gross guys.

0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	Having the root canal done will not hurt, you will be numb. The dentist will clean out the canals, removing the nerve.  You will likely be a little sore from that, but shouldn't be in excruciating pain. By removing the nerve, the tooth should not have any pain. If there is infection in the tooth, you will be prescribed an antibiotic and they might prescribe you some pain medication to get you through the next few days. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you take some kind of pain reliever before the appointment so that it takes effect when the local anesthetic wears off from the procedure.<br>  <br>  Good luck tomorrow, and don't be nervous :)|`|a1pmr73vaa	hell I rather live thru the pain then get it..I'm just allegic to the dentist smell and I start to freak out..but your strong just..go to ER and ask you need viocadin or something freaking strong..I had that for a few weeks until they figured I was abusing it and I was not..I'm still in pain and I take sometimes up to 900 Ibuprofen.|`|50ElW7c0aa	There is no pain during, because they numb you. When it wears off its just going to depend on your pain tolerance. Its really not THAT bad. Its more of a deep throbbing pain, afterwards its not a sharp pain.

Y4ogWjHOaa	hi Carebear,<br>  <br>  I think I know what you are not saying (if you see what i mean)<br>  <br>  What you need to do is bandage your  left elbow, including above and below. That way there is no way that your partner will be able to get the stethoscope onto the brachial pulse.<br>  <br>  Have a word with your teacher before class and explain that you fell  and hurt your elbow so could your partner record your blood pressure on your right arm as long as he/she explains the reason for not doing it on the left. <br>  <br>  There are often reasons why it is not possible to record a BP on a patient's left arm and then it has to be done on the right.It could happen in real life so your teacher should accept that. As long as your partner tells the teacher that normally he/she would take it on the left because........etc: But in this case that is not an option so he/she is having to do it on the right. As long as the teacher knows that he/she knows that, it should not alter the marks.<br>  <br>  It might look more realistic if you bandaged your left knee as well actually!! <br>  <br>  Good luck and remember not to forget and use your left arm to lift something heavy, because that will give the game away completely!<br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Love mel.X|`|cNwOuLuGaa	Just say "I'd prefer to use this arm." If she asks why just tell her it's a personal matter and you don't want to talk about it.  <br>  <br>  I'm assuming you don't want to show your scars.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Surgery, Blood Donation <br>  <br>  You can talk to your teacher privately before class??
eoL9PxPiaa	Yes you should always go to a gyno once a year, its the best way to prevent cervical cancer and other problems. I also encourage you to try other birth control, condoms can break very easy and will put you at risk for contracting STDS or becoming pregnant.|`|idx3y0Azaa	you should go see a doctor anyway to get a PAP-smear and just regular check up. Its good to know your fine. I am sure you are but just double check so nothing comes up later. Once you start having sex again,  make sure you use protection. Take care and have fun!|`|jb9guNo3aa	It's always a good idea to go to the gyno after having sex for the first time. You should go annually, really. They'll take a few swabs, make sure everything's normal, all that good stuff.|`|Yek5D2Chaa	well it be a good thing to go. jst to be on the safe side and make sure everything is ok. besides you should be going for routine annual check up anyway.|`|kMesQjEDaa	yes I think you should go I'm barleyy going for mine, the reason being I was to embracedd to go but u know its better knowing than finding out to late when nothing can be done|`|vvB0Etysaa	Depends how old you are.<br>  Women should have a pap test once a year.<br>  Not because of sex but because of cancer.|`|AA10363258	it's a smart idea, but you don't have to.

Steak is best.<br>  2)  Work out.  Doesn't matter what you do.  Lift, run, just stimulate you muscles.<br>  3)  Get plenty of sleep.  For some reason you only while you're asleep.  Don't ask me why, but that's a fact.  People who go to bed early and get 8 or 9 hours of sleep every night will grow much more than someone who stays up late.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those are the three things you need to do.  Stick to those, and not only will you grow taller, you'll add several years to your life.  Good luck!|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	Eat right, no empty calories, organics, balanced diet--tons of veggies, moderate fruits, proteins and minimal whole grains.  Nothing processed or refined and no artificial sweeteners.  No drugs or smoking or drinking.  Stay active and get adequate rest.  The rest you will have to leave up to genetics.|`|513708e4dfd3b88a9b7ce59087ef82aeaa	Avoid cracking your back, always sit upstraight. This will reduce the chances of developing scoliosis which curves your back, making you shorter. Sitting up straight will help as well because it straightens out your back. Also, drink milk. Drinking milk helps build strong bones. And becuase of the way we manufacture our milk, it contains steroids, which also might help.|`|TbM4K6Ytaa	lol break your legs and get them stretched like they apparently do in china. oh wait... thats not the natural way lol.|`|OyRX3OxLaa	Your growth rate is determined by a hormone called the human Growth Hormone (hGH), which is secreted in the pituitary gland, in the brain. The rate at which this hormone is released depends almost entirely on your genetic makeup, hence you are likely to be about as tall as your parents are. Other than taking intravenous does of such synthetic hGH (which i strongly not recommend), there is really no other way to increase growth. So just let yourself grow and who knows, you'll probably catch up with people of your age later in life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Note: Milk has nothing to do with body growth and height. It does increase the concentration of calcium in bones and makes them more resistant to injury or damage, but in no way it does stimulate the production of hGH.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	Everyone's different so really you need to find ways that you yourself can become taller.. always eat healthy and exercise.. <br>  Basketball helped me grow much taller in a very short time. It all depends :)|`|DuGAysygaa	Drink less coke, coffee and anything with caffeine in it if you smoke try cutting down and quitting.|`|PtyXfg5Aaa	Milk and basketball|`|hJ5lQXehaa	You don't. You'll be stuck a midget the rest of your life.|`|1IrVn1Dlaa	Having a good balance diet and lots of milk :D|`|VZFEB85Iaa	stretch|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	Honestly its mostly in your genetic make up and theres no controlling that. You can drink as much milk as you want, but you're not going to grow any taller just from that. Just remember that girls don't stop growing till they are about 17 for the most part, so you still have sometime to get taller. Being tall isn't all its cracked up to be anyways, be happy with how you were made and who you are! Your height isn't the most important aspect of who you are. Its all about who you are as a person on the inside, that's what truly matters.|`|HetjZkdmaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

Altogether, marijuana is good for fun but not good for bad emotional stress.|`|D9ebNFOZaa	I have smoked weed before but I choose not to do it anymore. Even though I still drink, I think marijuana is way healthier than alcohol. Ive driven while I was high and the only problem was I forgot where I was.

The color may not be bright red at first it could be brown and then end up a really bright red as your period progresses.<br>  <br>  I recommend for your first period start using pads and then if you feel comfortable you can try using tampons and also you may want to carry a pad in your backpack when you go to school just in case your first period were to happen at school its a way to avoid a potentially embarrasing moment and also because your other periods after that will be irregular and hard to predict when they are due. <br>  <br>  So make sure depending on where you are tell your mom or a go to the school nurse and she will help you. Stay calm and don't panic.<br>  <br>  Also when I got my first period I was at home and I just told my mom and I didnt feel any cramps really until the next day and as it progressed it went from being light to heavy. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. By the way don't rush it, you will get your period when the time is right, enjoy the time you have without it. =)|`|d9g5lqJfaa	Everyone has different symptoms. <br>  Some girls will have cramps and/or mood swings, while others might have no signs.<br>  I recomend using pads for a couple months before moving on to tampons. <br>  And make sure you tell your mom or any other female you trust and are comfortable with so they can show you how to use the pads/tampons correctly.<br>  Good luck =]|`|6c4eacbc33273c871bc7185d6f301bc7aa	Every girl is different, but you might have slight cramping before you start. When you do it will most likely be light, but it will change as time goes on. When you do, you should find someone close to you that can show how to use pads and eventually tampons. Maybe a sister, mom, aunt, or an older friend. There is also a web site that you might find useful, www.beinggirl.com. Hope this helps!|`|xMT9XTT6aa	Honey, don't be afraid to ask. I was terrified to get my period but it's seriously not a big deal. You probably will get some cramping, I sometimes get a headache prior. When you actually get it, it may be light and just look brown and streaky.  If it's heavier, you might feel a "trickling" sensation inside your vagina which can be a little strange when you're not used to it. You also might get some clotting but that's completely normal. It's gross but you'll get used to it quickly. <br>  <br>  The most important things to remember are: don't be afraid to ask questions and don't panic.|`|auVg3SbDaa	Try the website: <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/</a><br>  It's from a very well known pediatric program and will give you accurate information from a doctor.

The page on periods is <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/menstrual4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/menstru...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  PS- These are also questions that you may want to ask your mother or doctor. It helps to have someone there on a day to day basis that you can ask questions from instead of just reading it on a website by yourself.|`|mbB1DK3Taa	Some girls will have clearer symptoms than others. When I got my first period I didn't feel a thing and it only hit me when I saw it all over my undies. But judging from what you've wrote, you might feel some slight cramps lower than your stomach. You might even feel as if something just came out of ur vagina (which is true) =P.<br>  <br>  if your symptoms become a lot more distinct, just wear darker coloured pants and carry a pad around you just in case and you should be alright! =)|`|mBzAETAXaa	everyone is different.<br>  you may feel cramps or feel sick.<br>  the night before i got mine i went to the toilet and wiped down there and a tiny bit of blood was on the paper. other wise you will just get it!|`|942b1225d34c3dd5b8a9cd21a08c4c2daa	Dont freak out (:<br>  its a part of life (:<br>  you will have dishcharge. and cramps sometimes. and when the time comes partial brown
h8l1H4N4aa	Ibuprofen and moist heat (dampen a towel and microwave for a minute or two.)<br>  If you don't want to do that, then a regular heating pad will do.|`|ZDFP11leaa	Try applying heat to the area or applying some analgesic cream. Good luck!|`|Nm1nMVrAaa	If you just need to get rid of it fast for a short period of time use a heat pack. The pain will temporarily subside and you will be able to move it without much problem. However, after the heat therapy wears off your neck will become more stiff than before and will probably hurt more than before. But, if you use ice than the stiffness will not go away as quickly but it will go away after approximately 3 days and will not return.<br>  <br>  Use tylenol to reduce the pain for the first 72 hours after injury. Ibuprofen will make the pain go away but may cause the swelling to increase within the first 72 hours post-injury.<br>  <br>  (All of this is under the assumption you simply have an overuse injury or a "crick" in your neck and not a serious injury to your neck (for example: bulging disk)
sKfDUAcvaa	I would recommend a maximum of once a week. No, marijuana does not have any adverse health effects. Although it does cause you to be lazy and can be psychologically addictive.|`|mAp90hEeaa	It is not OK.  Marijuana puts more tar into your lungs than a dozen cigarettes which sets you up for long-term health problems in the future.

x1gtaqwVaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  ok so, if you don't take care of yourself and let your sugars run high it will really take a toll on your body and cause great damage to your kidneys.  when your blood sugar is high the sugar molecules get stuck in your kidneys negatively affecting the kidneys ability to filter the blood.  <br>  <br>  because of the damage that the elevated blood sugar does to the kidneys, diabetes is the #1 reason for kidney failure, as well as blindness, and foot and leg amputations.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :]|`|eGW4X9pgaa	ok, it is "does" not "dose" ...<br>  <br>  when you have diabetes, your blood sugar is high ...  the kidneys are a filter ...  you basically wear them out by not watching what you eat, etc. and they work overtime filtering sugar out of the blood...<br>  <br>  centuries ago they could diagnose it by tasting the urine (it's sterile) ...  it would taste more like honey because of the high level of sugar from filtering it out of the blood stream  ...|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Why diabetes can cause kidney disease (nephropathy)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When our bodies digest the protein we eat, the process creates waste products. In the kidneys, millions of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) with even tinier holes in them act as filters. As blood flows through the blood vessels, small molecules such as waste products squeeze through the holes. These waste products become part of the urine. Useful substances, such as protein and red blood cells, are too big to pass through the holes in the filter and stay in the blood.<br>  <br>  Diabetes can damage this system. High levels of blood sugar make the kidneys filter too much blood. All this extra work is hard on the filters. After many years, they start to leak. Useful protein is lost in the urine. Having small amounts of protein in the urine is called microalbuminuria. When kidney disease is diagnosed early, (during microalbuminuria), several treatments may keep kidney disease from getting worse. Having larger amounts is called macroalbuminuria. When kidney disease is caught later (during macroalbuminuria), end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, usually follows.<br>  <br>  In time, the stress of overwork causes the kidneys to lose their filtering ability. Waste products then start to build up in the blood. <br>  <br>  Finally, the kidneys fail. This failure, ESRD, is very serious. A person with ESRD needs to have a kidney transplant or to have the blood filtered by machine (dialysis).<br>  <br>  Who gets kidney disease?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Not everyone with diabetes develops kidney disease. Factors that can influence kidney disease development include genetics, blood sugar control, and blood pressure.<br>  <br>  The better a person keeps diabetes and blood pressure under control, the lower the chance of getting kidney disease>
v84od8vraa	Go for the clear, they are more presentable and seem to better fit you. Definately not the metaly ones! Goodluck!|`|Zuqyx4tJaa	the clear are a good option, but it's easy to forget to put in and even easier to loose. metal braces don't require as much care and can be colorful, but also annoying and probably more painful. pick whichever you would want to take care of in the long run.|`|5GcmU8gNaa	Clear looks better but it will stain so go with mettal.

Clear are more expensive, but I would definitely get them at least on the top. They're a lot less noticeable than metal, and no people wont double take. Nobody even noticed I had them until I showed them the wire on top and the metal ones on the bottom. They're also a lot less scratchy than the metal brackets, so you don't feel them as much.|`|54d87ada5cbd610e99a576802ad52e06aa	Wow first I have to say you are really pretty and I say you go with the metal.

rcPnnfmmaa	1. It's a performance enhancer sold on the internet with a superfluous X in it's name.<br>  <br>  2. Human growth hormone is weird stuff. You may grow breasts. Small ones, but they'll be there. It will also change the shape of your face slightly and increases your risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.<br>  <br>  3. Human growth hormone does not come in pill form. It's a lot like insulin and other important signaling compounds; it's not designed to be that stable in or out of your body. Actual HGH is an injectable drug. So the good news is you won't grow breasts from this product but you won't grow muscles either.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Creatine is the least harmful of all available performance enhancers. It's considered cheating but it does not have the capacity to alter other body systems like many of the others.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd be happy with protein shakes. Or even a nice rare steak.
0bYcYz2jaa	Give it a chance to heal some more.  It may just be irritated from the damage and you using your hands.  If you would feel better about it, visit YOUR doctor.  Sometimes, health centers and clinics can be understaffed and very short on patience and time and may blow you off if they can.  As for scarring, I don't believe that.  I had surgery on my wrist 15 years ago and the scar is still there and pretty obvious.  Using a lotion specifically to heal scars or damaged skin can help, I just didn't know that when I was 12.  Count on having a scar.  Visit your doctor to set your mind at ease or, worst case scenario, fix what might be wrong.<br>  <br>  The itchy, some of the puffy, and even some of the discoloration can be normal.  Your skin may be bruised and healing in the wound area.  The fact that you are worried is something that only a trusted doctor can fix.|`|rq9aLqTnaa	may be some sort of infection .consult the doctor who put the stiches

ad9AssJZaa	Realistically, there IS ALWAYS a chance of those serious things happening to you no matter what. You don't smoke that much, and don't plan on being on the pill for a long time, so your chances are very very slim, but I have heard of these things happening to healthy young women who do not smoke(blood clot, stroke) with no family history or known condition. Long term? Probably not much, I wouldn't really worry about it, but realistically, there is always a chance, no matter how small. If it happened that often, these pills would be taken off the market, so I would say most women are safe.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Different people react differently to the Pill; that's why the packet lists so many possible scenarios.  You should visit the doctor regularly to be sure you're doing OK.<br>  <br>  Oh, and there's safer options than a hysterectomy if you want permanent contraception.  The hyster is a barbaric procedure that should only be done if someone has cancer or some other serious condition that cannot be treated any other way.
F81T9hhxaa	try drinking prune juice (lots of it).|`|n8EcCVfWaa	eat fruits and yogurt. drink apple juice. <br>  they have these vitamins out there that aren't perscription and they seem to do the trick. Try Trader Joes. That place is amazing. <br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Activia? Maybe you should try that stuff.|`|d8C5qtS5aa	Water! Hopefully you're drinking it, but your intestines need water to move wastes. I'm not talking about dehydration, just lubrication (which also sounds gross...)<br>  <br>  But yeah, changing diet can help too. Lots of fruits and veggies. Produce has a thing called cellulose (aka: fiber) which we can't digest so we turn it into waste.

qfSKgxDsaa	Okay, well get some underpants that have absorbancy in them like "depend" underpants, so it doesn't leak on your sheets and so you dont have to wash all the time and the smell is pretty contained and you can take it off then put it in a bad tie it up and take it to the trash outside and that should do wonders.  Do this while you are trying to train yourself.  Don't drink liquids past like 7 o'clock, if you do just take like a tiny little sip.  I know this may be embarrasing for you but you probably should talk to your doctor and see what he/she thinks, like maybe some more tips, and or a medicine if you cant get it under control by yourself.  I'd try to do it without medication first though.  Just to tell you I was like 12 or 13 too before I stopped, so don't feel bad.  There are things to help and stop it.  You may want to google help stop bed wetting and they probably have some good tips.  And then also say over and over before you go to bed "I wont wet the bed" go to the bathroom right before you go to the bed and ANY time you wake up even if you don't "feel" like you need to go at that specific time because chances are you'll need to go soon anyway.  If your parents stay up late have them wake you up to go every so often maybe too...just some suggestions good luck|`|UgZq1pXjaa	Wear a diaper to bed, will save on your water bill and stop the smell of your mattress.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	Hypnosis.|`|R0M1WCmZaa	wow! you should go to doctor and they will help you..........<br>  <br>  <br>  there's good website for you..<br>  <br>  teengrowth.com|`|0qfT1eNfaa	Have you seen a Doctor about this?

I got a book about sexual abuse & read it. It mentioned that bed wetting was a symptom of sexual abuse. The bedwetting stopped that very night, and I have only wet the bed 3 or 4 times since then (I am 44 now) and all those times, I had somehow confronted the abuser earlier that day.  I think this story is freaky - it was freaky when it happened, and now I always wonder if a physical problem I develop is really from an emotional problem (eg joint pain, headache, stomach ache, etc).<br>  <br>  It is often a psychological problem, but there are physical causes too, so you need to see a doc about that.  Avoid caffeine - it makes it more likely you will wet. don't drink anything for about 2 hours before bed.

uqj6BMAGaa	any sort of lifestyle change will be helpful to you in many ways. I would recommend a more realistic goal for your weight loss though. At 5' 7'', you'd look anorexic at 110. Shoot for being toned and tight, not necessarily skinny. I think 125 would be a good starter goal. After that, if you think you want to lose more, by all means, do what makes you happy. At least with a 50lb weight loss goal, it won't be too unrealistic. My brother lost 50lbs over a few months from riding his bike everywhere. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!
VWAq8KDzaa	I had the same problem several months ago.  The tip of my finger (on the side) swelled up and got red.  I knew it was an infection but I never knew what caused it.  Maybe an ingrown nail?  And, although it was uncomfortable, it never hurt.<br>  <br>  I just happened to have a doctors appointment a couple of days later and showed it to him.  He gave me a prescription for an antibiotic and had me soak my finger in hot water as often as I could in order to draw the infection out.  Two days later, the pus pocket broke and drained and I've had no problem since.<br>  <br>  So, my advise to you is, if you won't see your doctor, is to soak your finger as often as you can in water that is as hot as you can stand.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Sounds like an infection.  You should probably go to a doctor.  For now, put antibiotic ointment on the wound and put on a band aid for a few hours a day.  Your wound needs air too, so don't forget to take the band aids off every so often.  I get small infections in my fingers from hangnails and the antibiotic ointment usually clears it right up in a day or so, but it depends on how deep and serious the infection is.|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Your finger is infected,although its a bit late make sure you clean the wound and see a doctor.If you cannot afford a doctor just cut your finger off.|`|mAp90hEeaa	You probably can't fix this yourself.  It is probably going to need an antibiotic from your doctor.  You can try putting bacitracin over the area where the pus comes out but the infection is probably already established.  And, squeezing it drives the current infection deeper into the tissues so you need to stop doing this.|`|6YnwXCIaaa	Pus = infection.  It sounds like you have some sort of abscess or infected area of skin.  If it's small, you might try some polysporin, but you might be better off having a doctor see this, especially if it's the whole finger that's red and swollen.  Some skin infections require you to take oral antibiotics.|`|sBpMpfTxaa	sounds like an infection. get it checked or take some antibiotics.|`|qtEx22c7aa	Pus = infection.did you bite your nails because that's what i do and sometime i get puss and it gets swollen just stick your finger in hot water every day and squeeze all the puss out of your finger it should be fine after a week max!!|`|rq9aLqTnaa	you got to see a doctor who can flush out pus from ur wound.no cre till the pus is flushed out

29yMjFInaa	Is it a sharp pain or more of a pressure pain. Usually a sharp pain is due to gastrointestinal problems (not to embarrass you, but gas is the most common). If it is a dull, more pressure pain then you should see a doctor because that is usually due to heart problems and any heart problems can be extremely serious. If it's sharp pain then try taking peptobismal, tums or even gas-x. If it's dull, the see your doctor or go to the ER immediately!|`|wfWAlztVaa	i would go to a doctor immediatley<br>  you may be reacting to something you've been around<br>  or it could be something more serious<br>  but breathing problems should never be taken lightely!|`|7YeGJHQqaa	You know my sister has that same problem at times and she's only 17!!! It could be due to stress. Try and take notice of what's going on when this happens, like are you stressed out, anxious, angry, ect. Too much stress can be a bad thing, so check with your doc to find out what's really going on.

UOZP4Ma5aa	Dentistry is the known evaluation, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions of the oral cavity, maxillofacial area and the adjacent and associated structures and their impact on the human body. Dentistry is widely considered necessary for complete oral health.[1] Those in the practice of dentistry are known as dentists. Other people aiding in oral health service include dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and dental therapists.<br>  <br>  Dentistry is that branch of science which deals with the study and practice of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases of the mouth, the maxilla, and the face.|`|wlxuCXSzaa	dentistry isn't simple.

xmibEEdcaa	Is your prescription really for *two* 500mg every four hours?  Because that's an awful lot of Tylenol to be taking at one time.  In fact, it's the maximum dosage: 1000 mg at one time, 4000mg within a 24 hour period. <br>  <br>  That's the part you have to worry about: the Tylenol.  Switching from pills to syrup shouldn't be a problem, but the amount of Tylenol you're ingesting could be.  <br>  <br>  If you really need that much hydrocodone, then I'd recommend getting a new prescription, because you're already maxing out your Tylenol levels, and it is terrible for your liver. Very dangerous.  <br>  <br>  And how much hydrocodone is in these pills?  Are we talking 7.5 each here? Because that's a hefty amount of hydrocodone too, especially if you're not acclimated to it.<br>  <br>  If you don't actually have a prescription for these meds, then...well, you know what I'm going to say, right?  You know that you shouldn't really be doing that.  But the advice still stands. Watch that Tylenol.  No more than 1000mg at once, and no more than 4000mg a day; and ideally, not even that much.  And careful with those high doses of hydrocodone, too.  Unless you're on a doctor's orders or have worked up to these levels of hydrocodone over time, I wouldn't advise taking any more at all, to be honest with you.  At least wait another four hours to do it.  Sheesh.<br>  <br>  But moving from the pills to the syrup?  Yeah, that part's fine.|`|2PGvedOcaa	Are you trying to commit suicide?  <br>  Where are your parents????|`|DNk5AtQbaa	for me, i think natural medicines ie kratocet/kratom are proven to be safer than opiate medications for people...they are proven to not be causing addiction like hydrocodone etc|`|t5NPC5EDaa	who actually understands that?|`|z3Fc7tPJaa	i have done it plenty of times over with more than that. but everyone is different!|`|P6VPZxiXaa	That's a lot of codeine.

aYgj4cIBaa	I know that the pamphlet that comes with that kit mentions a "clean" diet while you are taking the cleanse. Basically-lots & lots of water, low sugar, whole grains, lean protein(including greens & legumes if you don't eat meat), fruits & vegetables. The less processed the better. Generally speaking, unless you're eating edamame, soy is processed to make it into tofu or "meat" etc. So I would definitely limit if not completely eliminate the soy while you're doing the cleanse. Hope that helps!|`|yazZH4khaa	I am no nutritionist, but I do read a lot about health. I would stay away from any milk products and drink OJ and other fruit juices. Soy products may stick in your liver, so that could hamper what you are trying to do.
NVxGp317aa	A general doctor could take care of it but without insurance is going to want money upfront. You could go the an er or if there is a urgent aid or walk in clinic in your area I would try there. Most hospitals or urgent aids will work with ya as far as payment goes. If there is a clinis in your area sometimes they base fees on income. <br>  Good luck!<br>  And don't let someone talk you into trying to drain yourself after its drained they usually need to be packed so that they do not come back also they can be easily infected so please please go to a  medical professional.

Do some research on the numbers of people who have the herpes virus, both type 1 and type 2.  It's a huge number of people.  I know it's not ideal that he has it, but you weren't involved with him at the time, so it's not like he got it while cheating on you.  <br>  <br>  How often is he having outbreaks?  You do know that it can be transmitted even while there is no outbreak, right?  If you're going to be with him chances are you're going to get it, unless you use a condom ALL the time.  There are oral medications he can take to help prevent giving it to you, also.<br>  <br>  Only you can answer as to how important this is to you.  But remember, MANY people have this.  It's not life threatening (although you should make sure you are both clean of ALL STI's).  Personally, I wouldn't let this thing stand between me and the person who I love dearly.  It's something many people live with all the time.

If you experience recurring yeast infections dont ignore it as it may lead to chronic yeast infection.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  Almost every woman has to deal with a yeast infection at least once in their lifetime. But for some of us it can be more of chronic re-occurring phenomenon. For those of us who have an ongoing battle with this yeast, we need to come up with some powerful ways to combat it so that it doesn't affect our lives. So how can we go about treating these yeast infections quickly and easily at home so that we can move on with our day?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thenaturalcureyeastinfection.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thenaturalcureyeastinfection.blog...</a> <br>  <br>  Well, out of all the yeast infection home remedies out there, one method that is quite potent is the use of tea tree oil. Tea tree oh has been used as an herbal remedy for many, many years. Just head on over to the local supplement store and pick yourself up a small bottle of this oil. Now once you have the bottle, pick up some tampons and olive oil as well. Why the olive oil? Well, what you're going to have to do is coat half of the tampon with the olive oil. This will act as a base, then you're going to put a couple of drops of the tea tree oil on top of the olive oil.<br>  <br>  Once you have this done you will then insert this vaginally and leave it in for a good 30 to 45 minutes, and to allow the tea tree oil to sink in and take effect. Without the olive oil to act as a base, you would lose some of the tea tree oil since it would get absorbed into the tampon itself. Keep this up for at least 1 1/2 to 2 weeks, and you should be able to clear up your yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Now keep in mind that while this may be one of the better treatments out of all other yeast infection home remedies out there, this won't kill off the yeast spores. This is why you will continue to get yeast infections recurring over and over again. To kill these off, you'll need to look into something a little more powerful.<br>  <br>  Do you want secret Yeast Infection Home Remedy?<br>  Visit to<br>  <a href="http://thenaturalcureyeastinfection.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thenaturalcureyeastinfection.blog...</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Never haerd of that one before.

As was mentioned before, visualizing is the key. Pretend you are sitting on the banks of a river. Look at the river....it's going super fast, right? the river's filled with all these thoughts that are going a million miles a minute. Just take slow, deep breaths a watch the river. You are not involved in anything going on in the river, you are just looking at it from a distance. Acknowledge the these thoughts and feelings, but don't become involved in them. Just watch them on the river passing in front of you and then leaving you...going down the river. Keep doing deep breathing as your doing this. Works for me! Hope this helps.|`|5V8yqwdWaa	Try to focus on visualizing something in your mind.

They typically contain diphenhydramine, a common antihistamine (found in Benadryl), which makes people drowsy and ought to help you sleep.

I had pretty much learned to live with it, and sometimes different positions helped (but not all that often).  I ended up having the problem a lot less after the birth of my daughter because the doctor had to cut me there to let her pass anyway, and asked me if I wanted her to only bring the stitches in so far and fix the problem.  I agreed.  I still had problems here and there with my last partner, but they were a lot less severe.  Being cut isn't a big deal, really.  I didn't even feel it.  And it made things a lot more comfortable for me.

But however like yourself, I feel like the bigger problems he isn't. <br>  <br>  I have tried so so so many things to do other than self harm and sometimes they work. Some ideas are:<br>  -write in a journal (write about what is bothering you, how your day went, how you feel, etc.)<br>  -talk to someone you trust (I know you said nobody likes you but that is not true...there are people who love you but sometimes don't show it the right way)<br>  -medication/doctor visit can help you figure out what path to take on your depression.<br>  <br>  Not one of those ideas I listed did I not try. I did them all and actually continue to do them...I know I still cut but if it weren't for those things I would be suicidal.<br>  <br>  You always will have someone to talk to no matter what- it is just finding the person and having patience ( which I know is hard )<br>  <br>  PLEASE if you need someone to talk to send me an email at:<br>  so.justme@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  I promise things will get better- They don't get better all in one day however, so give it time, and be patient and you will get to the point in your life where you want to be.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped<br>  Good Luck

Don't eat too late at night (nothing after 7pm)<br>  <br>  When you do your cardio workout at the gym, use interval training, that is, Do a continuous cycle of high intensity followed by low intensity (active rest). If you don't understand what I mean by this, google interval training. Interval training is important because it will increase residual energy burn (meaning you will still be burning energy hours after you stopped exercise) hence maximizing weight loss.<br>  <br>  There is a really good eBook you should read its called the Truth About Abs.

q4XSkBQFaa	Most likely this is what is due to something called orthostatic hypotension.  When a person gets dehydrated, as you likely are having just gotten over a severe illness, their total blood volume is reduced.  While this is temporary and not really a problem in and of itself, it can lead to feelings of dizziness/lightheadedness or even cause a person to pass out if for example they attempt to rise quickly from a seating to standing position.  What you need to do is get back on track eating/drinking a regular diet, and take care when changing body positions rapidly.  <br>  <br>  Whether this is related to your prior experiences is anyone's guess.  Lots of people get dehydrated from time to time, and lots of people get benign positional vertigo.  If it continues to occur or gets worse you despite staying hydrated, if you experience palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, have severe pain or pus in your ear, or if you notice changes in your vision you should see your family physician.

iAPHAAinaa	As long as you are taking the prescribed dose - that is, the dose that your doctor said you should take - you're fine. Most pharmaceutical drug addictions occur because the users enjoy the feeling so much that they begin to take the drug too much (that is, more than the prescribed dosage) which drives their bodies out of whack and before you know it they're buying it off the street for $30 a pop. It's good that you're getting the exact same effect every night with the same dosage, because that means your body is not adapting to the drug (which is what causes an addiction). Like I said, make sure that no matter what you do you stick to the prescribed dosage, and if you start to crave it more or feel any pain consult a specialist immediately. And to answer your other question, the amount it stays in your body depends on the dosage taken. However, one molecule of codeine has a half-life of about 2.5-3 hours, so figure a couple of days until only trace amounts are left.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	You haven't experienced any type of withdrawal symptoms because you continue to take a high dose every day.  That is a narcotic that should only be used for a specific amount of time as directed by a doctor.  It is very habit forming.  I would be careful with it.|`|YPufVLCUaa	you can find your answer in sources|`|xmibEEdcaa	Yes, you can still get addicted to a daily hit of codeine, although it's encouraging to hear that you're not building up a tolerance. When you stop taking your daily dose, that's when you'll start feeling withdrawal symptoms.  <br>  <br>  If you do go off of it, I would strongly suggest tapering down, rather than just stopping: take only half the dose you usually take every night, then only a quarter of the dose, and so on.  Otherwise, you very likely will be hit with some unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.
FLAtdWrmaa	Yes, things like infections often cause a disruption to your monthly schedule.  Don't worry yet.  <br>  <br>  Your period may be skipped entirely while your body-system heals and adjusts.

It sucks to feel like crap.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  Your ex sounds like a dipshit.  I would just go make an appointment with a psychiatrist and let them know how you are feeling.  They will probably start you out on an antidepressant to see if that helps.  And, if needed, possibly add a few more medicines until you feel better.|`|mBUfy9zMaa	It could be Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, or Bipolar.

Taurine helps relieve anxiety and curb excessive energy, which can be especially helpful in treating bipolar disorder. <br>  <br>  Taurine has a sedating effect so it is important to monitor the amount that you take, as too high a dosage could actually cause symptoms of depression. maybe this site can help you find more idea <a href="http://setmind.info" rel="nofollow">http://setmind.info</a>|`|Wb6l1nKEaa	u seem al little depressed and have some anxiety and i think u need to talk to someone about the loss your dad.  whenever ur depressed u get angrier easier.  depression is inside anger.  u think about death alot bc of your dad.  social anxiety comes from that feeling everyone is staring at you.  if u want to talk online on aim or yahoo messenger my screename is TheBTPYoda.  maybe i can help u more.<br>  <br>  <br>  your bf doesn't deserve u then.  if he doesn't stick with u when ur make a mistake or thru bad or hard times, then he isn't worth it.  i sent a request to u on yahoo messenger and if u want to talk.|`|af192a6562ef00219f613f2619a735ceaa	i'm sorry you're having such a hard time with the loss of your dad. you are clinically depressed with paranoid and psychotic features. sometimes when people get really, really depressed they can start to imagine things that are not real (this is the psychotic part). the paranoid part is feeling people are looking at you or out to get you.<br>  <br>  talk to a counselor or call a mental health hotline.  i am sure there are free mental health clinics in your area. you could also tell your regular doctor.  get some help. this is nothing to be ashamed of. a death in the family is a hard thing to deal with. get the help you deserve. i really help you feel better soon.
6juV48RWaa	if you're playing sports YOU NEED TO WEAR TAMPONS!<br>  start now! pads are like diapers and they can be irrtating. tampons are miracles :)|`|IqK0wcTLaa	Well if you use a deodorized pad it could be from an allergic reaction. It could be from sweating and the pad rubbing it (gross I know). Change your pad regularly and don't use deodorized pads. If that doesn't work then you should probably go to a doctor and ask them.|`|k6M48eUMaa	For playing sports, it is usually better to use a tampon. <br>  Ask your mom to help you.|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	You are quite likely to be allergic to whatever pad you are using.  Try a natural, organic type.  Most health food stores, along with many other places have organic/natural alternatives.  Tampons are an option, but they might be made of the same thing the pads are made of and getting a rash in your vagina might not be comfortable either.  Talk to your mom about trying a different pad with less chemicals in it or possibly a tampon.|`|m2aznd8xaa	you need to see a dermatoligist. i dont get this but my husband does and he says they hurt bad even to sit. the dermatoligist gave him a special wash for this skin condition and it helped him out alot. its not the pads causing this. although you can try to switch to tampons to aleviate the friction. but what u have if a skin condition.|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Tampons.Switch to tampons and a pantie liner.|`|gH36QO6Xaa	Don't fret, this can easily be fixed, and many girls have the same thing as you, but they think they're top **** and won't admit it! (hope that part made you feel better lol) Drink berocca (that red, fizzy vitiman drink) it helps balance out the hormones and prevent acne from developing and also use an acne wash with benzoyl peroxide in it, that kills off ance really well. Hope this helps! :)|`|xWyXbsw6aa	try tampons? if you are uncomfortable using them then i suggest using a facial cleanser - it will cleanse the skin on your bottom, like using cleanser on your face which helps clear impurities and toxins which cause a build up of yukky stuff - which causes pimples...<br>  <br>  good luck !|`|bql2RJzWaa	I get them too. Its just from moisture. I was told also, that some ppl suffer from acne on their face, others get it in other places. lIke, chest, back, & butt.|`|ys0QlVf7aa	Wear tampons especially since you play sports. You'll be able to move more comfortably and  won't feel it all unless you put it on incorrectly.|`|0ZQhUATDaa	Maybe try another form of protection like tampons.  I'm guessing the pads make you sweat down there which is causing you to break out.  If you're set on using pads, then maybe wash more often or use powder.|`|SnDTQwGnaa	Maybe you need to try a tampon, or change pad brands.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	Use a tampon.|`|AA10363258	just wear tampons.|`|Jxx30d5Raa	You can use a special 'loofa' or 'scrubby' in the shower. be sure to change your pad every 2-3 hours even if it is not saturated. You can also use a triple antibiotic ointment on the 'zits' to prevent them from becoming infected.<br>  <br>  Also, you may just need to switch brands of pads. Some pads have fragrance or artificial colors in them which can make your skin react.|`|eoL9PxPiaa	First of all do you have any allergies that you know of? If the pimples are caused by excessive sweat in the area which is a perfect spot for pimples to arise then the pad is not the problem. You may just need to place something to keep you more dry, like baby powder but avoid the ones with starch they can cause yeast to grow in not so nice place =)  Is this only happening on your period, is it itchy at all and are they pimples or hives? These all need to be considered.|`|wrNZ9RYwaa	use tampons, i know it may sound scary but ur body well ur skin may be having a reaction to the pads u put on..i have the problem where my bottom gets irritated by a pad try changing it more often, but ur best options is a tampon u can have more freedom to move around..oh or maybe try puttin baby powder|`|d3n5Wchvaa	omg i thot i was the only one!! im turning 13 in september, so im 12 as well. yeah i play soccer and the zits are really gross, but to get rid of infections i usually use rubbing alcohol, and that should help it somewhat.  i use tampons, and they are waayy better than pads,  dont be afraid to try them out.  good luck on whatever =)|`|K5BLCZPkaa	tampons are life savers, and once you fully get used to them, you won't even notice you have them. I never use pads, and never have. They have always felt like diapers to me. Not to mention sports are so much easier when you use tampons instead of pads.

Q4ggnG0waa	Surgical resection is usually ineffective because of the depth of the tumor. Treatment with irradiation and corticosteroids often only produces a partial response, but tumor recurs in more than 90% of patients. Median survival is 10 to 18 months in immunocompetent patients, and less in those with AIDS. The addition of IV methotrexate and citrovorum may extend survival to a median of 3.5 years. If radiation is added to methotrexate, median survival may increase beyond 4 years. However, radiation is not recommended in conjunction with methotrexate because of increased risk of leukoencephalopathy and dementia in patients older than 60 years of age.

AA12269596	Honey, with CFS/ME you shouldn't be working so hard! <br>  That's one of the problems, if your body needs all the rest it can get, and you have to work to earn your money.<br>  The thing is, if you have CFS/ME, you are very ill. The more you push yourself, the more ill you get! <br>  Just look at it like a broken leg. You don't cure a broken leg with walking. It needs to rest first. When it's strong enough, you can start making it stronger. Before that time? You will only damage yourself more. <br>  If you had a heart attack you need to rest, and not to start sporting instantly. Again, you need to gain some strength before you can even think of starting to push it.<br>  It's the same with CFS. You will damage yourself more and more if you ignore the fact that you are ill!<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with ME/CFS, and got ill 3,5 years ago. Now, I'm doing very fine. I'm not recovered but I am doing so much better! <br>  <br>  What worked for me does not have to work for you, but the most important thing (that I am sure off will work for you)  was/is listening to my body. It took me a huge amount of patience. Resting a lot at first, then slowly, very slowly starting to do more things. Until I felt the symptoms where getting worse, then it was time to slow down again. <br>  With taking 2 steps forwards and 1 step back all the time, I managed to get slowly better.<br>  I also had acupuncture. This is also a slow process and that might not help everyone, but it helped me. It doesn't cure me, but it helps me to build up my energy and to fight all kinds of symptoms. <br>  I tried to avoid everything that took too much of my precious energy. I had to watch myself very closely to be able to do that. Sometimes the tiredness doesn't strike at once, but it will strike you after hours, or a few days. So, I started avoiding not only physical activities but also social, or things I needed my brain for (like reading! I couldn't read even 1 sentence when I was very ill, it simply took me too much energy.)<br>  <br>  There are experiments now with the supplement Carnitene. I havent tried it yet, I hope to get it prescripted to me soon. There are some good results with it, though it doesn't work for everybody. <br>  <br>  I think you should get to a good research center that specialises on CFS/ME. They will be able to diagnose you properly (if it is something else, then it's equally important to find out! Fatigue is a symptom that there is something wrong, no matter what people say) and to help you understand what is going on in your body. <br>  <br>  But my biggest advise: listen to your body and take the rest you need! If you read a book and feel that it makes you tired, stop reading! The same goes for everything. I know it's very hard and sometimes not even possible, but try to listen to your body as much as you can. Even though not everyone will understand. <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|iwBJ9ij5aa	The most common cause for chronic fatigue is anemia, and because the symptoms are often not very severe, it often goes undiagnosed. If along with feeling tired all the time you find that you have to stop to catch your breath when you're not exercising or you occasionally experience severe headaches, you probably have a very mild case of anemia, and should simply talk to your doctor about taking iron supplements.

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|MKisfyJpaa	I was also overweight when I was your age and I lost weight by just eating right and getting exercise. Don't go on any crazy diets, just cut out fast food and soda and eat a bunch of veggies. You can buy workoutvideos and workout at home or just go for walks to start out. I am 29 now and have never gained it back (in fact I am in better shape than most of my friends because I developed good habits) because it is a lifestyle and you will really just feel better! As you lose weight and become stronger you will gain confidence and want to achieve more-good luck!!!
t9Nw86Plaa	I had the same experience. My periods were very irregular, and the longest I went without a period was 16 months. My doctor put me on the pill, and on the first pill I tried (a low dose pill), I bled every day for three months.... which was a lot worse than never bleeding at all, thank you very much! I tried a couple of different pills (on some, I bled every day, on others I didn't bleed at all) until I found one that worked.<br>  <br>  When you have very irregular periods, and particularly when you have prolonged amenorrhea (as you have) the pill can't fix it straight away. You may have bleeding problems on the pill for the first few months, and after that they will either straighten out, or if not then you may have to try another pill.<br>  <br>  Give it some time (3 months minimum) before you visit your doctor again to try a new pill, and be thankful that you're not bleeding every day!|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Depends on what you are taking.|`|onfX2jqLaa	how long have you been on birth control?
GGmaSpHDaa	Lifting weights will not hinder your growth. This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated. <br>  <br>  Doctors recommend strength training for youth.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury. <br>  <br>  Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic: <br>  <br>  “Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/strengthtrainingforyoung.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...</a><br>  <br>  NSCA position on resistance training for youth.<br>  <a href="https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/Y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/downlo...</a><br>  <br>  While you won’t stunt your growth lifting weights, you can be injured.  It is very important to get instruction in proper lifting technique.  If you don’t have an adult to instruct you, get this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-Young-Athletes-Faigenbaum/dp/0736002189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225944504&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-You...</a>|`|mb2Otvunaa	Firstly it is stunt.<br>  Secondly, no.|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	Weight training is only indicated beyond a certain age.

The symptoms can be varying and the medicine will treat the cause of all of them, which is bacterial.

That is how my sons have to be diagnosed because he doesn't get the "usual" signs of sinus infections.<br>  <br>  As for myself I get them OFTEN and docs have no trouble telling me if I have one. I have no trouble figuring it out for myself for that matter!<br>  <br>  The common way to tell is to do an overview of the ears, mouth, nose etc. They will feel the neck for swollen glands and/or pain. Then the tale tell sign is sinus pressure. Did you notice them push on his forehead and under his eyes? That is the main way they tell! Those are sinus points and if there is pain/pressure there then its a good indication of a sinus infection.<br>  <br>  I always know I have one for sure when I get severe pain in my forehead and around my eye after leaning forward or behind over. As it temporarily builds the pressure and intensifies the pain. As for the meds yes it will help the strep should he get it!

Whatever the reason to take this amount of acetaminophen, there is always an alternative available. <br>  <br>  The only reason I can fathom that someone would want to scarf down this much acetaminophen would be to get at some 'recreational' drug that it's packaged with. Be aware that there are extraction techniques and most often alternatives without acetaminophen that don't require you to risk your health and or life to consume.|`|FY7NjgGnaa	xcessive use of paracetamol can damage multiple organs, especially the liver and kidney. In both organs, toxicity from paracetamol is not from the drug itself but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). In the liver, the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 are primarily responsible for the conversion of paracetamol to NAPQI. In the kidney, cyclooxygenases are the principal route by which paracetamol is converted to NAPQI. Paracetamol overdose leads to the accumulation of NAPQI, which undergoes conjugation with glutathione. Conjugation depletes glutathione, a natural antioxidant. This in combination with direct cellular injury by NAPQI, leads to cell damage and death.<br>  <br>  Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is, by far, the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance. Signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity may initially be absent or vague. Untreated, overdose can lead to liver failure and death within days. Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replacing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the patient presents for treatment soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine, acts as a precursor for glutathione helping the body regenerate enough to prevent damage to the liver, a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe.
Q0yLkokwaa	Doing weights and building your muscles stunts your growth if you have fully grown and you don't stop growing until your about 22-25.

PuRXmK8naa	Try some soy milk. I think it tastes great but everyone has their preference. If you want to continue to drink regular milk, you can try a pill called Lactaid. It enables your stomach to handle any milk products.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	They sell lactose-free milk these days--whole milk, 2%, 1% and fat-free.  They also sell tablets, Lactaid, that supposedly do the same thing (allow you to drink milk).  I've even seen lactose-free ice cream (but I think it only comes in vanilla).  If you can determine where your cut-off point is--how much milk, or ice cream, or cheese you can handle before it starts affecting you badly, maybe that's the best way; stop eating dairy products once you've hit your maximum level before the bad stuff starts happening.  If you can, try to buy lactose-free, maybe keep that in your home (so you can go out with friends and have pizza and ice cream).  And you'd probably have to eat a LOT of chooclates to ingest enough lactose to affect you.|`|deYDbVDSaa	DON'T drink goat's milk, it has more lactose than cow's milk. I am lactose intolerant, but like most it wasn't that bad at first. The best solution that I came up with and it works 100% of the time, is I don't do dairy. It was a little rough at first, but giving up dairy was the best thing I ever did for my body.|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	Green tea is not indicated for more than 2 cups per day.  It's not an alternative to milk.  Drinking whole organic milk might not cause the issues with your tummy.  If you still have problems, try some papaya or papaya enzymes.  They will help you to digest the milk sugars among other things.|`|aAcjC22gaa	You have a couple of options: as far as pill you can either take lactaid or try lactose free milk or soy milk. I use lactose free milk because it still taste like milk and it is the cheaper option. I also take the pills so i am not limited. Yes you can still eat chocolate.

You'd have to smoke about 40,000 times the amount it takes to get you high, or about a third of your body weight.<br>  <br>  Does it make you fat?

After smoking, most people experience the "munchies" which makes you hungry, and makes everything taste great!<br>  <br>  Good effects? Where to begin! A feeling of extreme happyness, everything is funny, you enjoy your life, you see that there is hope in the world, and with time everything will get better!

It dose not increase fat production in any way. It dose however (if you smoke a lot), make you less energetic. It also makes you much hungrier.<br>  <br>  Recently, scientists in Italy have discovered more about the mechanisms that make marijuana users hungry, as well as what makes humans hungry in general. <br>  <br>  The operative molecules are called endocannabinoids, and they have receptors in the brain that, when activated, increase the appetite of the subject. <br>  <br>  The researcher's results, published in last week's scientific journal Nature, have potential uses for dieting programs and medications. <br>  <br>  "There is tremendous interest in marijuana because of some of the unique physiological effects it has," UW biochemistry professor Dr. T.F. Martin said. "It has been useful in pain killing, glaucoma treatment, etc. and in all of this, it is possible that an appetite-suppressing drug may be found, which is a billion-dollar-a-year industry." <br>  <br>  To decipher the effects of endocannabinoids, the researchers genetically altered mice, removing the endocannabinoid receptors in their brains. <br>  <br>  Once they had created these "knockout mice" and monitored them, they found that the mice ate less than the control mice.<br>  <br>  To further study the effects of endocannabinoids, the researchers also gave ordinary mice a drug that blocked endocannabinoids from acting on the receptors in the brain. These mice also ate less than the control group. <br>  <br>  "Marijuana produces a multitude of effect's euphoria, analgesia, etc.," Martin said. "It is believed that the majority of these are produced because delta-nine-tetrahydrocannabino l in marijuana can bind to CB1 receptors in the nervous system and mimic endogenous cannabinoids." <br>  <br>  The study also hypothesizes that endocannabinoids are part of the complex neural circuitry controlled by a hormone called leptin, which tells the brain when it is time to lose weight. <br>  <br>  "These findings indicate that endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus may tonically activate CB1 receptors to maintain food intake and form part of the neural circuitry regulated by leptin," the study said. <br>  <br>  Even though the researchers know what hormone to control to encourage weight loss, it would be difficult to develop a drug based on cannabinoids alone. <br>  <br>  "The endocannabinoid receptors such as CB1 are very widespread in the central nervous system," Martin said. "Cannabinoids have effects on memory, cognition, coordination, mood, pain sensation, sleep and appetite. <br>  <br>  Since these effects seem to be mediated largely by a common receptor, using a drug to block this receptor may have many consequences." Martin said.<br>  <br>  IN ENGLISH: Marijuana makes you hungry, which in turn usually makes people fat.|`|Sh7r0kNuaa	marijuana doesn't make you fat. people that smoke weed and had no self control to begin with might over eat and gain some weight, but i know countless skinny pot heads. you cant o.d. on marijuana, there has never been a single reported death. its the safest drug known to man with an addiction level less than caffeine. if you smoke too much, you might get a panic attack, but that's relatively rare..its usually if you are prone to them to begin with. good effects? when using it in moderation, it can be very nice to unwind and have fun, nice to ease stress. it also has many known uses in the medical field. weed smoke is not nearly as bad for you as tobacco smoke and it doesn't kill brain cells.|`|77YWNCV5aa	Bad effects: It doesn't make you fat, it just makes you get the "munchies".

However it is slightly more then twice your body weight actually it would take eating 1400 pounds of weed in less the 45 minutes to overdose, remember i said feasible to possible. In terms of smoking you would have to smoke 40000 times the amount it took you to get high in order to overdose. While alcohol only take four. Bad effects of the actual marijuana plant i cannot find any, while todays society has said that smoking weed can cause cancer it has never been proven and the only way it would have a large amount of tar is if you are smoking low grade with a Pyrex ( glass pipe). The truly only thing i could find wrong with it is if you are a newby and you smoke more then you are used to you may feel very sluggish and paranoid. It is truly safe because before your body would let you smoke enough to kill you which would take weeks people you would fall asleep. Marijuana has many different uses  including spices for food, clothing, tea, medicine, and most commonly as a recreation intoxicant. The effects of weed alter different people different ways which is what makes it classified as a class 1 intoxicant although most commonly you relax, lose anxiety, fight anorexia, and become a laughy kinda person. Being high can very easily be controlled and you can still function while on the drug and it doesnt kill more brain cells then when you think a little to hard. It has been scientifically proven and medically so learn your facts before you discriminate..|`|yXnpHg0Waa	Bad: Kills some brain cells, the resin is like the tar in tobacco for your lungs, Causes depression over time. etc....alot more bad things<br>  <br>  Good: Cures anxiety and depression for a little time period, makes you happy, etc...alot more good things<br>  <br>  But no marijuana does not make you fat, but certain individuals may not be able to contain their munchies and overeat <br>  <br>  :)|`|mzz9Icdjaa	you can't overdose on it, it's nearly impossible. You get fat from pigging out when you get the munchies. I guess a good effect would be pain relief. It really helps cancer patients on chemo. Some use it for MS. The bad effects mainly come from the tar it leaves in your lungs, similar to a cigarette.

9pLdhuBnaa	A bruise (an example only) could cause some of the pain that you are noticing as well, but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend letting your mom know what's going on so that she can help you keep an eye on the situation (depending on her age).
YFiDnVrtaa	Well lets put it this way.....I have seen enough of Maury to know that sometimes the man that looks like the father is not the father. DNA tests are 99.9% accurate. <br>  <br>  Now there is a rare disfunction with the body that may cause and DNA test to mess up. Its very rare and as far as I know it has only been found in women, when ever there are twins and one twin died, the other baby obsorbed her twin, thus giving her body 2 different types of DNA. When she had her children DNA tests proved the children didn't match her blood type. Come to find out the DNA that was in her eggs was those of her twin. I seen it on the history channel as well as researched it a bit. <br>  <br>  But like I said that is soooo rare. As far as your daughter is concerned you might need to talk to her because if 2 tests prove he not the father. He is not the father and there is no proving it otherwise. Remember sperm can live inside a woman 7 to 10 days.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	i'm sure that there is a guy that looks like the guy she thinks is the father, every heard of "everyone has a twin"  ... if it's negative it's negative...she should've kept better count on her partners i guess...that's why you should only have one and then wait a while and so you dont have to go around guessing

If you do call, call from a blocked number. <br>  It sounds like you may be depressed or have a form of anxiety. I'm no doctor but I've been through something similar. Just tell yourself, You are not the only one. There are people all over the world who deal with these things every day. You need to get the proper help to get through this. Try keeping a journal, maybe something is bothering you. Try your best to figure out what it is. Also try your best to make your mother understand that you need her right now. <br>  I'm sure your friend wouldn't lie to you. You need more confidence!<br>  Go to anybody you trust at a time like this, its not going to go away on its own. Good luck.|`|U2LZDeKIaa	You sound like you are definitely depressed. Look up Major Depressive Disorder on google. You have some of the symptoms. You need to get help. If your mom won't help you get help, it sounds like a good idea to talk to a school counselor, like others here suggested, or your family doctor, maybe they can help you find a psychiatrist and a therapist. There may also be a number you can call for county mental health services.  If you feel suicidal, call a crisis or suicide hotline.  There is a hotline at 1- 800- 273- TALK and another one at 1- 800- SUICIDE.  <br>  <br>  Also on line are support sites dealing with depression and mental health. You can google them. I think one is www.moodgarden.com and one is www.healthyplace.com. Try using them to hook up with others with experience in dealing with depression.<br>  <br>  There's a site, www.DBSAlliance.com, which offers help for mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, and provides information on local, in- person support groups.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are not alone, countless others have been through it, and people do recover.

0bYcYz2jaa	It's a pretty deep burn if you got blisters.  You need to keep the area clean and bandaged.  Use an antibiotic cream, place clean gauze over it and use medical tape to cover it.  This blister is basically an open wound and can get much worse if you don't take care of it.  Remember to change the dressing at least daily and consider consulting a doctor.

Do not break them, that will slow down the healing process and risk an infection. Blisters that are broken will drain fluid. To protect the blisters, lightly cover with a non-stick sterile gauge pad. Get medical attention if the area gets red and swollen.<br>  If necessary, take a pain reliever such as, Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin or other). Follow label instructions.<br>  Take the pain reliever until redness and soreness is alleviated. <br>  Skin that is peeling should be treated gently.

sPT8ikgXaa	If you got the shot on the last day of your period, you can have unprotected sex in 24 hours since you got the shot.  Depo Provera injection stops your ovaries from releasing eggs, so you will not be fertile at all while on the shot.<br>  <br>  As far at weight gain, it happens to some women and it it doesn't to others.  I've been on the Depo for 12 years and I have not had any extra weight gain, the weight gain I had was normal gain due to growing and getting older....and I've been the same weight for the last 3 years or so (cause I stopped growing), so the shot has had no affect on my weight.  If you notice that you are gaining weight because of the shot, you can stop getting the shot and try another method.<br>  <br>  Only other thing I can think of that you may want to know, is that the longer you are on the shot, the longer it takes for your body to start ovulating again.  For me, since I've been on it for 12 years, it may take me about 2-4 years before I would start ovulating again if I decide to have children.  I don't recommend anyone being on the shot as long as I am because not every woman may want to be infertile for that long or may not be able to handle it that long.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes well for you being on the shot.  I personally have loved not having a period for years :)|`|VDXKqoejaa	You will need to wait at least one full menstrual cycle (usually one month) before having unprotected sex.

D0bwDLXJaa	Drink lots and lots of liquids. Drinking fluids when you have a sore throat does two things: first, it helps to hydrate your body, and second, it helps keep post-nasal drip from building up and keeps the irritated linings of your throat coated with moisture. Mild and soothing drinks like warm tea are very good. <br>  Try gargling with salt water. The swelling and subsequent in your throat, called edema, is caused by a greater water concentration in the cells lining your throat. A light mixture (1 teaspoon of salt per glass) of salt and water gargled for thirty seconds, several times a day will help draw some of that extra water out and reduce the swelling that accompanies a sore throat. Be careful; too much salt will harm your already beleaguered mucus glands.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

kKOzl9nUaa	Are you eating enough, make sure you have alot of iron, calcuim and eat fish, veges, salad, fruit? Sex is usually six weeks after giving birth naturally.

jFCA0Pwcaa	first of all- congrats! :D my cousin is in the army and i miss him a lot but he's proud to serve his country. neway:<br>  2 months= 8 weeks.<br>  1 lb= 3500 calories. <br>  if you cute 500 calories from your diet, 500 x 7 days = one pound GONE! so in just 8 weeks alone you lose 8 lbs. if you burn 500 calories a day, u'll lose two lbs a week: 16 lbs total. <br>  <br>  good luck!
FgnAb0Ldaa	Well, you need to talk to your therapist about that and see what he or she says.  Are you on a good healthy diet?  Sometimes if your not eating good the dizziness can cause that to happen.  I would also go get a physical with a MD and have him examine you and see what he says.  Life is too short to be thinking about suicidal my dear.  There are so many other things to look at in life and I know times can be hard but you are VERY young and life is never gong to be easy but you have to make the best of it.  I was in therapy for 5 years from an eating disorder and suicidal.  I know how you feel but when I almost died in the hospital it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me and I realized that I didn't want to die.  I started to appreciate life a lot more. Please be careful and Good LuCk to YoU.  Make sure you get a physical and let your doctor know everything.|`|xMT9XTT6aa	GO TO THE HOSPITAL!!! Never mess around with stuff like this...better to be safe than sorry! I hope you're alright...please, please, please go to a doctor and if you're not happy with his/her answer go to another doctor.  It could just be stress but it could be something serious.|`|xtJ2yIRmaa	Yes, you should be very concerned.... my advice go to the hospital. it could be more serious than you reckon.
jy47TEVkaa	Unfortunately, there is little you can do.  Eat nothing, drink only water and in small doses.  You may dry-heave a bit, which can be painful.  It should only take a couple of days for the bug to pass.

They'll probably try to get the swelling down as much as possible before doing surgery since swelling can complicate things. If the motrin isn't working they might be able to give you something stronger.<br>   Are the doctors having you stay off your knee and resting it? you should be doing that. I can't tell you if it'll get worse. It Can potentially get worse but we're all different.
S4W7FojCaa	If you are asking for hallucinations, then the Devil is something you should look into. The Devil and his demons can haunt her and this can cause her to cut to try and make the fear leave her body...but small cuts don't do it and she begins using a bigger blade and slicing her skin open...she could nearly die of this. The devil would do anything to have her die because the only thing he is after is her soul. <br>  <br>  Is that good or scary?|`|W8F9PboZaa	One of my best friends is a cutter and she honestly does not have a reason. She has, in many people's opinion, the perfect life. Her parents love her (seriously and this isn't one of those family issues where they look nice but aren't really), she has a great job, she goes to church, has supportive friends, is reasonably attractive. She suffers from depression. Sometimes there isn't a reason for that. Sometimes it's a chemical imbalance in your brain. Sometimes its brought about by terrible events. <br>  <br>  She could have been raped, abused (family?), anorexic (or bulimic), bullied (how old is she?), anything really. Just think of issues in today's society. <br>  <br>  In the area I live in (perfect suburbia) there's a real issue with cutting, it's also the area with the highest rate of suicide in Australia. It costs a fair bit to live in this area, families are generally white anglo saxons who are well off, live in a nice house etc. The schools are fairly good and there's no "reasons" for it. They just live in this perfect life and hate it and see no way out. They get depressed and cut themselves. Nothing traumatic has happened in their lives. It's just the way it is.|`|KJ1dDkonaa	cutting is to cliche and cannot be explored without boring your audience.  try something more deviant with depth and exploration, Control is the foundation of most deviant behavior. but no murder. you'll lose them that way too, try something new and research every detail of it.

rocQqDxYaa	yea unless your already down a lot . <br>  then you start to gain wait from muscle . <br>  <br>  my advice for wantin to lose weight . sweat it out . <br>  used to do laps around the track with sweat pants and hoodies for myself . <br>  but if you have the money . go to a sonna or however you spell that . more expensive but relaxing|`|YteiWSM1aa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - consume less food and move more often - the difficulties appear when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are plenty of opportunities to fail in the real world aren't there?!

I melted away 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!
jmgLiPS2aa	I read about an ayurvedic therapy, it says, we need to take equal portions of onion juice and equal portions of honey, mix them well and apply it on the scalp. it said it was best if it was done everyday and after that head bath should be taken with Shikakai or Kumkudkai.

Sleeping meds and exercise didn't do squat. I got really desperate and saw a doctor about it. Turns out it was stress related too and I had way too much on my mind. He told me to try to sort out any problems to relieve as much stress as possible and then try meditation (not the whole knees crossed and chanting part tho). It actually works, I just lay in bed and concentrated on keeping a slow breathing pattern and then tried to focus on it until I fell asleep.   You gotta start by focusing on a single thing (or thought) and eventually you can learn to just sort of completely clear your head and space out (called the Quiet Mind).  My sleeping issues have now stopped, but I still meditate like 30 min a day to reduce stress and relax. It doesn't work for everyone, but I'd give it a shot if you are desperate.   Good Luck|`|CmLDWTJiaa	you need to see a doctor lack of sleep causes a person to have bad immunity to diseases and also it sucks not sleeping you may have anything from a brain issue to a chemical in-balance but you definitley need sleep go see a doctor|`|JrkJw1Xxaa	exercise before u sleep so ur tired when you go to bed!|`|sEryEzoyaa	ya need to exercise

736f4c2d0f80c01ae125e1a7f95e6540aa	I know how you feel.  If you plan to stay a virgin for a while though, it's probably best that you don't get too comfortable with heavy petting.  It's not immature.  If you do want to go farther with this, don't think about it.  Just let your hands go where they want to.  They'll probably end up in his hair, just because from experience, that's where hands want to go.  Anyway, relax... let your bodies do the work (but don't break your scruples because of desires or hormones)|`|x3RGtco8aa	was he licking you vag? if so maybe next time you could put your hands on his head, and touch his hair if you wanna get wild pull it maybe??? or you could put them on your chest and touch your boobs thats what i do it adds to the pleasure :) or put them behind your head. next time just relax.|`|xMT9XTT6aa	Run them through his hair, gently guide his head.

N6EP6b4kaa	aww sweetie i'm so sorry.first let me say the lube should't have burned you.You may have an infection or some sort.Second I know that some time the doc will use their fingers and it's more comfy.Just relax okay.Hope all is well.|`|AA12187942	it could be that because you tensed when she opened the speculum that it caused tiny tears in your vagina, in which the lubrication may have gotten into and caused a burning sensation, which should go away with time and washing. I would recommend you relax with the smaller speculum and no matter how bad it hurts or makes you feel uncomfortable it is an absolutely necessary procedure and take ease in the thought that you are doing a great thing for yourself. maybe ask if you can watch, because sometimes knowing is less stressful than not knowing, maybe the doctor can put a mirror down there to show you what exactly is going on when it's going on. I know that it helps sometimes to know what is happening not just being told about it. you could learn something about yourself as well. Like i said I would chalk the lube burning up to your tenseness when the speculum was opened. if it does not go away with bathing and relaxing recommend to the doctor that it was a major irritant to you during your last visit and she can try something else less irritating to your vagina.|`|9db6577c31cba2dca461af45ce8d1b3aaa	The smaller speculum should help. Not everyone is very big down there (especially if we haven't had kids yet). The lube (which was most likely SurgiLube or KY or some generic form of it) should not have caused burning, but if it did you need to tell the doc (I suppose there is a slight chance of an allergy there).<br>  <br>  Next time, make sure they're using the smaller speculum, and try to breathe deeply while she's doing the exam. Nobody likes them but they are really necessary and are important to your health.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sUyX4BISaa	I experienced similar when I went for my first pap smear two years ago. I couldn't relax long enough for the doctor to do anything, so she suggested me coming back for another appointment and for me to take a valium before coming, that way I'd be more relaxed. I had my mom drive me to be safe. It isn't as bad after your first one though.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	It sounds like the doctor didn't have much patience with you.    If she's not patient, you won't be able to relax.  She should have used the smaller speculum today, instead of making you come back.   The lube shouldn't have burned you.  It's designed to be gentle.    Try taking some deep breaths next time.   Good luck.|`|sLI3uBk1aa	it shouldn't hurt...well it didn't hurt me anyways. <br>  all i felt was pressure and i could feel her inserting it. and the lube shouldn't burn either...that's not normal i don't think. sorry i wasn't much help..|`|349781ebe495f90a571f59693d9bfa5faa	The lube shouldnt have burned you but for sure mention it to your doctor when you go back in, they can use warm water instead! If it was your first pap the doctor should have used the smaller size but really it shouldn't hurt just maybe feel funny. Try to relax and think of something you like, maybe shopping. Try reading a magazine or find something to focus on. Pap smears are very important so no matter what make sure you go back. Maybe you could even hold the medical assistants hand!|`|sObEb6NNaa	Hi Kourtney paps are always uncomfortable for women. Ive been having them for years and I still feel that way. I find that Im more comfortable with a female doctor, if you havent, you may want to consider that. Just try to relax next time and think about something else than whats going on. Paps dont hurt, you just feel a little cramping at the time. As far as the burning from the lubrication, that shouldnt happen, you may be allergic to whatever they were using. Make sure you tell your doctor next time that you experienced that. It'll be ok hon|`|wZzWmXU0aa	are you a virgin? that's why it might hurt! also, if your small down there she will use a different tool. I don't understand why she didn't just go & get a small one so you didn't have to go through that again. Don't worry it's not your fault! she should of been more understanding & helped you ease yourself. I hope you are doing good! sorry sweetie!<br>  <br>  also, if it burned & hurt maybe you have an infection.

bf6K6uubaa	you're fat turned into musle and muscle weighs more so your weight is not going to change....you have to keep at it and eat healthy and drink the tons of water like you said and it might change...butdont go by weight go by how you look...i weigh the same when i am toned or no toned...its annoying to see the same # on scale but thats how it goes|`|U8oR3VU6aa	You may need to omit starches and sugars from your diet. Also, exercising a lot can cause you to miss periods.|`|I82XZNp7aa	Weight is not necessarily all fat. If you have been exercising, yes, fat is burned, but you are also gaining muscle. Muscles weighs more than fat, so you might have been building muscle. As you exercise, you need more food, so you might have eaten more than you wanted to. <br>  <br>  Also, it really depends on where you're trying to lose fat from. For example, if you want to lose fat near your hips, you can try playing with hula hoops. For toning your legs, try swimming laps (with frontcrawl). To tone your arms, lift weights.<br>  <br>  Yoga is more of a stress reliever than a fat cutter.<br>  <br>  If you're constantly worrying about your weight or stressed over something, you could be gaining weight. This is because stress makes you either munch on food (so gaining weight, obviously) or no food/less eating food (your body would store more fat to conserve energy because you aren't giving enough nutrients to it).<br>  <br>  Your body composition also comes into play if you're trying to cut down on fat. Some people have denser bone mass than average. Not to mention the ratio of your muscle mass to fat mass, which is similar to BMI.<br>  <br>  And uh.. if you're missing a period, I strongly urge you to eat more foods with folate acid, like tomatoes, which are extremely rich in folate acid. Folate supplies your ovaries and ova with nutrients, and perhaps you are just missing some nutrients for the period.<br>  <br>  Also, I highly recommend getting a personal trainer if all fails. Most of the time, people prescribe the wrong diets for themselves. Nutritionist, dieticians and gym trainers are there to help you. It may seem corny, but if the shoe fits, then why not try it?|`|jLnhnDjhaa	im telling you hydroxycut gives you that extra push.. and if ur worried about all the caffeine take the caffeine free one.<br>  <br>  also are you on birth control? that usually keeps you at a plato..|`|c0a7928c45c9c44137051320a690fe30aa	I'm having this same problem.  Started working out and eating well in December to lose weight and have actually gained 10 pounds or so.  What I have been told is that it's muscle weight.  Your muscles are also working overtime and retaining water to heal and build.  It's kind of discouraging to see no scale results even if it is muscle.  You said you've lost inches.  That's positive.  Muscle weighs more then fat which I'm sure you know.  I see athletes that are half a foot shorter then me and skinny, but weigh like 40 pounds more.  Perhaps you can get a body fat measurement every few weeks and not pay attention to the scale as much.  Perhaps it can help motivate you to continue your efforts.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|tluT02tvaa	Since i starting eating less and working out more,i too have been late.<br>  But nothing since NOV is bad news,go get checked out by DR.<br>  <br>  As for the weight.Are you counting calories? perhaps you are eating only little enough to maintain your weight and not lose.Find out how many calories you burn each day and subtract about 500 from it.You can lose a pound a week like that.

Helping others grieve, and helping children grieve are some topics at: www.crisiscounseling.com/TraumaLoss/Grie... Understand that there are often several stages of grief. Those stages are:<br>  <br>  Denial: The initial stage: "It can't be happening." <br>  Anger: "Why ME? It's not fair?!" (either referring to God, oneself, or anybody perceived, rightly or wrongly, as "responsible") <br>  Bargaining: "Just let me live to see my son graduate." <br>  Depression: "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?" <br>  Acceptance: "It's going to be alright.<br>  Growth: Grief is a chance for personal growth. For many people, it may eventually lead to renewed energy to invest in new activities and new relationships. Some people seek meaning in their loss and get involved in causes or projects that help others. Some people find a new compassion in themselves as a result of the pain they have suffered. They may become more sensitive to others, thus enabling richer relationships. Others find new strength and independence they never knew they had. After the loss, they find new emotional resources that had not been apparent before. Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This also includes the death of a loved one and divorce.<br>  <br>   Kübler-Ross also claimed these steps do not necessarily come in order, nor are they all experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two.See www.amazon.com/ for books on the various stages. After a while, consider making a photoalbum/scrapbook and/or a shrine, in remembrance, and set aside; say; one day every month, perhaps on a significant date, (for example; the 17th, or the second thursday) on which to reflect. Many religious organisations offer counselling, or you may feel more comfortable with a therapist, to express your thoughts, and feelings. Journalling may help in this. Celebrate that life; be thankful for the experience, and remember the good times.

4JFuXBskaa	First and foremost your Grandpa and entire family will be in my prayers!  The key for you is to realize that you will not be any help to your Grandpa if you fall apart.  It is so hard when someone you love is ill, and so frustrating to realize that you don't have any control over it!  If you believe in God or a higher power I would suggest praying for strength.  When you talk to or see your Grandpa you should tell him just what you said in this e-mail.  Too often in life we have such wonderful feelings for someone and never take the opportunity to tell them how much we love them and what a difference they have made in our life.  Make sure you tell him, you both will feel better!  I pray that the growth is nothing dangerous.  Chances are it is nothing serious.  However, if it is something more there are so many things that doctors can do now...medical miracles happen everyday.  Just take some deep slow breaths and realize you can't control the outcome, you can only control your response to it.  Stay strong, your Grandpa is lucky to have you in his corner!  Take care!!!|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	your grandfather sounds like a wonderful person, but he voluntarily chose to use tobacco. This growth is one of the risks of smoking and chewing tobacco. They all think "it cannot or will not happen to me".<br>  <br>  Remind everyone that : "Your health is a negative equation, because you never know how good it WAS until you lose it".

VpXrsxGGaa	yup its the liberals who are catering to the "poor me poor me " attitude<br>  and lazyness adds to depression <br>  and in other countrys if you get depresed you will die|`|QAsWwWvFaa	I think its just because depression is accomadated here, where if your living day to day in a third world country you cant really afford to take time off for anything let alone depression. Youd flat out starve to death. Americans are just spoiled, in so many ways.|`|9ibxX8EAaa	In 3rd world countries, it is not in their vocabulary because they are thinking of survival. However, you ignore the fact that American and much of western society is also very fragmented, alienated and disconnected. The family unit has shattered, and there are now more broken homes than ever. Loneliness is a very real problem in a progressive, individualistic culture. In contrast, in third world countries, the extended family is often very alive and people depend on each other. (Studies show that a sense of social support has strong ties to well-being, even more than money does....well actually the relation between money and well-being is practically nil, that is above a certain poverty level)<br>  <br>  In some 3rd world countries, people are very unhappy indeed if they are extremely poor. Below a certain threshold, you will be miserable, wherever you are. But their medical system is so impoverished there is no luxury of mental help or getting a 'diagnosis'.|`|ICEqYXy7aa	Lol... you are very cluelles and ignorant what depression really does to you boy. You really have no damn clue what depression does to your mind, body and soul... ignorance|`|Xmxaxi5Gaa	this sounds like something you should be complaining to your girlfriend about.<br>  <br>  it isn't just the 1st ailment that makes you feel like the world has to stop, it is THE ailment where everything falls apart and makes life a living hell.<br>  <br>  as for the "posers," they're just idiots and cannot tell sadness from depression.
Fjp12f8laa	keeping running, you have probably lost your level of fitness now that you have stopped playing, all you need to do is get it back, so stop and starts, like run for a minute then walk for two. if you go out runnning every 3 days and jsut stick to a rountine, and increase you running time and decrease your walking time, you will get your fitness back and you wont get out of breath so quickly<br>  <br>  easy|`|MSqE9rbDaa	You could have asthma...? Or some other weird breathing problem. Go see a doctor. I have the same problem, I have had numerous appointments, we are still trying to figure out what it is. (I don't have asthma...) :p|`|K0E51G1saa	ur conditioning is bad then<br>  to make it better sprint as far as u can as fast as u can multiple times will help after time<br>  also jump rope for a long time increases ur endurance too|`|erXY47kNaa	your gonna need to get your body use to running again and the only way to do that is to keep running. until then take energy supplements like 5 hour energy.|`|2j6NMTOAaa	Your endurance isn't as high as it was before<br>  you just need to slowly work your way up :)
AA11780191	Be very careful with self diagnosis, especially with very broadly described conditions such as social anxiety disorder and depression.  I had an altogether similar experience and although you are amongst a distinct minority, it's a sizeable one.  My guess is that you're still deep in the midst of high school.  This is an undeniably difficult time to process any kind of meaningful thought.  Difficult, because the status quo, ie - what the teachers, your parents and your peers are telling you, may not align with your own ideas.  And since the ideas of all these people around you don't necessarily mesh with your own, it's natural to develop a sense of alienation.  Comfort in a social scene usually requires some sort of likeness in mind and perception.  At your age, the majority will not likely be abstracting concepts pertaining to self and existence (but that is not all it is you think about, is it?)  And for those that do, since their ideas are not likely echoed by those immediately around them, they also tend to retract, finding themselves alienated from their peers, and therefore anxious in their company.<br>  <br>  Consider yourself precocious with your intellectual curiosity, however.  Existentialism is the thing of Sartre and Camus and a fairly heavy philosophical concept; as such, there's even the concept of an 'existential crisis' or 'existential despair.'  So before you convince yourself that you're afflicted with any disorder, ask yourself first: are you anxious in the company of all people or instead, certain people in specific social settings?  Be aware that your social surrounding changes.  The next change will happen when you set off for college or work.  And your social surroundings from then on will be strictly of your choosing.  I also don't want to speculate on what might've happened in your past, but whatever it might be, be careful with how much responsibility you take for it, how much blame you let yourself place on it.  Bad things, bad experiences, especially when you're younger can have a lasting effect mostly because your ideas are still developing.  Your ideals tend to be firmer and more towards the absolute and you're more susceptible to the emotional impact of dramatic events just as a matter of quantity, ie - the younger you are, the less events you've likely encountered and so they are necessarily more remarkable now, regardless of how remarkable they'll be in retrospect 10 years from now.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention whether you've been on any meds for the social anxiety or depression.  There's a strong contingent that'll readily suggest psychotherapy in conjunction with medication to treat your 'condition.'  And this might very well be called for, but before you embark on that route or very well, /while/ you go that route, consider also finding answers to the most complex of your troubles.  You'll be surprised how therapeutic intellectual edification can be.  Cathartic even.  Continue to broaden your knowledge and field of experience and I promise you that things will just start to 'click'; it's a slow process, but it does happen.  Take care.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART). Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. <br>  <br>  You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing. One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! <br>  <br>  Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally. It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable).|`|KIaZ0Z2laa	you sound like a close friend of mine, he suffers from bi polar. you should probably seek medical help and talk to your parents.|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	You should see a doctor and have blood tests done to start with.

uqj6BMAGaa	Probably not, as it is at most, 10% juice. You're better off buying 100% cranberry juice or getting some cranberry extract pills. Also, to avoid the antibiotics, get some D Mannose. You can buy it at a health food store and it comes in either a pill or a powder. If you get the powder, mix it with some water and drink it. It's a form of sugar derived from cranberries and it will help you immediately! Good luck.|`|mAp90hEeaa	It may help a little but cranberry juice will not cure a urinary tract infection.  Large amounts of water will make the stinging when you pee go away.  Hopefully, you are on an antibiotic for your urinary tract infection.  The concentration of cranberry juice in the cocktail is often not strong enough to do the job.|`|cEMH6xGPaa	If it has cranberry in it, I believe it will suffice. Well, think of it this way: it's better than no juice at all.|`|eSf4jWm4aa	Technically there is a little bit of cranberry juice in it, but since it is the cocktail it is full of sugar and other additives that can cause more problems.
sPT8ikgXaa	Breast enhancement pills do work, BUT you will notice that you'll get fat everywhere else too.  Breasts are fat, the pills you see on tv just increase fat...but they don't target just your breasts...they target all fat on your body.  So if you want to increase the fat in your breasts, fine, but know that you will increase the fat everywhere on your body.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If women could purchase pills to make their breasts larger, most of us would be sporting DDs.

I now go to Pure Fitness, which is by far the cheapest, but its smaller, no pool or steam room either. <br>  If you dont mind spending more $ id go with Lifetime Fitness.

sQu3LLqtaa	If you eat too many oranges you might get the runs but 4 oranges a day and 2 cups of orange juice is not too much.  Oranges are laxative but to get the runs you would need to consume more than what you are consuming.<br>  <br>  Oranges are rich in vitamins A and C and also citrus bioflavonoids that are powerful antioxidants.  Keep eating your oranges.  They are very healthy.<br>  <br>  Raw oranges are much better than orange juice as the sugar content in orange juice is rather high.|`|x6bMwoAUaa	Eating too much oranges might give you the probability of making your stomach hurt, but I think it is really good that you are serving yourself the right amount of fruit a person needs for the day :D|`|dCURE6VQaa	u pee a lot.... thats abt it. really it helps out with the daily fruit servings but thats a lot of sugar so it balances out to too much sugar to count... i think but im not an expert so ya. . . oranges sound really good tho
kKOzl9nUaa	A Brazilian does hurt but last quite a while. I don't remember talking just waiting for the next strip to get pulled off. It is better than shaving from the finish and lasting time. Worse than shaving from the pain. I only got it done once and may get it done again one day. Not awkward if they are professional.|`|f890d82e3b2cb1a15aa475ff75321c1aaa	It's smoother and lasts longer... But those are about the only upsides I see. It has to be a certain length before you can get it waxed and I don't like having hair there, so I couldn't see myself doing it X]. But if I were prone to razor burn or irritation, I might opt for waxing instead.<br>  <br>  And yeh, I'd feel awkward having a stylist do it, too.

kqkPsq5laa	If you are on any kind of antidepressant alcohol does not mix well, in fact alcohol is a depressant or a barbituate. Stay off the sauce in other words!<br>    Welbutrin does not restore your labido it just has no ill affects on it unlike other antideprerssants SSRIs', like anything in the Prozac family of drugs. Although Cymbolta is combined with Welbutrin and Zoloft? I could be wrong on the Zoloft but it is mixed with an SSRI at any rate and should have no ill affect on your labido as one counter acts the other. Cymbalta also has a low success rate too.<br>    Taking this medication first thing in the morning is best as it will keep you awake other wise. If your dose is too high it can make you hyper active for sure. Your doctor should gradually increase the dose till you find a level that is well tollerated. Yes it will enhance your mood but within 2-4 weeks after you start it.<br>    If you need a higher dose to function then you may need a traquilizer to help calm you at night so you can sleep. <br>    Doctors use antipychotic drugs usually to treat patients who do not respond to antidepressants so no you will not need it. <br>    Hope I helped answer some questions.

After that, you can go back to your usual routine.  You can even work out before you go donate, but be sure to keep hydrated and eat something (they will finger prick you right before you donate, and if you have a fever, low iron count or are dehydrated, they won't let you donate).|`|6c4eacbc33273c871bc7185d6f301bc7aa	If you want to, you should do it!

Anyway worth the visit.|`|WOvXaGUYaa	Yes sometimes home pregnancy tests can be inaccurate. Also, as was mentioned above... You could have an irregular period, or under a great deal of stress (emotional or physical) or underweight. Any of these could make your period stop for some amount of time until the problem is fixed.<br>  However, you should really get some blood work done just to know for sure that you are not pregnant. Unfortunately it may cost you, but if you find out later you are pregnant, raising a child will be a lot more expensive than that test.|`|AA12187942	many things can cause missing periods. such as weight gain/loss or hormonal imbalances. Excessive exercise can cause an absence in menses. However, I had a friend that also have 4 preggo tests turn up negative after many months of a missing period. She finally went to her doctor and come to find out she was pregnant after alll. The home Pregnancy tests measure a hormone called HcG and those hormone levels fluctuate in pregnant women and get higher and higher through the first half of pregnancy beforelevelingg out and waning off later in pregnancy. Unfortunately Home pregnancy tests do not have the sensitivity at times to show slight fluctuations in HcG and quantitative blood tests can show with more accuracy ifyou'ree pregnant. Most labcorp offices charge $60 for a Quantitative blood pregnancy tests. There are 2 types of blood pregnancy tests, Quantitative and Qualitative. Qualitative is about as useful as a home pregnancy test and can give a false negative whereas Quantitative actually measures the amount of HcG in your body.<br>  <br>  Certain medications can also mess with your menstrual cycle. I recommend, if at all possible going to a planned parenthood or some other free/cheap clinic to speak with a practitioner about your options. the Quantitative blood pregnancy test is by far the best option.|`|mbB1DK3Taa	Go get a blood test just in case you're worried about pregnancy. The at-home tests usually test for the hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) that's mixed within ur urine for *only* a few days after implantation of the embryo. If you've missed those days, the tests will be negative, as the hCG would no longer be present.|`|Q4314rsOaa	you most liekly havent ovulated. you have to pop out an egg to have your period (in like 99% of cases) unless you are the other 1% i would say that you havent ovulated. here are some things to think about:<br>  <br>  1.
