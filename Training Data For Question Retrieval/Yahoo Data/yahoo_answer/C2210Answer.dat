cg3IaThxaa	Uhhh... yea. <br>  Just build up 2 adult sims of the opposite gender's relationship until they'll have sex. Direct both of them to go to a double bed and relax. Then choose cuddle. From there on they can kiss, make-out, woohoo, or try for baby. Choose try for baby. You can also have sex in hottubes, dressing rooms, photobooths, cars, tents,... I forget the rest. It just depends on what expanision packs you have. They can also get alien pregnant by being abducted by aliens.|`|X6WAOqZOaa	Obviously yes if you used the answers search function you would not have to spend 5 points asking a question that has been asked 5.9 million times.|`|62ca1a09937292cf311358116b02a9d1aa	You can. Go to a bed , if you have some of the addons you'll be able to woohoo in closets and picture booths and other places. Anyways , you need to invite the other person to a bed , usually by asking them to join you wh en you are already in bed. Then click on them and click "Try for Baby". If this option does not exist the relationship is not good enough to try for a baby and you need to work on that , usually by kissing and hugging and stuff like that. <br>  <br>  When Try for baby appears click it , and if the sims are willing to they will have coitus and go under the bed. Hopefully , a baby is conceived , although a Try for Baby does not necessarily guarantee a baby will be born. If nothing happens after a few days , try again.|`|C7UsyVkVaa	no you can't get pregnat, you can get pregnant though|`|laO3osrwaa	Yes you have to have a married couple. And have them both get into a double bed & then click it again then press "Woo Hoo" Hope i helped!|`|V5DnV3fgaa	yes|`|1YizZvzPaa	Yes you can get pregnant on Sims 2. once two adults (female and male) have got a high enough relationship (and are in love) put them either in a bed, hot tub, or whatever. and then click on the other sim and click try for a baby. if you hear a ding then your sim is pregnant, if you don't, then try again. <br>  A normal pregnancy lasts 3 days (sim days).<br>  hope this helps, if any questions please message me|`|xHLoIbZQaa	Yes you can. If you get abducted by aliens you have an alien baby, or if you have two sims, opposite gender obviously, have them do a woo hoo in a bed, hot tub, car, or photo both.|`|e49a7ba7ee0a7801e1dfd7dd6a87e67baa	You can. You need to get two Sims of the opposite sex that like each other a lot. Get them both to relax in a bed or a hot tub. With one of the Sims selected, select the other and press Try for Baby for a chance to get pregnant.|`|EBAy2Tgsaa	yeah you can ok so what u do is get i couple merried or in a good relationship and click on a bed (for two ppl) and it should say "try for a baby" <br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  p.s. u might have to try i few times for it to work:)

At one time, I did demonstrations using this machine for a craft chain store.  It was wonderful for cutting out letters and designs.  You can use it  for cards, scrapbooks, and signs.  The extra costs of running the machine would be the in paper they recommend, the sticky matboards and the cutting blades, and oh, different fonts.  It was very easy to use. (The thicker the paper, the more use the blade gets.)<br>  <br>  This week its on sale at a nationally known fabric store.  It's going for $99.00.  That's the cheapest its ever been.  Really a bargain if you are going to use it a lot.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Enter buy mode and remove the bed on which the Sim is sleeping. The Sim will disappear. When you return to live mode the Sim will reappear somewhere else in the house and all mood bars will be at 100%. <br>  <br>  If your Sim is very depressed, enable the move_objects_on code and pause game play. Click on the Sim in buy/sell mode and click the bottom of the screen to delete him/her. Once deleted go to the live mode and double clock the person's head icon to go to where that Sim is located. Everything should be close to full. <br>  <br>  Enable the move_objects on code, then select a walking Sim with a bad mood in the buy mode. Then, "sell" the Sim. Go back to the live mode and click on the icon of that Sim. Check his/her mood and all except "Room" and "Fun" will be full. <br>  <br>  Enable the move_objects on code. Have your Sim to take a shower of bath. When he or she is in the shower or tub, pause game play and enter buy mode. Click on the shower or tub and delete it. Your Sim and tub/shower will be gone. Your tub/shower will be gone permanently, but your Sim will be walking around in your house somewhere else, usually their room. Their "Energy", "Happiness", and sometimes "Fun" will be almost full.

xf4VPcFGaa	You don't give too much detail but here at the best answers  I can give.<br>  <br>   if you just started the game you won't be able to change the baby until the nurse tells you. Then from there you press the house circle to see your house lay-out, then double tap on the diaper.<br>  <br>  If you see a ! when you try to take the diaper off, it mean the baby is too upset. You'll have to rub it's head, arms, legs to calm it down and talk to it softly until the baby stops crying and the ! disappears. <br>  <br>  If you have a girl you have to remember to wipe the baby front to back, or it'll get upset. You can't just scrub up and down. <br>  <br>  You un-latch one side by tapping and holding and pulling it down. Then do the same thing to the other side. When you're ready to pull down the big part, where the mess is, go slowly, they say the boy pees everywhere but my girl has done it to me also when i pull the diaper off too fast. <br>  <br>  Once the diapers down, lift the feet by tapping and holding the feet till they're up, the baby will hold it's feet up so you can do only one thing at a time. So after you wipe her, she'll drop her feet down again.<br>  <br>  After you wipe you toss the wipe out, then the dirty diaper, then you put on the clean diaper and fold the diaper the same why you took it off, big part- side-side and you're done!|`|UQNgUN0Aaa	Practice on a real baby|`|MnEHO9u9aa	get a life son|`|xPn4ydFKaa	Its a game...try on a real baby...;

gBVCPcNSaa	This is only the beginning...soon it will start to happen more frequently.  Trust me it has happened to me twice.  All you have to do is call microsoft and they will register your unit for you.  Then They will ship out an empty box and a shipping label for you to send back your XBOX 360.  The whole process takes about 3-4 weeks.  There are options for you to fix the XBOX yourself without having to deal with the shipping.  There are some guides that have recently come out to avoid having the problem in the first place and give instructions on how to fix yourself.<br>  <br>  Check out my blog for Redlight xbox related issues and other gaming topics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gaming-deals.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://gaming-deals.blogspot.com</a>|`|125315c108f05e75dfd5c52b267d6dbdaa	what you have to do is call the microsoft company and tell them that your xbox 360 is having that problem and they send you a new one|`|I30Ao40Xaa	its in the first stages soon it will completely shutdown and you'll have to send it away so suggest not playing it|`|MkoivzxUaa	it is proably overhaeting when you were playing it

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No.  You still need the disk in the 360 in order to play.  MS has thought of everything to make sure that you buy the game instead of using a friend or rental game to play.|`|PQy6if0Waa	Nope, you have to have the disc to start the game up.|`|yQXAddNhaa	Yes my friend installed Call of Duty 4 on mine, as well as Fable 2, however, together it took up 15 GBs of space.  WOW...  So I deleted COD4 which took up 7.6 GBs of space.  <br>   <br>  Pros:  In this scenario, you wont have to buy whatever game it is, as well as waste the 30 seconds it takes for you to load the disk in.  NOTE:  Installing games to your hard drive will make that game run smoother than on a disk, for example, In Fable 2, many times scenes use to freeze up, but when I installed it, the performance was improved drastically...  <br>  <br>  Cons:  It will probably take up a good chunk of space, but if you don't have that much hard drive space taken up, then your fine.|`|MkoivzxUaa	No that is not how it works

PTovC2Dqaa	This is one of the most challenging and difficult boss fights in all of Kingdom Hearts. After defeating Maleficent, she is transformed into a dragon and she is also now a lot more powerful. Before entering the black hole, put the Beast and Donald in you rparty and equip the Ars Arcanum and Strike Raid abilities.<br>  <br>  Right when the battle begins, summon Tinkerbell to help you out with your HP. Also, cast Aerora to help you with defense. The dragon unleashes destruction upon the area directly in front of it, so avoid standing there too much. Jump and glide to the dragon's rear legs, and jump on its back. Run along the length of the dragon to the base of its neck, and use the Strike Raid ability when its head reaches your level.<br>  <br>  It's critical to use combos during Strike Raid. Whatch your attack menu and use the ''Raid'' command at the moment it shows up. Do this several times successfully, and the final ''Judgment'' combo command will appear.<br>  <br>  These string of attacks will completely deplete your MP, so use an Ether or Megalixir (depending on your party's condition) and do the ability again. When the dragon has just a little health remaining, it will probably shake Sora off of its back. It's very difficult to get back on the dragon, so stand a few steps under it and use the Ars Arcanum ability. <br>  <br>  If the dragon moves, or if you run out of MP, run under its head and use several phisical combos to its nose until the battle is over. For winning this fight, you receive the FIREGLOW. This is a new summon stone that summons out Mushu. You also obtain 6,000 EXP from the dragon.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	This battle is really tough, unless you know the Dragon's weak spot. As the battle starts, glide around back of the Dragon and jump on its hind leg. Walk on to its back and stay there. Now use Strike Raid over and over again, using Ethers when you need to replenish your MP. If you get thrown off, simply climb back up again and continue this process.<br>  <br>  Attacks include green dragon breath that stays burning on the floor, continuous shockwaves that cover the entire area EVERY time the Dragon takes a step, claw swipes, devastating bite attacks, and homing fire. This is a nasty battle, even for the well prepared gamer. If you see the Dragon pause and lift its head up a little, be prepared to be launched from its back, taking minor damage.<br>  <br>  You could just stay on the Dragon's back until Goofy and Donald take care of it, but that would take quite a long time.|`|aiuyco9naa	it took me a long time to beat her but when i did i was in for a harder fight, Riku. For malificent dragon form make sure you have beast in your party and Aerora in your shortcuts. Imedatly cast aerora and summon tinkerbelle so you will have a high gaurd and regain health constantly. Also make sure you stock up on hi-potions and ethers and such. From then on just keep attacking with your keyblade. (i recomend the olympus keyblade)

It doesn't matter whether they are destroyed or not before the damage is dealt.<br>  <br>  In this case, the blocking creature will be destroyed, but the damage will not be dealt, because the blocked creature will still be blocked. The blocking creatures simply ceases to exist.<br>  <br>  Hope that Helped!|`|DdkyUEnhaa	It basically works like this: At any point or time that you declare a creature to block another attacking creature, that attacking creature is considered blocked, therefore, no damage will go through even if he uses Dark Temper. <br>  <br>  To actually get damage through, he should have dealt damage to the creature before allowing you to declare blockers and the creature would have to go through UNBLOCKED. When ever a creature is blocked, it does not do damage in the damage step unless it has trample or another special ability.|`|OrDZ3TdAaa	depends on if the creature has the ability to attack player directly or if it is shadow and cant be blocked or flying and cannot be blocked.<br>  Also look up official rules and look under stacking.|`|n0qG9ptzaa	he can do that if his card has haste. if it doesn't then u cant|`|l6lh6fT8aa	If it has Trample, it will hit you. If it does not, then it is still considered blocked and won't hit you.<br>  <br>  However, if your opponent destroys the creature before you declare it as a blocker, then it will get through.

8pIGQdybaa	You've gotten some good answers on what Mod Podge is -- a glue and sealer for decoupage projects. After you've glued your pictures down, you put quite a few coats of Mod Podge over the entire surface to give a nice, shiny protective finish. It goes on with a whitish shade but dries clear. You have to allow it to dry between each coat, so it can be time consuming. If you're planning a project, I would recommend a light, feathery-type brush to avoid lines in your finish.|`|0C3O3feraa	mod-podge is a glue that drys clear and is great for crafts.|`|SdHqyWKHaa	From the Plaid website:"Mod Podge? is the original all-in-one glue, sealer and finish."

mHWsuqjZaa	well crush card is a terrible card to have in a lightsworn deck. I can guarantee you that it will be more of a dead draw than help.  plaugespreader is a good card to have, nut 2 jain is kind of over kill. Drop her down to 1.  In her place add a phantom of chaos, this card can be amazing in tight situations. 2 ryko overkill, only use 1. Instead of using MST is your main deck you should use giant trunade, just a little FF, it's alot easier on you.  Your trap set up is terrible... Use 2 threatening roar and 2 beakoning light as you dont want a big backfield with this deck. and thats about it, those are the changes i would make and it will save you from having to get CCV.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	take out 3 cold wave and add in 3 foolish burial.

6FBpafUYaa	I have never seen those advertised separately, but then again I haven't looked for them. I would look at the r/c boat manufacturers to see if you can get something from them, Dumas and Traxxas would likely be good places to start.
dXEo2xpqaa	You can't edit family members after you make the family, unless you want to add a family member, with that you try for a baby. You get two Sims two fall in love (Different gender) and then have them relax on a double bed, click the Sim that you aren't playing as, and if you have a high enough relationship, one of the options should be "Try for Baby" Click that. After they try for the baby, if your Sim is pregnant, you will hear part of a lullaby, and she will have morning sickness. Only girls can get pregnant, and not teens. If you want twins, it's a 10% chance. I have heard that if you make the pregnant Sim eat nothing but cheesecake, she will have twins. But I know a way you will have twins for sure.<br>  Open the cheat window (Ctrl+Shift+C) all at once, and type in, "forcetwins" exactly how I typed it, but without ""<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how to break family relations, but I know that if you want an adult to move out, have the adult you want to move out go to the computer or newspaper. Click on the computer or newspaper, then click "Find own Place" A box will come up in a couple seconds asking who you want that Sim to bring along, you don't have to bring anybody along. If you don't want to bring anyone along just click the check-mark without moving anybody over.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Please answer my question!<br>  Here's a link:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao5h1KTJgCKE5zjWtu5lHS_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222142852AAyDaIj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

AA10744471	Hosting a cool party can be fun and exciting, but if you've never been the party host before, you may be unsure of how to proceed in planning your fabulous party. Follow these tips to plan and throw the perfect party!<br>  <br>  Step1 Decide on a party theme which can add an fun element to your party. Some party themes include and are not limited to: 20s, 60s, 70s, 80s, James Bond, Graduation, Christmas, New Years, Birthday, Black Tie, Cocktail, Pimps & Hos/CEOs & Corporate Hos, Mardi Gras, Cowboys, Costume, Vegas, Murder Mystery...etc. Once you decide your theme, make your invitations and send them out 3-4 weeks in advance. Consider sending out Evites to save on paper and postage. That way you can also send people updates and reminders as the party date arrives. <br>  Step2 Set the mood of your <br>  party  with lights from Pretty Glow Set the MOOD. <br>  Lighting is very important in setting the mood of your party. Big white candles are elegant for any theme. Do your lights have dimmers? Then dim the lights! If not, use soft colored bulbs with candles. DO you want it to feel cool or warm? Use blue bulbs for cool, or soft pink bulbs for a warmer feel. <br>  Step3 Serve the right FOOD. When hosting a party, it's best to go with bite-size everything. It's less messy and awkward. Some ideas to try:<br>  Mini Cupcakes<br>  Mini Quiches<br>  Mini Burgers<br>  Mini Sandwiches<br>  Cherry Tomatoes<br>  Mini Tarts<br>  Serve whatever you want, but keep it small. Also keep in mind that people LOVE comfort food. Have a buffet of mini foods, appetizers, yummy desserts and a fun bar with specialty drinks. Cheese platters always seem to do well and don't forget to include some fresh fruit! However, when deciding what food to serve, take into consideration you party theme, as you may have the opportunity to get creative and serve food that goes with the party theme. <br>  Step4 Be COOL.<br>  You are the hostess, so even if you are stressed out or frazzled, play it cool. Make introductions as guests arrive to keep people mingling and having a good time. Take a deep breath, envision yourself being the perfect party host and then go for it. <br>  Step5 Look HOT. <br>  If you feel overdressed for the party...perfect! You should look the best! Looking and dressing your best will make you FEEL your best. Dress fancy and you will shine as host or hostess. Plan a trip to the salon before your party to freshen up your look. <br>  Step6 www.daprisuniquegifts.com Scent.<br>  If the mood lighting candles you are using do not have a scent, find something that gives off the scent you want for your party. Just remember to stay away from sicky sweet smelling candles & potpourris. <br>  Step7 www.myfloralarrangements.com/ Flowers.<br>  Find a bold bouquet(s) to spruce up the place. One on the buffet table would be great as well as any other side tables or coffee tables. If your party is in the summer season, head to your local farmers market for bunches of flowers for a deal. If your party is in the winter season, go for poinsettias. <br>  Step8 Music.<br>  Keep music going constantly. No one enjoys awkward silence at a party. Play a variety of music including all time classics from the Jackson Five, Jimmy Buffet, Journey, Bob Marley, Guns N' roses, Aerosmith, Madonna, to Jay-Z, Gnarls Barkley, Brittney Spears, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg and whatever else you like in-between. Make a playlist on your computer or Ipod, hook it up to the stereo system and let it go all night! <br>  Step9 Entertainment.<br>  Keep a few games on hand for people to play if conversation gets dull or the party is lagging. Have at least 1 deck of cards. "Catch Phrase" is great because you don't have to set up any game pieces. You can just divide into teams and play, the game device keeps track of score. "Scene It" is fun too or check out the book "50 of the Finest Adult Party Games". There's nothing like games and competition to help loosen people up and feel more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  Have a small wine tasting party. Serve a couple varieties of wine along with a platter of cheeses, grapes, cherries, crackers, and nuts.<br>   <br>  Put some fresh flowers in a cup in the bathroom and have a great lotion on hand for guests to use.<br>   <br>  If things start to die down, stay positive and upbeat. Introduce a game.<br>   <br>  Hire a bartender or ask someone good with drinks to be in charge of the bar if you can.|`|f3z1dtQYaa	My advice to you is to just be yourself. Let yourself come out, and the party will be great. Meaning, if you choose things you like, your friends should like it too, and it'll turn out a success!

AA11346465	I think it's this -  You bet on say 5 horses / dogs to come in 1st 2nd or 3rd. All of your bets MUST come 1st 2nd or 3rd and the money u win builds up and goes onto the next race. If any bet comes in after 3rd you lose!|`|IdtzdpqGaa	do you mean a accumulator that uses air and fluid, if that is what you looking for i can explain it, but don't want to go through it if that is not what you need|`|Nc0mxdY5aa	Lets break this up a bit-    Each-way - meaning each of your selcections must place 1st/2nd/3rd (or 4th in horse-racing handicap with 16 or more runners).    Accumulator - meaning all of your selections must win/place - your win/place stake will then be placed on your next selection and so on.    If any one of your selection does not win or place then the bet is lost.

6GIrW5eWaa	when you say broken/loose do you mean that it has to be moved back and forth or up and down to get the same whammy affect? Our original guitar had this issue and less opening up the guitar and replacing or fixing the spring there is one other options besides making your fat cousin buy you one. Take a rubber band and wrap it around the whammy bar and take the other end and wrap it around the strap post on the bottom of the guitar this is what we ended up doing and it worked fine. Get a strong rubber band or one of those items girls use to put their hair in a pony tail. Hope it works out for you.|`|Wmn5Bh1Zaa	The same thing happened to mine.  I took it apart and looked at it - basically all that holds it together is a thin piece of plastic.  There's really no way to repair it.  For some reason, even though it is broken off of the plastic, mine still works.  There is no springiness to it, but it will still work on the notes.  If yours doesn't work at all, get a new guitar controller.

Great Cave Offensive has 60 treasures. Milky Way Wishes has 19 abilities. And with Gourmet Race, you have to beat it on all three stages. All other stages merely need to be completed, as they do not have extra stuff to unlock at all.
WmTxlHi1aa	Ya, me too. I don't lag when I host on b.net but I lag when I host on garena especially 5v5. Usually lags a lot at the beginning while picking heroes.

0brkUyGgaa	There are several ways.<br>  <br>  The best way is to lower the brightness. Brightness takes a toll on your Nintendo DS' life. And if you can, try to avoid games that take a toll on its lifespan. These include games like Elite Beat Agents, which uses far higher sound quality than other games, Animal Crossing: Wild World, which uses far more battery life while the Nintendo DS is in sleep mode, and others. And definitely do not play online if it can be avoided. That really kills battery life. Go into sleep mode as little as possible: if you're going to stop playing the DS for an elongated period of time, save and quit. Also, an idea would be to play a Game Boy Advance game if you're in the mood - they take significantly less battery life up.<br>  <br>  But the most practical suggestion is to only play when there's nothing else interesting happening, or try to conserve your play as much as you can. Don't want to use it all up when there's tons of stuff going on and then be disappointed when you're terribly bored.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Turn the background light down on the lowest setting, or off if it is the original ds. <br>  Never turn the sound on.<br>  If you want to put it down for a while, save and turn it off, don't just pause and close it.|`|MnEHO9u9aa	put it under a pillow|`|Del5F0anaa	Soak your nintendo ds in salt water|`|gB5ATj7aaa	turning the brightness right down, and keeping the sound off.

ufU0VNLUaa	This is how to Defeat Sensei: 1.Ok so first, you have to get each belts by defeating other players, (take the competition mode, you can get the belts faster while taking the competition mode) 2. You might not get the belts so fast, just keep playing, if you keep losing thats normal, just keep playing other players till you get the black belt. 3. Once you get the black belt then your ready to defeat the Sensei! At first he will win, just keep playing with him until he messes up, i'm serious, he will mess up. 4. When beating the Sensei, you might want to choose water first, it works for me by choosing the water, then choose fire or snow, then if you win, you get to be a ninja. 5. Check out the secret ninja room! It looks cool, you can defeat other players and throw snowballs at the drums on top of the ceiling, but the matrial artworks are only for members, :(, oh and in order to be a shadow you have to get the powerful ninja suit in matrial artbooks catalog, oh well I am not a member but I don't care! I will still be a ninja, and I hope you will too! Wishing you all good luck! If you need any questions ask me!<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh my gosh, what is wrong with you people?

nsUeaPCLaa	you need to make sure that there are no wireless  phones, or microwaves, or anything like that that is running on the same frequency.. Also, type in on youtube, Xbox 360 wireless network Adapter boost, or something like that, and there is a video on how to make it stronger, it involves wrapping tinfoil and stuff around your adapter (making it look stupid) but if you are that concerned, it's worth it.

gTDzR23jaa	Halo 3 is a much better game.  Here's why:<br>  1. Better plot.  the plot of halo 3 is much more exciting, and you actually care about what happens<br>  2. Takes more skill.  In GOW2, you die within like 2 seconds of being shot.  Al the weapons are exactly the same.  In halo 3, the weapons all have their separate uses, and you can only carry two, so you have to choose.<br>  3. Stupid checkpoints: Halo 3 has checkpoints whenever you finish something, or walk a long way.  GOW2 has checkpoints right before cutscenes, so when you die, you have to watch teh cutscene again and again.<br>  4. Better characters:  Master chief s a total beast.  In GOw2, you don't really care about the people in it.<br>  <br>  And then there's the multiplayer.  halo 3 has the best online playing of any game in history, almost everyone would agree with me on that one.  It also has better maps.<br>  I know this sounds like I hate GOW2.  I don't hate it, in fact I think it's a good game.  I just think halo 3 is way better.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Gears of War 2 definitely.  The campaign is really bloody and sad though.  It's got a much better story than Halo's, it's a lot more fun, and less predictable, and the enemies are much smarter.  Plus, it has more difficulty levels to choose from, and when u get really good, it will still be really challenging.  It also has horde mode where u fight a ton of waves of enemies.  It's really hard, and really fun.  <br>  <br>  Plus, Gears has bots that u can play multiplayer with.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	i played halo yesterday for fun for the first time in a while but i sold it.gears it def a lott better in my oppinion|`|zvzjZwFnaa	GoW2 has massive gore but people still play halo.  i'd go with halo 3 if you're a fan of the series but GoW is definitely better<br>  <br>  ps. bobbyjoe doesn't know what he's talking about|`|5lXouSKAaa	Gear of War 2.

vTkqJyzXaa	Okay, not knowing your current OS, or your graphics card, this is what i can tell you. having a 1.4ghz CPU is okay just meets the requirements, and 760MB of RAM, they just peak over the minimum. So have a better CPU or more RAM would be better, adding to that you might have programs running in the background, i haven't played WOW but can you try the quality etc down to the lowest this might help in making the game less choppy, if your problems conisit if you get team viewer i can help, email me at gazahscd@aim.com if you want me to help further.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You have low RAM and a low processor speed.

Then if you challenged them they would have to receive 8 cards. If you challenge the other player and their Draw 4 was the only playable card they had, then you have to draw 8 cards.

The best way to rank up to level 10 is to play hangmans noose on hard over and over again because you make about 2500 every game which is like 2 and a half minutes.

From there, you can usually find your NAT settings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure when you go to your network connections, make sure your home network allows you to share your internet connection (ICS enabled).
