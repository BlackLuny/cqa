JfVxCDb7aa	in excess yes<br>  <br>  but so could cheese kurds etc|`|PgFYPZg2aa	It's actually two beef patties and a couple slices of cheese with onion, pickle, ketchup, and mustard in between two buns.|`|WngxQDiaaa	Its no worse than any other burger you get at a restuarant.  Besides, eating one once in a while is not going to give you a heart attack.  It's the constant eating of fried full of fat foods that clogs up your arterties.|`|zTeW6BIIaa	er, yea. it's 1/2 a pound of meat. <br>  <br>  calories: 740<br>  fat grams: 42<br>  sat fat: 19<br>  trans fat: 2.5<br>  cholesterol: 155<br>  sodium: 1380<br>  carbs: 40<br>  :P|`|pueeMH6gaa	I prefer to think of it as future vomit.  Although given the greasy fat in it, your description isn't bad.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	Yes, it is full of FAT and sodium. Not good for you at all.|`|ryh5AslRaa	considering its not really a quarter of a lb with an extra meat patty on it yes|`|aEbbzvioaa	who cares its delicous|`|G0QugnQ8aa	yes, especially if you already have high cholesterol|`|86DFnYt8aa	yes|`|NTEuxMVmaa	sure ,but you'll die smiling|`|SfludeD5aa	yes|`|JQhYc5DVaa	not really as long as you dont eat it too often|`|IPFCtyvQaa	well... in a way, but you only get one life sooooo so  wat if it is u no?|`|kMDAjsBnaa	Its not an agree or disagree...<br>  <br>  The fact is that anything at McDonalds is unhealthy. Even the salads.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	no i have worked there as a young adult and its not no worse then anything else its probley better then the fried foods|`|4yhWdTjhaa	YES!|`|bwoVogaOaa	YES!
QJmGo5fFaa	There is nothing wrong with going to a restaurant to see a game if they have a television in the bar area that's what it's there for.  Look for places like applebee's or chili's if they are in your area.  They are not overly crowded and at the same time very laid back.  most the time you can find other people like yourself just there to catch a quick bite while later plans unfold.  P.S. looking 16 just means your going to be beautiful longer than the rest btw.|`|AA10720479	If you're 16 you cant get into any bar. Maybe a place like BW3, or Damons grill would work, but you need to order something, you can't just go to watch t.v.
mzk0t6Ovaa	Up on  W 56th is Patsy's. . .  Haven't been for awhile, but IIRC, it's<br>  about a mile or so of a walk.  Exceptional food.|`|vGTzWCjraa	Patsy's is always good.  I've heard that Biricchino is pretty good too.  Not a lot around there like your looking for.
M0qbyACRaa	Honesty is ALWAYS the best policy.<br>  so no , don't say you have a screwdriver.<br>  <br>  Just say " alcohol doesn't agree with me, but I have no problem when other people drink"<br>  <br>  and yes , there are many drinks you can just order virgin.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	you can always order a soda or gingerale, just because you don't drink doesn't mean you can't have fun! you don't have to order some fancy drink- just ask for a coke, or cranberry juice. now did this dr run test to determine that you have this disorder. red wine is very different than have another type of alcohol.|`|40f9996319d13867c4bbea47b436ef3aaa	No one has to know what you are ordering.  Excuse yourself walk up to the bar and order an orange juice and seltzer or sprite.  Say you are drinking a screwdriver (oj and vodka).<br>  <br>  Thats what my mom always does!|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	you could always order a drink but have no alcohol put in it they call it a virgin drink but you don't have to call it that you could order strawberry  daiquirii but i do believee they call it a virgin strawberry daiquirii i hope this helps you could ask her what she wants then go order for the both of you she will never know there is no alcohol in yours good luck
JfVxCDb7aa	egg mcmuffin's are AWFUL !!!!<br>  <br>  but give me 2 big macs for 3 bucks and I'd eat there a lot more often|`|bcTErNF6aa	No that's why it is called 2 3 dollar deal the old saying wheres the beef eggs are over cook taste like rubber no thanks I learn to cook a better sandwich / Ha|`|TiEwwRzaaa	no, i hate the way everything is always "supersized" . .|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	nope. i dont eat out|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	no i feel like you pay for what you get|`|yyvcryrbaa	no
x3jBQaGYaa	it depends if its in...<br>  freezer-3 weeks<br>  by a window- around 2 weeks<br>  in a dark cabinet- 1 or 2 weeks<br>  and siting out on a cabinet 2 weeks<br>  (i did a project on it)|`|b2938a13192fed60597e4f746b8425edaa	2-3 weeks.
JfVxCDb7aa	they love to disrespect people.<br>  <br>  I really hate what you're describing too. If you bring them back, expect even worse service and food quality your next visit (thats true of any restaurant)|`|bcTErNF6aa	Maybe You should say Super Size you get a regular Ha|`|8bHuUJczaa	I know! that happens to me sometimes! It's like, give the customer what you said you were going to give them or stop advertising it! Stop making sales if your nothing is really on sale at Mcdonalds!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1T2qiNIvaa	It's because of food costs.  They think it's more important to save money than to satisfy their customers.  If you want a full fry, go to arbys.  We have to "over stuff" the boxes.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I'm not sure. I haven't  been there in a while. They are probably effected by the recession too.|`|utbfT0APaa	That's telling them. I like mine full too.|`|nzWux9Meaa	I know exactly what you are saying, but it really is usually accidental. This usually happens one of two ways. One way may be that the employee is simply very rushed and only gets a small amount of fries into the container. This happens when there are a lot of fry orders in the lobby and in the drive through. The second way this happens may be when you fill up the container and you put it in the shelf to get picked up  fries always fall out. This obviously gives the employee no right/excuse to do this. I generally just refill it when the fries are sitting in the shelf. When anyone fills up the fries they should be overfilled not half filled. So again I just wanted to let you guys know my side of the story, but obviously you have every right to get your moneys worth and they should completely fill up your fries.|`|g2zNC1sqaa	Damn, you should see them here in Australia!, the big mac is like, a freaking normal hamburger from hungry jacks, even smaller!<br>  <br>  They used to fill me up, now im like, WTF IS THIS?!<br>  <br>  Anyway, your better off going to a different fast food place.|`|OYFoYDOaaa	BUSINESS|`|NTEuxMVmaa	i agree,price goes up ,product gets smaller
