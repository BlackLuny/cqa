20090222144529AAlQcJS	Health;Mental Health	Can "SSRI poop out" cause withdrawal symptoms?	I'm not even on an SSRI - I'm on an antidepressant known as Mirtazapine (Remeron) and have been on it for 10 years (began taking it when I was 14 due to IBS and loss of appetite, mild depression associated with being a teenager).      The drug worked wonders and even made me happy for several years, it still helps me to go to sleep and with appetite, not as much as it used to but it still does.      However I keep hearing about the "prozac poop out" or antidepressants "pooping out----"      Would this "poop out" cause withdrawal symptoms (much like when benzodiazepine tolerance occurs and then 'tolerance withdrawal' symptoms occur?)      I am currently slowly tapering a benzodiazepine my doctor hooked me on a year ago, and the reason why I was put on it was due to some panic episodes after taking some birth control pills. I am getting off of it is because I developed a phenomenon known as "tolerance withdrawal" - it is when you develop tolerance to the benzodiazepine and it then causes withdrawal symptoms.   I am a senior member on www.benzowithdrawal.com and am coming along well with it.      but      I wonder      When the ADs "poop out," do they cause withdrawal symptoms in the same nature as tolerance withdrawal from benzodiazepines?      Thanks and many judos for anyone who might know! :)

I always have to wear a hoodie or a sweatshirt when I go to school. They keep our school very cold because they're trying to save money and to save energy.

If you could help me out with the information about the product, that'd be great. Thanks! :)

20090222145307AAl0S5q	Health;Women's Health	My gf hasn't had period in 39 days...  i'm worried.?	So my gf hasn't had a period since January 14, and needless to say, we're both concerned. Now let me give you the facts:      - She is in her mid 20's.      - She is not on birth control, but I always use a condom. However, sometimes I am inside of her unprotected, but only for a couple of minutes at the beginning, and I've never come close to finishing inside of her (whenever I do, it's with the condom on).      - We've only had sex about 10 times since her last period.      - She took a 'Top Care' (supposedly an ept clone) HPT on Thursday (35th day), and it was negative. She took another HPT (first response early detection) two days after that, and that was also negative. The first response in particular is supposedly very sensitive, and if you have even a trace of hcg, it should show a faint 2nd line indicating pregnancy, but she only had 1 line, and no sign of a second.      - She has been pregnant twice before and both times she'd taken pregnancy tests and both showed positive at those times.      - For the past week, she's had dull abdominal pains and nausea (though she never actually vomited). It started last week, then peaked in pain about 3 days after, and then today she felt fine with almost no pain/nausea at all.      - There has been a strain of stomach flu going around, if that's relevant.      So that's all the relevant info I could think of. Thoughts?

I've been having a ringing in my ears for the past few years, but recently its been getting really severe. I've been having a few more issues, perhaps a minor bit of hearing loss? I only notice it because sometimes my ears "pop," and I hear better, and it gradually goes back to the normal softness.      But back to the original question, will having tinnitus disqualify from the army? I don't want to go through with having the doctor diagnose me, then get told that I cannot go through with my military training and be a soldier medic. The "hearing loss" isn't that severe, so it won't stop me from being able to do my job. I also have a past family history of meniere's syndrome, which consists of tinnitus, hearing loss, loss of balance, vertigo, etc.

It is very uncomfortable but after it gets used to it, the pain goes away.  For the past week, the pain has been more consistent and there is also swelling behind my right ear, under the jaw line.       I was told by my orthodontist that I do have TMJ problems. I had braces and a mouth piece that I stopped wearing after two years (because I was sick of having braces and I was sick of having this huge thing in my mouth, I had braces for a total of four years).. I haven't had braces in five years. The clicking and popping of the jaw was always there, and has never been a problem for me, but now the swelling won't go away..      Is it TMJ or Molar problems??      Also, I've been eating a lot of beef jerky at work (to give me some protein) which, as you know, is very tough to chew on.. I'm going to stop eating it and finding a protein source elsewhere..

20090222151721AAFqI3g	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does it ever make you sad to see you family eating junk food?  Its scary.?	My dad eats so bad, but he thinks he's eating healthy.  He is a big guy: 6'6 with lots of muscles, but he also has a huge belly.  He weighs about 300 lbs.   Today my mom bought him literally 20 yogurts from the store.    Since he is a big guy (and I believe that he is depressed and addicted to food) he will probably eat all of those in about 1-3 days.   My mom and dad think that yogurt is healthy (because he could be eating worse stuff), but each of those yougurts has 37 grams of sugar!!!   If he eats all 20 that will be 740 grams of sugar, plus all the other food he eats in just a few days.        Also today at the store my mom was looking at some zero calorie flavored water.  The problem is that the water has 6 carbs per serving and 2.5 servings per bottle.   Thats actually 60 calories, regardless of what it actually claims.   I told my mom, why dont you just drink regular water and she said "I just dont drink water.  I just dont like it."    She also eats tons of cereal which has a lot of sugar even though it is the "healthy" cereal.      My parents have been eating slightly healthier because i have been forcing them too, but they still are eating mostly crap.   My parents are only 49 and 52 years old and they have this mentality that they are too old to make changes.   My problem and fear is that they are too old NOT to make changes.   I cant even fathom something happening to them and I just wish they could see the light.  I have made a big turn around myself and I have been obese since I was a little kid.  I drink tons of water, whole foods, watch my sugar and my blood pressure has actually gone down since the last time i went to the doctor.  I just dont know what to do.  They are so stubborn and it scares me.

20090222110531AAm99pF	Health;Alternative Medicine	Is love necessary for a healthy life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.

One of the things about growing older is that you start to come to terms with who you are, rather than who you want to be. BUT, I've finally learned to be myself and I don't like it! I want to be confident and "give a sh*t" but my natural self isn't that way. I'm naturally a shy and nervous person.    BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE!   But it's the REAL me.   How do YOU come to terms with the fact you can't be who you want to be? How do you find peace with it?   We have to keep it real. Not fake it. But if the real you is not who you wanted then how do you cope?

20090222155916AAoUwvo	Health;Mental Health	Schizophrenia: how can I decipher what is real and what is not?	Other people with schizophrenia or psychosis: how can you determine what 'unusual' things you see are real or not? Is it possible to make that distinction between hallucination and reality when that hallucination is not necessarily atypical to begin with?      I have visual disturbances (i.e. mainly to do with colors, patterns and seeing flashes) , but my question concerns seeing things that are not totally 'out there', e.g.  seeing something odd, but at the same time is plausible-- like a very unusual-looking car, or a conversation with someone.      I ask this because I had a man approached me in the subway and had an odd conversation with me.  There is nothing really unusual about this-- I'm not an unattractive female and dress nice and therefore appear approachable, especially next to 90% of the people that take public transport - , but I was feeling really anxious that day and am slightly paranoid; once he left my lip started twitching (which never happened to me before).     The experience seemed real but given that I wasn't feeling particularly stable that day, I wonder how possible it is I imagined it.   Public transport is not the best example-- it's possible that the person talking to you has mental issues, Alzheimer's or is on a substance, so when the conversation seems weird, it's because that person, and not you, is weird.      Are there "signs" or feelings you have before, during or after the "hallucination"?   Is there something I can do to determine whether it is real or not?

They discussed it and everything, and they went to pink out her ring, but when he looked in his wallet, he didn't have enough money. Well, the reason he didn't have enough money, is because he spent his pay on "weed" and then, when him and his "buddy" were high, they went to buy some oxi-kodine pills. It really pissed off my sister, and to me, that's like saying she's not good enough, or that his drugs are more important than her or something. She trusts me and tells me everything, but I feel that with him, she's going down the wrong path. He might get her to be that way also. She told him to stop herowin, and he did...she said the only thing he could do, was "weed" and I told her that she shouldn't have even told him that. He's 18 with no drivers license or permit, no car, and the only job he has, is farm work. I know she cares about him a lot, and loves him. Her schoolw ork has even improved signaficantly. Anyhow, I worry about what her future holds. She trusts me, but I had to tell our parents about it, then, let them decide what to do. However, I feel guilty for telling them, because I know how much she cares about him, and I don't want to betray her trust. But it's for her better interst. So, did I do the right thing by telling?

I am a teenager, almost out of HS, and I haven't been truly happy for a long time. I am not clinically depressed. I just can't seem to interact with others, and I am tired of living. I am trying to get help, but it doesn't seem to be working. I like to think that if my life doesn't get better by the time I graduate college, I will kill myself. However, I know that suicide is wrong and would hurt my family, so I wouldn't actually do it. I don't know what I am going to do with myself nevertheless. Life only gets harder, so if I can't take it now, how am I going to deal with life later? I know that I have a lot more than most people, but I seem to be less adapted to everything. I like people, but people don't seem to like me. I try to volunteer out of school, I am a fair student, and I participate in school activities to no avail. What now?
20090222103939AAAXzBr	Health;Men's Health	Inflamed vein near frenulum/head of the penis?	About a week ago I gave my boyfriend a somewhat rough ******* (more aggressive than usual, anyway) and I might have accidentally bit or injured something near the head, around the frenulum. A couple days later he noticed that the frenulum or possibly a vein running up towards the head around the frenulum was inflamed. Not severely, but slightly enlarged and swollen, and painful when touched. We only have sex with each other (we've been together 8 months) and neither of us have STD's, so that can be ruled out. Do you know what this complication could possibly be? Thanks!

20090222111403AAHCphM	Health;Mental Health	Why do i worry what people think?	I feel like everyone hates me. I'm so insecure it's ruining my life. I'm very quiet normally but i've got all this pain and resentment inside because i feel that people think they are better than me. It's a huge inadequacy complex and it's making me bitter and i don't know how to stop it. I've been dumped two days ago because he says i "can't handle his lifestyle" and "i'm too insecure" cos he's a musician in a successful band. I feel like his bandmates don't like me and don't approve and look down their noses at me (which they do, they are very arrogant). Am i ever going to have a relationship where i feel comfortable and good enough. Am i always going to worry that people will find out how insecure i am and leave me because of it cos it seems to be a running trend in my life. Why do i care so much what people think? It's weird, i don't think i'm a bad person at all, I just get scared that everyone will find out how weak i am and how much i doubt myself and then lose all respect for me.

At one point just the tip of the penis was inside of me... not the whole thing... just the tip.  It only last for about 5 seconds until I realized what had happened and I stopped it immediately.  So I know I haven't had sex... but am I still a virgin?

Can you tell your dr only 2 or 3 not 7 or 10?      2.What all happens after you find out your pregnant?       3.How many dr visits do you have? Are these at the hospital visits or are they dr office visits? I am planning on having a homebirth so would I even have to go the drs office or a hospital or would the midwhife come to me?      4.What kind of things does the midwhife do and use during labor and pregnacy?      5.How much easier does the birth go with a midwhife?      6.How many complications afterwards are there? My friend had a baby and got a bad flue and ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks! Is that normal or rare?      7.Once the baby belly shrinks will I be back to normal size depending on how much weight I gain?      8.How do I keep my face from breaing out so bad during pregnacy      9.Would it be okay to drink no more than 2 cups of coffee a day?         Adopting      How much does it cost to adopt a baby      What is the process of getting the adopted baby      Will the child soon hate me cuz i"m not his/her birth mther      How do I know I will even love the child? Or if my husband will?      these are things I need direct answers to. Please I want serious answers.

Okay, l was pregnant when this all began, I asked my OB/GYN when I first noticed it in November . It looked like a bruise about the size of a quarter above my right knee, it also looked raised. I told him my leg was numb around that area, and that if I walked a lot my whole leg would go numb and tingle.He told me it was a busted blood vessel and that I had extra fluid putting pressure on it bc I was pregnant, and that it would go away after the baby was born. He sent me to physical therapy for my back & this but it didn't seem to help.      Well it's been about a month since I had my baby and I still have the spot,still looks inflamed & numb.   The numbness when I walk has gotten better but I still have numbness around the spot and like a dull aching pain almost all the time. My toes sometimes go numb and get cold. I have an appointment with a neurologist, but I really don't know who I need to see, this was who my Dr suggested if the problem didn't get better. Would love some input. Thanks

Holistic healing, positive thinking etc.?	am 28 yo, and had a tumor taken out of my thumb recently. The orthoepeadic surgeon says that the results from the pathologist says its a malignant tumor (Epithelioid Sarcoma) and I need to get my thumb amputated. I intend to get a second opinion on that.      But am wondering if they indeed amputate the thumb, how is life without a thumb? Has anyone had that experience? They also mentioned that they could replace the thumb with a toe from my foot, but I am not very keen on that as I don't want surgery in two places.      Does anyone know of any sucessful treatment for cancerous tumor in the thumb without amputation? I am open to holistic healing, and alternative therapies. I am also considering ignoring the whole thing and just doing positive thinking and meditation. Has anyone able to cure themselves or their relative with just positive thinking and mediation?      Thanks in advance fro everyone who answers!      Additional details: I have had this tumorous growth on my thumb for about 2 years. It never caused any pain. I didn't go to the doctor thinking it wasn' that important.

20090202075648AAWk9s3	Health;Mental Health	What can I do about my depression, and my lack of communication to my parents?	If you don't want to read all the details, just skip down to the last paragraph      Since I was 11 I have been suicidal on and off, and there really hasn't been more than a week's worth of time where I haven't been depressed or felt completely and utterly empty. I'm 14 now, turning 15 in March, and these past weeks have been really bad. I just can't stand all the bad traits of people, the repetition of everything, and I don't know, I've been feeling EXTREMELY empty. And at first I was so monotonous that I wasn't even depressed because I wasn't feeling anything- but since last night my depression has returned, and it feels stronger than ever.      In the past, I was always able to help myself out of my own depression, but these days more than ever I lack any bit of motivation or will to push myself forward. A couple of people have told me that I might have a mental disorder- and this is where lack of communication to my parents come in      I admit that the worst of my emotions are probably coming from "teen hormones," but considering that I have had about 4 years of depression now, I'm also willing to look for professional help with the bit of sanity I have left. But with my age, I can only get professional help through my parents. But they don't listen. Last year there was one point where I stayed home from school. Automatically my mom starts yelling at me about being a failure, what do you want to do with your life, you have to get straight As, etc etc etc- this isn't the cause of my depression, but the fact that she automatically started yelling about those things instead of just asking what's wrong made me mad that so many people lack the sensitivity to help others. But anyway, eventually I got to telling her that I was depressed, and had been for a long time, and I don't remember what she said word for word, but she said something like don't be silly, those doctors overcharge you so much money (we're not poor, not rich), just focus on school, etc etc. She was just blowing me off like nothing was serious, just overtaken by worry of my school studies      Since then, I have been very reluctant to talk to my parents about anything, since they don't listen to much anything. My dad has always been a tactless person- last night when I told him I didn't want to go to school tomorrow (today) he automatically just started yelling at me to finish my homework and go to school. And this morning when I was lying in bed while my bus stop time was coming, he was literally jabbing me in the sides to get me up. Finally at one point he asked me what's wrong- but it was his impatient "just go do it" what's wrong, not a genuine curiosity for what's bothering me.      Again, the lack of sensitivity from my parents isn't what's making me depressed, but it is preventing me from getting professional help which the last straw I'm reaching out for. I've talked to friends, I've tried motivating myself, I've tried keeping myself busy, and I've tried being a better Christian (not as in I feel a lack of self-esteem, but that I tried increasing the strength of my relationship with God)- none of that works, and most recently I just dropped it all. So...my question is, how do I communicate to parents who are unwilling to listen, or blinded by other things, or unwilling to talk, that I am depressed and need professional help? Or...how do I get professional help without my parents?          * 3 minutes ago       * - 3 days left to answer.      Additional Details      0 seconds ago   **This is not the last paragraph for those who skipped my details, please go up one paragraph      I'm not depressed from lack of self-esteem, I'm not self-conscious, I get decent grades regardless of what my parents say, I have a good group of friends- I think what's making me depressed is just a very minimal outlook on the potential of life and what it holds in store for me. I seriously just lack any motivation to live it out to it's fullest- partially because of my depression, partially because of logical thinking, and partially because I just don't think life's greatest treasures are worth going through its worst ones. I know depression can be like a mindset, and I just need to look up and "see the world," but sometimes I just feel like the unluckier ones who don't see the point

I am not normally an unhappy person with a morbid outlook in life. but this year is really bad.   My boyfriend committed suicide a little over a month ago, and we only dated for six month. It was a very good relationship with our share of ups and downs. I found out after he died that he suffered from borderline personality disorder for years. (undiagnosed.)   I was so traumatized by the event, thought there are no hopes for me to go on anymore.   I am 28 years old, and really feel like I have been given a death sentence in the love department Like, I can never find anybody, and I will die alone.   career is okay, but it is nothing but a routine kind of thing.    I have no financial problems, but I feel the thing I want the most which is love itself may never find me.   feel so lonely and empty inside. feel I cannot go on anymore  what's the point?

I just bought my first box of tampons the other day (Playtex Gentle Glide Regulars) and out of curiosity opened one and inserted the applicator to see how it would fit (don't worry, I did not insert the tampon (meaning i didn't push the inner tube in) because I'm not on my period).      Putting in the applicator did not hurt me at all (I'm a virgin) but, obviously, I don't know how the actual tampon would feel once its inserted.      Bottom Line: Are these girls saying that putting in the applicator is hurting? or the actual tampon insertion (pushing in the inner tube) is hurting?      just curious hehe =)

Whenever I stand up or turn around, I get really dizzy, like the room is spinning, but then after a few minutes, it goes away again. My toes are numb too now, which scares me. My neck was stiff in the beginning, but at least that seems a little bit better now. I have also been really weak lately, and my chest feels like someone is pushing it inwards. The chest pain hurts the worst in the morning and evenings, but is still persistent low-key all day. HELP! What should I do?!      PS. I am 14 yrs. old.

My baby is five weeks old and I have noticed bumps on her face for about 2 weeks now. At first I thought it was just acne so I haven't been worried about it, but now I notice that it's spread all over her head and onto her chest. I don't know if she's been trying to itch it or not. Her movements are not controlled enough for me to be able to tell if what she's doing is intentional. I looked up in a baby book to see if it might be eczema. My son had that as a baby. But the book says eczema is extremely rare in breastfed babies. I only breastfeed.       Has anyone else had this happen to their baby? Does baby acne spread to other parts of the body?

My teeth are crowded on the bottom... on the left side I am missing the 1st molar (pulled 8 years ago).

Shouldn't she request to extract the same tooth on the other side and try to close both spaces by moving my teeth back? She mentioned that she may not be able to close the gap of the missing tooth because the extraction was so long ago.... but even if that is true, then obviously I need to put in an implant afterwards and I'll still have 1 premolar extracted.... that will mean I'll have 15 teeth on the bottom... an uneven number and more than on top (I have 14 on top) ...

I'm not sexually active (i havent had it yet) and i am 16 years old. A little personal info: i masturbated every day (im not going to now of course), but i think this may have been the cause of it. Don't answer "go see a doctor" because i want that to be my last resort. I am also afraid to pop it because i think it will get worse if i do.

20090222135020AAVvOfM	Health;Diet & Fitness	Friend with a BMI over 50:  what can I do to help?	A close friend of mine is considered morbidly obese, with a BMI of 50+.      He has tried to lose weight on his own for years now, and has, on several occasions, lost a little.  He has, unfortunately, damaged both of his knees in the past which makes typical exercise (which most of us take for granted) something that is almost impossible.  He's able to do normal things (and quite well, I might add, for his weight), but if he over-stresses either (or both) of his knees, he is likely to further damage his MCLs.      His eating habits are not the best, but his caloric intake is not overwhelming (and is typical of a person of his age).  I think that his lack of activity has essentially destroyed his metabolism, honestly.      He has considered gastric bypass as well as other alternatives, but the cost is more than he can afford.  Payment plans are not an option at this point.  He'd rather stay away from surgery, anyway.      This is a very serious matter, and I'm not looking for "tell him to drop the candy bar and go for a walk"-type answers.  I want to help him (and he wants help), and I'm really worried about his health.

20090222131123AAhOLnQ	Health;Women's Health	What is wrong with my period? It's driving me crazy!?	For the past two months I have been having an on and off period. I have always been really irregular but this is just insane of how it is now.      It started off two months ago with a three day lighter period when I usually go for 8 heavy days. I thought maybe it was just spotting and that I would start my full period the following week. Well that didn't exactly happen, all I had was a brown like discharge that came out like a period would. I would have to wear a pad everyday and that gets really annoying in school because I always feel that someone can see this buldge in my pants from the pad. Anyways, this went on for another week. Then I started heavy bleeding again, then it got lighter and went on for another two weeks.       Just last week it had stopped all together but then this week it's back and I have back pain with cramps. It's so annoying and it driving me completely crazy! What is wrong with my periods, do I have a disorder or something? My mom said she would take me to the gyno soon but she hasn't done anything at all but complain the bill I ring up for having to buy the pads.       And what would the doctor do exactly? Like would he give me a full examine in my vagina or what?      Help? I'm really starting to worry about going to the doctor and what if this period never ends?

The first time I couldn't hold my urine was when I was doing excersises with the class in high school (I was like 13) and ran to the toilett but couldn't make it! Afterwards, when I was 22 and I was jogging (alone). Then, like a year after happened again while I was alone and today (now I'm 26) just happened while walking back home alone! I felt the need of peeing, but just couldn't hold it till home (5 min walk only!). Other times, I have also felt the need but when I am with someone or many people are around I can hold it. From what type of incontinence do I suffer? Can I ask this to the gynecologist or should I go to another type of doctor?   Thanks in advance...

20090222133436AAXRCHi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Whitehead with skin lump inside--is this a problem?	I recently noticed that I had a fairly small whitehead along my belt line. I popped it as I would with any whitehead, but noticed that even with the pus and pressure released, there was still something solid inside.      Working at it a bit, I got a hold of it and pulled out a small clump of... well, it appears to be skin. It was about the thickness of a thin string or twine, and between half an inch and an inch in length.      The zit started bleeding more substantially after that, but the solid mass that I'd felt earlier was definitely gone. I cleaned the wound, applied some antibacterial ointment, and put on a bandage.      I've had my share of whiteheads over the years, and I've never had something like this, so it worries me a little. Is there any cause for alarm? Is this fairly normal?      In case it helps the diagnosis, I'm male and significantly overweight. As I said, it was just above my pubic area, near the belt line.

I looked up withdrawal symptoms of Lexapro and they scare the hell out of me!! - Am I better off stopping treatment now seeing as I have only been taking it for 5 days? I don't want to stay on this medication long anyways, as I am concerned about the health risks but I decided to start taking it as a starting point to my recovery.. If anyone has ever been or is on Lexapro - please, any advice I would appreciate.
20090222153118AAp3jdK	Health;Women's Health	Im on depo (the birth control shot) is it possible im pregnant?	I Know depo works to prevent pregnancy 98% of the time , thats why i started it , plus its convience . ive been on it for over a year now and i havent had my period , not even spotting , after the first 3 - 6 months . i havent gained or lost any weight , and its been wonderful . but 3 days ago my fiance and i were having intercourse , everytime we have sex we dont use protection , and afterwords i went into the bathroom and noticed i was bleeding ! it continued yesterday , but was light and today it got heavier and there were VERY small "blood clots" when i wiped after i used the bathroom . lately my breasts have been sore , my bodys been achey , ive been having mood swings , and i have to pee all the time , to the point i cant even hold it in , and ive been having minor cramps . I dont know what the signs of pregnancy on depo are , but i was pregnant before and i didnt expirence any symptoms at all , just minor cramps . and all 5 home pregnancy tests i took came out negative until i got blood work done . is this just a freak thing that happening ? or is it possible im pregnant ? or maybe even miscarrying if i had been ?
