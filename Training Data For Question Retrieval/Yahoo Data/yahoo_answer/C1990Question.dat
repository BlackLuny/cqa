She said my resume fits the job position, and she would like to set up a phone interview for today at 8AM.  So I did everything I was supposed to--read the company's credo, practice interview questions, and even went to bed early just to receive no call!!   I don't understand this--why would someone set up a time for a phone interview and not call you?  I emailed her and asked her if we could reschedule and got nothing back.  I feel like I have been played and honestly, this looks really bad for the company she is working for.   I am going to call her tomorrow, but in the meantime I want to know why would someone do this?  Has anyone had an experience like this they can share?

I'd be willing to learn but I need stuff that is forgiving for a beginner. I like to take pictures of things I'm cooking as well as scenery around town. I know there are Nikon and Canon cameras and you can add different lenses. I'd like one that's not quite so expensive as $1,000. I think there are some that cost less. I'd love to buy the Nikon D80 type of camera some day but I can't afford it right now.      This one looks like it could be good but less expensive:  http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Came...  I'm really kind of lost on this and need someone to point me in the right direction. What kind of camera and what sort of lenses do you recommend. My pictures would be primarily of people and animals, my recipes up close as I'm cooking and the final product, and pictures of the city I live in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Now regularly this wouldn't be a problem, but my laptop pretty much isn't compatible with my TV.   but Here's the problem. My laptop is new, and has an HDMI port. But my TV is 'old', well not really old, but it was made roughly around the year 2003, and it only has an S-Video port. So i went to radio shack, and they said that it won't work and that "I can't get from HDMI to S-Video".   So i would really like a cord, or an adapter that can connect my Computer to my TV.   Also, not to sound rude, but I don't want stupid people who don't know what they're talking about telling me i need an S-video cord, because that simply won't work!    Thank You in advance for a good answer.

I received a text message on my Nokia N72 mobile phone today. I tried opening it but it only opened till the inbox. I could see first three msgs in my inbox, first being the new msg from a frnd of mine and the other older messages. but it did not revert automatically and open the new message as it does. I tired opening it again and again but it didn't open. So i exited the menu and tried again. this time i just couldn't open my inbox. the sidewayz toggle bar appeared at the top but inbox was inaccessible, so were the rest of the folders (my folders, new msg, sent, outbox etc). Only reports were opening to show delivery reports. Ever when i toggled side ways, it didn't open the other folders like Nokia phns do. I tried recovering my messages through a card reader but even that is unable to read the messages, even though some amount of memory is occupied. That means the messages are there n not deleted, and are only INACCESSIBLE! :(      This has blocked all of my messages with my fiance that i saved and stranded me in misery :(. can anyone of u please please ppllleeaaasseeee tell me what to do? :(.. I'd be ever so grateful!
