It works by showing you a globe on the screen, which you can move around with your mouse or keyboard, and as you zoom in it gets more detailed pictures from Google's storage servers online, the same way Google Maps does. So you'll need a reasonably fast connection and computer to make the most of it. Have fun exploring!

Just trash the Raid card unless you plan on building a computer to put it in or have a custom machine built for you.    If you must try a Bios update then you will want to make a back-up disk. with all your programs etc. Also you should have a copy of the Bios currently installed. There is a good chance that an upgrade will destroy the computers ability to run at all. If it does you will need to format the hard drive and install the original Bios.

It is similar to the old fashion records that are huge compared to the compact disk, and it's method of storing data such as music is very similar. The old fashion records uses a needle to play it's data (music) and the compact disk uses a laser.    hope that helps!|`|qzPbcHpmaa	A compact disk is a plastic disk that you can store digital information on.

You could also get an adaptor that uses the 3 pin MOBO type connector on most fans and converts it to the 4 pin MOLEX type connector that your power supply probably has extra not being used.    Your last option is to hardwire a fan to an unused power supply lead - but thats really not the greatest idea

You can contact me if you want in my email   lickwomenfeet@yahoo.com|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	An encrypted file is a file with encrypted data. The original text is transformed to cipher text via complex mathematical functions.     In network security, encryption is important. People can easily intercept data passed from computer to computer. Secure sockets layer use RSA security.  Any website that processes personal information should use Secure sockets layer. If the web page says 'https' instead of 'http' in the URL, its secure. Check out:     http://www.pnc.com    In RSA, A public and private key is generated by the receiving computer. The public key is passed to the sending computer. Then, the cipher text is generated by the sender using the public key. The receiver uses the private key to decrypt the data.     The only way the data can be stolen is by learning the receiver's private key. The key is anywhere from 128 to 256 bits, which is about 1 trillion * 1 trillion * 1 trillion possibilities for a 128 bit key. No, security is perfect, but these algorithms make it harder for computers to break them.

2SSA9e9Naa	What is happening when you try to distribute your program? Does it refuse to run?    It may be you are missing some libraries where you are running your program.    If that is the case get a copy of depends.exe (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and run it on a system where you are having problems.     To use it start depends and tell it to process your program. If there are any libraries, DLL, etc. your program needs that are not on the system it will tell you.    Hope that helps.

AA12026077	"Distribution" processing or "Distributed" data processing?    "Distributed" data processing as apposed to centralized processing, is distributed to more than one place and all tied together with a network via phone lines, Internet or fiber optic cables.    That way you do not have all your eggs in one basket.    If something like an explosion or natural disaster happened you could loose everything and all your data if it was all in one spot.    It also allows you process more data with smaller machines because it take the work load and distributes it to all the systems.    Worth?

However, with terrorism so widespread, it is almost necessary now days ... because it is almost impossible to take out all of the systems at once.|`|AA11853764	Distributed data processing?  *Computers are dispersed throughout organization   ?Advantages   Allows greater flexibility in meeting individual needs   More redundancy   More autonomy      Distributed Data Processing         Definition:     Two or more computers   doing processing and storage and   sharing data   Advantages:     Overall system reliability   Forces design modularity   Faster, more consistent response time   Reduced communication costs   Easier to scale up or down   Disadvantages:     More costly for hardware   Lower hardware utilization rates   Lack of backup hardware typically   Unreliability of individual locations   More IS knowledgeable people needed   Harder to control   More potential for security problems    Advantages and disadvantages are versus centralized processing.

A trigger fires when an event occurs.  There's really no "history" you can tie to the trigger except by storing a value somewhere.    What you could do is add an extra integer column to the table, create  a sequence, and insert the next value in the sequence every time a record gets added.  Have the trigger test whether the sequence equals 11, and send the email if it does.  Every day, reset the sequence to 1, and this should do what you want.    Just insure that nothing else uses the sequence, or you might lose the 11 value.  You could expand to test if the sequence was between 11 and 15 to give your self a fudge factor.  You'll get a few extra emails, but you'll almost be guaranteed to get your notification, and they'll stop after 15.

QxERY26Laa	I can not really say because I do not know the directory of the install files on the dell restore disk.  Before you began you can make sure your optical drive is set to boot first by hitting f12 when your computer boots and select the proper CD drive. I know for a windows operating system disk you would press:  F:\setup  or  F:\1386\winnt  This is if you wanted to start the installer through dos mode but you can boot through the CD-ROM drive and the installer should open automatically.      Try some links below.  Good luck.|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	Well first off having a warranty wouldn't help if it's a software issue.  No warranty covers software.    When you get the press any key you want to hit ANYTHING on your keyboard.  This will get the computer to read the CD.    Follow the steps for a full install with format.  Do know that ALL DATA WILL be lost.  Gone, unrecoverable.  Make sure you have your driver CDs ready for when the install finishes.  It will take an hour for windows.  IF you get any error (such as can not find drive) you have a bad hard drive and should get it replaced.  Any tech shop can help you.    Once windows is installed put in the drivers and utilities disk (blue).  Look for the items with check marks next to it.  Click on one, click install (or extract, I forget which it is).  It will install.  It may prompt you for a reboot on each one.    To verify that your drivers installed correctly, right click on 'my computer' go to properties.  click on the hardware tab, click on the device manager button.  Look for anything with a yellow question mark.  Those are devices that do not have drivers.  You can find the missing drivers at support.dell.com click on drivers and downloads, put in your service tag (found on the top of your PC or on the back side, it is 8 digits long).  Stay AWAY from anything that says firmware, flash or BIOS.  You could really mess up the pc.     After that install your applications from your applications CD.    Install anything else you want installed.  Be sure to get antivirus on your system as well.

bjuVcxN8aa	DVD shrink is a pretty program for compressing movies. The quality isn't the greatest at that low. but ok i quess.     Or you can use a more complex system of AVIsynth. Works really well, but not the easiest to use. Reguires a bit of copmuter knowledge. If you want to use this, my recommendation is to use a DVD ripper to convert the DVD to an uncompressed file on your computer and use MEGUI to compress it using AVIsynth.|`|RwNqGx2yaa	maybe u need to get a iso maker to burn your iso image to cd or dvd, then rip dvd to avi with dvd ripper, if u need,free download to have a try  http://www.regnow.com/trialware/download...      *  Burn data/movie/bootable ISO image files to CD/DVD      * Burn BIN/CUE, IMG, MDF, NRG, CDI, B5i, B6i, and DMG to CD/DVD      * Burn ISO to CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD+R DL  then u can rip dvd to avi with a video converter, u can try avs video converter, Rip and burn personal DVDs, convert video, create HD Video, split, join, edit, apply effects, copy to mobile devices!

0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Firstly you will NOT need a network card, the MOBO has an in built NIC. So save your $$ there... Next why do yo need 2 hard drives, one 80 gig & one 360gig..?? Why not just get one 500gig & partition it in to 250 X 2 it would be a simpler setup. Stick with a Western Digital brand SATA drive!!! They are the best ones out!!     Now as to Vista... I have been running it for over a year with little to no trouble! It is great for Gaming & you will need it if you want to use DX10, which is what all games are now using!    Also Make sure to get the 64bit version OS!!! This will allow you to use the full memory capacity of your MOBO(which is 16gig of RAM!)...You can add RAM as your budget allows...    I hope my tips help!    Good Luck!!|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	Well, I suggest you get the E8400, since .16Ghz is not noticeable. Second, get an aftermarket CPU cooler, since both 8400 and 8500 overclock well. Third, get Vista 64bit. It was bad when it came out, but now it is fine. It will allow you to use DX10, not just 9. Oh, and get some Arctic Silver 5 if you get a new heatsink. And make sure that you have enough fans for your case. Often times the case can accommodate more then it comes with. And, don't forget a monitor if you don't have one, and a sound card if you wish, but the on-board ones are fine.|`|jwurmVbVaa	you have 2 hdds but no monitor.  and XP will only support up to 3 GB RAM|`|XlyLakYAaa	Vista is actually REALLY good and better for gaming than XP (especially due to DirectX10).  I find that most people that don't like Vista have never even bothered to try it.  XP is an old and outdated OS and actually has tons of problems with new hardware.  XP also won't support all 4GBs of your RAM.|`|DSa6xvqOaa	i have vista n i like it. games run fine wit it.     n for ur rig, u may  need a floppy drive, SOUND CARD , monitor  and an aftermarket cooler incase u want to overclock cpu. u should get the zalman 9500 or 9700     xfi creative sound cards are pretty good

VQlrQ34Faa	I have an older model HP all-in-one that about 8 years old and have never failed on me yet. I've gone thorough about 6 different types of printer before I bought this HP. My brother bought his HP all-in-one printer a few weeks ago and it running very good. The ink for both printer costs about $88.00 for both Black and color as they both take the same ink cartage's. I usually replace the ink about once a year for the color and 3 times a year for the black.|`|XsxicDzzaa	I use a small and cheap Canon Pixma printer.  It's space saving and actually very good at printing pictures on High Gloss photo paper.  I've used it around 6 months with normal use and the ink is still going strong.

LI64IZCWaa	1. organize  2. add more usefull information  3. aesthetics    I think one of the biggest things would be organization.

Creating a site that students use isn't easy. I tried for our choir program, we still have very few hits on it, and most of them are by parents.    You need to focus more on the content than the visuals, a website can have an amazing design but worthless content and nobody will go there. Information that will help students with what they're looking for is probably your best bet. If you had a tutoring area online where students could log in and reach other students would draw in people, but that takes a lot of work, and even more programming knowledge.|`|MTwoxMctaa	Well, I would use flash.

Wnb2HIsEaa	It does sound like the trackpad has failed, unfortunately replacing the trackpad means replacing the whole top case.    How much that will cost depends on which G4 you have. If it's an Aluminum the cost of the part is about $80 and the repair is about half an hour.    If it's a Titanium it's not as good, the part costs between $180 and $250 and can take up to 2 hours to replace.

RyvKws7Laa	If you're into movies, music, and pictures you really should consider investing in a small external hard drive for you laptop.  Like a USB drive from Western Digital (My Passport) or Seagate (Free Agent Go).  They are small, portable, and can draw power from the laptop.  They have a wide variety of sizes and prices, so I'm sure you can find something to fit your budget.    Then you can move off a bunch of things onto that drive.  Stuff you don't need access to all the time for example.  Maybe you want your music always on your laptop, but do you really need the movies and pictures always on there?  Those would be a good candidate to put onto the external drive.    Burning to CD-Rs is slow and tedious.  And you can't put more than about 700MB onto a disc (not even 1GB).  So you won't free up space very quickly.  But anyway, to make that work you want to use a good burning program like Nero or Easy CD Creator (from Roxio).  That would likely let you sort out the burns easier and more efficiently.  But those programs aren't free.  So again, if you're going to be stuck making some kind of investment, I say grab a small portable USB drive.
Hy1Sd2C2aa	There is another way not yet mentioned. The dual booting is a possibility but something I find much more useful is running a virtual machine inside vista.You can install and run Xp while running Vista by using the program Virtual Machine 2007. This way is much more stream lined in my opinion and offers the best of both worlds. Only draw back being that this way does need more intense hardware, such as a decently large amount of memory, hard drive space, and a reasonably powerful processor.

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	It's a good setup, but looks like a terrible value in terms of bang for the buck.  Buying an Alienware system practically guarantees that you're paying twice as you'd pay buying from Newegg or Tigerdirect for parts of equal or better quality/performance.    First off, the processor is a good choice if you're not going Core i7.  For gaming there's not a huge benefit to quad-core cpus over similarly-clocked dual-cores but for general multitasking and movie editing, the 45nm quads are great.      It's true that spending $280 for a Q9550 instead of $290 for a Core i7 920 seems weird, but you'd need to factor in the cost of a more expensive motherboard, more expensive RAM etc...  Still, for what you'd wind up paying for Alienware, you could do it!    In any case, the GTX 280 is a terrible value. Way overpriced for how it performs.  Either go with a single GTX 285, or a pair of 260's.  To really go high-end, buy the 295.    The main reason to go with a Q9550 system is if you're working with a limited budget.  The money you save on the CPU/RAM/mobo can be put instead into better graphics.    Anyway, here's a much more powerful system built from scratch:|`|IYgiWL3Haa	If you buy from alienware expect to pay about three times the value of the parts for the computer. That PC is pretty good for most games out now. It may run into trouble as soon as a year down the road though.    There are much better CPUs out right now and the single GTX280 is trumped by a lot of existing cards.    I would recommend either going with a Phenom II or Core i7 platform computer right now. I installed and overclocked a new AMD phenom for a customer and got it up to 3.7GHz on stock cooling stable.|`|pOaE0fWOaa	This is a Terrible Set Up. You should go back and find some better parts.|`|gzJsI3NCaa	Upgrade ram and video card and ull be good
d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	First one by a wide margin.  Although it could be upgraded.    It has the best processor (Core i7) and more important... dual 9800GT graphics cards, while the other systems have single cards in the same general performance category.    A pair of 9800GTs leaves a single 4850 in the dust...    Of course, all 3 systems get pwned by the mighty Gamecube :D|`|BWttPY1taa	I would rather wait for AMD Phenom II X4 that support DDR3 RAM|`|xJZSpsRhaa	game cube... hahahahah thats dope!    but seriously, the first one if you can add an extra gig of ram in there.  When buying a gaming system you want to focus on the processor speed the ram and the graphics card.  Since this one dual graphics card its going to be able to process the graphics that now a day computers can put out.  But, the processor is just a single? or what? you didn't really say.     Since i'm thinking that the processor is probable going to be Quad as well, your golden.    But, if its not then go with one of the Quad processor.      Later, you should upgrade to a blue-ray player, because this will be the future in gaming... possible asap... i don't think its going to be long before they start using blue-ray to produce games on.      Hope this helps...    gamecube... hahahahah|`|dfe47013b50a7769a8b917aef90f0eb2aa	NIntendo Game Cube|`|cEE4Ka47aa	definitly the third one by far, but the 2nd one which i would assume is cheaper. should suffice enough. but if your looking for lots of power id go for the 3rd one, but if moneys not the problem i suggest this bad ***     http://www.apple.com/macpro/    im not a mac person but i hear macs run xp as well so who knows. this thing can run 8 screens at one time, 32 gigs of ram and 8 cores of processing power. as well as 4 terabytes of memory (you'll never fill that idc what you download) and the graphics card is just simply insane but this is more like a dream computer. 3rd ones the best bny far,  most power graphics card is good and it cools pretty well according to that case and its got plenty of room for storage.    hope this helps|`|IyCnihLmaa	Is that your only choices???

I don't know about all of you but I know I don't just work on programming when I work on websites many times I work on multiple things while programming.    If you plan on keeping exceptional track of your actual working time then go with hourly, otherwise, do pre-agreed based on complexity of the requests for the actual building.    When it comes to sitting with the client and discussing the website and how they want it to look, that makes sense to be hourly. or at least 15-minutes interval charge.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	what will he pay?|`|BgwTxzEFaa	I charge a minumum of $400 and my going rate is $100 per hour as long as no flash is required.

9wbsjbioaa	I do ^_^, Vista is the biggest waste of an operating system ever, maybe if they could learn how to make it work properly, we could think about switching, but why bother when XP works perfectly fine|`|3EBKrVrDaa	Vista sucks, I use XP, but linux wins overall.|`|IYgiWL3Haa	I still use XP on one of my computers. I have Windows 7 on another and LINUX on the last. XP seems to be more stable than Vista and uses less system resources. People say Vista is more powerful but the only thing I have found more powerful is the nice little glass effect of Aero. All the other nice features have been ported to XP through third party software. In ending... there is no excuse for vista to use 1GB of RAM idle and keep my 3.0GHz quad core CPU at ~5% usage on a blank desktop. An OS is supposed to be transparent and not take up more system than your programs.|`|wXloRCegaa	I do!|`|fE7zhp3Caa	I still use XP, and I'm also a Slackware user.  I don't like Vista's resource appetite and a number of other design choices Microsoft made, like disabling the Administrator account by default and requiring you to jump through a few hoops to turn it on.  Like precaching programs that you use so that they can be loaded faster *IF* you use them again.  If you don't they're still precached and wasting system resources.  I don't want or need an OS that's good at guessing what I might do next, and Vista isn't even very good at guessing from what I've seen so far.    Stupid.|`|Z3LL3csEaa	I have Windows XP on one of my computers, and I wouldn't consider ungrading to Vista seeing as that Windows 7 is almost here.|`|NIFk1Nxoaa	I do occasionally, but I prefer the more recent programs.|`|cOlvcgDqaa	Yeah, i do.

They cannot afford it  2. (My Favorite) There are a lot of bugs with Windows Vista.    The higher the version of Vista, the less bugs, but to hardly have anything to worry about you would have to spend about $600 for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition. Needless to say, not many people can afford to spend money not only for the OS software but so peripherals (printers, scanners, and etc) made prior to the release of Vista can not function with the new OS. This is the reason why on printers and other hardware you see (Windows Vista Compatible). Although Microsoft has already ordered to cease the sale of the XP OS since mid 2007, updates will continue to be released until some years pass. By that time though, your computer will most likely be out of use and you will have to resort to using Vista or Windows 7 as previously mentioned.|`|z0oEs3YOaa	I do!

Then learning a few languages, and getting a few years of experience with each one.

I would recommend that you learn JAVA first, I would say that JAVA is the hardest Object-oriented programing language out there, so if you know JAVA you can become proficient at other languages in less time than if you did not know it. Java is also a popular web Development language. When I started with PHP I only knew JAVA but PHP syntax was so similar that I picked it up pretty quickly, same thing with Javascript and a few others.    If yo want to learn JAVA I recommend a book called "Absolute Java" by Savitch, if you want to learn PHP and MySQL I recommend "PHP and MySQL WebDevelopment". This website called w3schools.com has free tutorials for many other languages including PHP and SQL.

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.    Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?    Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  Its only for the Windows operating system.    First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    Second, if youre interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings.     http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...    Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.    Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), heres a possibility for salvaging them.

Qdzlv79Laa	No the speed can't be changed unless you get a wireless N router with a N wireless adapter, then the wireless speed will be 108Mbps. So if that guy is not selling you a new wireless N router and a wireless N network adapter, then he is lying.  Good luck|`|pOaE0fWOaa	It is unlikely you would get 300 mbps if you went to an N router. It is unlikely you would even get 100 mbps on an N router. These connections are usually much less than their rated capacity. These figures are only theoretical as the real world has many sources of radio wave interference. These wireless connections all use radio and the overhead from transmitting packets absorbs a good chunk of the rated capacity. I have never seen 54 mbps on my Linksys WRT54G V.2.0, even when the wireless machine is next to it.    I suspect that 108 card would probably get about 40 mbps. My set up usually gets in the 20s as I go through a wall. These speeds are typical what from I have seen. To get wired speed you generally have to use wire.    If you want 100 mbps upstairs, you probably should wire it.    Good luck.|`|YrLVvAHvaa	you can't put it any higher then 54Mbps the frenzy that the wireless router (2.4ghz) cant have any faster speed on it. the frenzy is just not big enough to carry any data over 54Mbps on it|`|4qMNaCUIaa	no 100 is the standard. for a Lan.|`|YTJxw0JYaa	Correction: your broadband connection is NOT 100mbps.    that is the speed of the connection from your computer to your modem/router.    The wireless speed of your laptop cannot be changed unless you buy a 108mbps wireless network card for it. However, I highly doubt the speed of your internet is more than 54mbps.     Hence the upgrade in speed is not going to make any difference except for things internally in your network like transferring files from the desktop to the laptop.    Its like having a pipe which is already way too big for the amount of water going through it and replacing it with an even bigger one.
6nOMv6aLaa	Your code looks correct.  The only problem I see would be the semicolon (;) on the line with "if array[i][j] > max"  "if" statements should be followed by a block of brackets without a semicolon between.

sjP1IDILaa	Glary Utilities is a highly rated program that will do lots of things :    "Glary Utilities offers numerous powerful and easy-to-use system tools and utilities to fix, speed up, maintain and protect your PC. It allows you to clean common system junk files, as well as invalid registry entries and Internet traces. You can manage and delete browser add-ons, analyze disk space usage and find duplicate files. You can also view and manage installed shell extensions, encrypt your files from unauthorized access and use, split large files into smaller manageable files and then rejoin them. Furthermore, Glary Utilities includes the options to optimize memory, find, fix, or remove broken Windows shortcuts, manage the programs that start at Windows startup and uninstall software. Other features include secure file deletion, an Empty Folder finder."    You can download it here:    http://www.download.com/Glary-Utilities/...    Best of all, it is free!  Be careful with any program that supposedly "cleans" or fixes errors in your registry.  The wrong changes can do MUCH more harm than good to your computer.    I also like PC Pitstop Optimize.  It doesn't do as many things as Glary Utilities, but it does some things that Glary does not.  It is not rated as highly as Glary, but I have used it with great success.  It is not free.

Never use an external program to cleanup or to fix your registry, unless you like reinstalling your operating system. Sooner or later they will make computer killing mistakes. The registry fix thing is a big farce. What you need to do is regular maintenance on your machine, like once a week. Start with emptying the Windows Prefetch folder. Delete everything in it. Then run Disc cleanup. Make sure the only boxes checked are Temp Internet Files, Recycle Bin, and Compress Old files. Then run Disc scan, checking only the second box. Then Defrag your hard drive. If you want to take it further go to pcstats.com Beginners' Guides way down on the right. Start with guide  78, I think, about services running on your machine. Then go up to the beginning of the guides and use the 99 tips, 101, and 104 tips or the tips for Vista. Don't try to overclock or mess with the BIOS. They will take you into the registry so be careful there. If you do what they say you will have a beast of a computer. Good luck.

a90UOSltaa	You need a domain for that.    Probably MS small business server or windows server 2003    The clients could be XP or windows 2000 even vista, make sure to keep away from home or basic editions, they cant connect to domains.    Depends how big your network is going to be, a domain is good for above 10 or 15 at least.  Any less and its peer-to-peer.    You could either make your router host the DHCP or your server, although its best your server does it,  your clients will need IPs to access the network.    A good ISP service is fine, it will feed through your router's gateway and via the server.  Make sure all clients use the router gateway (192.168.1.0?).      To control your clients, you ll more likely be using Active Directory, which should become active when you make your server a domain, from there you ll be using group policies for the user accounts.

A lot of hard work and dedication. A passion for the field. You wouldn't make it if you were just in it for the money. That goes for any field of work really. But it's important to remember.    Other than that, stay on top of your game. Practice with different aspects of the web development process. For a professional feel/look practice on ease of use, proper grammar, etc. In order to "sell" the professional look you need it to look educated. Make sure what the viewer reads sounds educated, but can be easily understood by people of all levels of education. Otherwise the customer (or potential customer) would be pushed away.    As far as looks are concerned, don't clutter the space. Don't go overboard with the graphics. If done properly you can pull off quite a casual, not-so-fancy design and still sell it to the customer as a professional environment. I wouldn't do business with a company if their web site was highly unorganized, made uneducated statements, etc. Do you understand what I'm getting at? I'm trying to make it as easy as possible.    Develop little "test" sites locally on your computer that demonstrate a specific "professional" feature. Make one that focuses on general layout, one that focuses on easy navigation, and so on, and so on.
vySVoIbUaa	Yes there is!  It's something called a TV Tuner Card.  Comes in PCI (for desktop computers), USB (for both desktop and laptop computers), or, some computers may even have the TV Tuner Card built in...    I am currently using an ATI TV Wonder 600 USB Hybrid TV Tuner Card with a Gateway laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium.  With this particular version of Windows Vista, I use Windows Media Center to watch and record live TV just like a TiVo!  (Well, this TV Tuner Card only records one show at a time...)  The Program Guide in Windows Media Center is quite user-friendly and very easy to set programs to record.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	TiVo it is some kind of vcr type of programable equipment but ther are serious insringets to the bios and you only get one pass at it wit out screwwing up the shot, but once you get it to work and it does not crash, it pulls all kinds of potential recorded stuff off of tv and cable on a search.But the drawback once again is knowing how to control the BOIS and the internal program before you attemp to unleash it or you lose all.|`|IYgiWL3Haa	It's called a video capture card or a TV tuner.

AA10248855	I have purchased and am still using several 'refurbished' items, from various places.  I have only had one of those items fail me. But, in all fairness, i used it for 4 years, quite heavily.  That item was a DVD burner, now the item still works, but the dvd burning ability is gone.      An items that is classified as 'refurbished' is an item that was returned after being open by the consumer.  Whether is was actually removed from the box or not, if it opened it is not 'new', and is usally sent back to the manufacture and check and repaired as necessary, then sold as a 'refurbished' item.  Most items do have a warranty and are not to be feared.

xiBQll8haa	Dell Inspiron 8600 is a very good, feature packed laptop but other laptops are also very good. It would depend on the processors, motherboard, graphics card and other inside bits and plus the look.

Do some research on what you expect in a computer...for example if you want a good graphics card or fast processor and such...    Personally, I bought a Dell Inspiron 1525 for about $700 and its working pretty well. Another good laptop though is a Sony VAIO NS140. But like i said, it all depends|`|LoTO5cHoaa	i have dell XPS 1530  its good  3 gb ddr2 ram  250 gb hard disk  nvidia 8400(not the best)  vista premium 64 bit  great looks  i advice you to go with dell because it is very economical compared to sony vaio,which costs more(almost double in india,where i live).....  ultimately ,its your choice,but this is a good suggestion.
RyvKws7Laa	The processor won't dictate how large of a drive you can use.  The drive format of your motherboard is all that matters.  If your motherboard only accepts PATA ATA/66 or ATA/100 then you need a drive that can meet those needs.  The size though doesn't matter at all.    I can't recall if SATA was really out much around P3 days.  But I think they weren't mainstream at that point, so you likely have an IDE/PATA drive.  Those can be harder to find these days.  So if you bought a drive recently and it was a SATA drive, it likely won't hook up to your motherboard then.  But you didn't really give a detailed description of the situation so its hard to know for sure what your problem is.|`|6aLOwNMwaa	dual partition looks like your only way.
22dd16f0bfe5dc0e72312c42dc72ba43aa	Get a nvidia gpu based 8600 gts or gt if price is an issue. Sometimes newegg sells 8800 gts 512mb cards for 99.99 but not often. Go with 128bit or 256 for best fps performance. Or a ati graphics card 3870 saphire edition 320 pixel shaders etc'. Both are great!!|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	You probably won't find anything in the $100 range that can run high quality graphics. If you're looking for a budget card, the Radeon HD4800 series has a phenomenal bang for buck ratio.

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your pc    5. Clean your Registry  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!  Use the tool:  http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_...  Learn more information "why is my computer running so slow":  http://toptenantispywareviews.com/RegCom...|`|34yKqNaQaa	Hard drive fragmentation is a major cause of slowness. Fragmentation is created as files are created, edited or as files and programs are downloaded, they get broken up and saved wherever free space is available. Then the computer has to work extra hard to restore and open or run these files and programs. As it gets worse it can cause, slows, program hangs, freezes, crashes etc.     Defrag your computer.

hHYIszRraa	More and more it appears that this site may NOT be legitimate. The first indicator is that Google stopped processing payments for them.  The second indicator is that their site is no longer available.  I placed an order yesterday (for a portable DVD player for less than $20). I did receive an e-mail confirmation, but I (and others) have found them to be unresponsive to inquiries. I also found it strange that they did not request method of payment (only billing address) when my order was processed (I guess I should be glad of this all things considered).  Others have indicated that this is a very new site. If you go to siteadvisor.com, they do not have info on this site yet, but the fact that this site continues to be unavailable and the info that others is circulating about this site is a cause for concern. E-bay, Amazon, or other similar sites would be a better and certainly much safer alternative.  I hope this information is helpful to anyone who reads it.|`|7M9HgCH0aa	I'm starting to doubt.

18f4f53d9d57c79acc8282c0db524079aa	The speed you are talking about in your question is the speed from your wireless router to your computer.  Try messing around with the antennas and location of your laptop in your house.  Move closer to the box provided by Qwest and see if it gets faster.      Wireless internet goes up to 54 mbps, but that isn't the speed of your connection to Qwest, it is the speed of your connection to the box inside your house.    For a test of the connection to Qwest, try doing a speed test.  http://www.speedtest.net/  This will check how fast you are connected to the internet.  From that number, you can compare against what Qwest says they will provide.    Yes, I know WiFi can get up to 300+ mbps, but Qwest routers only come in 54g format.|`|Syn2excFaa	I have qwest too and that happens to me too.

AA11134471	the system(), or spawn() functions will do it. I dont remember the exact syntax off the top of my head for spawn() but you can easily look it up. For system() its system("iexplore.exe"); you may need the path, im not sure.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	cstdlib (stdlib.h in ANSI C) has a function called int system( char  *command) which executes any string you send it in the operating system and returns, usually, the return code sent from the program.  When we C programmers want to use switches ("dir /w" for example) but we won't know what switches we'll need till run time, we'll declare a command buffer with enough space for the command and its switches then use sprintf() to generate the command.    In C++ you can certainly use sstreams to do the same thing.    I know more about C than about C++ so I know of no ANSI C++ function which is the equivalent but that would make sense as Stroustrup has described C++ as C with objects and namespaces -- and he should know.  Check your compiler documentation for information on any OTHER functions which might be helpful.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	System::Runtime::InteropServices;

fE7zhp3Caa	You can also use Windex or another ammonia-based cleaner.  The important things are:    - Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth like felt, flannel, or knit (old t-shirt)  - Spray the cleaner on the cloth instead of the LCD  - Use very light pressure when wiping the panel;  too much and you can damage it even if you don't crack it|`|djWjUBcNaa	I always use a wet tissues, not soaked just wet.

Then lightly mist some of the cleaner onto a soft cloth.  You can then wipe down your LCD.    Though I think that might be more hassle then its worth.  I would just go to a electronics store or computer store and buy an LCD cleaner solution.  They aren't that expensive.

DY2IT1Mqaa	When you use the Windows Disk Management snap-in tool to mark your primary partition as active, the computer may not start up if the partition marked as active does not contain the Windows boot files (or boot files for another operating system).    NOTE: When this happens, you may receive the error message when you try to start the computer:  NTLDR is missing     This problem occurs because on Intel-based computers, the system partition must be a primary partition that has been marked as active for startup purposes. This partition must be located on the disk that the computer gains access to when starting up the computer. There can be only one active system partition at a time. If you want to use another operating system, you must first mark its system partition as active before restarting the computer.     To resolve this problem, perform one of the following:        * It may be possible to change the active partition by booting to a floppy disk and using disk utilities to manually change the active partition. -or-        * If enough free disk space is available, you can install Windows to a parallel directory. After the parallel installation is complete, you can use the Disk Management snap-in to change the active partition.          The names commonly used for partitions containing the startup and operating system files are system and boot partitions, respectively. -or-        * If the partition that has been incorrectly marked as active is a FAT, FAT32, or NTFS partition, you may be able to correct the problem by using the Windows Recovery Console.          For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:        229716  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/229716/E... ) Description of the Windows 2000 Recovery Console          NOTE: Windows always considers the active partition to be drive C, so the drive letters on the hard disk partitions may have changed from their original orientation.        Using the Recovery Console, you need to copy the following files from the root directory of the original system partition to the root directory of the current active partition (which is now drive C):        NTLDR        NTDETECT.COM        BOOT.INI        If the partition was not formatted using Windows, you may also need to use the Recovery Console's FIXBOOT command to make the active partition bootable.          After you are able to boot into Windows, it is recommended that you use the Windows Disk Management snap-in tool to reset the original system partition as the active partition, and reboot the computer. This will restore the correct system partition as the C: drive.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	Cause:    Computer is booting from a non-bootable source.  Computer hard disk drive is not properly setup in BIOS.  Corrupt NTLDR and/or NTDETECT.COM file.  Misconfiguration with the boot.ini file.  Attempting to upgrade from a Windows 95, 98, or ME computer that is using FAT32.  New hard disk drive being added.  Corrupt boot sector / master boot record.  Seriously corrupted version of Windows 2000 or Windows XP.  Loose or Faulty IDE/EIDE hard disk drive cable.  Solutions:    Computer is booting from a non-bootable source    Many times this error is caused when the computer is attempting to boot from a non-bootable floppy disk or CD-ROM. First verify that no floppy diskette is in the computer, unless you are attempting to boot from a diskette.    If you are attempting to boot from a floppy diskette and are receiving this error message it is likely that the diskette does not have all the necessary files and/or is corrupt.    If you are attempting to install Windows XP or Windows 2000 and are receiving this error message as the computer is booting verify that your computer BIOS has the proper boot settings. For example, if you are attempting to run the install from the CD-ROM make sure the CD-ROM is the first boot device, and not the hard disk drive.    Second, when the computer is booting you should receive the below prompt.     Press any key to boot from the CD    Important: When you see this message press any key such as the Enter key immediately, otherwise it will try booting from the hard drive and likely get the NTLDR error again.    Note: If you are not receiving the above message and your BIOS boot options are set properly it's also possible that your CD-ROM drive may not be booting from the CD-ROM properly. Verify the jumpers are set properly on the CD-ROM drive. Additional information about checking the CD-ROM drive connections can be found on document CH000213.     Additional information: This error has also been known to occur when a memory stick is in a card reader and the computer is attempting to boot from it. If you have any type of card reader or flash reader make sure that no memory stick is inside the computer.      Computer hard disk drive is not properly setup in BIOS    Verify that your computer hard disk drive is properly setup in the BIOS / CMOS setup. Improper settings can cause this error. Additional information on how to enter the BIOS / CMOS setup can be found in document CH000192.     Corrupt NTLDR and/or NTDETECT.COM file    Windows 2000 users  Windows XP users    Windows 2000 users    If your computer is using Microsoft Windows 2000 and you are encountering the NTLDR error. Create the below boot.ini file on the floppy diskette drive.    [boot loader]  timeout=30  default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partiti...  [operating systems]  multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WI... Windows 2000 Professional" /fastdetect    Copy the NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM files from another computer using the same operating system. Both of these files are located in the root directory of the primary hard disk drive. For example, C:\NTLDR and C:\NTDETECT.COM should be the locations of these files on many computers.    Please keep in mind that these files are hidden system files, if you need additional help with viewing hidden files in Windows please see document CH000516.     Once these files have been copied to a floppy diskette reboot the computer and copy the NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM files to the root directory of the primary hard disk drive. Below is an example of what commonly should be performed from the A:\> drive.    copy ntldr c:  copy ntdetect.com c:    After the above two files have been copied, remove the floppy diskette and reboot the computer.     Windows XP users    Insert the Windows XP bootable CD into the computer.  When prompted to press any key to boot from the CD, press any key.  Once in the Windows XP setup menu press the "R" key to repair Windows.  Log into your Windows installation by pressing the "1" key and pressing enter.  You will then be prompted for your administrator password, enter that password.  Copy the below two files to the root directory of the primary hard disk. In the below example we are copying these files from the CD-ROM drive letter, which in this case is "e." This letter may be different on your computer.    copy e:\i386\ntldr c:\  copy e:\i386\ntdetect.com c:\    Once both of these files have been successfully copied, remove the CD from the computer and reboot.  Misconfiguration with the boot.ini file    Edit the boot.ini on the root directory of the hard disk drive and verify that it is pointing to the correct location of your Windows operating system and that the partitions are properly defined. Additional information about the boot.ini can be found on document CH000492.    Attempting to upgrade from a Windows 95, 98, or ME computer that is using FAT32    If you are getting this error message while you are attempting to upgrade to Windows 2000 or W|`|OhOTQ0mLaa	NTLDR  is a system file which stores all the hardware information in it.    if u have change anything.    y don't u repair the os with the XP bootable CD.|`|BebNutSZaa	You get this message because the computer does not find one of the following 'boot' files:  1.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.    Please dont tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.    None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure   your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter,   add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.    Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies", and "history".  Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without   having to buy or install anything, please click on my avatar   and send send me a message -- ideally with your YouTube   channel or email address. I'll guide you step-by-step, using  plain English and with full explanations.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,   even though this contradicts all my advice. Not only does it   conflict with YouTube, simply clicking on "Don't Accelerate   This Website" will not help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "solutions"   have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of stupid   answer is:....[my paraphrase] "Although you can't watch or   access videos properly, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|k4dQsHKkaa	Try refreshing the webpage    or...    Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.    or..    It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???

E1gN87H0aa	When you're using a PC for games or business apps, the main advantage is that the PC will appear more responsive to you. The reason for this is that there is more likely to be a cpu free to respond to user events such as keyboard key presses or mouse movement. Also, there is more likely to be a free cpu to perform the processing that Simple queuing theory says that if your cpu(s) are 50% busy, then a in dual-core cpu system the chance that a cpu will be free is 25%.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Very, very good.  Most dual-cores have over twice the power of a single core CPU (meaning that a single core from a dual-core CPU is faster than a single core CPU)|`|ILKJx0jTaa	If you are going to be computing everyday and multitasking then the duel core is the way to go, but if you do a lot of multitasking such as video editing and web browsing and listening to music at the same time then i would go with a quad core, you can get the Q6600 for $196 on http://www.newegg.com|`|qSKWUDEvaa	single cores find it hard to work on more than 1-2 programs at a time so you cant listen to music, go on the internet and do work at the same time. Dual cores can easily do 3 times as much as single core so You can have as many programs as you want open really

j3Px4JXfaa	Hi Man,  My names Ron and Im on the Windows Outreach Team. I thought Id stop in and try to answer your question.    Ill throw out the general specs that youll need to have in whatever system youre thinking of installing Windows 7 on, but heres the link that spells it out for you: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...  ? 1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit processor   ? 1 GB of system memory   ? 16 GB of available disk space   ? Support for DirectX 9 graphics with 128 MB memory (in order to enable Aero theme)   ? DVD-R/W Drive   ? Internet access (to download the Beta and get updates)     Hope this helps!    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|zxyevbRgaa	I have the 64 bit beta.I had problems until I updated my bios.It is as stable as XP now.  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...|`|f2K7mSJiaa	i installed windows 7.   it requires about 8.5 gb space on hdd, 400mb ram memory.  it works well in comparison with vista.
AA10810132	I've heard of some 9880gt's having two sli connectors and some having only one allowing SLI only..   Yes you there are certain PSUs you need to use.. 800watts is enough for a tri-sli 9800gt but you better be sure that it has enough pci-e connectors for your three cards (i think at least 3 6pin pcie connectors).. and you better look at the rails, most powersupplies have multiple rails and overloading one of them would make the powersupply fail so it would be better to choose one that has a single massive rail...  The rail thing is optional, its just that a single rail is better than multiple ones.    yeah another thing, scaling in-tri sli is pretty awful.. but its ok, it looks cool anyway..|`|XlyLakYAaa	You're probably better off getting 1 GTX260 than 3 9800GTs.  I'm not even 100% sure the 9800GT supports Tri-SLI.
eI9mkxS5aa	How in heaven's name can you break a toughbook.. i tumbled my cousin's from the third floor...    So anyway. the toughbook is isolated throughout, the only way to fix it is going to an OFFICIAL Panasonic dealer. it's gonna take a while. but if you take it to a local dealer the toughbook wont be so tough when they get it back to you.|`|E5kBRqBlaa	It is the best to contact Panasonic by phone or email. They will suggest you what has to be done. You can send it back to the company, as they suggest.    It will certainly not be free, as tossing the device down the stairs is not covered by the warranty.
8xDSKf3Maa	limewire is a peer to peer program.  if you download something of limewire your actually downloading it off somebody elses computer.  so if somebody downloads something of your computer it is using up mb. so it will add to your monthly data usage.|`|vVJhWnTqaa	Peer 2 Peer is the technology behind most sharing applications. Essentially the songs you download and are only available because others shared with you, so you should share with them as well.|`|69a4cf85f88200f02f51cfb2f39095c3aa	LimeWire is the name of a popular P2P program.    P2P stands for "Peer to Peer". You are correct to assume that when you download a file on a P2P network, you also upload that file to other people who would like to download it as well. In turn, other people must upload the file to you for you to download it. This is how a Peer to Peer network works. If no one uploads anything, you wouldn't be able to download anything.    Yes. If someone downloads from you, it does count towards your monthly data usage.|`|AygEpMMaaa	yep,u r downloading it from some1 in return some1 then downloads it from u,hence  ( p2p )|`|bc6MlMyoaa	That's how the technology works, yeah.|`|wKNcNWD3aa	Peer to peer. Meaning from one person to one person. Someone uploads a file, and someone downloads it directly from that person.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	p2p means "peer to peer" basically you have, you share it. You're not uploading it to others, but you do have it available for others to download if they search for it.|`|nI6V2Q9xaa	you got it,

You would technically need to get clearance and pay royalties to the artist etc.    Podcasts from radio shows cannot include music for this reason. I always though it was to save time, but when listening to John Safran and Father Bob's 'Sunday Night Safran' I learned this- which explained why the podcast never played the Religious Song of the week.

mu1SyqCLaa	It's pretty easy. Most fax to email service today are very user friendly including Onesuite Fax.     For receiving, you don't need to do anything aside from putting an email address where you want your faxes to be forwarded.    For sending you use a simple Onesuite fax application where you can attached pdf, image or document files.    Been using it for a few months now, so far no unsent faxes yet. Here's a link to a few common questions and answers -> http://www.onesuite.com/faqs_OSFax.asp|`|dVK7E5Kiaa	Onesuite is ok but you have many options for online faxing.    The best part is that many of the major online faxing companies offer a FREE 30 day trial so you can test drive their service and then decide if they offer everything you need for your faxing needs.    There are major companies such as RingCentral, MyFax and eFax. You can check out a review of all of these in the link I've included below (http://onlinefaxfree.net/) and they also provide the Free 30 Day Trial.    I made the switch to online faxing with RingCentral fax and in my opnion they are the best, but go ahead and try the 30 day free trial in the one that interest you most and after 30 days you decide whether you want to pay or not :) Hope this information helps!

Try deleting cookies and stuff (tools - browsing history - delete cookies e.t.c.)    Also the more space you take up on ur computer the more slow its gona be.    Also - the more things you have down the bottom right corner make it slower again, and the more things you have open make it slower.    Try deleting some stuff you dont need or want.

1r78EBWYaa	they're both, still vista, Ultimate just has all the features of vista available including accessing the file backups which all versions create but can't be accessed without Vista Ultimate    I'd opt for more RAM than 2GB though    (o_O)  Cheers|`|Bh6Bgzhoaa	With the luck I've had with Vista, chances are it will slow down.  Ultimate just has added security and accessibility features that I know of and more stuff just means more lag unless you really need the stuff.  As you apparently already know, RAM is mostly what your computer needs and a RAM upgrade is probably a lot cheaper than a Vista Upgrade.|`|j5nVMVPNaa	no.  wait for windows 7|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	Stick with home premium. 2GB of RAM isn't very much and your computer could actually become slower or at least start up slower. You probably wouldn't use any of the features in vista ultimate anyway, you'll have a ton of programs and features for business use that you won't need. If you really want to though, upgrade to 4GB of RAM and you should be ok.|`|E5kBRqBlaa	Well, there may not be any much difference. The OS is not at all related to the speed as compared to the hardware. To increase performance, look forward to changing the parts.     If you had Vista Home Basic, switching to Ultimate would speed you up, as Ultimate has some extra features to incrase speed.

fE7zhp3Caa	You can damage RAM by touching it, but it sounds like you're taking all the precautions you can short of working on a grounding mat and wearing a bracelet.  You're handling the RAM with proper care and discharging yourself on the case.  There's not much more you can do, although it you're working on a carpeted floor then just make sure you don't move around on it.  Better to set up on a bare wood or concrete floor.    Some motherboards with 2 slots require memory to be installed first in one slot and then in the other.  This can be because the second slot is for dual-channel mode or because the board maker wanted things to be done that way.  Check your documentation.    Double check yourself as you work.  Make sure the RAM is fully seated in each slot before powering up to test.  Make sure you're inserting the sticks straight.  If you have a lean to them when your installing them they can sometimes give you problems (happened with my system when I upgraded my RAM);  too much and you can damage your slots' connection to the motherboard.    Check to see if you may be bumping another device and causing an intermittent connection.    If nothing works, consider taking the RAM to a local computer shop for testing.  They shouldn't charge you more than $20 or $30.    Or return it for a replacement.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Static can kill RAM, but it sounds like you took precautions against that.  My guess is the motherboard is just finicky about how the chips are seated.  Try putting your original RAM back in, as a sanity test.  It's not uncommon to have to reseat RAM a few times before the motherboard is happy.|`|MTwoxMctaa	If the RAM blocks support it, it should be fine. And if you discharged before, the RAM blocks being blown wouldn't be the problem. It could just be defective somehow. Try to see if you can return it.|`|zF12F5Hfaa	Yes you can kill it buy touching it. You should be fine. I dont think you could have killed the RAM because by the sounds of it you seemed to be very carefull. I could just be a faulty set of RAM send it back or return it    Im really sure you didnt kill the RAM, the RAM probably working the way it was suppose to.|`|IyCnihLmaa	It is also possible it was defective from the factory.  I helped replace 100 memory sticks recently in some lab computers and over 1/4 of the memory ended up bad / testing bad.

Click on my computer and then right click properties to see just how much Ram is working (ie: if you know you have 1 Gig of ram & it is only showing 512MB then you may have a dead/dying stick of ram).  delete any old files you do not need or burn them onto a disc to free up space.

FIboB15Jaa	Older laptop's (And I mean old), could have the battery swell if it charged too long. This was a chemical reaction, similar to the type of rechargable batteries one would buy for a gameboy, or other device. this however would need your laptop to be plugged in for MANY many months, without it using any power. This could cause the battery, and laptop damage. But newer laptops, have an electrical storage; using many types of 'cells', which are basically capacitors, that work much, much better.    If your laptop keyboard is overheatting, it can hint to overall overheatting. This can be cause from many different things. Your fans not working properly and the components inside overheatting. This can be very bad, and will heavily shorten the life of your laptop. It is best to get a professional to look at it, or to send away for warranty repair. My Toshiba Laptop was overheatting for a while (The fan was installed incorrectly from factory) and it fried the Processor. In a laptop the Processor is built in to the motherboard, so they were unable to simply replace it, and had to replace the whole motherboard. If the processor can overheat, and becomes a damaged product it could mean you will need to buy a whole new laptop. If you can cut the problem early,  then you should be fine.
YxlurPgJaa	you can charge your laptop battery as long as you want since lithium batteries don't have the memory effect seen in nickel based batteries, nothing happens if you laptop keyboard gets overheated, it shouldn't get overheated anyways|`|IyCnihLmaa	What do you mean?

After that, go to utorrent, select the shield at the bottom (or where the shield is supposed to be. If you cant see it, try downloading something with utorrent and wait one minute), then select 'Connection Type' and select you internet speed.     - Enter a firewall exception in you Firewall, for both program AND port?  Try removing the exception for port and program, applying, then re-adding the exceptions to the firewall.     - Port Forward the port you are using to the router?  If not, go http://portforward.com/routers.htm and select you router model. Follow the instructions to forward ports for utorrent. This reason is the most common reason for slow downloads, DO NOT SKIP. If you don't get the stuff, read slower.|`|Bh6Bgzhoaa	Go to the utorrent website and check their setup guide for anything you may not have done.  The usual problem is that you have not setup your firewall to allow legacy connections.  In order to do this you need to forward the firewall port that utorrent is using to your router or modem.  All the instructions you need should be at this site: http://portforward.com/routers.htm  Just select the router you are using and follow the instructions.|`|D5LFu34Raa	Since it operates in an adsl technology, depending on the distance of your nearest telephone exchange, at 256 kbps, you will get a maximum bandwidth of 32 kBps.

I wiil not suggest to change it yourself, eventhough it might seems easy but it is not, especially if you do not know what you are doing. Anything can happen, from just wasting you money on memory wich will not work because you bought a wrong one, and the worst that can happen that you can complitely burn your motherboard or get an electroshock.

vVJhWnTqaa	You probably have a virus. The bluescreen you see is generally followed by the system "rebooting" itself, and if you notice on the reboot windows xp screen it will say something about purchasing antivirus protection.     This is the rogueware antivirus 2008/2009/XP/360 that has been running rampant recently. It will keep you from going to AV sites and doing any updates to OS or AV applications. You need to have someone professionally remove the virus, there are many places that you can either go to or contact to have this work done, which should resolve the issue without the need of reinstalling your operating system.|`|beLSHjWbaa	If you PC was or maybe it still is infected, the best way to get rid of all "bugs" and fix all the problems is to reinstall OS.

SJkK3wHgaa	It could be any number of things. I'd start by checking the physical connections to your computer. Ensure everything is plugged in.

Make sure you're not working offline, etc. Just check all lose ends.|`|6AwwInrxaa	Check your network connection.Make sure you're connected to a network.If the problem still persist,check your internet option.If you're using internet security,pls check them too.Maybe your web page was accidentally block.Reset your internet option to default.

VdHKQMeXaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.  Go to: http://toptenantispywareviews.com/RegCom... learn how to fix it.|`|8v6Lq1O5aa	Using a registry cleaner can clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".

Because your computer requires 100% when reading a file, it has to go back and reread the parts that the needle messed up on.    I would back up all your data ASAP, try reinstalling the OS.

I'm a Video major in college so I bought an iMac and a MacBook Pro so I can use Final Cut Pro. Mac is also good if you are into doing things with music, or any kind of creative field.    PC's are good for gaming, and I find that it's easier to use Photoshop and Illustrator on PCs rather than Mac. If you do go PC, try to get Windows XP Professional. Windows Vista in my mind is okay, I can work around a lot of its kinks, but many don't have my luck with Vista. I just got the Windows 7 Beta, and it looks to be promising.     Overall, I go with PC, because I'm so used to using them, and that I like that they can be easily upgraded, such as graphics cards, CD/Disk Drives, Hard Drives, etc. And you'll find that a lot of programs aren't made for Mac but are available for Windows.     Don't fall into the "I thought Mac was better than Windows" trap. Like I said, it's good for certain things. I don't think it's overall better.    Plus, Mac's are so expensive, it's insane.

I think the reason is because around the same time people doing the same thing. Because xbox can be consume more bandwith, you play it live, so it can be tough for the internet connection. Actually it is the same when we play it in the game center, the internet connection slowly drop after many people in once play "Ayo Dance!" (aka Audition). I find it very disturbing, so make sure the bandwith is enough to play.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	well did it start dropping when u started playing live? cos if so that might  be ur problem. if not it mite be who ur with|`|nTH98i2Jaa	If this is happened in continues of time like that, seems that you have to :    1. Make sure your computer has no malware or virus. To make sure this is not, try to change your computer time to backward one hour or forward one hour. If this problem still exist at the same time of 11:00 pm as your home time (not the computer time) you have to contact your ISP to solve this problem.    2. If problem happened at 11:00 pm just the same as your computer time, I suggest you to re-install your computer, because your computer is being hijack by some program with timer control.

1r78EBWYaa	to be compatible across OS platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux    99.9% of the time  the drive is pre-formatted to FAT or FAT32 depending on the size    ie. a 16GB USB Flash pen/thumb drive would not be capable of FAT and would have to be FAT32    Generally 1GB & smaller are pre-formatted as FAT  and anything Larger 2GB & up are pre-formatted as FAT32    you can re-format to NTFS but it's not recommended because NTFS doesn't use disk space in a "linear" fashion as does FAT & FAT32    & if it's NTFS it's not fully Read/Write compatible with anything but Windows 2K & up,   Win9x cannot read or write NTFS drives,   there are some NTFS Read Only solutions for Linux   and some Read/Write solutions for Max OS-X but not older versions    there will be better compatibility in the future because as these drives get bigger the FAT32 file system will need to be phased out of use    (can you imagine a 500GB thumb drive)    (o_O)  Cheers

KnDkfBwkaa	I have that game too! Fortunately, I have older Macs to play it on (which I have not done in a long time).    Forget DOSBox. It is a DOS emulator. The game that we have runs on a Mac with OS 7.5 or greater. Sheepsaver (for Intel Macs) requires that have access to an older Mac OS that you can copy the ROM from.    Your best bet is to buy an older Mac. I don't remember if the game comes on 800k floppies or the 1.4MB. I thought the anniversary game came on CD? Anyway, you can get a Rev. 2, B&W G3, a used USB floppy drive, and OS 8.6 (if necessary) for next to nothing on eBay (less then $100).    Its a little bit of an inconvenience, but you will have more then what you will need to play the game. Have fun!|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	Sorry, you can't  Even if you had a floppy drive, that game will only work on the old powerpc Macs.    The newer Macs use Intel processors    If you can find a download of the DOS version of the game, you can probably run it in DOSBox:  http://www.dosbox.com/|`|zJppAVbVaa	Get Doxbox for OSX.  http://mac.softpedia.com/get/System-Util...    How you will install the game from the floppy disk is unknown.  Perhaps use an External 3.5"/5.25" usb floppy drive|`|73zdU7m1aa	You might be able to get it running using Apple Classic Mode (OS X 10.4 or earlier), or using Sheepsaver (10.5), assuming that the disk is a 1.44MB (HD) type with a USB floppy drive.  If it is an 800K disk, you will need to buy a used older macintosh with an internal floppy drive  in order to read the disk.  You may be able to use a network or external drive to transfer the files from the older mac to your OS X Mac if this is the case.  Most external USB drives do not read 800K floppies because they require a variable speed drive to read them and most standard floppies are fixed speed.

PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..     Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think..    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    SECURITY  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  |`|j5nVMVPNaa	Mac is good. I have one.

I have a Mac and a PC. I use them both and I like them both. I'm more comfortable with my PC, however, because I am more familiar with it and how it manages everything. Plus, if my PC happens to crash it's very easy for me to troubleshoot it. If I need another part, I can easily jump in my car or order it online and put it in myself with ease. With my MacBook, however, I have to ship it off to Apple and have them repair it and ship it back. It's a hassle and something I had to do only once - thankfully. The cost of owning a Mac & keeping up with the latest editions is something I cannot keep up with. It's much cheaper for me to keep my PC updated. All in all, every computer is going to have its ups & downs and I wouldn't let anyone tell you anything differently.|`|4cMuedpWaa	Windows = Drivers problems, compatibility problems, crashes, hang-ups, BSD, freezes and on and on and on...    Macs = all that in a 0,00000000000001%    MAC OS X is a solid Operating System with NONE of the crap that Windows uses.    And I have worked all of my life with Windows PCs|`|Z8lqZXy6aa	I don't think that they're better than PCs for a few reasons, but if I had to say one thing about them being better, it would be because of Windows Vista, and people converting in anger.    1. Price - Unless you're buying the Mac Mini, the cheapest Mac computer is the Macbook at 900 dollars (last I checked). To me, that's way too expensive to spend on a personal computer unless it served a specific purpose. I bought an iMac and a MacBook Pro because I need to use Final Cut Pro for school and career, otherwise I would have never put out 1500 bucks (for the iMac) and 1900 bucks (MacBook Pro) for a personal computer.    2. Upgradeability (is that even a word?) - The best thing about PCs is that the parts are interchangeable and replaceable. If you have a problem with a CD drive, you can just go to Staples, Best Buy, etc, pick one up, come home, slap it in, and you're off to the races. Graphics cards as well. Processors, RAM, Hard Drives, very easy to replace yourself, though I've never done a Processor install just yet. With a Mac,  you buy whatever it comes with, and if there is a problem with a part, you have to send the entire computer back to Apple and wait for them to fix it or put a new part in. And it would end up being more expensive for the labor as well.    3. Program Compatibility - With the Mac trend growing, there are lots of software developers making software for Mac, however there are a numerous amount of third party software makers who aren't producing software for both platforms. If you typed in a Google search for a program that performed a special task but you don't have the program or heard of anything like it, chances are if you find it online, it's Windows only. Sure there are many Mac-Only programs as well, but none enough to really sell me over.    They also say that Macs are immune to viruses, and that's somewhat true. Pretty much most of the world is running on PC, and thats what the virus creators are going to target. It's good that you don't have to worry about viruses on Macs, but it's also simple to prevent and contain viruses on PCs.    I'm glad you enjoy your Mac, I love mine as well, but I wouldn't go as far to say that it's better than PC.|`|oncL2Tixaa	Y'all n1ggas be postin' in a troll thread.|`|ZN4u3s2baa	Apart from the OS what exactly is the difference, my 500 GBP hp notebook has the same core 2 duo chip, 2 gig more ram, a bigger hdd and better graphic card than any mac under 1300 GBP, it can also run a mac os if i so want.    The only reason i use vista is because of software compatibility, it dual boots with ubuntu and i use ubuntu for all my daily internet travels as it is sturdier and less prone to viruses.   The only reason i see people buying macs these days is because its fashionable to do so,they are like the prada of computers.   for expample , walk into any  mac store and look at the displays and how trendy it all is then look at the 12 yo school kids begging mummy and daddy for a 1000GBP laptop for them to do their homework on it makes no sense at all, exept for high end power macs used in media ,     So buy your system based on what you use it for not because its trendy   you will just be a putz if you spend a fortune to check your mail and sync your mp3 player.|`|hmSwQobvaa	Mac's are way better, they are made for having fun.

HOq5Urn1aa	Yes it does, but I would install a second anti spyware program  Spyware Terminator is a very good one, It is free and has a very good real time shield.  http://www.spywareterminator.com/  As you know, you should never have more than one anti virus program on you computer. It is however recommended to have at least 2 anti spyware programs. So you can run Spybot and Spyware Terminator together.|`|4QmgVhS5aa	You should use an antivirus program and antispyware software, because your computer is now infected with viruses and/or spyware.  Here you have more information on computer security, as well as good and free programs that you can download into your computer:  The  website list top ten the best and newest anti-spyware in 2009.  http://toptenantispyware.com/  All are safe and can be trusted and you can download one.|`|44415e09eb0e052d5c1f363945f1e958aa	Spybot S&D can detect and remove spyware & adware. But it is not so helpful to prevent spyware installation. It's real-time protection not effective. It provides little information about found threats.
N9ygGImkaa	Yes, but there are a few factors that go into this. First off ventilation; If your laptop squishes down into your pants, bed etc and the vents get covered you're setting yourself up for a problem since there's no way to circulate the heat away from the hardware.  Another thing that could do it is running high performance games and whatnot. Though you may leave the vents uncovered, without a surface that lets go of heat easilly, you can have too much heat around the near area so that it vents in the hot air it was putting out. Due to the graphics cards putting out heat in addition to the processor, this situation can become dangerousm expecially in a bed. If it's sitting on your lap, however, you'll probably notice your leg feels like you just leaned on a black car in mid summer on a 80 degree day before your system is in critical danger. If you have a cooling pad of some sort you should be ok on your bed, due to the set up of vetihillation and heating distribution, but I cant imagine that would be very lap friendly.|`|zxyevbRgaa	The bedclothes can block the air flow.Eventually the lint will clog the cooling fins.  Someone needs to design a laptop case that has a port to attach a strong vacuum to pull out the lint and dust.  But they won't because that would make them last longer.|`|EMcwjhZ4aa	aww man.. i hope not   . thats the only way i use it .|`|XSBsomfVaa	Yes. Mine actually shut down on me when I was doing homework. You just have to make sure that the computer is being properly ventilated. When it's on your lap or on the bed, make sure the vent is not blocked and that you can feel the heat coming out of it. That way you can make sure it's working properly.|`|AA12181625	if you plug up the vents over and over something could happen.if it has vents.|`|Rkir7YnBaa	On your lap it is unlikely unless you are wearing some really loose clothing.  On a bed if there is a fluffy comforter that the laptop will sink into, then probably.  The thing you have to watch for is something blocking the air vents,  It has been a while but some had air intake on the bottom with discharge on the side or back.  Most now have intakes on the side or back edge.  So long as you do not block the slots, should not be a problem.  If you are really concerned you can get a cooler unit for a few dollars at a computer store that has fans to aid in dissipating the heat.  They run off the USB port of the laptop.|`|GzOL9FwDaa	yes it can over heat cause the fan can get blocked.|`|E5kBRqBlaa	If you keep it on your bed, there are more chances that the air vents are blocked by a pillow or mattress. Blocking the air vents means trapping the heat inside. This will cause the laptop to shut itself down to prevent damage. It may also cause the chips to melt.    Also, regularly check your heatsinks (if possible) and the vents for collected dust. The dust will also do the same thing. I am currently sitting on my chair with the laptop rested on a couple of boxes as it has got an overheating problem and it shuts down automatically when I play Transformers.

It can lower the resources it uses when you start up applications, but if you're not doing anything, it will use more RAM to pre-load things that you might use in the near future.    Vista is actually a VERY good operating system and widely misunderstood.  I personally find that most people who say bad things about Vista have never even bothered to try it.

I am a big fan of mac btw:P    I would say the Dell is the better laptop overall(HD capacity, video card,ram).However,  I don't think you would need that much ram for internet browsing, movie/music and other stuff. It would suitable as a gaming laptop though.    If you are planning to go for the Dell, install normal xp instead. Some people might say that they are comfortable with Vista, but they will change their mind after a month:).    Note:Have nothing against people using Vista though. Even if you can lower the resource use(through some tweaking), some people may not bother to do this at all( not everyone is a computer savvy, some just need laptop for basic use)|`|EkIQCrUEaa	Go with world no.1 brand hp or compaq graphics inbuild dedicated coming with hp. more details contact 9962368821|`|RF739Kxqaa	go for the dell, the hardware is better then the mac. also if you don't want vista you can have xp put on it.|`|lTUmzLuxaa	DELL......|`|28ID8cUuaa	lenova and accer company loptop is better|`|r6s8Ja9Xaa	according to my experience second one good, most important speed ,depend on ram ,though battery power is low but it's ok because according to me no one Laptop is having 5 hr backup it's hardly impossible

As for gaming, assuming you do 3D gaming, look for a laptop with a dedicated 3d card (256+ memory on the card).  Go for as much hard drive as your budget permits.

Does not work with HD videos, however, but there's still a workaround to download HD YouTube videos.    All YouTube videos are temporarily cached into your browser's cache folder. For the case of Internet Explorer, that happens to be your Temporary Internet Files folder. If you're in Windows 2000 or XP or Server 2003: search for files that start with the name "video" on "C:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5" (usually hidden) or its subfolders. If you're in Windows Vista or Server 2008: open the Run tool and type "C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Window... Internet Files\Content.IE5", then on the Search box there just type "video" and it will search for all cached video files (which are the actual HD YouTube videos).    Low-quality YouTube videos usually have no file extension (video, video[1], video[2], etc.) but are actually FLV files. High-quality, non-HD YouTube videos have the FLV file extension (video.flv, video[1].flv, video[2].flv, etc.). HD YouTube videos are all MP4 files (video.mp4, video[1].mp4, video[2].mp4, etc.).    To play FLV and MP4 videos on Windows, you will need to install K-Lite Codec Pack which includes the ffdshow decoder that can decode several video formats usually not supported by Windows Media Player.    For imeem, Veoh, and other Flash-based video sites, the "Temporary Internet Files" tricks above will also work - they usually keep the FLV file extension but in some cases they may omit the FLV extension.

sXTjYH7Iaa	Virtual memory is a lot like what it sounds: It's auxiliary storage that resides on your hard disk, and your OS uses it when your RAM gets too full.  You can delete files that you no longer need. Save files on an external hard drive or burn to DVD's.  There is not enough room in the computer memory to run properly so it has to be cleaned out.    Running disk defragmenter is a good start. It takes some time so let it do it's thing.  It shows how to do this on the provided link.    Go to the link to find other ways to fix this.    http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/null/782|`|WeZcSZvKaa	When you install Windows the system sets up your Virtual Memory to 1? times the size of your RAM. It also takes into account the size of your Hard Disc drive and allows approx 10% of it's free space size. So if you disc is nearly full it will start to have problems.    First thing to stop your problem is to not to have too many programs open at once. Although you not actually using them they are running in the background and taking the RAM's resources which overspills into the virtual memory.    Another way to help is if you right click on My Computer ? Properties ? Advanced ? Performance ? Advanced ? Virtual Memory ? and change the button setting to "System Managed Size" ? click on Set ? Apply & OK ? The system will now ask you to reboot for the settings to take effect ? click on OK.    This allows the system to be flexable and can adjust the Virtual Memory as required with out being fixed between two parameters. With a bit of luck that should solve your problem!    You also might want to think about increasing the size of your RAM.|`|zxyevbRgaa	turn the pagefile off and reboot then turn it back on   system>  advanced system settings > performance    make sure you have it set for windows to control the virtual memory|`|AuNz7KV4aa	in short, your running way to many programs.

Reason being is that if the min and max are the same (4 gigs in this case) the "virtual memory AKA swap file does not have to grow and shrink.|`|9o8lEBSnaa	When all of your computer's real physical memory (RAM) is in use, Windows will try to create virtual memory by grabbing a chunk of hard drive space and treating it like real memory. Your software can't tell the difference between real and virtual memory, but you might because virtual memory access is much slower, due to the hard drive activity it requires.    If you encounter the low virtual memory error message, then you have used the maximum amount of real plus virtual memory that is supported on your system. Sometimes programs that crash or ones that are poorly designed will not return their working memory space to the operating system when they're done using it. Other programs that need a large amount of memory to run may fail because Windows cannot "see" the available memory. In most cases, a shutdown and restart will resolve this problem.|`|c2a0ffa9394d629428b6f7178805ff02aa	Vista or XP ??

AA10446546	Not quite of the both. Some (large) websites are distributed over several servers, while some servers hosts several website.    But what is always true is httpd.conf is the setting for a single Apache instance. It is possible for a -- usually large -- websites to be actually served by several servers (obviously with different Apache instance). And some of the cheaper or free hosting hosts several websites in a single Apache instance (which means httpd.conf affects several websites at a a time).    If your website is big and is high traffic, it might be better to serve the cacheable content (images, scripts, etc) in a separate server.|`|D5ShDa5naa	It's Apache's top-level configuration file. You can override the settings in httpd.conf on a per-directory basis by putting a .htaccess file in the directory you want to apply the changes to, but the developers recommend doing as much as is practical in httpd.conf. That makes it easier to keep track of what directives are coming from where.
3QDt9znwaa	HI - The issue you will have is that the footage on your DVD is already very heavily compressed. If you try to extract that and drop it into AE it will show up blocky and not particularly useful for doing effects (although it can be done)    I would suggest using a tool such as DVD Videosoft which will extract your footage into AVI, WMV, MP4 and Other Formats (optional) (The optional conversion involves a piece of 3rd party software called AVS video converter) Find more about this at http://www.free-video-editing.com/ya    If there's any way you could find the original footage before it was compressed that would be far better    Hope this helps  Freevideoman

There are other free solutions out there that will allow you to compress and decompress zip files. WinRAR is a popular choice since the trial version will never "expire" like most trials do. Personally, I suggest trying an open source program called 7-Zip. It supports compression to five different formats and decompression from 23 different formats and can compress 2-10 % smaller than WinZip. More importantly, it is completely free.
69a4cf85f88200f02f51cfb2f39095c3aa	It is possible that those three files are, for one reason or another, in use.    Try booting to safe mode and using Defraggler there.    Alternatively, you should also be able to resolve this with an "offline defragmentation". An offline defrag will defragment your computer before Windows has a chance to mount it.    The only program I can think of that features an offline defrag is one called O&O Defrag.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Use Diskeeper 2009 Pro; it's an excellent defragger ...always completely defrags my XP system without leaving any file fragmented.

7L60FeYxaa	I have a the same netgear USB adapter but in V2 and I find that I get a better connection with a wireless router that is connected to my computer.    The router connects to the PC (which we barely use, couldn't tell you what its like on there) with a cable then I connected the laptop to the router via wireless connection. It depends on what you have and what you're prepared to spend if you don't have certain things.    Our family has a plan with optus and the kit we got came with the router and the USB adapter (and more stuff not worth mentioning) and we also have a Telstra prepaid one that we used for going on hols and stuff and it wasn't very good.

aLyJe1b3aa	broadband internet   & a router    your labtop already has a wireless adapter built in  & a wireless card is something to have internet in  any location in the U.S.|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	If you are looking to use your cellphone wherever you go, you will need a  wireless network adapter, like a phone for your laptop like you speak about from sprint.    Some cellphones may be used to connect your laptop via bluetooth or cable to the internet, however, the cost of being able to do this through your provider are just as high as if you had the dedicated card, so I would not use this option unless you really want to.    Most of the newer cards are supported by USB 2.0, and are capable of 3G speeds. 3G is currently the fastest wireless connection for cellular style broadcasts. The availability of 3G depends on network coverage. 3G is not available in all areas. What this means is that in or close to a major city, you will prob have a 3G connection, while in a rural area you may only be as fast as dial-up.     My verizon card gets me downloads of around 100-200 kbps in some places, and in other you can watch a movie while waiting for it download. So your speed will vary by location, however you do want one with 3G support. 3G is pretty fast, pretty much broadband speed.     All of the companies out there right now only offer 5GB of transfer per month. After that, you are charged a hefty overuse charge per MB.     Now about a home network. If you have a cable/dsl modem, then it must be a wireless one if you want to use wireless funtions. Nearly all new laptops on the market come with a standard wireless network card as well as a LAN connection. The great thing is, while on the road with a laptop with a wireless network card, it is usually pretty easy to find a hotspot that has no login needed. This allows you to do something quick, like send an email, look up directions, etc..     So in the end, i would suggests a laptop with a wireless on board network card, and I might would look into getting service from sprint or verizon or the sorts, the cost on that is about 60 bucks a month, kinda pricey, but if you need it you need it. If your comcast modem is not a wireless broadcast modem, then get ahold of comcast and ask to trade yours in for one that is.|`|AIGevX6jaa	You don't build laptops.

If you have comcast you will have to connect the modem to the router and you will have wireless internet.|`|GKsdtbgeaa	The best possible thing you can do is ask a sales consultant. Preferably one who knows their stuff.    Wireless internet speaks for itself - no wires.  For a laptop, it is a USB object (a thing where the plug loooks a bit like [|] on its side).    The internet on a cellphone is called WAP, or Wireless Access Protocol. It is the same thing as Wireless Net, just on your phone.    To answer your speed question, yes it can be faster, sometimes alot slower, depending on the area you are at and how busy your server (the network you are connected to) is.    Of course, I live in Australia so things will be different elsewhere.  But that is the basic idea.          Sorry if i've dumbed it down ridiculously, I have to explain alot of things to alot of people alot of the time. and they end up asking someone else.

3QDt9znwaa	Hi there - Personally I would recommend DVD-Flick    DVD Flick is a windows based free DVD burning tool. It allows you to take video files from many many formats and create a DVD file from them. It even includes a burning tool to physically burn the file to a DVD after creation.    One feature I especially like is the ability to knit multiple files together to create a single video. This is useful if you've created a large movie but split it into smaller chunks to make the encoding and rendering easier. DVD Flick will allow you to merge them together within the tool to create your final film (which I think is pretty neat)    DVD Flick supports 45 file formats, 60 video codecs and 40 audio codecs.    Information about these and more, can be found on the web site below.    Hope this helps  Freevideoman

You could use blogger, or wordpress, or any other blog software you want. Its really easy, free, and there are a number of free templates you could use. If you set it up right its completely transparent to whether it uses blog software or not.    If you want to go the template route you could join something like www.55design.com and sign up.  Of course you would still need to get a domain and hosting, but there are a ton of sites that are already set up ready for you to just change names and images. Its $55 for the year and there are a ton of websites that are already set up you could easily change. I know they have a blog that has some good tips there too.The best thing about joining a site like this is you have access to MULTIPLE templates if you decide you would like to go with another template. I believe there is a whole pack of LOGO templates you get along with that membership too.|`|uxEThASeaa	I recommend one of these: http://www.hosttell.com/    Powweb is on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them.    They include web builder, plus they offer easy, one click install of Wordpress, so you can install it, just choose a theme and start adding content.

So it depends on your preferences, if you're like me and you like the old games it's worth it, but if you don't play the old ones then don't do it.  It you're version of ps3 doesn't allow you to play ps1 games, linux will! Give it a go and see.  You could install it onto a thumb drive and not take up any of your hard drive.  Remember that linux is also extremely dependent on the internet and if you can't connect then linux won't work as well.  I have an extreme emulator called mupet that play's like 30 different systems games.

Select (Drag mouse Left Top to bottom right corners) the piece of spreadhseet you want  8. Right click, Copy  9. Go to your first spreadsheet,  10. Paste, move, resize  11. Voila, happy spreadsheeting.      If this doesn't work for you, I don't know why.|`|g62ATenqaa	You cannot have different widths in the same column, all 65,536 rows (pre 2007 versions are formatted the same). 1million, 400 thousand odd in 2007.  What is best though is to merge certain cells that contain lots of data, but the ones below remain normal width column, ie.8.43 pt or even less if you double click on column address to autofit.

If this fails then hold in the start button on the tower for about 3 seconds and the machine will switch off. It doesn't necessarily mean you have a virus.

Most instances of application hang are caused by invalid memory addresses.  In other words a program tries to retrieve information from a memory address but the information is no longer there.  Other times a program can get stuck in an infinite loop and use up all the memory and bring the entire computer to a halt due to lack of memory.    You need to use Task Manager to verify whether a program is still functioning.  Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete and click on the Processes tab.  Check whether the digits next to the process name in the CPU and Mem Usage columns are doing anthing.|`|yDaNMARcaa	Software loses files that run a particular application...  You don't need a virus to crash a computer...  Hardware failure, or I should say hard drive failure, will crash your computer.|`|K5XpqLdVaa	Sounds like you have a problem with your computer, not enough processing power.  Computers crash because they are not maintained correctly, processes and memory lock up and cause the computer to crash.|`|4QmgVhS5aa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.

It overloads in information too quickly for its capacity, and therefore the computer freezes because the information that has gone into the computer corrupts all other running files causing it to come to a halt.  Sometimes there are freezes, basically because it goes though a recovery stage to recovering data, but the data cant be recovered leaving it in a frozen state, which means you have to restart your computer.    Im not sure what the code is, search it on google. Perhaps a Reference number?
pUzJiMUcaa	NOTNULL...haven't seen that one used in a row filter...    I'd use the ISNULL() function. Syntax for this would be:      incidentList.RowFilter = "CustomerID= '" + CustomerID + "'"+"AND ISNULL(DateClosed, -1)  -1";    In this, the ISNULL function is checking if DateClosed is null. If it is, it returns -1 (if not, it returns DateClosed) The next operator says "Don't return any value that is returns -1 in the ISNULL function".    That's the only way I've seen a rowfilter exclude nulls...

Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	You've blended two concepts in your question:  Remote ASSISTANCE means you invited someone to help you. Someone gaining access remotely and controlling your system, means somehow another computer gained access to functions, or files of your system, unknown to you.  This makes your system a ZOMBIE.  This may come from many vectors (or sources),  usually the result of misconfiguration of settings, or lax security.  The dynamic and fluid nature of Windows OS permit this assault, whatever it's source.  This topic is far too complex to cover in this forum.

I was an intruder alarm engineer and I got called to an architect client whose computer would "come alive at night" after being switched off, and messages would be left on the screen, even though the office was locked at night and he slept with the key under his pillow. I set up a program whereby the communicant was set questions with a Yes or No answer. It turned out there was a teenage daughter in the house rapidly approaching puberty who had attracted a deceased entity (quite common in puberty/pubescence). Only after a Sikh Guru visited the house and exorcised the spirit, was his daughter and the deceased left in peace. The spirit would also trigger the alarm Passive Infra Red detector in one particular room which had been set on test mode. There were no sleepwalkers in the residence and both doors to to the test room were locked and the keys retained in the architect's bedroom. Does your house have a history of someone having passed on? If spirits can open doors, they can also operate keyboards and read or answer questions left for them on the monitor. It is certainly worthy of consideration. You could leave a message on a piece of card, asking them to press the space bar to reactivate the monitor from sleep-mode to reveal the message. Then over the course of a week or so you should be able to establish if the cause is a mischievous spirit. Rather than sleeping with your computer under your bed it would be a good idea to lock it in a spare room and keep the key under your pillow. That way if it is a deceased entity it will be more inclined to keep clear of bothering you. You will also need to leave an economy light on, wherever you leave the computer overnight.|`|4iqnOvE1aa	You do not need an engineer u Need an excorcist there are Ghost in your house probably a lady spirit coz it was chatting with you BF

QZeM4ZUVaa	Hi,  please do this first :-  Reboot and press F8 as it boots up to go into safe mode then :-  run CHKDSK :-  start -> run -> command line then type chkdsk /f (the /f switch tells it to fix errors). You'll also need to mention the drive you want examined. Just put the drive letter ahead of the switch (eg. chkdsk C: /f). you will now be asked to reboot your system as it boots up it will start to check your drive and then fix any errors you have as well.  Now please do this :-  download CCleaner, install it and then run it, this will safely delete all your temp files etc for you, then reboot back into safe mode again (press F8 as it boots up) and defrag your hard drive to get all your free space back again, i think your system is full of rubbish and just needs a good cleanup.  CCleaner will also clean your reg files correctly as well, but please remember to reboot between doing a disc cleanup and a reg cleanup.  Defaggler will defrag your drive quickly and cleanly.  this will help you, (i promise).  http://www.ccleaner.com/download  http://www.defraggler.com/download    This is a completely free download and will not harm your system in any way.|`|uAOkRBA0aa	start up in last known good configuration.

Xbx4V59Kaa	To answer your question directly. Here are the following specs you need to have in your XP to play Lord of the Rings Conquest: Here is the address for all the information:     http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/01...     SP2 or Windows Vista  (SP mean service Pack) For XP there are a total of 3 service packs. You might need to up date your computer.  * 2.4 GHz Core Duo processor or equivalent  * 1 GB RAM  * A 256 MB Video Card, with support for Pixel Shader 3.0 - nvidia 7800 or equivalent  * The latest version of DirectX 9.0c  * A DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card  * At least 6 GB of hard drive space for installation.    As far as Windows Vista these are the facts and my personal opinion.    I would stick with XP. Vista has had many problems. Vista may also not support your printer, scanner or software like quicken or commuincation software. Its been more than quirky to say the least. Here are some very important must read articles about Windows Vista. It will enlighten and educate you and Im sure lead you to a decsion of staying with XP. There is an old saying. "Dont fix what aint broke."  Here's the links.     http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-101496...    http://badvista.fsf.org/what-s-wrong-wit...    http://www.pcworld.com/article/153295/sk...|`|zokJMPBAaa	upgrade your motherboard ,processor,psu,upgrading your os will not help though windows xp 64bit works better for the upgraded computer  here is a website you need to check out for upgrade|`|AygEpMMaaa	upgrade ur xp,if u like the Vista look just download this    http://www.crystalxp.net/galerie/en.id.1...    but me personally i would upgrade whatever needed upgrading than buying vista|`|r3E8doe7aa	wait for windows 7.|`|M6FURI3raa	I use a Vista and its alright, but it can be very slow.

I bought a new computer a year ago and the sales person talked me into vista. I write children's book and illstrate them so I bought the top of the line computer to work with the graphics programs I had. I told them the programs I had purchased and asked if there would be compatibility problems, and was told there wouldn't be.    But there was... lots of them. 2 of my programs won't work at all, and my printer is incompatible with Vista. I tried downloading patches to meake everything work, but it still doesn't.     With all of this said, I strongly advise against getting Vista. Just upgrade your graphics card and install moreRAM.

VbhXTKO8aa	Hi,    It's very unrecommended to install more then one antivirus at the same time  on system. It can cause unpredictible effects like blue screens, undetected  malware soft. or limited functionality. Actually you shouldnt you even few  antispyware apps which have an live monitors.    If you do use 2 or more, be sure only one is active at a time.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	No, it's not okay. It's like using two condoms. Actually, it's like using two sheepskin condoms. Both are ineffective. And together, they're even less effective.    Stop running "antivirus" and get some real protection instead.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|es6au3ITaa	It depends.  Sometimes one program conflicts with another.  I personally would choose one, keep it up to date, and be cautious of what I expose my computer to.|`|9019680d8ddcf225e537b2d9db41b654aa	Is it ok to keep two anti-viruses active at the same time? NO    You should only run one AV - Avira or Kasperasky delete one.    If you think your AV is missing viruses then the safe thing to do is a free online scan, this way your not running two AV:    http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html    http://housecall.trendmicro.com/uk/
dntaXIGgaa	Dude, i think the best and easiest way is to :  1. Get hold of an Operating system..(say WinXp)  2. Have your PC boot with CD at start up.(you can usually do this by going into Cmos setting....in most PC it is pressing "Del" while its booting)    Before you do these make sure:  1. You have a backup of your files.  2. Backup of software CD's that are installed and are your needs.    Now....this process will actually allow you to format and then re-install the operating system.    1. insert OS(operating system) cd  2. boot from CD  3. follow the Menu and steps in CD  4. during the process you will see a screen which shows your current drive(c: usually) and its allocation.  5. select it and delete it.  6. Continue and it will ask the file type to format into...usually ntfs.  7. continue with setup....in the process you will be  asked to set timezone, user name, as well as network which you can skip.    now....be sure to use an genuine and registered OS.  This is an basic instructio....you may also search re-installing OS for more info.    cheers|`|AygEpMMaaa	formatting won`t get rid of the virus`s,u need 2 get an antivirus    free antivirus`s - Avast,AVG,Avira,,,only 1 antivirus program on a pc    free online scan - http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html    and get malwarebytes,that will get rid of any spyware,its free      formatting ur pc u need 2 press F12 on boot up and u hear a tapping sound,then insert ur format disc and follow on screen instructions|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Formatting WILL destroy any virus; in fact, it's the only 100% certain way to achieve a secure system.  You'll need a Windows OS disk to do it though.  Before you do anything, back up your drivers to a separate CD!  It gets harder and harder to find them, and many places charge to get them.  Try Driver Magician Lite (freeware);  http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system...  Use the 'identify & back up all drivers' for the first BU; & keep it with your unit.    Don't bother doing a data backup now; you'll likely just be backing up the virus/malware.   With the OS disk in the tray, power up the system; Windows will walk you through the steps.  Do a 'Formatted' install; NOT a 'Repair'.    Good luck.|`|nI6V2Q9xaa	do u ahve a disc for windows xp/vista. if u dont go bye one if u do folo these steps:    put the disc in and restart ur compo  press 'any key'to boot from cd.  folow the prompts.  enter ur details. voila. simple!|`|v27n9rksaa	if you are using Windows Operating System;  Click on START button,  Point to All Programs  Point to Accessories and click on Command Prompt  Type C: on the screen displayed and depress ENTER Key   Type Format   Then follow the on-screen instructions as the formatting process progresses.  But be sure to back-up your important files.  Goodluck|`|yRwLyQedaa	Well if you don't know that you can't format the disk in Windows whilst Windows is using it (system drive) then you'd better not mess around. Instead pay someone to clean up your system. They may not even need to re-install/format, but might be able to clean the viruses off and get your system working again. Or ask them to reformat anyway but this might take longer depending on the nature of the PC in question. Get them to teach you what they're doing as they do it and it will be a good investment of money.  Alternatively, back-up your personal files (always scan for viruses when doing such operations), get a boot CD like Ultimate Boot CD, boot it and use one of the disk-blanker/shredders to wipe the drive clean, restart, get a Windows install CD, boot from it and install Windows. Restore your files by copying from the backup on the other PC. Then realise that making the effort to properly use an anti-virus and firewall is a lot less than the effort to re-install Windows! ;-)
Nby3Emktaa	That depends on what kind of programming you want to learn.  Designing a website and designing a desktop application generally involve different languages that are designed to do very different things.  But, a good overall language to learn though is C++.  Its syntax has been copied and imitated by countless other languages, and it is one of the most widely used too, so learning that would be a nice starting point.  Try going to your local library and checking out some books on the topic, I'm sure they have plenty.

h0hSIgC1aa	Well that is going to depend on the specific components you have - and in most cases it is not as much as you think.    Go to a reputable PSU calc like this one:    http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psuca...    and put in your values, for this system:  Amd X2 7550 / 2 x ddr2 / 1 x sata / 1 x dvdrw / 3 x fan / 8800gt 512M    I get a whopping 250W.  So look for a quality unit that at least 250W or more on the +12v combined max power    Let's go with this (since someone mentioned Corsair, good choice)    CORSAIR CMPSU-400CX 400W  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  $60 w/ $10 MIR & free shipping    It has a +12v combined rating of 360W, so it can handle that system and a lot more upgrades (or last a very long time)  http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...      cheers|`|XmnVJxzaaa	600-ish Watts should be fine. In fact, it is a little more than you need, which is always a good thing for a power supply (PSU). You never know when you are going to upgrade again and a little extra power when you do is nice.  Another thing to consider when buying a PSU is the number of Amps on the +12 Volt rail(s). Many higher-end graphics cards require a large number of Amps (20+) be available on a single +12 V rail. Try to find a PSU that has one, single large +12 Volt rail.   I'm big on Corsair power supplies because they are one of the only companies that make PSUs with a single +12 V rail. This model:   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  should work just fine for you. Or, if you already have a favourite PSU company find one of their products that has a single, large +12 V rail.  Good luck!|`|DvvnXLS1aa	It is better to have more power.Maybe you will upgrade your computer or connect more hardware.Off course,use brand PSU,i have bad experience with unnamed PSU (DAMAGED COMPUTER!!!)

93c878b05606a22f5b62decd4c13ecc9aa	Considering you have not given any details as to which columns/cells you wish to transfer to the "print" page, I'm assuming this is a portion of the macro that you are able to setup on your own, and that you are just looking for some ideas on the general design of the macro itself.  I am also assuming when you speak of "pages" you are referring to worksheets.    It also appears you may be familiar with creating the buttons for the macros, but for all those reading here who may not, the following link provides a good explanation for how to do this:    http://www.mrexcel.com/tip068.shtml        Now, there are several ways you might program the macro...here's a couple:    1) Use a pre-defined space on the print worksheet for each of the other worksheets such that none overlap.  Leave as many empty rows or columns between sections as necessary to ensure they will not overlap.  Then  prepare a separate macro to remove all but X number of blank rows/columns between the sections so that it will look nice for printing.    In this arrangement, you would click on buttons 1, 4, and 5 and then click on a button "Prepare for Printing."  Using this macro arrangement would mean that each page could occur once and only once, and that it would always present the pages in the same order, regardless of the order in which the buttons were clicked or how many times the buttons were clicked prior to clicking on the "Prepare" button.    2) Make each macro check the existence of data on the "print" sheet before copying additional data into it.  Once it reaches X number of blank lines and/or finds a pre-arranged marker, it knows to begin at a row following this marker.    In this arrangement, the order in which buttons were pushed would change the order in which the data was filled in on the print sheet, and if a button were pushed more than once, the data would also appear more than once in the print.      With either of these macro arrangements, you would be forced to either clear the print worksheet before clicking the macro buttons, or create a button to do so, so that you start with an empty page.    Assuming the "print" page were worksheet  7, here's a quick example of how it might be done:    Sub PrintSheet1()  printrow = 0  For i = 1 To 65000    If (Worksheets("Sheet7").Cells(i, "A").Value  "") Then printrow = (i + 1)  Next i    printrow = printrow + 1 'This will put a blank line between sections.  Increase as necessary.    For i = 1 To 600 'Change this to include the necessary rows to copy     Worksheets("Sheet7").Cells(printrow, "A").Value = Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(i, "A").Value  Next i    End Sub

zorYTX59aa	Don't take it personally.    Unfortunately for you, any music that's not your creation and that is  used in your video is considered "copyright infringement". The huge  music/media corporations like UMG, Warner and Viacom don't just  "own their music", they "own the rights" to them, which means how  and where "their music" can be publicly presented.    Thus, they're apparently 100% within their rights to claim the music   in your video as their own -- especially if you have not paid them for   "licensing fees", "distribution rights", "royalties", and/or "expressed   written permission" to use and "broadcast" their music on YouTube.    Even if you gave credits to the song, the artist and/or the label, that  should never be construed as an excuse or justification for you and   really YouTube to "break the law". You could contest the takedown  trying to claim that your video is for "personal use" only, but the big  corporation lawyers could ask some intriguing questions of you like  A) why did you upload your vid to YouTube; B) why did you, in their  minds, rip off "their music"; and C) how did you acquire that music?   Even if you bought it legally (and can prove it!), that does not entitle   you to, in their eyes, "distribute" it illegally for free -- or to have your   video potentially come across as though you may be a commercial  agent or official representative of theirs.    It may not be your intention, but to the copyright owners, you might  be involuntarily defaming them, the song or the artist -- even though  they have probably never seen your video or heard of you. I have not  seen your vid, so please don't feel that I'm insulting you, but if I was  U2, Linkin Park, Aerosmith, Eminem or the copyright owner of their   music, I don't think I'd want my songs affiliated with possible videos  of gerbils eating ice cream, stupid neighborhood pranks, nerdy kids  in a school cafeteria, boring highlights of a basketball game or even   amateurish "fanvids" of "MY" music. Your video may not be like the  ones I've just given examples of, but if the artists/corporations didn't  object to your video with their music, it could be perceived that they  "officially endorse" you or that you could be one of them.    If you know of other vids using the same music, either YouTube will  take them down eventually, or someone who's jealous will flag them.  If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the   same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,  description, or tags. Also avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright   infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any   credit for this song". Not only do YouTube's servers seek out words   and sentences like that, it reaffirms that you havee knowingly taken,  used, copied or maybe even stolen someone's copyrighted material.    You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry   is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such,   it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your   video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".  You would thus be better off trying to find a different recording of the   music you want to use. If you've noticed that other videos are using   the exact same music, those videos were probably uploaded before   this new technology really started coming into being.    The only possible exception to everything that I've just written above   is for you to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds. If you listen   carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a   guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)    I hope my info has been helpful to you.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	The person above me is quite correct.  You are free to do as you wish with your video but the problem is you are placing it into the public domain (uploading it onto the web).  This is what the owner of the copyright objects to.  I guess you are too young to have any old style vinyl records.  From the time music became commercial available on record - 78's, LP's, 45's - there has been a notice on the label of the record "Public performance prohibited".  Uploading onto the web is the 21st century version of "public performance" because your video is available to the public.  Record labels - especially WMG (Warner Music Group) - are pressuring YouTube to delete (or mute the audio on) any video that includes music track belonging to the label.  If YouTube failed to comply, they could be sued and possibly, if the judgment for damages went the record label's way, be put out of business.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	You're like me... we get the sh*t luck all the time with things lol    jus laugh it off babes|`|3XMCQ4Spaa	Most likely because whomever you used on your soundtrack -- or more likely their record-company -- have actually complained to youtube (about your usage) or previously have refused to have their music used on YouTube.  There is probably also a large degree of chance involved, that the "wrong people" have happende to see *your* video (but the others).    In any case, the TOS of YouTube states that you can only put-up content you are allowed to publisize -- ie. have the copyright to or permission from the copyright-holder(s).|`|d7kC9WPKaa	most ppl ask the ppl who maked the cd aka the band
5zSSGKBpaa	Before installing I would suggest that you get the live-cds for various linux distros to see which one will work best on YOUR computer hardware. Some versions of linux have problems with some graphics cards (nvidia seems to work best) and wireless cards. The live-cd will not make any changes to your hard drive, and it will run a little slow because it is running from the cd and not the hard drive. Once it is installed it will run like all your other programs. If everything works with the live-cd everything will work when installed. If for example your wireless won't work with the live-cd if you install it it will need to have some work done (look for and install new drivers, edit configuration files, etc). It CAN usually be fixed but it will take a little work and for a person new to linux it can be very frustrating.  When you find one that works and you like I would also suggest that you read the instructions and tutorials from the website of that distro on how to install, setup and use linux. This will make using linux a much more pleasant experience.  If you just go ahead and install linux and try to use it the same way you used windows you are almost guaranteed to be frustrated and unhappy. Linux may sorta kinda look like windows but it is not windows and you have to do things a little differently in linux. I am not saying it is hard to use linux just different.   The display and look when booting from the live-cd is plain vanilla. You can customize the look and feel of your desktop any way you like. I have not seen a moving background in linux yet, but it MIGHT be possible.  You should go to :  http://distrowatch.com/search.php  and use the search engine to filter which distro would be best for you. You can select a version for beginners, or multimedia, or a special purpose. They are all free to download. You can read reviews and articles about each distro. You can select a distro for ease of use, needs little ram  or hard drive space, popularity, most software packages available, amount of  customization,etc.  Have fun|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Hi there,              I have used all the linux distros out there and I am a very regular contributor to linux as a whole.

Best of all, it supported all my hardware right off the bat, WiFi card included.    It's a really solid OS, and since you can download it free and try running it as a Live CD without losing your old OS, it's worth looking into.  it'll be slow since it's running of the optical drive, but you'll get an idea for how things work.    As a heads up, sometimes when you try to run it as a Live CD, it will try to install itself anyways.

So more research on the response of the tablet PC is in order, let me look around..    Ok, so briefly searching around, maybe the Cintiq by Wacom would be your best option. It's more of a system add-on, but I think for what you need its probably the best pound-for-pound.

OR ( and I think it is this )    - Your battery pack is broken. The pins are bent and when you use it, it isn't retrieving the electricity from the battery pack correctly. This causes the lifespan to vary, I've had this problem before.  ----Try taking the battery out, plugging in the charger, and then using your Laptop to test my theory.---- Its worth it especially since its the cheaper option.

Have a look underneath the laptop and make sure the vent is clean and not full of dust. That is most likely the intake fan.  Secondly, check the output fan, usually found on the side of the laptop.    When you use the laptop, make sure none of the fans are blocked... you may place it on your lap or on the couch at home, but sometimes the intake fan underneath lacks air circulation when you do this... poor design.    The fan may be in poor condition too.|`|K5XpqLdVaa	1.

You can do it with a digital camera and several shots of the object from different angles.|`|3werhIURaa	A Video Camera?|`|y4qref2taa	the cheapest way to do so is by using a camera to snap on side, top and front view of the object.

However as with everything in life you only get what you pay for.  Both free programs are fairly basic.     Have previously used AVG, Trend, Norton & now use Kaspersky Internet Security Suite after having to rebuild my Desktop PC after a trojan got through the free AVG programme.  I use KIS on my Laptop as this is the one I do most of my surfing with etc., but as a back up I have Avast on my Desktop (which I rarely use for i/net purposes).   Good luck.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	I would consider it to be the best of all the "freebies". Far better than AVG.

9fe2ad1e4012b0da774059d5d7c39405aa	i have been getting the same crashes and not responding lately on my pc and my laptop with both firefox and INTERNET explorer.  only started the past 2 weeks. i think there is a bug in one of Microsoft's updates. i have reset my pc, i have also had norton 2009, kaspersky 2009,bitdefender and one care (separately of course lol) all in my pc and the browsers are still doing this. i have tried everything.  the only thing left i can think of is my isp (virgin broadband 20mb speed). the isp company are monitoring what sites we are visiting and we have to go through a filter between our routers and the internet so we can be watched and sometimes this causes delays in internet connection and crashing etc.  if you find out let me know  and yes i have defraged, clean browser etc etc as i know what i am doing|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	If you have two computers hooked to the same broadband, one is ok and the other chokes you know the connection modem and router are ok.   Dump the Torrents stuff. I gather that can be a mess. You have no idea what these guys are giving you. A 2mb broadband connection is slow and anything you do to try to speed it up is going to hurt you much more than help.  With all this disk drive formating you probably do not have the latest updates for WinXP nor for the IE or Firefox browsers.   It also sounds like you are trying to get way too smart about security with the DMZ stuff. Go back to basics.
DEk5E4pfaa	Sounds to me like you have viruses. You need to do a deep virus scan with something like bit defender total security 2009. That's the best in my opinion. The same software will also help with another issue that may be affecting your computer this way. Registry errors need sorting out. All in all if you those two things you should be fine.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	Download and install this    http://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en-U...

Have you tried resetting your router?|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	If you are using the same modem and router for two computers and one works and the other chokes I have to assume the connection is ok.  Whats this Torrents thing you mention? A 2mb connection is slow and anything you try to do will cause more trouble than help. What's this thing about outside the DMZ. Are you trying to mess with the security?  All this formatting means you are probably way behind on winXP and browser updates.  I think you are doing things that might be hurting you.
AA11787432	VMware is an emulation layer and will run windows as a host OS on top of mac osx while bootcamp has a totally different approach and dual boot windows by letting you install it on a different partition and then running windows natively.    so performance wise, boot camp will be better.|`|AA10570173	As the first person said, VMWare is an emulator, a virtual machine. Because you are running Windows in the virtual machine on top of the Mac OS, it's as if your machine has to go through more layers to get to resources when running Windows.     Bootcamp allows you to create a partition on your hard drive, then install Windows onto the partition, so you then can boot into Windows or Mac. When you have booted into Windows, you are running natively directly off the hard drive, without the extra layer of the virtual machine. So you will therefore always be faster running off the hard drive directly rather than through the virtual machine.
58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	This should be a no-brainer. Just plug one end of your optic cable to your surround system and the other end to the computer. The computer female plug should be on the back, near the other sound outputs.
AA10769666	Mac fans like me are willing to pay more for their hardware and software because we like Apple. If you are not biased against either one and you are looking for a good computer, I think Windows or Linux running on a PC are your best option. If you are looking for a good computer for photo and video management and making DVDs and movies, etc., Mac OS X is definitely your best option!|`|DvvnXLS1aa	Mac is a Mac,and not compare Mac and PCs! Definitely not overpriced!|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	If you match a Mac with a Windows PC, spec for spec, the Windows PC will usually be anywhere between $100 and $300 cheaper.    So if you consider that overpriced, then, yes, they are overpriced.    A lot of Apple fans, however, argue that the premium is worth it, that iLife or the "Apple experience" or the sturdier build of the outer chassis (not the internal hardware, as that's the same as Windows PCs have) makes up for the price difference.    "Overpriced" is subjective. You pay for what you want. If you want a Mac, you pay more, and presumably it's worth it to you.|`|c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	The so-called "Apple tax" (the premium you pay to own a Mac) is very real and I think it is a business strategy - in general they are looking to fill a certain sector of the market and they are happy to sell to certain customers who generally are "happy" or just willing to pay this premium. Well, that's my take on it. To use an analogy, Apple really see themselves as BMW, not Toyota.  http://gizmodo.com/5065133/the-truth-abo...|`|qzPbcHpmaa	yes they are overpriced. But if you ask a Mac user (fanatic) they will tell you that the PC is garbage and that is why they are so cheap.

RZQnxoF1aa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:    http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]     http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.

Because a permalink remains unchanged indefinitely, it is less susceptible to link rot. Most modern weblogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Other types of websites use permanent links, but the term permalink is most common within the blogosphere. Permalink is a portmanteau word made from permanent link. Permalinks are often simply stated so as to be human-readable.|`|RuHaUAwXaa	What is a permalink?  A permalink, or permanent link, is a URL that points to a specific blog or forum entry after it has passed from the front page to the archives.     What is the purpose of a permalink?   Permanence in links is desirable when content items are likely to be linked to, from, or cited by a source outside the originating organization. Before the advent of large-scale dynamic websites built on database-backed content management systems, it was more common for URLs of specific pieces of content to be static and human readable, as URL structure and naming were dictated by the entity creating that content. Increased volume of content and difficulty of management led to the rise of database-driven systems, and the resulting unwieldy and often-changing URLs necessitated deliberate policies with regard to URL design and link permanence. For example, Wikipedia's internal cgi-based URLs, e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?titl... are re-written to a more human-readable form, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink (see Rewrite engine).

Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think..    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

Linux and Vista were not hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered. Vista was next, and then Linux.  Macs are standardized with Cameras, if your Mac gets hacked, the hacker can turn on your camera with more ease.

VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (and significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  |`|ElvQTpUVaa	Mac and PC are not models - they are the one of the simplest ways to categorize platforms of computer.

AA11622701	No.  All a defrag does is to rearrange in the files on your hard drive so that is a file has been split into more than one section, they are all moved back together.  And then it arranges them in a way that allows your computer faster access to them.  It does not delete or remove anything, and it will not free any space on the hard drive.    How long a defrag takes takes depends on the size of the hard drive (a 500 gb drive will take 10 times longer that a 50 gb drive), and how badly fragmented the files are (the longer since you last did, the longer it will take).  With today's "giant" hard drives, if the drive has never been defraged before, it could take several hours to complete.  It is recommended that you start the defrag and let it run overnight, or all day while you are away at school/work.  You will also want to turn off any programs, and disconnect from the Internet, because if either of those changes the content of the hard drive, it can make the defrag restart and never complete.    It is something you should do every couple months, as it will help to protect your files agains data loss (the more fragmented they become, there sections there are to lose), and will increase the speed of your computer by moving the most often accessed files to the front of the drive, where they can be found faster.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Defragging doesnt delete anything. It only speeds up the system. You will not lose any files or softwares nor will their location change.  Just ensure there is no power cut during the defrag. Make sure you have a power backup.    If you are still worried, you can backup important files befor defragging.    I would also recommend Diskeeper as a safe and reliable defragger that can be set to run automatically in the background even as you use the PC.  http://diskeeper.com/|`|l5kWF8m3aa	no, but it's always a good idea to backup your data on a regular basis.|`|3WbNrDZ0aa	No it will do nothing like that|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	nope.. it will just arrange some files on your computer..    for safety measure always back up your important files ^^|`|aUmqiSOlaa	only if you do it in safe mode|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	NO, you will NOT lose any Data...

I would set it to run at night while you are asleep...|`|7pAXElgSaa	no you wont lose anything. if this is the first time you have defraged it may take a while, but it will be worth it! from now on try to defrag at least 1 a month, especialy if you "save" lots of stuff|`|WWxGAzYgaa	When you defrag a hard drive all you're doing is taking all the data that is scattered around the disks and put them all in a row in one place. kind of like tidying up your kitchen.    nothing gets lost. in fact it makes it easier and faster for your computer to find stuff. you should not try to use your computer while it is defragging. the best way to do a defrag is in safe mode. reboot your computer and hold the F8 key before windows starts to load.    then scroll up to select to boot into safe mode. then after you are in go ahead and start the defrag.    it takes sometimes 2 to 8 hours for a defrag depending on the size of your hard drive. so it is best to start the defrag just before you go to bed and let it defrag while you are sleeping.    And TURN OFF your screen saver!|`|IHxBui0Naa	actually u dont loose any data friend. defragment means" if u suppose think ur hard disk as a cd when cd got filled with data completely ie; 100 % now take ur hard disk it is olso completed filled by data so now after few days u may remove some unwanted or disliked softwares which u installed previously so there will be a location of installed file so if u unistall that the portion of free space be left in that middle portion so when u defragment the whole data get moved to previous free spaces where ur software get uninstalled .. now u gained more space in doing so so our pc needs higher space to run fast .. more the free space more runs faster so keep on defragmenting.. but more u defragmentthere is a chance of loosing data keep ur computer safe do three four times a month thanks for the oppurtunity bye|`|PG7WfGpHaa	No. You shouldn't lose anything  It is difficult to make a guess how long it will take without knowing how big your hard drive is, how fragmented it is, what speed of computer you have etc.|`|dILqe7nBaa	no  http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...|`|ElvQTpUVaa	You would not lose your software or saved data - that's not what defragging is about.

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	To speed the computer up? It really depends what you're using the computer for.  For gaming, a faster processor won't affect speed much but a better graphics card will increase performance dramatically. For decoding and editing video or compiling code, a faster processor would make a big difference.    What graphics card does the system have now- you didn't say?    I recommend downloading the free SIW program- it can identify the exact motherboard in your system, which will let you know which processor upgrades are possible.  But an X2 5000+ has plenty of horsepower for gaming, the video card is much more important.    Also, for brand-name machines like Gateway, Dell, HP etc upgrading the motherboard will require installing a new copy of XP, because the mobo upgrade involves performing a repair install and reactivating Windows- something the system restore CD cannot do.   Vista removed the repair install option, so you'd probably have to reinstall fresh.    The pre-installed OS is tied to the original motherboard.
0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Move from a 32bit OS. to a 64bit OS...|`|AA11622701	If I understand your question, you have a system board with a limit on the memory (for example, 1 gb) and you want to find a way to increase it to 2 gb.  There is no way to do that without replacing the entire system board.  The limitation is in the number of connections, wires, circuits, etc that run between the memory slot and the rest of the board.    But there is a possible work around.  If you are running Windows Vista, and the PC as an available USB2.0 slot, you can plug in a flash/jump/thumb drive and use it as a memory cache to increase the memory in your computer.  When you plug in the drive, you should get a menu with "Speed up my system" as an option.,  Select that, and it will "add" the flash drive's memory to the memory already in the computer as am additional cache.  While it is not as fast as actual RAM memory, it is considerable faster then the swap file/virtual memory on the hard drive, and can make a huge performance boost for a PC with a RAM limitation (and is a lot cheaper than a new system board.)|`|a277813eb96093f31d8ebeaf06461dccaa	the limit is by the 32-bit ability of the os. Some OS will allow you to use a DEP switch to address more than the 4 GB limit. Google the DEP and see what you find.|`|oOcQSylMaa	u will need toupgrade to a better OS but in most cases the computer/laptop's motherboard can only hold a certain amount of RAM. if u exceed this limit it may not work correctly. best thing to do for a computer is buy a new motherboard to increase the RAM evan more. try pcworld or curry's or comet
d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	I'm not sure about prices in the UK, I think they're a bit high?    Here in the USA, the Radeon 4670 is a better buy- the 9500GT is priced too close to the 9600GT (often less than $20 after rebate), considering it's half the speed.    If the 9600GT and 9600GSO are too costly, take the Asus 9500GT (512mb, DDR3) over the Sparkle 1GB.  Aside from Asus being a higher quality brand, the faster memory really helps performance while the Sparkle's extra memory is only useful at high resolutions the 9500GT can't handle anyway.    http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best...    Here's the Asus card from a UK merchant:    http://www.ebuyer.com/product/149265    Comparison prices below:|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	I am presuming your mobo won't take an ATi card...pity.    Try rolling back to the 88xx cards. See if you can find an 8800 GTS for about that. Why? Simple. nVidia pulled a fast one...they took "older generation" cards (7x and 8x) cards, overclocked them, added some extra GDDR, doubled the price, and called them the 9xxx generation cards.    The 8xxx cards, ironically, are more stable, less prone to bugs and crashes. The drivers are also more "developed" for them. The process of rebranding the cards means that the 9x cards can't properly use the drivers for their predecessors.    Good Luck!|`|XmnVJxzaaa	www.tomshardware.com rates the ATI Radeon HD 4650 the best graphics card under $65 USD*. They do state they bias their ratings toward gaming performance. Models of this card can be found online for around $60.00 inc VAT**.   That said, the 9500 GT does get great reviews. I have never used a Sparkle product, so I can't comment on that part. However, other 9500 GT cards I've used have work well for clients.   Good luck.

(Meaning a Core2 Duo system running at 3Ghz (same as the AMD 6000) will be MUCH faster than the AMD processor is.    In the same manner, don't compare it to an Intel "Atom" processor either, as the Atom does a lot LESS per clock cycle than the AMD Athon does.

AA11134471	using Hex (octal is rarely used), or decimal in code really depends on what you are doing in code. If you are just counting or doing mathematical equations then decimal is usually used. But if doing bit manipulation, such as setting or clearing certain bits in a byte then Hex is the preferred method. Hex easily converts to binary, whereas decimal does not. I know that if I have a byte equal to 18 Hex and I want to set the 8th bit all I have to do is OR it with 0x80. If I do the same thing in decimal then I have to figure what 18 Hex is in decimal (happens to be 24), then figure out what 80 Hex is (128) then add them together to get the same result.    So Hex is perfect for the bit manipulation instructions like AND, OR, NOT, XOR etc...|`|sCAvtfpXaa	It is just another way to look at the same number in a shorter form.  It is also more helpful looking at things in Hexadecimal, if you are looking at bit-fields, because it's easier to tell which bits are turned on/off.  For example:  Can you quickly tell which bits are turned on in the number 157?  It's Hexadecimal equivalent is: 9D.  9 = 1001  D = 1101  So any variables assigned this value would have the bit-fields of: 10011101    With decimal, you'd have to start from the highest position closest to the value:   157  -128??1 (for bit field 128)  ------   ??29  - ?16??1 (for bit field 16)  ------   ??13  - ??8??1 (for bit field 8)  ------   ???5  - ??4??1 (for bit field 4)  ------   ??1??1 (for bit field 1)|`|XmFT7fHnaa	there are eigh bits to a byte. basically the computer thinks in base eight so if your doing programming trust me its easier to learn the ancient way using binary etc it will make it a lot easier to grasp programing concepts later on (even if you may seldom use it)|`|AA11064029	It is simply a matter of readability.  Usually the value required is binary and therefore it is better to have this value as an octal or hex value.  Of course there is nothing wrong with using the decimal value but you are then disguising the fact that it is the binary value you are really using.|`|AA11779483	depending on exactly what it is you're trying to accomplish, sometimes it is just easier to use different ways of expressing the values.

K2h6M1xqaa	Hm.  What a strange problem!  If it is affecting two different browsers and only on that one website, then that suggests something quite beyond the normal.    I just looked at the website and found the images loaded no problem.    Thoughts which enter my mind:    1. Do a cold reboot.    2. Do you have the latest version of IE and Firefox?  If not, you might try to un-install and then re-install the latest Firefox.  Available here. . .    http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/    3. Have you done a virus check recently?  One of the recent big viruses, (I can't remember it's name), alters browsers to prevent them from accessing anti-virus websites.  I don't know why this would affect the one you're looking at, but maybe a virus scan would help.    4. The images might be hosted on an server which is specifically blocked by ad-blocker software you might have switched on in your browsers.  If you turn those off, it might help.    5. Do you have any other programs running which might be causing the problem?  Press, "Ctrl", "Alt", "Del" at the same time, and then take a look through the Tasks which are running.  Shut down everything but your browser.    Those are a few ideas. Hopefully one of them will do the trick!
