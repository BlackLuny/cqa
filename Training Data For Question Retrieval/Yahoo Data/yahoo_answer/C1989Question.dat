20090306160457AA0SBaG	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	What's wrong with my iPod? Can you PLEASE help????	He's an ipod touch. This morning I was listening to him and he shut off. I thought he was probably dead, but I thought it was weird that it never said that the battery was dying, and as far as I knew, he had a pretty good charge. Anyways, I just thought he  was dead. I just plugged him into the computer to see if that would "revive" him, and no screen showed up.   I'm really worried because I love him and I just got him like a month ago.   I'm not that rough with him. There shouldn't be a problem.   Please please please help me, this is really important.    And i'm referring to him as a he, because that's what I do.   And I named him Napoleon, just incase you wanted to know.   PLEASE HELP.

20090306173207AAVBO41	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 controller won't stop vibrating!?	I bought an energizer 360 charger and was ready to use it when, of course they make you buy your own rechargeable batteries. So I run to Wal-Mart and buy rechargeable Energizer batteries. I put them in and put the controller on the dock, and it seemed to be working, but after a few minutes the light went green and the controller started vibrating. I figured okay i guess that means it's done, but I was skeptical about the vibrating. I took it off, and it didn't stop. I switched batteries, it didn't stop. I played on it, turned off vibrate on the xbox and game, and it hasn't stopped. What is going on? Is it safe to put my other controller on the dock? If there is no other way, I guess i'll just have to open it up and take out the vibrating motors, but what kind of screwdriver would I need to open it? By the way, I was thinking about putting a rapid-fire button on it, so if I do have to take the motors out, I will use this opportunity to put one on it. And yes I am asking this question for the second time so that i can get more answers.

20090505064838AAXSDr2	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Hoping to switch to the Blackberry Curve 8330 with Verizon, can someone please explain the data plan?	Maybe it's me, but I feel like Verizon is so confusing in the layout of their plans. I don't know if it's to get suckers for random, unnecessary fees or what, but I could use some input from any Blackberry owner. Or anyone familiar with Verizon for that matter.      My issue is I currently have the EnV with the "select plan" from Verizon where it's $59.99 a month, unlimited texts/pics/videos, 450 minutes, and web browsing is $1.99 per MB.      I'm due for the discounted upgrade and really want the Blackberry Curve 8330. The plan I was looking at is the "BlackBerry Nationwide Email & Messaging" which says this briefly...   A bundled package with voice allowance, unlimited messaging, and wireless data usage for quick and easy remote access to email over your BlackBerry handheld. Monthly access starting at $99.99.      In further detail, the plan stated...   * Unlimited Text, Picture, Video & Instant Messaging   * Data usage from within the National Enhanced Services and the Extended National Enhanced Services Rate and Coverage Areas   * Data Access for Email   * Unlimited Calling to all Verizon Wireless Customers   * Unlimited Night & Weekend Minutes   * No Domestic Long Distance Charges         Does this mean that data plan is included now in the general plan? Or do I actually have to pay an additional $30 a month for the data plan in order for this Blackberry to work? Also, I want to be able to browse the internet freely... like the actual internet, not the limited kind some phones offer. Would I be able to do so with the above mentioned $99.99 plan?            THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE HELP!! =)

The next morning i came driving back to see if it was there....it was about 8:00am and i left the night before around midnight.   As i was driving up there was a guy standing outside his house, i only saw his backside, he was holding a razor scooter in one hand and looking at something in the other.   i couldn't park on that side of the street so i had to go around the block, he wasn't moving the whole time i saw him, but when i went around the block which didn't take long, he was gone, and i couldn't even see him in a distance.   I don't know what to do, i can't afford another one right now and i have that 2 year replacement plan, but i can only get it replaced if i have a police report right?    would i even be able to report that though, im sure he took it, but there's no "hard evidence" of it i guess.

20090306232336AALmlRe	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Can I use a 220V-50Hz electronic device in a 110V American outlet?  The power will be weaker.  Does it matter?	I have a small electronic device from China.  It has an AC adapter with the same 2-prong plug that is standard in the USA.  The AC adapter is used to recharge the electronic device.  If I use this AC adapter in the USA, will it still work?  I'm assuming it will just take longer to charge since the power will be weaker.  Here is what it says on the AC adapter:      INPUT:  AC220V-50Hz   OUTPUT:  DC3V  350mA

20090306232908AAKoSvo	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS3 Monitor Support Question?	Hi guys, I just have a really quick question I'm hoping one of you can answer. I have my PS3 hooked up to my HDCP compliant Acer 22" P221w LCD monitor. I have an HDMI cable running from the PS3 to a HDMI to DVI adapter, which then is plugged into my monitor. I can get a signal fine at 420p without any problems. However, the monitor does not support 720p or 1080p resolutions at all.             My main concern: when I tell it to output using 1080i, the monitor displays the image properly in perfect detail, except there's a little floating message that comes up and dances all over the screen in the foreground that the input is not supported. The image is displaying fine, except that little popup window saying it isn't supported (which is clearly wrong) won't go away.             Has anyone else run into this problem, and/or know of a way to fix it? Thanks for all the help.       Cheers.

I wanted an Ipod (since mine broke along time ago) But I have a few concerns. #1: I'm fearful wither or not the Zune has better to sharper quality (using the WMV codec or the h264 codec by handbrake) #2: I'm mostly afraid becuase my favorite program manually cuts the framerate in dvd to ipod wich peaves me to no end.

I just want to know once and for all what company and device I should trust BECUASE I own a windows. That and windows easily creates wmv anyway.

I also do not own a 360 and don't plan on it. Given those factors Finding out dead rising was coming to the Wii made me extremely excited.  The only problem is the only reviews I have found are written by 360 fanboys.  Most people compare it to the 360 version too much and give the game bad scores because of that.  Other people say it is a great game and that even having played the 360 version they like it.  I don't know who to believe.  Please just review the game not as a port just as a game.  I don't care about the graphics.  By the way is the battleaxe in the wii version (I got bored so I watched part of a 360 version walkthrough)?

20090307143205AAsjGDq	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Is this worth the money?	i was just looking online and i saw an advert for a nokia n95.      this is what the ad says:      "The only thing wrong with the phone is one of the clips to hold the back cover in place has snapped off so i just use a small piece of sticky tape to keep it secure apart from this the fone is in 100% working order.      Im not sure if its unlocked but i was using 02 and usually they are all unlocked to suit any network.      im sorry but i dont have the origional box, but i do have the charger.      thanks for looking, and questions give me a shout. "      my questions are:      1: is it worth the money because of what is wrong with it?      2: can you buy origional covers for it anywhere online?      3: would i be pushing my luck offering him ￡50 seeing as its not boxed and only comes with a charger?      would you buy it?

20090307143620AAO23uP	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Why can't I receive a digital television signal?	We recently purchased a new Emerson television that has an internal digital tuner. However, when we set up the television along with an antenna capable of receiving a digital signal, the television is unable to find any DTV broadcasts. I have verified that everything is set up correctly. My zip code is 06770 and I am located on the third floor of a three-story building. All the buildings on my street are comparable in height and there are no large buildings (more than 4 storys) in my area. I have tested the antenna on another television in a different location to verify that it works. Many stations in my area are broadcasting in digital, and the closest (and strongest) is about 15 miles away.
20090307143652AAkhLb0	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS3 DualShock 3 possible fix?	my ps3 dualshock 3 got wet i dried it off waited a few days to find out my controller has been ****** up like i have to connecting to the USB cable and hold down the ps button otherwise it would shut off also it keeps pressing random buttons every time i can't even use it on the PS3 browser because apparently its automatically pressing buttons. now something similar happend to my tv remote it was screwing up then i figured that the battery was the culprit. now i also have a sixaxis controller minus the r1 r2 and l1 l2 buttons im just wondering if i open up both controllers and switch batteries could it possibly fix it and could i possibly find drips of water in the controller?
