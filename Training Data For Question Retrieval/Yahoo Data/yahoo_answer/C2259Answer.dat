g8xoINw0aa	your deck is good, there is a couple of things that your deck is backfiring.    for example, your messenger of peace, if u have it already have it out, and you attack with your horus lv 6 and u want to bring out horus lv 8.  HE  CANNOT  ATTACK!   horus lv 8 doesnt negate it, so if u have messenger you dont need lv 8 , since they cant attack you, or get rid of horus, or u could keep horus lv eight, but then u dont need the messenger, it is better to pick one or the other, since if u have them on the field together, its kinda a waste.      the other thing your deck is lacking, is what are u using to draw cards?      since your already have swords of light, and u must like burn cards like cylinder and wave motion, u might consider just side decking your burn cards and focus more on cards that let u draw, such as dekochi, reckless greed, pot of avarice, but as everyone else will certainly agree draw power is one key needed to win in yugioh|`|xB0vOgSwaa	you have absolutely no theme....try picking one and then ask again|`|v0l05yBMaa	WOW its not a good deck but    here is a site that can help you with good decks    http://www.youtube.com/underyubel    http://www.youtube.com/JTtheUnderdog      underyubel has a good deck that is easy and good to us but JT has decks that can easy be done!|`|HbP4MGe0aa	make a list of your strongest monsters then i will help you  IM me at pokemii and i'll help

VzJQUCPIaa	Nothing on the market that I'm aware of - I had a D100 for a while, but the BBs that they (for whatever weird reason) put insider it finally drove me nuts and I got rid of it (plus that sucker would roll for-freaking-ever). A friend of mine once made a D101 as a joke.|`|kNGMVXBLaa	i don't know what is D100, but the galaxie is bigger than that.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	Not that I know of.  I could see someone trying to make a d200 just out of novelty and as a challenge, but I never found my Zocchihedron as practical as just using two d10's.|`|c59045ebb7c3c4f87df5f8e216916775aa	I go to a lot of game conventions and game stores. The d100 is the biggest I've seen in terms of number of "sides" to the die.    Some companies have made VERY large d8's, d20's, etc. Some are made of foam! So I guess the answer depends on how you define "bigger"...|`|xRCynGQqaa	I've never seen (or heard) of anything larger than a D100.    And the D100's themselves are pretty unwieldy.

Q5qoPBv1aa	Many fabric/craft stores sell a basic sewing kit. However if you want to make your own or expand on a pre-made one here are basic sewing essentials:<br>  <br>  Good pair of fabric scissors: Without a good pair your fabric will be hard to cut and end up with jagged lines which will throw your seams off.<br>  Dressmakers chalk in various colors: This is essential to mark off locations of straps, button holes, darts, alterations, etc. Make sure you have white and blue to show up on both light and dark fabrics.<br>  Fabric measuring tape: This will help you get your sizing correct for clothing patterns, ensure your cutting on the grain, and generally prove useful for checking the accuracy of your sewing.<br>  Before beginning a pattern you should read the back of the envelope to see what notions you need. Common notions include snaps, buttons, zips, hooks and eyes, and ribbon.<br>  <br>  With these basic items you should be able to complete simple sewing projects. As you become more proficient in the craft and move on to more complex items you will require more advanced tools. You will also build up extra notions (ribbon, thread, hem tape, closures, etc) and your fabric store so it may be useful to purchase some containers now. I suggest buying these items at a JoAnn Fabrics store. You can sign up online to receive coupons (which frequently give 40% off) to lower your costs. Also keep a lookout in their circulars for sales of fabric, notions, and patterns as they frequently offer fabric at great discount and patterns at $1-$2. For additional free and inexpensive patterns and a community of sewers check out burdastyle.com. You can also check your local craiglist to see if anyone in your area is offering free or cheap supplies.<br>  Best of luck sewing!|`|6N3yjlXhaa	You have most of what you will need.<br>  <br>  Here is a site that list the supplies generally needed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page=section/classroom/sewingLessons/sewing101part1.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page...</a><br>  <br>  The site also has free patterns, projects, tips and techniques.<br>  <br>  If you have a Walmart store that still sells fabric and sewing supplies, the prices there will be less than fabric stores.<br>  <br>  I do not know of any place that donates or shares sewing notions. <br>  <br>  Notions aren't usually purchased as needed and not normally shared.|`|BwEN0hWAaa	you should invest in a good pair of fabric scissors!!
9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	I dont think so, you are basically shooting aliens so in that respect it is just a realistic version of space invaders.<br>  I think Halo 3 is a fantastic game, the best fps around and I think if younger people are going to play a shooter this should be it. <br>  It is less violent, realistic or bleak than COD 4 or COD 5 and it simply isn't in the same league as say Grand Theft Auto in terms of language, sex references or violence also unlike in GTA you are a hero not a villain and are never asked to do anything morally wrong. I could get into the ins and outs of why I think the game is great but if I did that I'd soon have a bunch of fanboys trying to argue with me.<br>  <br>  Putting aside the rating system if you are considering buying a shooting game for a kid then Halo is the best you could get them. If you are willing to let them play a game involving shooting people then you should be willing to let them play halo.<br>  <br>  You can go on to Youtube if you fancy sifting through thousands of Halo videos or I'd use gametrailers.com if you just want to see the official videos.|`|AA12366013	THE GAME PLAY SHOULDN'T BE RATED M BUT IT IS BECAUSE OF THE ONLINE GAME PLAY TONS OF PEOPLE CUSS AND TALK CRAP TO YOU AND MICROSOFT DOES NOT WANNA GET SUED BECAUSE OF THE ONLINE!|`|m3lQluaHaa	It's already rated 16+, so maybe yeah.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	I do. Too many lil brats get on Halo and have there Piercing, high pitched voice messes up the expirience. As for Blood and Gore, no. Halo has little blood in it and the only gore u see in the game is little blood splatters on a wall. There are a couple swear words used in the Campaign but it isn't nothing we don't hear on a daily basis. I don't think that Halo should be rated M though.

vLB3tdG5aa	Problem gambling, like any other addiction, is a kind of compulsion. The guy just can't let go. He's on a roll, he's winning, losing, keeping it going -- it becomes disruptive and almost pathological.    You're right about the 'state of denial' that gamblers live in, and sadly, they snap out of it only they've lost their money, house, car and spouse.    Fact is, these guys need support too. They too are human, with their own weaknesses. And the best way to deal with gambling addiction (be it a friend or family member) is to put some sense into him. Show him the mirror; tell him what he's doing to himself and to you.    Explain it assertively and courageously. Get Gambler's Anonymous if you have to. One way or another, just tell him to stop.|`|URO3gDXcaa	snap out of it?  no.  it is a form of mental illness.  you do not just 'snap out of it'.|`|AA10726404	For some people it's not always that easy.  The crave the rush they get from gambling.  Many convince themselves they have a winning formula and that they can win back any losses.    The mindset may not be easy for some people to 'snap out of.'  It's like telling a clinically depressed person to just cheer up.
HPuiI7BCaa	Develop a very good understanding of the mathematics of the game. If you truly understand the math, you'll realize not only that bad beats are normal, they are proof of your superior play. This will help some.    However, when this is not sufficient, learn how you react to the bad beats. [Understand yourself.] When you are in a situation when the bad beat is beyond your ability to deal with rationally, take a break. I usually go for a walk. Get up and get a drink. Just don't play for a little bit until you have yourself under control.     In the end it's a matter of self discipline. "Zen and the Art of Poker," by Larry Phillips helped me. Good luck!|`|AA11001595	There are two ways to get over it.    The first way is to have it happen to you over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, which every experienced poker player can relate to. As the years go by, you get used to it.    The second way is to understand that those same players are where your money comes from. If people didn't call your bets when they were behind, you would never make money. Therefore, in order for you to make money, they have to call you sometimes. Therefore, you have to lose sometimes to those players.    But as long as you realize that it's a part of the game and that you get paid for making good decisions, then you will win in the long run.    It is explained better on http://chainpoker.com in the money management section|`|VzJQUCPIaa	I look at it as an investment. If some guy sucks out a 10% chance on me, I figure he's gonna try and do the same thing the next time a similar situation comes up. I'll happily give him my chips one time if it means I can take his 9 times in return.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	Would you rather be on the house's side or the player's side of a bet?  The casino/house side has an advantage to their bet.      Whose hand would you choose in your bad beat poker hand?  I would bet on your poker hand every time because you do not know when you are going to be bad beat.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	you are a sucker for a bluff...you watch too much poker on tv....you actually think phil helmuth ever gets made ....he puts on a show and you say to yourself what a f-u-cking idiot but  your mind goes ultimatebet.com hockey jersey  ultimatebet.com hockey jersey....|`|AA10726404	You just have to try and focus on the times you give others a bad beat.  Imagine in your head that for each bad beat you give, the universe 'owes' you a bad beat.  Sure, it doesn't really work like that, but over time you will get your fair share just like everyone else.    Just yesterday I was playing a S&G and I had a big blind special.  Flopped an open ended straight, turned a straight, but my opponent turned an ace high flush.  The river brought me the only card in the deck that could save me, and turned my straight into a straight flush.  Convinced that his nut flush was best I was able to induce an all in bet from him, and knocked him off the table, becoming chip leader.    It was a pretty cold deck for him.    So next time I get a bad beat, I'll think of this moment, and realize that sometimes we get lucky, and sometimes we get unlucky.  But good play will always yield profits over time.

I have a big mob and you will get 5 respect points every 60 minutes when you join my mob 135-486-945.

It is the way the creators of the game can earn money. You can not earn respect points but you will have to buy these. You can do this by clicking the app store icon on your Iphone / Ipod Touch and then search for IMOB. It will present you the respect point options you can buy. When you have bought these, you can use the THE DON icon at the bottom of the screen (in IMOB) to buy health, instant energy or 1 henchman (mob). Hope this helps.

Dv86FTJuaa	you probably can i guess. Probably depends on wether you had a Ds or a Ds Lite.

k3cmetWRaa	Well the best PC RPG I think is Final Fantasy 7, it's not free but it only costs about $10.00 from amazon.

Also Phantasy Rpg is an excellent RPG to do but it is text based.
BDEVP4qpaa	Well the reason it says to have a larger memory device is because of the down-loadable maps required to play Halo 3 online.  I would try to get the Pro because they come with a 60gb hd now but you can just get the arcade and buy another hd when you can. The way I look at it though, if you're going to get Halo 3 and not be able to play it online, then it wont be worth your money. <br>  <br>  Halo's the best fps the 360 has to offer and its pretty cool too. <br>  Gears of War 2 is played from a 3rd person perpective. Good game though.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	number one: Get the pro/elite.

UVUYG5jaaa	most people play 6/6 (double six) the rules are basically the same , just 6/6 is easier to play and more people play it. anyway, 9/9 always goes first. if nobody has it? it goes to 8/8 etc etc etc. lets say a 7/7 was played (14 points). i can play 7/1 and get 15 points. the 7/1 is played lke the letter " T " the next player can play 7/0 and get the same 15 points, shaped like the letter " X " the next player needs a 0-1-7 to play, if not, he picks up the extras until he can play. the winner of the round can play whatever he wants. all points are 5-10-15etc . you get nothing for 14 points

5x9ArRQLaa	You need to log out, then log back in.  Or close your game and restart.  You can get the M95 sniper for shooting through glass.  Or get the G3, for a better rifle.  I suggest the Anti Tank weapon, DAO-12.  It's good for close range.  You can use the rocket for long range.  AND you can take out tanks.  There's 12 shots, fully automatized.|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Here's a link you may want to see...but be advised that the site is rated as a "High Risk" site, so make sure you have a good AVS running...just as a precaution. :D    In any case, depending on how BF2 does it's unlocks (I haven't played in a while), I'd go for the sniper rifle - take out those annoying prop jockies with one or two shots!

S3pgtJGpaa	I'm not very sure how it can be done, but this is the best advice I can give you.   http://www.spellsofmagic.com has lots of free spells you can use. It might have a spell there for that.   If you can't find the exact spell you need, you can use a wishing spell to wish for it to come true.   Also, there are sites that are said to make wishes come true like these:   http://www.gogeni.com/  http://www.ammonia-sentry.com/index.htm  http://theoldwishingwell.com/Well.html  http://www.real-wishes.com/  Although the sites that make wishes come true might not work, it's still worth a try, because it's free.

8hbm4uiPaa	Removing Balthor the Defiled from the game is part of the activation cost, so the ability will be on the stack before your opponent gains priority or has an opportunity to respond to the activation. Once the ability is on the stack, it will resolve.    It also works in reverse. When an opponent attempts to destroy or remove Balthor the Defiled from the game, if you have the means to pay the activation cost of the ability, then you may activate the ability in response. The activation will occure first, so destroying or removing Balthor the Defiled from the game will have no effect.    This should not be confused with an ability like that of Fleshbag Marauder, which says, 'When Fleshbag Marauder comes into play, each player sacrifices a creature.' In the case of Fleshbag Marauder, its ability is the result and not part of the activation.    Usually a player will play a card like Fleshbag Marauder with the intent of sacrificing their weakest creature or Fleshbag Marauder itself. However, since its ability is not part of the activation cost, the spell must resolve before the triggered ability will take effect.    Meaning. If an opponent were to destroy Fleshbag Marauder's intended target as it were coming into play (including Fleshbag Marauder itself), the player who just cast Fleshbag Marauder will have no choice but to choose another sacrifice target for the ability.    That may be more information than you were looking for, but should demonstrate the differences between the activation cost and the resolution of an actual activated or triggered ability.|`|HB8uby7xaa	Killing a creature will not stop already activated abilities that creature has.      As part of the activation ability of Balthor, you remove him from the game.  At that point, he is no longer a legal target for a instant destroy target creature spell.  Your opponent is unable to stop Balthor's ability through this means and his playing a kill spell on Balthor is response is illegal and he must choose a different target (possibly his own creature)     Any part of a card's ability that occurs before the colon (:) is the cost.  Any part that occurs after the colon is the effect.  If you have already paid the cost and part of the cost is removing a creature from play, this will happen faster than your opponent can respond.  Even if your opponent tried to kill Balthor, you would have a chance to respond by sacrificing him to his ability.  The only way a kill spell could stop you from playing the activated ability would be if it had the ability split second which does not use the stack and does not give you a chance to do anything in response.    In response to additional details:  The removal from the game does not use the stack.  Paying costs precedes putting abilities on the stack just like you pay a spell's mana cost before it goes on the stack.  You cannot respond to mana payment just as you cannot respond to other costs for activated abilities.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	Before you put the ability on the stack, you must pay all of its costs. So you would pay BBB and remove him from the game THEN put his ability on the stack. At that point, your opponent could choose to respond. Because he was removed as a cost, he is no longer on the field for them to target.    Now, you also have to keep in mind that you can't stop an activated ability by killing its source. For example, if Balthor the Stout (different card; see my source) used his ability to give another barbarian +1/+0, the opponent could respond and kill him. However, the ability is still on the stack and will resolve anyway. Once an ability is on the stack, it is completely independent from its source.
HB8uby7xaa	I assume you are looking for green cards.  I recommend you get the Molimo's Might tenth edition Preconstructed deck because it has all green cards in it.    Any other pack will have cards of all colors in it.  You should just get a set you think is cool and then trade your non-green cards for green cards from your friends.  If you are the only one that plays green you will get good stuff easy!    As for sets with powerful green:  Mirrodin Block is good  as well as Urza's    As for new stuff look for the Naya Behemoths theme deck.

X9kNbpnQaa	1) Interrupts are now instants.    2) Serpent Generator is an Artifact, not an Interrupt nor Instant.    3) Yavimaya Elder is a Creature, not an instant.    4) I think Yavimaya Elder and Sakura-tribe Scouts are both kind of unwieldy. I would include Sakura-tribe Elders and Kodama's Reach instead.    5) I'd drop the Wild Growth (you don't need that much land acceleration) for Whispersilk Cloak.    6) I would also include some "Fear" (it's an enchantment that gives fear). You want to be able to attack and hit your opponent.    7) Funny as it is, I think Doubling Season would work out decently. It'll double the number of counters your creatures give (and the ability stacks; two of them quadruple it).

VzJQUCPIaa	I believe that, because of the various chance/community chest cards and "go to jail" space, the orange monopoly (Tennessee, etc.) is the one mathematically most likely to be landed on (albeit by a very narrow margin) of all those on the board in any given circuit. (It's the chance of landing on it when coming out of jail that tips the odds in its favor, btw.)|`|gQpoSC6Baa	i like the classic version, instead of all the other novelty version out there.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Usually the Yellows and the Greens are the best. They aren't too expensive for original purchase and they get landed on the most I think. Don't try for Park Place or Boardwalk.

They are the green ones,    and there is a go to jail right before them also!

Jail is the most frequently landed on space and the Oranges are six, eight and nine (rather common rolls of the dice) squares away from Jail. At $100 per house, the property is developed cheaply. Boardwalk and Park Place are highly overrated especially if the "Advance to Boardwalk" Chance card is out of play.|`|6NvlEEgHaa	the red one by far. not expensive to buy. does damage.|`|0NbPgf2vaa	try to get all six properties near the jail and the railroads|`|e2mAJAK6aa	monopolize the corners...

Are you trying to create a 40-card deck?  If so, you'll need to be very strict and eliminate anything that does not either make tokens or provide the necessary mana for doing so.|`|RAN9tdQNaa	You have 77 cards. If you're going to do a 60 card deck, that's 17 cards off. You have a lot of cards with good effects, but they don't all link together; some cards are just there. I always try and do around 20 lands and 40 spells. Another tip, when determining what is good and what is better, consider cost as well as overall deck theme.  Your planeswalkers will help a lot (and they cost nothing, is that right?)    Well, that's my advice: connect with theme and keep costs low.|`|rMKOAdO6aa	take away like 10 lands and other things that don't do something immediately when it hits the board (ie prismatic omen....)

WxmNSxNGaa	No reason to stop. Just manage your money well and enjoy taking money from the suckers at the card room. You say you've already tripled your money twice. Just take double your original stake (since you should be up to 6 times your original buy in) and set that aside. The rest is profit you can play with. If you bust out that money, no big deal. You're still ahead and can decide what you want to do from there. If you keep winning, more power to you. There's nothing to be worried about.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	Do you think you are making mistakes when playing?  If not, keep playing.

They say it better.|`|VzJQUCPIaa	Sounds like you're playing solid strategy and have found a spot where the fish are biting. Just be sure not to get overconfident and try and move up the ladder too fast - the higher the blinds, the more likely the competition will also be competent.|`|TcyuVk8Qaa	You are nervous because you don't totally understand what is going on at the poker table. You don't know how much of your success is due to skill and how much is due to variance. You think maybe you have some holes in your game but are not 100% certain where they are. Definitely read about/study the game as much as you can and don't risk too much at poker until you know enough that you don't get nervous anymore. You want to get to a level of play where when you observe other players at the table, you can almost immediately tell whether or not they are bad enough that you can make money at that table. And whenever you win or lose you should be able to tell if you played well or not. Sometimes you win but didn't play well and sometimes you play great but still lose. Don't stop playing. Just keep your investment small and keep learning about the game and getting better at it.

vbC2JN4paa	You can make a living being a Face Character for Disney.  It all depends on your life style.  I was an intern through Disney;s College Program and lived with a Face Character for 7 months.  He made great money for being an intern.  I also had another Face Character friend who had enough money to pay for the intern apartment and rent a huge house with a couple of friends.  And I say if he could do that, then you can sure make enough.  But, I wouldn't recommend being a Face Character if you have 3 or more children.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	i've read that they make $13 per hour. its a heck of alot more than the $7.21 (minimum wage) the most other disney jobs pay.   you could make a living but it probably wouldn't be as much income as you'd like. plus you have to be available 365 days a year so even if its your scheduled day off they have the right to call you up and make you come in especially if there was no one else available to play that character that day.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	The Disney employees I have met and talked with on my many trips have told me that Disney shockingly pays pretty bad and the benefits aren't that great. There is a position on Disney for a face character but it pays $12-$15 and hour and is not guaranteed to be full time so I would say you could not make a living on it alone.
5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Simple. You are playing a game of chance and the odds are NOT in your favor. Like Las Vegas for example, just where do you think the money comes from to pay the electric bill for all those signs and lights? From players like YOU who lose, lose, lose. Winners are rare, losers are many or gambling establishments of ANY kind would quickly lose money and go out of business. Gambling of any kind is a game for fools and idiots who let greed run their lives. SURE, you DO have a chance to win, but your chance of winning BIG is really, really SMALL...|`|L2S9jjdLaa	Could it be too do with the amount of players, playing at the site?

0V1SkpiFaa	The Dragonborn first appeared in a 3.5 book, Races of the Dragon. So if you've got that book or can get it easily, you're good to go.

AA12177717	It's telling you to take the hardcover copy of The Sorcerer's Stone to use to measure the fringe for the right size.  Hold the book sideways and wrap the yarn around the book.  You'll need 7 wraps for each group of each color.  Once you've got the wraps, take some scissors and cut the yarn along the open side of the book (not the spine, it's easier this way).  Take 7 strands, fold them in half and use a crochet hook and insert it at the end of the scarf where you want the fringe.  Put the 7 strands on the crochet hook and pull them through, then wrap the cut ends around the hook and pull them through the loop on the hook to lock them.  I've found that to even the ends out if you have a quilter's mat, quilter's ruler and a rotary cutter you can line the fringe up so the uneven ends are at the edge of the ruler on the mat and just cut them off with the rotary cutter in one swipe for a nice, neat edge to them.|`|AA11685844	Take several lengths of yarn, fold in half.

Rowling about a boy named Harry Potter. Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (retitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) in 1997, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success worldwide, spawning films, video games and assorted merchandise. The six books published to date have collectively sold more than 377 million copies,[not in citation given] and have been translated into more than 63 languages.[1] The seventh and last book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is scheduled to be released on 21 July 2007.[2] Publishers announced a record-breaking 12 million copies for the first print run in the US alone.[3]    The story is mostly set in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and focuses on Harry Potter's fight against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, who used the Dark Arts to kill Potter's parents.    Due to the success of the novels, Rowling has become the richest writer in literary history.[4] English language versions of the books are published by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic Press in the United States, Allen & Unwin in Australia and Raincoast Books in Canada.    The first four books have been made into very successful motion pictures by Warner Bros.. The fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, began filming in February 2006, and is scheduled for release on 13 July 2007.[5]    Origins and publishing history  In 1990, J. K. Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry simply "walked" into her head. Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:[6]     I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. [...] I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.      That evening, the author began the pre-writing for her first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a semi-detailed plan that would include the plots of each of her seven envisioned books, in addition to an enormous amount of biographical and historical information on her characters and universe.[7]    Over the course of the next six years, which included the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and a move to Portugal, Rowling continued writing Philosopher's Stone.[8] Eventually settling in Edinburgh, Rowling wrote much of the Philosopher's Stone in local cafs. Unable to secure a place in a nursery, her daughter would be her constant companion as she worked.    In 1996, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was completed and the manuscript was sent off to prospective agents. The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury. After eight other publishers had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a 3,000 advance for the publication of Philosopher's Stone.[9]    Despite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when she began to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted them at children age nine to eleven.[10] On the eve of publishing, Joanne Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name, in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), omitting her first name and using her grandmother's as her second.[11]    The first Harry Potter book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury in July 1997 and in the United States by Scholastic in September of 1998, but not before Rowling had received a six-figure sum for the American rights  an unprecedented amount for a children's book. Fearing that American readers would either not understand the word "philosopher" or not associate it with a magical theme (as a Philosopher's Stone is alchemy-related), Scholastic insisted that the book be given the title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the American market. Apart from this exception, the book's original title was kept by every other country in the world.[12]    Over nearly a decade Harry Potter has achieved much success due in part to positive reviews, Rowling's publisher's marketing strategy, but also due to word-of-mouth buzz among average readers, especially young males. The latter is notable because for years, interest in literature among this group had lagged behind other pursuits like video games and the Internet. Rowling's publishers were able to capitalise on this fervour by the rapid, successive releases of the first three books that allowed neither Rowling's audience's excitement nor interest to wane, along with quickly solidifying a loyal readership.[13] The series has also gathered adult fans, leading to two editions of each Harry Potter book being released, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults.[14] Moreover, the series is popular around the world in its many translations. Such was the global clamour to read the book that the English language edition of the series' fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, became the first English-language book ever to top the bookseller list in France.[14]    Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.    Story    Plot summary  The story opens with the unrestrained celebration of a normally-secretive wizarding world which for many years had been terrorised by Lord Voldemort. The previous night, Voldemort had discovered the refuge of the

The way the Trophy Garden works is that you'll only be able to catch certain pokemon if the owner of the mansion says he saw that pokemon that day.  The pokemon he says is a random one of 10 or 15.  The only way to get an eevee in the trophy garden is if you talk to him, he says he saw an eevee, and then you go find one in the trophy garden.    It might be easier to migrate one from another pokemon game (if you have one) or breed an eevee or any of its evolutions with a ditto (if you have any of the eeveelutions already).|`|BFCIXFnPaa	All i can say is he is rare.

ZZR30G7raa	Ah. You are wise, my friend.    Anyway, the SNES itself will be about $20-$40, depending on how many controllers you want with it. Know that this info is for ebay.    DO NOT GET EVERY MARIO GAME. FIVE of them are NOT made by nintendo. these are:  Mario's time machine  Mario is missing!  Mario's Early Years: Fun With Letters  Mario's Early Years: Fun With Numbers  Mario's Early Years: Preschool Fun    They are all terrible education games.    Also avoid a game called yoshi's cookie. It is an odd and confusing puzzle game. Though it IS an official Nintendo-made cart, it's...ugh...    Good SNES games will be around $5-$20 dollars each. I suggest you buy in lots. DK games: $10-20. Mario games: $10-80 (ill mention the 80 dollar one a litle further in). others: $5-hundreds (hundreds=games like chrono trigger, etc.).    So heres a list of the musts:    Super Mario World  Super Mario All Stars  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  Super Mario RPG (THIS is the 80 dollar mario game)  Super Mario Kart  Mario Paint (you might want to try to find a nintendo mouse for this)  Yoshi's Safari (you need a snes super scope)  Tetris and Doctor Mario: 2 good puzzle games. One is mario-themed.  Donkey Kong Country  Donkey Kong Country 2  Donkey Kong Country 3  The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past  Super Metroid  Star Fox  Kirby's Dreamland 3  Kirby Superstar: 8 games in 1!  Megaman 7 (aka Megaman VII)  Megaman X  Megaman X2  Megaman X3  Chrono Trigger  Final Fantasy 1-3  Secret of Mana    That's all I can think of for now. If you REALLY like RPGs, get ready to pay, Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana are the BEST RPGS on the SNES and VERY RARE!!! You could expect to pay up to $300 for EACH! But otherwise, stick to those and any that come with bundles of the games suggested.    Happy Retrogaming!    -Smartcomputernerd|`|DfgHAPAwaa	try ebay. haha they have everything, and as of games  well all the mario games are super fun!

JhJXKRkOaa	Yes they are, I got a nintendo ds older version in 2005 with the game nintendogs. just after christmas 2009 I bought a nintendo ds lite in coral pink, it's much lighter than the older version and slightly smaller.  There are lots of games to play on the ds, for all different ages, more new games are released on a regular basis, there great and very fun.  I recommend you get one.|`|nHNCslRZaa	They're WAY fun. It depends upon the game too. I have a racing game that doesn't even use the touch screen, but then I have Zelda: Phantom Hourglass and you have to use the touch screen to move and fight and everything.     I'm not sure about any animal games. My little sister like Pets Dogs 2.|`|9uwABTQuaa	A Nintendo DSi is the third iteration of the Nintendo DS handheld. It was first announced during the Nintendo Conference on October 2, 2008 in Tokyo, Japan. It includes a web browser, two cameras, bigger screens, louder sound, brighter screens, a music player, and an sd card slot. It will also include DSiware. It will not have a GBA game slot but you can play retro games with DSiware. At first, it will come in 2 colors, white and frosted black. Other colours will be created later onwards. It will release in the U.S. sometime in April. A Nintendo DS Lite (I have it) Is very fun! It is lighter and brighter than the regular DS. A good Ds games that are animal is Animal Crossing, Imagine Animal Doctor and Pet Vet are great games! If you like to take care of babies you could do My Baby Boy (or girl) and Imagine Babyz. You take care of babyz on Imagine Babyz and they grow, thats all I tell ya. I hope it helped!  Keep on rockin',  Mikayla|`|hFNS77cNaa	Get one.

DfPyyDssaa	You might be out of range of your wireless network. Place your Xbox 360 console in the same room as your wireless router or second Xbox 360 console and try again. You can also try the following suggestions:    Verify that an Ethernet cable is NOT plugged into your console's Ethernet port.  Verify that your network's wireless access point, gateway, or router is powered on.  Make sure that your router is broadcasting a wireless network name (SSID). The wireless router broadcast of the SSID might be disabled. See your router documentation for information about enabling SSID broadcast.  Remove any obstructions between your Xbox 360 console and your wireless access point.  Turn off any devices that may interfere with your wireless network (for example, microwave ovens or 2.4-GHz telephones).  If you are using an infrastructure network, make sure the security settings on your wireless adapter match those on your wireless access point, gateway, or router (for example, your WEP key or WPA passphrase must match).  If you are establishing an ad-hoc network, make sure the network name, channel, band, and security settings match the settings on the device with which you are establishing a connection.  Note    If you have MAC filtering enabled on your wireless access point, router, or gatewayor if you are using a wireless bridgemake sure you add the MAC address of your Xbox 360 console to the list of allowed MAC addresses. Contrary to information stated in the Xbox Dashboard, the console's networking software does not make use of the MAC address assigned to the Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter.|`|3eQhA8nraa	is it the microsoft version? how far away from your wireless router are you? you leave out too many variables, such as your router type, distance to your router... aim me or message me or email me with more info|`|hEeeUetyaa	you have bad wifi connecton|`|14zJNbfFaa	try taking it out and put it in ? unplug your moden for 10secs n try again it worked for me   what modem router you got i have netgear they work best with the wireless adapter

oEfnqmp3aa	Well, I'd personally call "Phantom Darkness" the most powerful booster series out. It is almost all DARK monsters with strategies for them that are just too easy to set up.    If you can wait until April, there will be a new structure deck titled "Lord of the Magicians" or something like that. It contains many unjustly easy to access cards that are very powerful. If you can't wait, then get the most recent structure deck, "Zombie World".|`|yzpU5fZJaa	but metal raiders, it has solemn judgmetn worht $60 and mirror force $40. as for a structure deck, it depends what you like. my favs are the machine revolt and the warrior's triumph. i like the warrior becuase you can remove a couple bad cards, add a couple solemns, a mirror froce, and a couple tuners and synchros and viola, a ready to play tornament legal (if you remove the illegal cards) not really bad deck.|`|m1vr3RR5aa	Hmm it basically depends on the cards you want. Like what kind of deck you want. Dont buy by the box, buy by the pack or something or find someone who is quitting yugioh and get cards for cheap. Also your local hobby shops and flea markets can help you out too.|`|ybXqknOuaa	i think it depends on the deck you want to build i am a bit biased with Lightsworns!!!! :D but they are hard to pull from Light of Destruction (and there is nothing else in this pack besides Lightsworns that are worth it.)    the booster box i would buy would be Gladiators Assault most of the Glad beasts are common anyways but they pack a big punch     as for the structure deck i would get a ums i forget the name but i think its like Rise of the Emperor i dont think that right but its the removal one    Hope i helped :D|`|7RAPW1J6aa	Try Phantom Darkness. The best cards are in that set. You can also try Gold Series. In my opinion, the best structure deck is zombie world.

WQzi3agEaa	The Knight will attack you by either swinging his ax at you while you areclose to him, or he will swing it and get it stuck in the ground. THAT is your time to strike! When he has it stuck in the ground, run behind him and kick him in the back to reveal an unarmored area. Now, when he gets his ax stuck again, use the crossbow to shoot him in the back. This isn't as hard as it sounds and is the recommended way because it is so quick. When he falls to his knees, press A to finish him.    Apparently you can kill him by shooting him for ages, bu a crossbow to his weakened section seems to do the trick.|`|SCeQY9ZVaa	OMFG DUDE, THIS TOOK ME AGES! there is one unarmoured part to him and i think that it is on his back somewhere. sometimes he will do an attack when his axe in the floor, run round the back of him and slash the **** into him with an axe or a sword or some ****! tink that will work!

Uc7BNCxRaa	I suggest you ask SE / POL for help.  I'm appending some contact information at the bottom.    A couple of suggestions, though.    0) Check out several support forums.  I strongly suggest three of them:    A) http://forums.ffxiclopedia.org/index.php  B) http://www.windower.net/forums/  C) http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/    1) Make sure the Vista account you're using has administration rights.  You need this to install update, fixes, etc.  This means the Vista account you're using to play the game also needs administration rights (not just the one you used to install the game).    2) Try uninstalling and reinstalling FFXI over again.  I think this will be one of the first thing SE / POL will suggests (I think).    3)  My last suggestion is contact SE / POL:    Phone Support:  PlayOnline Information Center  (858) 790-7529 (PLAY)  Monday - Friday  9:00 am - 6:00 pm Pacific Time (excluding weekends and holidays)    Web Chat Support: https://secure.playonline.com/supportus/...

Dso7k3sjaa	Do you have Apartment Life installed?  Because I know that when EA made that ep, they put some of the things that were in Makin' Magic into that game.  Maybe the "Ghost of Gordon" was added to it.  I never had Makin' Magic and I don't have Apartment Life, so I am not sure.    Otherwise, did your sim know a sim named Gordon?  Did he die?  If he died, his ghost probably wanders around at night on the lot he lived in.  If there are other sims still living on that lot, they can invite your sim over in the evening and there is a chance that your sim may be able to see the ghost of the sim named Gordon.    If you want to find out whether EA included some "Ghost of Gordon" that was in the Makin' Magic game into the Apartment Life game, then I would advise you ask about it on EA's Sims 2 bbs as sims 2 games are the only thing that's talked about on that site.    **eta -- Just remembered something else.  I had a sim once who was really mad at another sim and they kept getting a Want to see the ghost of the sim they were mad at.  It just means that they are wishing that sim were dead, lol!  You can actually try to get that sim to come to your sims' home and then use a cheat to kill "Gordon" off.  Then your sim will be able to see Gordon's ghost wandering around at night and will get that Want satisfied.|`|AA11850311	was Gordon a burglar?  Sometimes my sims want to see the ghosts of burglars even though the burglar is still alive.  I think that is the sims' way of saying they wish the person who stole their stuff would die.

A lot of people say it has problems, but really, its the fault of the user. If the 360 is taken care of poorly, yes it will stop working. But if you treat it like you would treat a loved one, it will work perfectly. People fail to realise this because of the battle between Sony and Microsoft. Or really, Playstation and Xbox. No one actually experiments with them to find which is the better system. People just pick a side and stick with it, having ignorance as to what the other side holds. I take Xbox over Playstation because of the faster load times, better graphics, and better controller. Of course, this depends a lot on personal taste.

I gave it a rental and beat it over the night. Games are meant to be a challenge on the normal setting by the way, so if it's a walk in the park on normal, and insane on God mode, then the game is unbalanced and not fun. Of course, I know you don't want to hear this, and you'd love nothing more than to argue about it, so go ahead, I'm done.
AA12178124	The problem should be resolved by now.  I've been playing '06 the last couple of days.  Are you still having issues?|`|011890d5c90493b7fb7c48a75ea98aedaa	Yeah you should be able too.  The error might have been from EA doing some updating on the server.
011890d5c90493b7fb7c48a75ea98aedaa	No, after 2007 came out they won't make anymore roster updates. I think the Feb one is the very last update for 2006
922e508192ea4d2e9c0edb1b3b09f1b5aa	I beleive you can download a patch but it will not increase the graphics or give you the extras on superstar mode. I reccomend buying it.

a1fb17d8d466c12eeed48a99ab4957c5aa	I would love to...I have to find my weffriddles stuff...what is the web adress for that particular one, if you let me know I would be able to tell you how to do it.    Is that the one with the vertical line of letters and then horizontal letters down the middle?    Okay, it is that one, I can't give you the answer because I don't have it...can't find my list. But I will tell you that the line at the top is the answer and the key is the one in the center....now all you have to do is substitute one letter for another....once you get it you will kick yourself...of course isn't that the way it is with most weffriddles....btw, if you think it's hard now just wait until you hit batch 3!

The only thing I would consider changing is the scrolling 'comment' reminders. They're cool looking, but they detract slightly from the rest of the design.
b9272b47d183b0fa24630b642fe4cab7aa	Here's an idea: stop being a cheapskate and go out and buy it!  The most I could see it being is $20.  It's probably less though.|`|m46M3ZI4aa	Ok... If you're downloading the game already.  Then you must have AOE 3 already.  Did you download it too?  Use your downloading program and search for a Age of Empires 3: The War Chiefs CD Key Generator.  I'm sure that there is one.  But, where I don't know.  Thats the best answer I can give you, besides going out and actually buying the game itself.
GokFu5cFaa	I honestly don't remember, but if you go to HER Interactive, you can log into their message boards and probably find the answer there.  I use it whenever I play.

18fwfrRfaa	I had a hard time trying to get to the 8th badge too! But I eventually figured it out. If your headed to Sunyshore City (were the 8th badge is) you first need to go up Mt. Cornet and battle Team Galactic. The top of Mt. Cornet is also were Palkia or Dialga is. So, fly to Hearthome City. Go left from Hearthome, into Route 208. You should  get to a Mt. Cornet entrance. Go to were you use Rock Climb in that room (after you use Surf to get there), and go up. Go up the stairs. In the Next room, go up to the top door. Not the door on the left side of the the room. In the next room, go up another set of stairs. In the Next room, go up, head left, then go down, and go out the door. You should be outside. Go right, than up and use Rock Climb. Do not go up the second Rock Climb. Go left. There should be a door if you go up. Enter it. Head up and use Rock Climb. Then go right there should be another exit. You should be outside when you go through it. Head up. There sould be another entrance. Don't enter that one. Enter the second one by going up, than using Rock Climb on the left one, then going left. There should be an entrance some were over there. Head right in the room you that you just entered. Go up the stairs. In the next room, head down, then left, and go up the stairs. Then go up. Exit the last door. Make sure you save before catching Palkia or Dialga! Head back down Mt. Cornet when you're done and that FAT guy should be gone, and you can go to Sunyshore City.  Hope this helps!|`|qTi1Y3oGaa	you have to go through Mt.Coronet,battling galactic grunts. Then you will defeat two team galactic comanders then the team galactic boss. Then you can capture or defeat Dialga. Once your done with that go to  valor lakefront. The fat guy wont be there.    Hope i helped

011890d5c90493b7fb7c48a75ea98aedaa	You can save alot more games on it and you will be able to get 1080i resolution on your screen with the HDMI output (which the 20GB 360 doesn't have)|`|6OiBR8vDaa	You can save more stuff and you can download almost anything without pannicking about memory i guess. Plus the design on it is really cool.

ibgPiMFcaa	Found this online and thought it would help:    "In order to  trigger the event, you need to walk into Nina's house on a sunny afternoon after you have met the other requirements.  In order to get  the sock from her, you need to have given Nina about 50 large wool and  gotten her heart rate up to the maximum of 255.  You cannot use the cat and dog showing trick to open this event.  Once you trigger the event, you will walk into Nina's hut and she will tell you that she has been knitting a sock for you.  She also talks about the stocking festival and a few other things.  When you return home, you will find the stocking on the sock hook next to the TV.  You need the sock in order to get the free gift during the stocking festival."|`|497e7bc802a90b3c6b6979f71b0f7f81aa	Try looking on www.gamewinners.com and www.gamefaqs.com.

ibgPiMFcaa	They are just there to harass your livestock and make the game a little more difficult. Apparently, your dog is supposed to help chase them off, so keep him out at the end of the day. Also having a fence helps keep them away from your livestock. Other than that there is nothing I have heard of that you can do to make wild dogs go away.|`|MVOUNBPMaa	my uncle has a farm and he has the same problem and we found out that the wild dogs are wanting something from your farm because its the time of season.  possibilities such as...  cattle.  chickens.

I think it also helps if you have built an animal shed    **To unlock the different levels in the mine you need to enter the dig site after 11pm with the hammer equipped. If you want to unlock another level of the mine, do the same thing, but you must have reached the bottom of the previous mine.     ***I think you need to bake them, or if there is somewhere to buy them, I havent heard of it.     ****Some of the harvest sprites that work in the casino:   Roller: Cross the bridge toward Vesta's farm on Spring 8.

ibgPiMFcaa	Unless you will be in some crazy backcountry, you will probably only encounter black bears. Black bears will usually just run if you do anything to scare them off like make loud noises, etc. and arent a major attack concern. The main exception is when there are cubs around and you are confronted with a mother bear and in that case it is best to not to try to scare it away but just back away slowly and and in an unthreatening manner while looking as tall as possible.|`|b152c8566a6a2e64a1dd6c42e4d5b29baa	Stick your head between your legs and kiss your rump  goodbye. :)|`|xirNoRtUaa	well if the bear isn't charging you, you are probably near its home and it is defending it so just back away very slowly but if it is comming after you at full speed it most likely thinks you are prey so the only thing you can do is wrestle it and yell at it if you have a knife just stab it a few times in the face ehatever you do do not run from it if it is charging|`|TD0gKb55aa	Make lots of noise and obnoxious behavior. This will usally scare the bear off. If this doesn't work, refer to the first answer given.
BqZJVBU9aa	Every match you play gets you X-amount of points, win or lose (except terrorist hunt, only win)    Every x amount of points gets a bar of exp, and every 5 (I think?) bars will get you a new rank.    The absolute quickest way to rank up, is to put on full armor, and get a good group of 4 people (you and 3 others) and go to LVU campus on terrorist hunt, a good group can clear it in about 2-4 minutes, and that's actually how I hit elite.

ozK2hKJZaa	Nabooti Island says it will come out this fall, right. November is one of the autumn months. So, Nabooti Island will come out sometime this November. My first hypothesis was it was coming out Nov. 10 - Nov. 20. The second prediction was Nov. 21 - Nov. 30.  Don't even check Wikipedia, they are very clueless. Poptropica Creator's Blog might even have a clue when Nabooti Island will come out just like what it did for Spy Island. Remember, the alphabet decoder. I might even be sure it will come out November 21. Don't trust Wikipedia, don't even trust Cheats Guru. Make sure you pin that and trust me and only me. Here is the reasonableness chart when it will come out: >>>    REASONABLENESS CHART:    1. November 29  2. November 21  3. November 19  4. November 25  5. November 18  6. November 22  7.

See this preview on the Poptropica Creator's Blog.|`|ZiOZ4Qsdaa	It'll probably come out soon, just be patient! I'm sure the Poptropica team is working on it, trying to make it better as we speak.

ibgPiMFcaa	There are a few requirements for muffy to marry you.     1st: You have to increase her affection towards you. Right now the gray heart means she doenst have much affection for you. To increase this, give her an item she likes everyday like jewelry from the dig site or diamonds or flowers. You have to do this a lot and her heart will change colors from black to purple to blue to yellow and then when it reaches red, she likes you enough to marry you.     2nd. Each time her heart changes color towards you, there is a scene you can watch that involves you and her called a heart event. It doesnt matter if you miss some, but you have to have seen all of them before you two can marry. They usually happen just by you being around her.     3rd. You have to have unlocked 60 harvest sprites. These can be unlocked just by doing normal work. The link below has more information on how to unlock more sprites.     4th. You have to have the big bed which you can unlock through the harvest sprite shopping network.     If you are new to the game then this is probably sounding confusing. As you get further it will make more sense, and if you get stuck you can use the online guide to the game below for help.  http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file...

Another game is Diablo though you have to buy the disk for that from zellers or eb games, its like $20. But if you want just a chatting games with rich and poor, no levels, no violence, then the best choice would be Habbo Hotel! Its a great game i lvoe that game, you can get addicted to it and and by the way u can go to either habbohotel.ca (canadian) or habbohotel.com (american). So its pretty fun, but you have to pay to buy stuff but once you have bought stuff and you start to learn more about the game then you will get more and more stuff without paying (u get free stuff when you bet, win contests, win games, or scam lol) Well another game that is exactly like habbo hotel but doesnt require money is coke music, you have to make your own songs and if people like it then they give you a thumbs up and you get points and then just like habbo u make ur own room and make friends and all of that...

4c4e78cdfed131967c22d003a7184e1daa	You realize that this violates the Yahoo TOS and is likely to get you banned right? Either way, you wont find a CD Key that works online for any game. The games ship with unique codes that are recorded by the publisher. Only recorded serials allow access to online play, and when a serial is used too often (IE is ditributed over the internet via warez) it is blocked and invalidated. So keygens work for offline as they simply repeat the common algorithm used to make the original unique code, however they are unrecognized by the servers. And deleting the Serial check from the game EXE would invalidate the EXE check done by the server which would also bar online play. The only way that anyone has been able to play games online is with legitimate copies.|`|TG2MhgqQaa	hey, I have tried their service.  It's not so bad.

xwuTBAlTaa	If you can afford to, I would rent the game or borrow it from someone that already has the game before you buy it. It is a great game at first with different modes that keep you going. Without the multiplayer, this game gets redundant and kinda old in just a short period of time. On the bright side, every aspect of the multiplayer is amazing. If you really enjoy cars, this is the best game out there right now and the selection of cars and customization is great.    It could be better though. There is a large selection of cars, but not a great big variety. There could be trucks, motorcycles, and even the common car like the Honda Civic or Nissan Altima. Drag races would give this game a little boost. It's a great game that's worth playing, but there is always room for improvement!|`|J41uc9Kzaa	Yes I would strongly urge you to purchase this game.  It has hours upon hours of gameplay in the offline mode, the races are challenging and fun (some less than others) the models are amazing, the physics are pretty good, but I might be being hard on them.  Hopefully, you have an xbox live acount, because with that, there is just endless hours of fun racing.|`|p7ehOz4Caa	ya becase its funner than DiRT!

ibgPiMFcaa	To marry Celia, you have to increase her affection rating toward you. This can be seen when you talk to her and there is a little heart by her, when that heart gets to red, you are ready to buy the blue feather and propose. You can also buy a friendship bracelet from the casino that will show you exactly how much she likes you. 60k is the minimum needed for marriage. The best way to increase her affection rating is to give her gifts daily such as jewelry and diamonds from the mine. I give one diamond a day myself because they increase affection by like 700. It takes quite a bit of gift giving for you to reach the red heart.      If you already have the red heart, and you still cannot marry her, you still need some of the cut scenes that include you and her. These are called heart events and are pretty easy to trigger just by being around her for a while. The FAQ below should answer all your marriage questions that I havent covered and will explain exactly what is needed to trigger the events. As far as you working for Vesta, I didnt marry Celia, so I havent heard of this, but maybe the link below can help you out.        http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file...    As far as unlocking sprites, I cant explain all those here, but below is another online FAQ that tells you how to unlock all them.     http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file...    Hope that helps.
4Rmrn5zWaa	A game save only works if you have the game rom as well.  That is, the save file doesn't contain the game on it.  It only contains certain things about the game, such as which items you have, what levels all your characters are at, etc.  You still need the game information from a rom.  Hope this helps!  ^_^    (If you have questions about where to find commercial roms, please ask elsewhere, as such questions are not allowed here.)
3e9768577c4d7cc51dc244221c948c23aa	Yes. It's typical for a MMORPG. You're basically paying for the upgrade, maintenance, and the upgrades to game that happen fairly regularly.     In fact, the disk is actually useless without the monthly fee, since there's no off-line version of World of Warcraft.|`|cfWzztC7aa	yes.|`|9pzYzoI8aa	Yes.|`|52a7926763692c156116ddc768c670bcaa	Yes.  $15 U.S. per month.

ibgPiMFcaa	Most of the good DS games are not cooperative, but here are some options for co-op games:  Lost in Blue 2: A very good simulation co-op game (but it might be weird because the girl is supposed to play a very minor romantic character and your sister would play her)  Club House Games: This is a compilation of tons of board, card, and other standard games that you can play with your sister cooperatively against the computer.  Mario Kart DS: One of the most popular multiplayer games and you can set it up so that you battle on the same team against the computers  Transformers: You play and fight as transformers and if you and your sister both buy autobots or both buy decepticons then you can play together against the opposite side over wi-fi.   And then a few other pretty good wireless games that are not cooperative but not as competitive as other games:  Super Mario DS, Metroid Prime Pinball, Elite Beat Agents, tetris

qblrMFV0aa	Usually, the daycare will level up the pokemon you put in there by 1 Exp for each step you take.  So, if you leave a pokemon in the daycare when you first get to it and come back after you finish the game, it will have grown by a lot of levels.  The only problem with that is the pokemon will not evolve in daycare and they will learn/drop moves according to level.  Say, you used a TM on a pokemon and left it at daycare, when you comeback, you might lose it because it would have learned something over it.    I usually never use the daycare, unless I am breeding, because I don't want to take a chance at losing a move I like and adding a move I don't like.|`|BbhmkSZCaa	it dose lv up pokemon and it madders like a step is a exp so when you do 50 steps and thats in till the next lv it will be the next lv up and if you have ditto put him in with a pokemon  thats not legend then run around  and the guy in the front talk to him he will give you a egg then it will be that pokemon that you put in with ditto hatch it|`|fLFFz8zwaa	Yes. For every step you take, your pokemon in the daycare gain 1 xp. This applies to both pokemon. So if you have 2 pokemon in the daycare, and you walk, run or bike x amount of steps, each of those pokemon will gain x experience. They will also level up when they reach their xp requirements. They will never evolve, but be careful because they may learn new moves and overwrite old ones.|`|iM0K6qV7aa	i do know that they can level up if you leave them in there for a while. A way to know how much your Pokemon leveled up you can get yourself a pokenav i think its called that shows you how much your Pokemon has grown over time. you would get it in the town that has a place for people to trade around the world its a big town one of the first you go to in the beginning. i can't remember the name but this is after you get a certain badge.|`|9dedbef55be08da96692f376e75d9428aa	Yes, it can. Eacch step you take after leaving the pokemon counts as 1 exp point, but the exp will only count if your pokemon lvls up.

59AZ4GKVaa	Hello fellow Pokemon trainer, here I am to resolve your question & hopefully get my points in return. In this version you get Regigigas first & then you may find the Regi trio on certain areas. However, to actually have Regigigas, you need to go to a Nintendo event, but as read on, I find out that this event is only in Japan, so I'm not sure if you trade any other Regigigas to activate the Regi hunt. Well, hope this helps you on your quest. Below I sent you the site I found the info on. Good luck & good bye !!|`|HDgdxtesaa	Yes it is possible to get them in Platinum. You have to have either the event Regigigas or a Regigigas from another game. You can go to different caves located across Sinnoh, and find them. I think the site in my sources is putting up a page about them.
vtJDHJDYaa	Kingdom Hearts features a mixture of familiar Disney and Final Fantasy characters, as well as several new characters designed and created by Nomura. Though the series features locations unique to the Kingdom Hearts franchise, worlds from Disney films are heavily explored. Sora must visit these worlds and interact with popular Disney characters to protect them from enemies. Often, Sora's actions in these worlds follow closely to the storylines featured in their accompanying Disney films. In one of the dialogues, Donald Duck tells Sora not to interfere with the worlds too much, since such interference would cause problems. Moogles, small creatures from Final Fantasy, are another common element in the games. They provide the player with synthesis shops in order to create items for use in the game. <br>  <br>  The Kingdom Hearts series contains both 3rd-person fighting and role-playing game elements. The games are driven by a linear progression to the next story event, usually told in the form of a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. Furthermore, there are allies to aid the main character, Sora. The allies in play rely fully on A.I controls, though players could later modify and customize their ability usage frequency. The combat system takes on real-time, meaning Sora could engage the enemy directly; various actions, such as attack and magic, are executable, during or after the battle.<br>  <br>  In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the combat system was altered slightly, Sora is no longer aided with his friends, all of his combat commands, are only executable via Cards. The real-time combat system was also taken away, where the scene flashes whenever Sora engages an enemy, taking them to a wider combat field.<br>  <br>  The Gummi Ship is another common theme in the series, where it serves as a means of transportation for Sora and company to travel towards other worlds. Players can modify and customize these ships via blueprints and selected parts. In the release of Final Mix, the first game contained Gummi Ship side quests. However, due to the criticism regarding the complexity of the Gummi Ship customization, the third game's Gummi Ship was toned down, providing easier and wider modifications, allowing players to customize it into either a small classed battle ship, or a grand carrier.<br>  <br>  Another recurring element of the Kingdom Hearts series is Jiminy's Journal, which functions as a bestiary and provides hints and simple character information. The journal also records Sora's mini-game results, as well as unfinished side quests, allowing players to have easier resolutions to track the game.<br>  <br>  In Kingdom Hearts II, the battle system introduced a new gameplay element: Drive Forms, which allow Sora to gain access to new abilities via his combat garment, and wielding two Keyblades for a limited time. (However, only several forms have this ability). Magics are simpler to execute, and Sora's MP gauge will recharge automatically one it is used up. Another gameplay element introduced in the third series of the franchise is the Reaction Command, various combat abilities only executable via several situations.<br>  <br>  The games are influenced by their parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carry its gameplay elements over into their own action-based, hack-and-slash system. Like many traditional role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts features an experience point system which determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player gains experience which culminate in a "level-up", where the characters grow stronger and gain access to new abilities. The amount of experience is shared with all party members and each character grows stronger as experience is gained. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/King...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a>|`|3YUql6Z9aa	you fight  heartless and try to save the worlds|`|59AZ4GKVaa	Pretty simple, it's a compilation of Disney characters & worlds, with the Final Fantasy-like fighting. This is a great title to get for all ages, since it has little mini-games for children to enjoy & battles for teens to enjoy as well. The story involves a kid with a KeyBlade named Sora, joined up with Donald Duck as a Black Mage & Goofy as a Defender. The trio travel through the Disney stories, saving the 7 princesses & collecting items. I have Kingdom Hearts I & II for PS2 & I like them both. Like in the first game you play with Peter Pan & Tinkerbell in London/ Captain Hook's ship the "Jolly Roger" & there is also a level where you end up inside Monstro's belly with Pinocchio. In KH 2 there are some of the same stories, although they make different stories in this game, like the Pirates of the Caribbean story & a Tron story. Anyways, check it out if you want or rent the game if you're not sure about it. Well, hope this helps you out!!|`|5N4tsjNiaa	I love this game but I don't talk about it that much,<br>  You play a 14 year old called Sora who lives on these Islands and one evening he and his friends (Riku and Kairi) get split up into different worlds (disney ones). Sora manages to wield the keyblade (a special weapon) and his objective is to find his 2 friends and joins forces with Donald and Goofy who have been given orders by King Mickey to follow the Keyblade bearer (Sora). In the game you have to battle disney villains and heartless. You travel from world to world meeting disney characters and unlocking key holes. Other than finding his friends he has a lot more responsibility to save all the worlds...sort of.<br>  I won't spoil it but there are 2 sequels with the same objectives and 3 other games not quite to do with Sora.|`|2L9mQ1nPaa	You basically go from planet to planet in a spaceship, each planet represents a different Disney movie.  When you there you fight various monsters and and bosses.  It doesn't sound like much, might even sound stupid, but the only way to actually understand it is to play it.  The fighting style in the game makes your heart smile.  The story is 2nd to none.|`|7DzcIkKRaa	It's a roleplaying game about the Disney world and how a boy named sora tries to save it and his friends.<br>  <br>  read up on it on wiki<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  it's a great game i suggest you try it

Anyways read the rest of my post to see why it worth it and other info that i felt like writting b4 :P <br>  <br>  My Last answer to Oblivion question.<br>  <br>  you almost never will! :) best game made for length and stuff!! If you get really good and have no life like me and my friends, we beat the MAIN QUEST ONLY in like 1-2 days,<br>  <br>  But normally it should take at least a week for that, then there are guilds, (fighters guild, mages guild, dark brotherhood, black hand, the arena, there are a few more too)<br>  <br>  Then there are skill quests and side quests and item quests, and there is always TRAINING :D:D i loveeeee that game :) I became god on 4 diff ppl with it :) i had a bowman mage lvl 30+ a Bowman fighter mage 30+ and a mage lvl 35+ (that one was the best :D still 100 skill with sword tho :P hehe)<br>  <br>  in short GET THE GAME NOW!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: When i say there i side quests i mean like 100's and you have to find them xD and if you dont go online and cheat it will take you soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long to beat even the guilds + Main quest never mind even tryin side quests<br>  <br>  Tip: the higher lvl you are the harder the monsters get, if you want to beat the main quest and you arnt amazing at picking skills (like i didnt do so well the first like 10 chars :P) try to beat it all without lvling ur main skills (thats how you lvl)|`|k6CSa9caaa	Well i bought it but to be honest it has more than its share of glitches. Its bargain priced with the expansions but be prepared for some re loads.|`|xDubataIaa	It is a great value, and yes it does include The Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine expansion packs. <br>  <br>  As far as glitches, I have not experienced any glitches in GotY Edition that I have not encountered in the regular edition. It is an Elder Scrolls game so you have to be prepared in the event that a glitch does happen, always keep multiple save files and save often. Don't worry about it too much, they don't happen all that often if at all.

i7ZArzliaa	The tentative name for the next console version of Tekken is "Tekken 6", which reportedly will include characters from the arcade version of "Tekken 6: BR".<br>  <br>  There has been some rumors that Namco-Bandai may reintroduce some past Tekken-series characters for the console version. Also, there has been some hearsay that Sony, since it lost its proprietary rights to the Tekken series to Microsoft late last year, is trying to negotiate exclusive characters only on the PS3... but these are just speculations at this time.<br>  <br>  Anyway~ hope this helps!

mIfY1ZxMaa	You didn't mention which edition you were using, but if you are using 1st/2nd, you might want to use the Artificer spells Mending, Reconstruction, and if the DM feels it's necessary, Rebinding or Recharge.  These are all wizard spells.  There are clerical Repair spells, one of which, Repair Item, could also work in a pinch, if the DM allows.  For a bone golem or any necromantic construct, the reverse of the healing spells, Cause Wounds, or Repair Injury, might work, with your DM's permission.  But no, traditional healing spells do not work on constructs, generally speaking.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	heal spells will not work on any sort of construct/golem<br>  but a mend spell will as will other repair spells<br>  <br>  repair/crafting skills can also heal damage to a construct<br>  it takes longer but it will work too though only if said construct was made by you or otherwise does not consider you and party a threat<br>  <br>  constructs/golem are very useful for defending an area<br>  but are also highly dangerous<br>  use great care when employing them or they will "bite" back|`|1H1Np9sFaa	If you mean things like golems, or other guardians, like shield guardians, or things of that ilk, generally you can't use heal spells.  In one of the books, and Spell Compendium, there were 'Repair' Spells the worked on Constructs.  They were generally similar to the clerical heal spells (i.e. Repair Light Wounds, Repair Moderate Wounds, etc.) but they only worked on constructs or those creatures with the construct type.<br>  <br>  Some DM's may also allow you to use the Craft Skill to repair damage, at some varying rate (i.e 5gp for 1 hp repaired.)  A roll is then made, and you see if you are successful or not.<br>  <br>  I'd look for the Repair Spells.  Probably easier that way.  Look through the Spell Compendium.|`|vlwkfkCDaa	Considering healing spells : <br>  <br>  Short answer : no<br>  <br>  Long answer : it depends. There are several construct subtypes. The Living Constructs are healed by spells, but only half the usual amount. This is the case of the Warforged in Eberron. Other subtypes may have different rulings, but they generally don't. You might consider that any construct that can be affected by necromancy effects can also be affected by healing effects (remember, undead are healed by "inflict" spells and damaged by "cure" spells).<br>  <br>  Considering how to repair them : <br>  <br>  In Eberron, Artificers have the several "Repair" infusions (different levels, different efficiencies). Eberron also offers oil of repair, and wands of repair (use magic device skill). <br>  <br>  Otherwise, the already mentioned spells (mending etc...) can help<br>  <br>  There are also several rules about Craft skills (long process, but it works)<br>  <br>  Psionics have the "Psionic repair damage" power, again can be put into tattoos, dorjes and power stones (use psionic device skill).<br>  <br>  A ring of regeneration might work. (Several constructs already have fast-healing or regeneration.)<br>  <br>  One last possibility, again for Eberron. Spells like "Unseen Crafter" or the "Dedicated Wright" homonculus might do the work for you. It might be more efficient to create a construct that repairs your other constructs than spending time doing it yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
c231bbpTaa	I depends on what kind of games you like and what else you are using it for. <br>  <br>  Wii: Has mostly family oriented and party games. Some games though are not like that such as Zelda and Mario Galaxy, but those are few and far between. It's the only system that doesn't have a DVD drive.It's backwards compatible, meaning it can play gamecube games and has quite a few downloadable games from old nintendo and sega systems.Don't have to pay for online play.<br>  <br>  PS3: Has more shooter type games and mature games then the wii. Has more exclusive games then XBOX such as Killzone 2, Singstar and LittleBigPlanet.Has a blue ray DVD player. Newer PS3 aren't backwards compatible. If you find a PS3 that is a 60g or an 80g with 4 USB ports then it is backwards compatiable. <br>  <br>  XBOX: Has more games then either system, but the least amount of exclusive games. Though it probably has more games because it's the system that has been out the longest. Biggest issue is the Red Ring Of Death, which means it's broken. But if under warranty can be fixed for free. You have to pay for online play. About 50 bucks a year. If you go with an xbox don't get the arcade version ($200) because it has no memory.|`|9nygTkHZaa	In my opinion, the Wii, while cheaper, was really not worth the time. I mean, it's next-generation, it's cool, and all, but after a while it just feels like a kids toy.<br>  The PS3 and XBOX are almost on the same level I'd say. Personally I would go for the XBOX because all my favorite games are on there, and plus with the update, and XBOX live, it's cool chatting with friends and playing.<br>  The PS3 I don't consider because it was way too expensive for me. It costs a bunch, and while the graphics are bleeding-edge (awesome), I just didn't like the price. For you, If you can't decide between XBOX and PS3, do some research on the games you like and then choose a console that has most of them|`|sSDJLUzOaa	ps3 although expensive the online is free and its hd graphics are amazing and it has more exclusives than anyother system plus killzone 2 and littlebigplanet are only on ps3 the ps3 has more action and shooter and more racing|`|yrBSkJKGaa	If you have children 12 and under, I would go with the Wii.  A really cool option on Wii is the ability to download (for a small price) older console games (from NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and N64) not available anywhere else:<br>  All the Super Mario games (SMB, SMB2, SMB3, Super mario 64, Super Mario World), plus many other cool games like DK Country 1, 2 and 3.  My 6 year old loves all of the Mario games, and at $5-10 a piece, it's well worth the money.  I have a PC for my shooter games and other 'big-kid' programs, so it's nice to play those old games with my kids.|`|10cf11353637f66f677c0fd0697091b7aa	you best bet is to go with a xbox 360. its only $200 now it has really amazing graphics. If you would want it for a family system then go with the Wii higher price then the 360 but really fun. ps3 has good graphics but its really a high price depends how much you want to spend.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|H8uCYaCaaa	better value for money is xbox 360 but u need live for the best stuff, best console is the ps3 tho|`|Bi43CSALaa	Wii is usually the cheapest. And it is innovative, too. Xbox 360 is good and has advantages when it comes to pirate games. PS3 is very expensive. There is no pirate games for it, yet. But games have best quality on PS3. You should take PS3, if you are willing to buy original games.|`|n8NBVCvnaa	Simple answer, look at the games the different systems offer, an what your friends have, so you can play online with them.
k5lfyMgNaa	It's not really a dance, they just make you do this stuff with a heart so you can make it special for your bear. <br>  <br>  It really depends on the employee who stuffs your bear. There are some people who make EVERYONE do it, there are some people who don't make you do it if you are older. <br>  <br>  If they ask you to, you can refuse to, and they might be like, "come on you have to" but if you really don't want to, just hand the heart to the employee. At that point, you are being so persistant they would look really mean to even try again. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you get a toned down version of it, and you only make a wish and kiss your heart or something. That isn't too bad. I personally leave older people who REALLY look like they don't want to alone.
