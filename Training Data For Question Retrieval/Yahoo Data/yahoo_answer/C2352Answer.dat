SIhxrxD3aa	Yes, there are a lot of scams out there.  Rule of thumb, if they ask you for a bank account or payment for the application, then it's a scam.<br>  <br>  Any application that you fill out through the university you're attending will be ligitimate.  Also, the website for federal grants and loans is legit, but there is a website with a similar name that is a scam.  To fill out the FAFSA make sure you go to <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov</a>  Make sure you're on the .gov website and not fafsa.com (a scam).|`|nNbE4WwVaa	I'm not sure where in the world you heard this, but a scholarship is money you receive from a foundation, the government, or the higher institution itself, not money that you give to anyone. <br>  <br>  A loan is money that you will receive from the school itself or from the government that you will eventually have to pay back because they let you "borrow" it to cover your costs based on your current financial situation.<br>  <br>  If you need a search engine to look for scholarships: Fastweb.com<br>  To determine your financial aid eligiblity for college, most institutions will need you to fill out the FAFSA (Federal Application for Student Aid) at www.fafsa.ed.gov<br>  <br>  Good luck on whatever it is that you will pursue in the future.
DorePwVOaa	Contrary to popular belief, most scholarships don't come from the internet or anywhere except from the college you go to. 90% of scholarships are given out by the colleges themselves. So the people you really should be talking to are the financial aid officers at Spelman. Here is their website: <a href="http://www.spelman.edu/students/prospective/scholarships/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spelman.edu/students/prospect...</a><br>  <br>  The January before you want to go off to school (which sounds like next January, in your case), you should fill out the FAFSA (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid): <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a><br>  <br>  Most schools require the FAFSA as a part of their financial aid process, and it looks like Spelman does. This will be your first step in receiving financial aid, both from the government and from the college. You can't fill it out early, though - the earliest it is available to you is January 1st of the year you're going to start college, unless you're going to start in the Spring of 2010, in which case you can fill it out now.<br>  <br>  This isn't to discourage you from looking for scholarships from websites and other outside sources, but keep in mind that less than 10% of scholarships come from those places. Only spend your time applying for the ones you are most qualified for, so that you don't waste your time on the other ones.|`|aR8fwFW8aa	She is right about the colleges giving you money.  That's where most of your scholarship aid comes from.  The rest will be offered as a result of the FAFSA, but part of it will probably be in the form of loans.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have a 3.917 college GPA and still can't get a scholarship, so it doesn't always help to have a high GPA - unfortunately.  Each school is different.  Apparently, my school is more interested in NEED and less interested in Academic merit.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	In most places, a school bus driver could not have a relationship with a student either.  To begin with, most students are underaged, which would put the bus driver at risk of statutory rape charges.  And then, even if the student were of age, there would be issues regarding the bus driver's authority if this were to occur.  <br>  <br>  However, there are additional reasons why it is not okay for a teacher to have a personal relationship with a student.  Teachers assign grades, and there is too much likelihood that there would be undue coercion of the student (the student could believe that if s/he were to say no to the teacher, her/his grade would suffer.  There is also a matter of fairness to the other students.  The bus driver only has to drive students back and forth to school, but a teacher should be giving attention to all students in class, and the existence of a relationship with one of the students could jeopardize that equality among students, since most teachers having relationships with students would naturally want to spend more time with those students.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	No adult can have a relationship with a child.|`|SlkAl1G2aa	Although there is no excuse for an adult coaxing a child into a relationship there is a difference.<br>  <br>  Teachers hold a power over students, and abusing this is immoral and wrong. Relationships aren't allowed because the teacher could exploit the relationship using the student's grades, homework assignments, etc.. Bus drivers do not have the same type of academic relationship.|`|z58jBAtGaa	If an adult is having a relationship with a kid, then it's wrong, immoral and illegal - whether it's a bus driver, teacher, crossing guard, coach....|`|H4dswqRlaa	I knew there was some reason why there are no seatbelts on buses.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I think the only thing you can do to increase your chances is to be willing to teach in places where no one else wants to be, so that should an opening come available, there will be less competition for it.  I've never heard that there were specific rules regarding how long one must pay one's dues, but wanting a fast track suggests that you aren't willing to pay yours.  There usually aren't any "rules" about having a Ph.D. either, but again, if there are a number of people in your area with Ph.Ds, you would be less competitive without one.  If you are in an area where they have a hard time finding acceptable administrators, they may be more flexible in selecting someone without a terminal degree.<br>  <br>  I also think that what you did in your prior career may or may not be helpful.  If you were a business executive who managed budgets and personnel for a large company, and budgets and personnel are big issues for your school district, then you may have skills which would be transferrable.  If your prior career was as a short-order cook or a mail carrier, it is more difficult to see how the skills you used on your previous job could be seen as relevant.

QoLL2ucGaa	No, teachers do not Google student essays. Some teachers have an online system that auto-checks student essays and auto-checks websites to see if sentences match, and then is reported back with a plaigarism (spelling) rating, from green (lowest chance of copying) to red (most likely copied)|`|IWSc7xkiaa	Some teachers do google, but they don't have to enter the whole essay. If a student has plagiarized it usually sends off a red flag. It's clear to us that you did not write the paper, usually due to sentence structure, vocabulary, and overall voice. Before I started using more advanced programs, I just looked for the sentences that were clearly created by someone else and googled them. I usually found the original source on the first try.<br>  <br>  Also, we don't check every single essay, because clearly, not every student attempts this. I guess having a nose for possible plagiarism is one of the gifts we English teachers are born with (of course, that's not to say that we don't make mistakes sometimes).|`|wD8ITWtOaa	If the essay is too good to be true then the school usually has software that can easily pick up on writing that is not all the student's work.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	No, they don't Google the whole essay, in most cases.  A lot of schools use programs like turnitin.com to check on student essays, which do look at every part of the paper, but if the teacher uses Google, s/he will probably pick certain sentences (either the beginning of the paper, random samples, or certain passages which the teacher believes don't look likely to have been written by the student).|`|C5E2liU8aa	I teach history and you better believe that I google parts of anything that is odd.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Stereotype and generalize much?<br>  <br>  In any given group, there are going to be people who are "weird".  Have you never met a weird public schooled child?  I sure have.  Does that mean that most of them are weird?  I think that THEY dress weird-following ridiculous fads instead of being individuals and expressing themselves.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You assume everyone who homeschools is like the whole two families who you have met?<br>  <br>  Says it all, really.

Perhaps they are very religious, like the Amish. I hope you are nicer to them in person than your comments here -- because imagine what they must think of regular school kids!! Why would they socialize with someone who thinks they're weird? <br>  <br>  Where I live, most of the families who homeschool have kids who are actors pursuing their careers, or those who don't like the public school environment and education and can do it better at home. These kids have no problems with social skills. Private schools cost $10,000 to $25,000+ a year in my area, too much for many families. Sometimes families homeschool for religious reasons.

He must be a nurse - you can do that in 4 years, but working in the ER takes extra training for nurses and doctors.  To become a doctor, the shortest program is 6 years (BS/MD) but most people do the BS and MD separately, so that's 8 years, and then you've got 3+ years of residency before you can start training for a specific field (like emergency medicine).  So the shortest amount of time to go from graduating high school to ER doc is about 10 years.|`|AA11635897	It takes a lot more than 4 years to be a doctor, its not true.

Adult learners are an absolute pleasure to teach.<br>  <br>  I have taught ESOL classes, you know second language learners and they were lovely.<br>  <br>  Now, I am teaching challenging 16-18 years old, but I can still cope.<br>  <br>  Would you like to come and observe my classes? Also, you can go around your local college and ask if you can observe classes there. This might paint a different picture for you.<br>  <br>  You are more than entitled to take a break from it, why not do your PGCE in service? We have vacancies where I work. The manager is a b.....but everything else is lovely.<br>  <br>  I am more than happy to offer more guidance if needed. I know how hard it is. Don 't stress my love though, it will get better. Happiness is THE most important thing in anyone's life.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself: what attracted you to the profession?<br>  <br>  I know you are not a quitter.

You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do.

I definitely think that it is a need. Some students in college live more than 10 mintues or whatever time from school. You need a car to get you there. A taxi can get expensive, and local buses may not always come when they are supposed to.

Applicants with legacy status, diversity status or athletic  recruit status. There isn't much a person can do about the first two statuses. These types of status  only come by birth. But a person can try to find a sport he or she enjoys and where he or she can truly  excel to the point of being recruited. The grades and test scores required of athletic recruits  are  extremely high by most colleges standards but not quite as high as  the standards facing everyone else  competing  for  admission to Harvard.  The rate of admission at Harvard was just over 7% last year and that is the lowest it has ever been:<br>  <a href="http://hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/resources/early2008statistics.html" rel="nofollow">http://hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/re...</a><br>  The admission statistics at Harvard and Yale Law School are even more demanding and far more stratified than at Harvard as an undergraduate. Athletic recruit status however is meaningless. I don't have the current figures for Harvard Law but at Yale Law,  23% of the current students either have a degree from Harvard or Yale.  Another 27.5% have a degree from 10 additional  universities: Stanford, Columbia, Princeton, Brown,  Berkeley,Dartmouth, Duke, Penn, Michigan, Williams College.  Just over  50% of the current students at Yale Law school  hold an  undergraduate degree from a dozen  Universities out  of maybe 2,000 universities in the US. <br>  However, these raw statistics do not inform us of the number of applicants with Yale Law legacy or diversity status from any of these institutions, so it might not be as meaningful to have graduated from Harvard or Yale  as the  raw data make it appear. A Yale Law Associate/Assistant Dean informed me at a Law School Fair that the chance for admission to Yale Law of a student with Yale Law legacy status was about 1 in 2.5, while the chance of admission for  all other applicants was about 1 in 27.5. <br>  From usafa's website and  great advice to prep for any highly selective university:<br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/academic_prep.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/leadership_prep.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  This is the College Prep curriculum required at Berkeley, UCLA and the  rest of the UC's.

Also, many of the "accredited" programs are not legitimate-check the accrediting board and where those accreditations are good at (you will be surprised).<br>  <br>  Many colleges actively recruit homeschoolers because of their ability to easily matriculate-homeschooling is more similar to college style learning than public school is.  <br>  <br>  Of course, higher level courses look better on a transcript (of course, if you have good grades in those higher level courses).  And college level courses will look much better than any of those so-called accredited institutions.  You will also, in that manner, already have college credits accrued-you may be able to start at a four year institution with enough credits to enter as a sophomore or junior.<br>  <br>  I am not saying to definitely avoid the accredited institutions-there ARE some good, legitimate ones if you choose to go that route.  Just do not do it based solely on those accreditations.  True homeschooling also offers much more freedom than they do, which is another thing to consider.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	Accreditation is an iffy subject and only means that the practices of the agency claiming accreditation conform to the accrediting agency's guidelines or standards.

ucYVpWWEaa	my god its like looking at myself last year i went to med link and found out it was a total waste of time... unless you like treating old people 24-7 and exams every 3 years and giving 40% of hard earned cash to the government and being woken up 3 in the morning . im aiming to do chemical engineering because i enjoy constructive hands on work with chemical science . and i want to become a petrol engineer because they rake in the dosh. <br>  <br>  the economics business and financial sector is a pretty boring sector in my opinion you'll find out when you study this in A2  but they pay is quite well. <br>  <br>  biochemistry and biology related degrees don't pay that well but are enjoyable worthwhile careers and so it would be worth looking into it. in general science degrees have high opportunity everywhere if your thinking of studying towards master or PH.D.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11635897	If your already struggling with chemistry, I think it's a sign that the sciences aren't for you. maybe your should try business or economics, they're both useful degrees, and while difficult, they're not nearly as difficult as science majors.|`|ouhv66YSaa	i think the best idea is to think to yourself,<br>  <br>  is it the career you want, could you see yourself doing that job?<br>  <br>  if yes its worth pursuing because its what you want at least then you will be happy.|`|XCtjuhujaa	i wud STRONGLY recommend u keep doing it bud<br>  <br>  xXx Matt xXx|`|SueMRdV8aa	Im in a similar boat to you. Having to compromise my life to pass chemistry and i got told even if i achieved all A's at alevel unless i had all A's+A*'s at GCSE id be wasting my time.<br>  <br>  So i looked into other courses similar there are many fields based around medicine... if thats what really interests you.<br>  <br>  one which i was told to look at was...<br>  <br>  Biomedical and Bimolecular Sciences <br>  <br>  to get on course you need ABB, Which is easier than AAA as the competition is so fierce for medicine|`|EAdZnaI6aa	TL;DR but money makes the world go round and the medical profession is a gold-mine.|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Most courses I've looked at have asked for bio, chem and maths. Economics is considered the same as maths so you'd have to stay at college another two years to get a maths A-Level. They generally ask for grade As although some I've looked at accept Bs for medecin. I suppose it's up to you. I think you're wasting your time staying on at college again. The sooner you can get it all over and done with, the better. Get yourself a university prospectus (you can get them online for free on som websites) and have a thorough look at the courses. You don't just have to do plain "business", there are loads of interesting courses that combine it with other things too.<br>  Hope this helps.x|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	If you have any doubts about dong medicine then it is not for you.

qbDPLkEQaa	It will require 11-13 years of additional schooling beyond high school.  That will stop most people from considering it.<br>  <br>  The academic requirements are difficult, and yes, you will put in a lot of hours studying in medical school.  After that will come your residency.  You'll still be studying, but your learning will become more and more practical, hands on. <br>  <br>  Honestly, based on what you wrote I'd say your command of the English language is in the lower third of all adults. You have fragmented sentences, subject-verb agreement errors, and more.  I think it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for you to even get into medical school.  If you're a science whiz--awesome.  It is the most important factor when applying for medical school, but you're still going to have to write application essays and pass oral interviews. And no matter how good you are at science, you'll be sure to be rejected if you cant write a cognizant essay!<br>  <br>  Lots of people drop out of medical school because it is too difficult, too time consuming, or too expensive--or because of all three.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Yes. Punctuation counts. In med school you will eat sleep and study,study,study. You better start hitting the books as you will need grades.

zhEXtbyRaa	No, you did not screw yourself as long as you get those grades up for the rest of high school! It may have ruined your chances at top colleges, but there are plenty of colleges out there who will still take you. I suspect that in the near future you (meaning most everybody) will need at least a bachelor's degree to pursue basically anything, it will become the new high school diploma- the bare minimum for a job as more and more people are going to college and pursuing even higher degrees. I can't stress the importance of going to college enough if you want to have a decent job. As long as you bring those grades up to par, you will be fine. Colleges don't really care about freshman grades anyways and you can even use this wake-up call as the basis of your college essays. Get your gpa up to a cumulative of at least a 2.8 (preferably at least a 3.0) cumulative by your junior year (which I don't think is hard at all if you pay attention in class and don't become distracted like the others you have mentioned) and you will get into college, even if it's some school no one's ever heard of. It doesn't really matter because you get the same degree in the end. But in conclusion, definitely get those grades up because as I see it, without a college degree you will be stuck, especially with the economy the way it is now employers will be looking for people who graduated from college. Good luck!
GSQzqhrkaa	Well, hiring these agents helps you atleast by not involving deeply in the application process. You are just required to fill in the application forms and submit your documents along with your transcripts and the rest of the charge is taken up by them.<br>  <br>  I personally would suggest you not to depend upon any one agent for getting your work done. It would be highly benificial for you if you could perform a bit of research as to which consultants are specialized for which country, their overall contacts in that country, past record and things like that. Above all I would just advise you to not to go by agents MARKET NAME, or popularity. <br>  <br>  If seeking higher education in UK / Australia, I would personally recommend <br>  1). AEC : Abroad Education Consultants<br>  2). TCC : The Combine Company<br>  <br>  All agents work good enough but these are my recommendations.<br>  <br>  Please note that these is just a recommendation.

zgTsCicNaa	1. They're still building the new road. They haven't finished it yet.<br>  <br>  ?|`|vV1hPhfWaa	1. correct<br>  2. This would only work if it's in third person omniscient narration.  But still correct<br>  3. Incorrect because you switched tenses.  They are building; They didn't finish.  It should be: They were building; They didn't finish<br>  4. This would only work if it's in third person omniscient narration like #2   you could also say: They're still building; They haven't finished<br>  5. Correct, but I would put "yet" at the end of the second sentance<br>  <br>  Generally when you use a conjugated form of the verb "do" (as in did, didn't, don't, does, etc)  you are talking about actions that have already happened.  So when you say they "ARE" (which is in the present tense) you want to follow with have or have not.|`|Bqc86DRQaa	NO!<br>  Who's "they" and, where's this "road"?|`|03e1b22ff05e6b64805763f168df8f5baa	I agree with Bob and Kat

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	It sounds unlikely, and I personally wouldn't want to be admitted to University College.  Basically, you have missed the deadline.  I think you will need to apply elsewhere and reapply later on, whether next year or the year after.|`|JbxrUJp2aa	Depends on how good of a student you are... Community college is not a good idea, transfer students hardly get accepted.
r1y8bBt1aa	I'm pretty sure you can, not sure about that specific college, you should check with them and see. But I don't recommend it, first year of college is hard enough, if you wait a semester, you'll have to catch up (some classes are only offered in the fall, so you'd have to wait until the next fall to take some)(at least that's how it is at my college). Plus, you will not get any scholarships or financial aid if you wait until spring, since scholarships/financial aid are given for an academic year (Fall and Spring semesters). If I may give you a suggestion, go to a community college your first year, next year, you still have time to be admitted, I know of a lot of community colleges that don't have deadlines until like May or June. Not only would you not get behind in your studies, but you'll save money, also, the adjusment from high school to a major university is rather difficult, my friend who went to a community college first did a lot better grade wise than I did (which I normally get way better grades than her, not trying to brag or anything).Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about college in general, I don't go to UF though, I go to Texas Tech.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	Check with their admissions office.  Some schools do, some don't.  It also depends on the program you're going into.  More structured programs often don't allow mid-year entries, because you can't take the spring classes without having had the fall classes.  However, supposing your program and school allow it, there is often room for spring admissions due to people dropping out or transferring after their first semester.|`|IddUYNR3aa	If you can't answer this yourself, you may not be ready for college. First you miss a deadline, then you need someone to do your research for you.

78TKhi84aa	1. I would point out that as your student they *do* have to listen to you, as their teacher. I would also mention anything in the school rules/policy about students showing staff respect and point out if they do not comply then you will have no option to take it further. Any threat you may make regarding their behaviour if they do not buck their ideas up you must follow through. If you don't then they will have even less respect for you and your authority. Don't be afraid to chat with other more experienced teachers about behaviour management techniques they use either.<br>  <br>  2. If this is the first time Shawn has done this then I'd let it go and give him the option to submit the work the next day. I'd point out the only reason I have been prepared to show him leniency is because you know he is usually a hard worker and you believe he made a genuine mistake and therefore can be sure it won't happen again.|`|If6Rv9Yvaa	1. I would tell him he needs to respect me as a teacher and maybe give him a warning the first time.<br>  <br>  2. I would let him turn it in the next day.|`|ORonhAuvaa	1. I would repeat my request, ignoring his response. I would continue to ignore it and repeat my response in a calm way until he did it. Also, if you have a student who is acting this way, move calmly closer. Do not respond emotionally at all. Finally, just stand quietly near him. I guarantee he will give in. He is trying to get attention and you shouldn't give it to him.<br>  <br>  2. Let him turn it in tomorrow. He has a good track record and that should be taken into consideration.|`|bImlg171aa	1. "*insert kid's name here*, you have two choices. You can either do what I just asked of you, or I can call down to the office and you can go have a chat with *insert principles name*. Then, tomorrow in class you can do what I asked of you."  My teacher did that...she's 27, and like, 5'5 and a boy at least 6 ft said, "I will not erase the board! I don't want to!" And she said, basically what I just wrote. <br>  <br>  2. I'd cut the kid a break. Mistakes are made...and high schoolers are under a lot of stress. I'd tell him that if he came in after school and did his homework, then showed it to me, this ONE time i'd give him his points back. He would have the option of making hte points up. My favorite teacher always cut students who always turned their homework in a little break every once in a while.
XmLJ84YBaa	Are people constantly calling her ugly to her face? This is harrasment. If this has been happening since high school your friend needs to learn some self-respect and stand up for herself. No one should have to put up with that kind of bullying especially at the college level. Is there more to this story? I really can't see lots of people on a college campus going around telling some girl she is ugly for no reason at all.|`|9OekzhWbaa	if it has been going on for that long then she is probably ugly.<br>  <br>  tell her that her personality is what really matters and if they dont lik her its there problem and some day shell find some one who wont call her ugly and will enjoy being around her for her not for looks.|`|2sXNuadxaa	I'd tell her to boost her confidence. People pick on those who look weak. Even if you're ugly, if you have a good personality people will like you.
8Awc3Zrxaa	As far as I know Rutgers do not require SAT II unless you do not have a high school diploma, so you don't have to if you want to. <br>  <br>  If you do, however, definitely take Math II because it's almost universal that you should. <br>  <br>  For the other one (or two), take either Physics or Chemistry because Columbia Engineering requires Math + Physics or Chemistry.<br>  <br>  Columbia only requires 2 but if you can go further if you want. These should be ones where you can get a decent score without putting so much work in because you do want to focus on SAT I and/or ACT. So it really depends on ur high school curriculum and interest.|`|fFvyAyHSaa	Chemistry and Math Level 2

rlKZ40fZaa	Hi, this is ones opinion; however, many people follow this tip because it improves brevity (conciseness).<br>  <br>  This is a tip which many Professional business writers employ because eliminating these linking verbs reduces the number of words while not sacrificing the sentence's meaning. Conciseness is imperative in business reports as the purpose of the report is to convey your ideas in as few words as possible.<br>  <br>  What this tip suggests is that these linking verbs, which convey the subject's state, are changed to action verbs as they provide more information to the sentence about the subject.<br>  <br>  <br>  In some cases, it is unavoidable to not use the linking verbs, but where it is avoidable, it is recommended by some.<br>  <br>  Personally, I try to prevent using these verbs frequently. But I do not refrain from them entirely.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any further questions, you can email me.|`|03e1b22ff05e6b64805763f168df8f5baa	the writing tips you recieved sound wrong|`|AbjC4p6aaa	the only thing I was tol was to avoid contractions AND the word got|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	perhaps the advice you were given was for formal writing (report or essay)<br>  most of the books i read are fiction, so those books can use the language pretty much as they see fit for the situation

k2Jbp9e6aa	I see the problem which is amplified by the fact that this is the first time the word "stage" is used. Since you have used the word "system" before, you could re-use it. e.g. "The system will return to where is was when the call was paused."|`|vfv7YqhPaa	insert the word *just* and ^before^. <br>  <br>  You will return to the same stage *just* a when the call was paused ^before^.|`|sUkRDeZmaa	No,  pls  omit  'as' .  If  I were  you I  would  write  like  this:<br>  <br>  You will  return  to  the  same stage  if  he  call  was  paused.<br>  <br>  good  luck!|`|GnpaF5TWaa	No|`|03e1b22ff05e6b64805763f168df8f5baa	no

JwpxsMhTaa	I was in retail (not management) and am now a teacher.  In my opinion, teaching is a far more rewarding career.  However, it is also more demanding.  Despite the time off, it is a career that you cannot leave at work.  While a retail management job may end at 5pm, I occasionally grade papers until 12 midnight and brainstorm my lesson plans in the shower.  If you are interested in having a family or have other commitments, teaching will be a bit harder.  If you want to go for the rewarding profession and take on the extra hours of work, go for it.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Right now teaching is probably a better option, since it's more stable and there are less lay offs than in retail management. Good Luck to you.|`|AA11251285	Teaching versus retail management:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos069.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos069.htm</a><br>  The link above will give you good data about teaching.<br>  <br>  Here's an excerpt:<br>  Seeing students develop new skills and gain an appreciation of knowledge and learning can be very rewarding. However, teaching may be frustrating when one is dealing with unmotivated or disrespectful students. Occasionally, teachers must cope with unruly behavior and violence in the schools. Teachers may experience stress in dealing with large classes, heavy workloads, or old schools that are run down and lack many modern amenities. Accountability standards also may increase stress levels, with teachers expected to produce students who are able to exhibit satisfactory performance on standardized tests in core subjects. Many teachers, particularly in public schools, are also frustrated by the lack of control they have over what they are required to teach.<br>  <br>  Teachers in private schools generally enjoy smaller class sizes and more control over establishing the curriculum and setting standards for performance and discipline. Their students also tend to be more motivated, since private schools can be selective in their admissions processes.<br>  <br>  Teachers are sometimes isolated from their colleagues because they work alone in a classroom of students. However, some schools allow teachers to work in teams and with mentors to enhance their professional development.<br>  <br>  Including school duties performed outside the classroom, many teachers work more than 40 hours a week.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regarding retail management,<br>  You’ll be busy working long hours, but it’s not too stressful unless your pay is related to how many items you sell.<br>  Here’s a link to that job description:<br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos025.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos025.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  <br>  Teaching is VERY difficult and stressful, but you get summers off and some nice breaks at Christmas & in the Spring.<br>  You won’t make a lot of money teaching though, and you can’t earn more by teaching better. With retail or sales, you can possibly earn more by selling more. I guess you’ll need to decide what is more important to you. If money is the main goal, then do not go into teaching.  If the type of work that teachers do is more interesting to you then retail, then you should choose that career.Also, do you value free time? Teachers get more free time in the summer, but they NEED that time off to get their brains & nervous systems back into good shape.
dUeDmb7raa	yea its illegal<br>  <br>  <br>  they take that stuff seriously<br>  <br>  <br>  a guy at my high school did that and the cops got involved. he got charge with harrassment and had to go to court, and got expelled from school<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, that's considered a threat.  In college, it could get you expelled and turned over the to the police.  You're definitely getting in trouble for that.  That was stupid.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Run|`|V13RIF6Kaa	It depends slighly on what you said. Were you threatening? Imply untruthful statements (slander her name)? <br>  <br>  Basically, you're in trouble.<br>  <br>  While it might not harm you legally, you may have a big issue on your hands academically. There's a good chance you'll be suspended/expelled and quite possibly have a note put on your file/transcript depending on what level you're in educationally wise. <br>  <br>  If you're in postsecondary... don't be surprised if you're transcript gets marked and you have huge difficulties getting into a new school.|`|3jwXB5araa	LMFAO!!! i doubt your teacher can do that unless he or she gets assistance or is a Computer teacher.|`|GSf09ALBaa	SO, what should you do?  Take responsibility for your actions.|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	you should have used a wifi hot spot. it would be harder to track you.|`|m9rK9dT6aa	Two words....<br>  Your screwed|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	smart one  but here's what you can do if the teacher is tracking you without the Polices help it is illegal so if you go to court all you have to do is tell them what you know. and BTW it's the 1st amendment freedom of speech.|`|7XJPyENFaa	You should apologize and try to make it seem as sincere as possible (but don't use any words you don't normally use in class, or he/she might not believe you).  And don't use emoticons.  I've found that most teachers hate them.|`|339NqJ84aa	OK, cussing is not illegal... but if you threatened your teacher in anyway then you will prob. get into trouble. Next time, use the computers in the library!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe reconfigure your proxy?|`|BV2e9M5saa	Well, right now, the only thing you can do. Confess it was you, rather then your school finding out you were the one that sent it to avoid more trouble. Then I guess, apologize...the only thing you can really do.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Well even if you don't get in legal trouble, you're screwed in the class.  You got instant-fail pretty much, good job, think twice before you act.|`|bImlg171aa	what did the email say? It depends on how bad it was|`|62TrH5Nqaa	say someone hacked into ur computer lol...|`|R7DnAPMAaa	what did you say xD<br>  <br>  <br>  come clean and apologise :) <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s say im sorry like 50 times xD|`|EXlXNHuQaa	well you should have thought of that earlier. you are in BIG trouble.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  FOOL|`|fN8Js8aeaa	NO, its NOT illegal.  "Freedom of Speech," so you're fine..You're allowed to have your own opinion, she has NO reason to come to your house, that's kinda desperate..if you really need to, make up a lie, like one of your friends or siblings was doing that as a joke, and it wasn't you.  Good Luck =]|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	run!!!|`|DWit98Spaa	What moron said that Freedom of Speech falls under the 6th Amendment? My gosh...kids need to stay in school. <br>  <br>  And you're not protected under the "6th amendment" freedom of speech if you were harassing or verbally assaulting him/her. You could easily be expelled with possible criminal charges. <br>  <br>  ...|`|olf8FWNFaa	wat exactly did you say??|`|8Rg4WODraa	HAHAHAHA!!!<br>  <br>  You should've used some defenses.<br>  I can't believe the n00bishness I'm seeing here.<br>  <br>  And I doubt your teacher has the capabilities to track your IP address... unless he/she got the school's tech guy involved.<br>  <br>  Basically, your situation is summed up in one word:<br>  <br>  PWNED|`|yHaGnT4gaa	you are screwed|`|P3OWfxi5aa	yes that is bad<br>  ur gonna be in deep **** if you get caught|`|xNhNRJrBaa	u r in some deep ****!<br>  you could get a fine for threat|`|1KFuNgyiaa	No, it's not illegal to cuss at anyone. Unless you made a death threat or something you should be fine, legally. I'm sure your teacher won't be too happy with you though.|`|niYixDU4aa	freedom of speech...it's not illegal.  but hahahaha you are really screwed.  you might get suspended and your teacher will hate you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  wait did you threat?|`|1aI1FSuAaa	hahaha i dont think the teacher could find out your i.p through an email, if there were no threats youll be fine away.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	Send an I love you im sorry email|`|AjTKb5Icaa	That's a felony I think. To "bully" someone over the internet...<br>  OH SH*T what are you gonna do?<br>  That sucks!<br>  FUUUUU*K!|`|HtyUrjrFaa	LOL. Not a good idea to yell at your teacher through email. Did you say anything which can lead them to know it was you? <br>  <br>  I don't know if schools have a protocol if something like this happens but there is a good chance that if you are found out you'll be suspended for a few days and your parents will be told. <br>  <br>  It's not "illegal" per say, but you will be tracked I'm sure.|`|usm8T4xhaa	HAHAHA yup ur screwed. Depends what you said. U coulda approached the situation differently, but u were obviously pissed off. I don't know much about tracking IP addresses. i know it can be done, but it might be  hard or expensive. If u threatened her, then they might be taking it seriously. If it was just an angry email, hell i dunno. You might get into trouble, but again it depends what u said, how old u are, and what could happen. <br>  <br>  If I knew I was gonna get into BIG trouble, I would approach the teacher. If not, I'd ignore it.|`|PJ7jzS9iaa	Okay girl so heres the story.<br>  Have you ever read the rights of the United States of America Constitution<br>  <br>  In one of the amendments i think the 6th it says<br>  FREEDOM OF SPEECH<br>  <br>  so if that teach is like blablalblbalbalbalbalbabla YOUCUSSED ME OUT! <br>  you impress her<br>  with the 6th amendment<br>  cause that really is true<br>  i swear.<br>  but<br>  Apologize and be polite<br>  and what did you even say to the poor lady?<br>  Cuz wow.<br>  hope the bell's could help ya<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  bella|`|x8loZIvEaa	lol thats great|`|tKLRnGiaaa	yeahh you really thought that one through, idiot|`|x6oAKWe6aa	It doesn't matter whether it was illegal or not the code used for school violations is different from the law. They can probably suspend you or expel you.<br>  <br>  That being said...maybe she is just saying she's going to trace it to see who gets nervous.|`|RjgUymUSaa	Yeah it is considered viral or online bullying and it is illegal. Say you were mad or something and you were fed up with her. maybe she isnt even worried about it and she doesnt care.|`|F2D1W4Kpaa	i really don't know, but here are some tips:<br>  <br>  1) Tell her the truth, and apologize to her!<br>  <br>  2) say sorry 1 million times!!!!!<br>  <br>  3) RUN AWAY FROM HOME/SCHOOL!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, you are SOOOOOOOO screwed!|`|ETNfE3nxaa	Its not illegal, but she can get you in trouble through your parents or through the principal. Your pretty screwed, and this could possibly go on your permanent record. Thats too bad...<br>  Your screwed.|`|V9bejh2baa	Here's some advice, <br>  Start kissing ***, you go and starting sucking up to that teacher like you've never sucked before! <br>  (Please don't take this literally).|`|PBjFc7I0aa	your screwed at the moment next time try using a IP shield like: www.torproject.org|`|FBaHcWMlaa	it's not illegal , but you will get into serious trouble .<br>  smart xD|`|0ysJ0KHWaa	its not illegal to cuss anyone out
HJbqA4hkaa	Sweetie, public colleges are only a good deal if you live in state!! So look at your own state schools.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I'm probably a little biased, because I have an MBA, a Ph.D., and a J.D., but while it may not be "necessary", in the strictest sense of the word, if you can afford it and this would satisfy both who you want to be and what you want to do in life, go for it.  It sounds like your reasons for this are good - I know that I had to question both whether I was trying to avoid something else in life and whether I was trying to compete with my sister as I got my later degrees.  If this is what will satisfy you, why not?|`|JnMnd5hsaa	My cousin had the same problem.<br>  <br>   I would say that getting the masters degree would be a lot of school. But it  opens your world to a new level of great jobs. Being a corporate lawyer would be an awesome opportunity for you. <br>  <br>  About the money problem, a lot of people have the same problem. I think that the best thing to do before you go to get a masters agree, is save some money in a bank account.|`|zOCnMpOVaa	I think you should go cause you'd be learning more and it would help you futher in life in what you want to be right. And if you have the chance then go.|`|D8OzQwXKaa	Yes you can never get enough preparation and the higher the degree, the better. it show your dedication and commitment...|`|9Ijv5Mppaa	I'm sure other people will think that, but if you enjoy learning or this amount of schooling is necessary to your future career, then it's not. If it's something you want to do, it's not unnecessary.

S1Xq18WKaa	To answer this question we need to consult our knowledge of genetics. Geneticists use the Punett square to answer a question such as this. We let two variables represent each trait, in this case we will let A be representative of the human trait and B be representative of the vampire trait.<br>  <br>  Using the square (imagine lines between the variables) we get . . .<br>  <br>                  A                B<br>  <br>  A             AA              AB<br>  <br>  B             AB              BB<br>  <br>  <br>  The AA child would be fully human, the two AB children would be part human and part vampire, and the BB child would be fully vampire. <br>  <br>  - 1 in 4 or 25% chance of a fully human child.<br>  - 1 in 4 or 25% chance of a fully vampire child.<br>  - 1 in 2 or 50% chance of a part-human/part-vampire child.|`|H3b2r9Zfaa	Well they will have a dominant gene and a recessive gene from the mother and father wich means half of both from mom and dad,like half vampire and half whatever the other opposite sex is EG Human!<br>  <br>  <br>  Its quite simple Biology really let me give you an example i am an Asian and if i was to mate with a white (no offense) my child with come out half white and half asian (Bengali) with a bit of both genes from the mother and father.|`|6cN2sIYcaa	Use a punnett square.

AA11310052	i'm currently doing pre-requisites. It really depends on what the schools degree plan is cause alot of schools are different. if you're going to community college though usually the pre-requisites that are needed (at least in Texas where i live) are:<br>  <br>  2 semesters of Chemistry<br>  2 Semesters of Anatomy and Physiology<br>  1 semester of Microbiology<br>  Philosophy<br>  Ethics<br>  psychology<br>  Developmental psychology<br>  sociology<br>  2 semesters of History<br>  2 semesters of English<br>  2 semesters of Government<br>  <br>  That's usually just for community colleges which offer a LPN-ASN<br>  then when you get accepted to nursing school after all that you take regular nursing courses. Then when you want to go for your RN, again depending on what school you go to, you need a couple of Biology classes and some elective courses and you go to nursing school a little longer. I would recommend finding out what pre-requisites you need for an RN degree and just get all of those out of the way.<br>  There are many different routes you can take to become an RN. at the end of this semester i will have 74 credits. I took every pre-requisite i needed to become an RN. In the fall i'm going to nursing school to get my LVN-ADN degree at a community college then i'm going to a big university to get my RN degree. I dont know about the midwest but in Texas most LVN's start out at around 40,000 but it all depends on what you work. My friend is an LVN working Med-Surg and he made 100,000 last year because he worked six days a week, nights (which pay differential), and holidays. RN's make around 60k a year depending on the job and what type of facility (hospital, clinic etc) .I'm going for my NP (masters degree) in med-surge.

KsaaEZqHaa	Newton's three laws of motion:<br>  <br>  1. Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. <br>  <br>  2. The relationship between an object's mass m, its acceleration a, and the applied force F is F = ma. Acceleration and force are vectors (as indicated by their symbols being displayed in slant bold font); in this law the direction of the force vector is the same as the direction of the acceleration vector. <br>  <br>  3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.|`|PSL8nb8laa	newton has three laws:<br>  <br>  First law<br>      There exists a set of inertial reference frames relative to which all particles with no net force acting on them will move without change in their velocity. This law is often simplified as "A body persists its state of rest or of uniform motion unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force." Newton's first law is often referred to as the law of inertia.<br>  <br>  Second law<br>      Observed from an inertial reference frame, the net force on a particle of constant mass is proportional to the time rate of change of its linear momentum: F = d(mv)/dt. This law is often stated as, "Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)": the net force on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.<br>  <br>  Third law<br>      Whenever a particle A exerts a force on another particle B, B simultaneously exerts a force on A with the same magnitude in the opposite direction. The strong form of the law further postulates that these two forces act along the same line. This law is often simplified into the sentence, "To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."|`|FvYqKZSMaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_la...</a>|`|5JWaPIs0aa	there are three laws. First laws says that a thing in motion stays in motion until disturbed by another thing. the second Law says that elevation helps the acceleration because of the gravity pull on a thing. The third Law says that an action has an equal and an opposite reaction.

Unfortunately in some cases despite the law the good samaritan has been successfully sued for damages.  It can be a judgement call as to how life-threatening the situation/injury is.

If a large percentage of the student body is involved in the Greek system, it may be of an advantage to you. If not, you can probably make friends outside of sororities. Also, <br>  2. is the Greek system exclusive? if you go to a school where there is no social life outside of frats or the frat parties are only for Greeks it can be difficult to have a vibrant social life without being a member of an organization.<br>  3. are you a party animal? if you are not then don't worry about joining a greek system!<br>  4. is it tough for you to make friends, in general? if it is then it might be great for you to join a sorority! it is an awesome way to make guaranteed friends!<br>  There are all different types of sororities.

When it comes to pledging you have to learn all about the sorority (dates, names, history etc.) and they give you an exam,<br>  <br>  The first year most people are struggling just trying to balance school, responsibilities, and a social life all at the same time.

Or at lease tell her that you will hold her back if her grades do not aprove by the end of the year.

Sundiata, similarly, is a story about a strong and talented young boy becoming King of Mali in approximately 1230. <br>  Both Arthur and Sundiata, went thad somewhat rough childhoods. Arthur was taken from his mother the day he was born and given to another woman raise.  Even though she raised him well, she treated him as the lesser of her two sons. Sundiata was a young prince who could not even walk properly, and because of this was subject to many malicious jokes. His mother treated him hideously, and because of this, he escaped to neighboring Ghana, and grew up there.  Once he was a man, he returned to Mali, only to find that it had been taken over by Sourmaoro, the king of Sosso, <br>  <br>  Despite their similarities, both Arthur and Sundiata differ in some aspects. Once Arthur became King of Britain, he was content to settle his court at Camelot and stay there with his knights, playing at jousting and sword fighting. Sundiata, on the other hand, was concerned with rescuing his country and family from the tyrannous sorcerer. Sundiata was not concerned with  chivalry or being valiant; he wanted his kingdom to be safe and secure.<br>  <br>  A hero is someone who gives up everything of value to save someone elsel. Sir Lancelot was a hero in the way he saved sixty-four prisoners by his victory over Sir Tarquine, as well as the many other perilous endeavors he endured. However, Sir Lancelot did those things not out of pure love and a willingness to help another human being, but because he would be remembered for the rest of time. Sir Lancelot wanted to be known as the daring and audacious knight who fought with the most terrifying of knights, who and saved damsels in distress. <br>  <br>  Sundiata, on the other hand, did not care about his name being written in the history books. Sundiata believed that it was his responsibility to conquer the cruel sorcerer Soumaoro, who had taken over his country. Soumaoro had also captured Balla Fasséké, Sundiata’s griot .  At a time when the people of Mali could not read or write, the griot was a sort of living history book who recalled for the court the great deeds of the past and recited the country’s tradition and laws.   Sourmaoro had also captured Sundiata’s half-sister, Nana Triban. Sundiata was prepared to surrender whatever it took to liberate his country and save his half-sister and griot, even at his own expense. <br>  <br>  In a comparison of Sir Lancelot and Sundiata, Sundiata is more of a hero than Sir Lancelot. Sundiata did not wage war on the evil sorcerer to gain anything for himself; all he sought was the welfare of his family and his country.<br>  <br>  Both men had strong qualities of strength and kindness. Even though Sir Lancelot did those valiant things for the wrong reasons; he was still chivalrous and charming all the same.<br>  <br>  Both stories have an abundance of magic woven through the plot. In the legend of Sundiata, magic shows itself first in the form of soothsayer's telling Sundiata to sacrifice a hundred white bulls, a hundred white rams, and a hundred white cocks in order to defeat Soumaoro’s magic.. The second time tuse of magic occurs when Nana Triban  tells  Sundiata that she flattered Soumaoro into telling her which jinn, or genie, protects him and gives his arm the “strength of ten arms”. She tells Sundaita that  Soumaoro took her into his magic chamber and told her everything. <br>  <br>  In Le Morte d’ Arthur magic is the platform upon which the entire plot is written. In fact, even while out of the limelight, Merlin controls most of the plot, is Merlin. He is always in the right position at the correct moment, waiting to turn things the way he wants them. An early use of magic in Le Morte d’ Arthur is how Merlin arranged for King Uther to masquerade as the Duke of Tintagil so as to deceive Lady Igraine into conceiving Arthur with him. Another use of magic occurs when Morgan le Fey, Queen of Gore, and her companions (the Queens of north Galys, of Estelonde, and of the Outer Isles),  see Sir Lancelot.  Each wants him for her own. Morgan le Fey then casts a spell over Sir Lancelot so that he remains asleep while they take him to her castle and make him their prisoner. The Queens then obliged him to take one of them as his mistress or remain a in his cell.<br>  <br>  The courageous exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, compared to the astonishing things that Kamara and Kamandjan did, were more dangerous, violent, and gallant. Kamara and Kamandjan performed amazing things to give Sundiata’s troops hope. King Arthur’s knights, however, saved many people from the dangers and perils which were so abundant during King Arthur’s age. <br>  <br>  The feats of Kamara and Kamandjan, on the other hand, were completely unrealistic. Kamara bore down on a great mahogany tree and with one stroke of his sword, splitting the giant tree in two.  Even more unrealistic is Kamandjan's piercing a tunnel through the Mountain of Sibi. The exploits of the Knights of the Round Table’s were realistic, but the ways in which they did them were not. One example of this is when Sir Lancelot defeated the second giant at the castle of Tintagil; Sir Lancelot “drew abreast of the giant and struck him on the shoulder with a blow that carried through to the navel, and the giant dropped dead.” That is impossible. <br>  <br>  The relationships between men and women vary strongly in the two tales. In Le Morte d’ Arthur, the women were most often the damsels in distress, for whom the strong and valiant knights appear dashing and chivalrous. On the other hand, in Sundiata Nana, Triban played a strong role in the way she deceived the evil sorcerer and saved herself and Balla Fasséké from the sorcerer’s hold. Nana Triban was a woman the king looked up to -- not because he could save her for his own glory, but because she was a strong woman he was proud to be related to.<br>  <br>  Most of the pictures in Le Morte d’ Arthur are paintings, while most of the pictures in Sundiata are pictures of sculptures from the era of its composition. The paintings of Le Morte d’ Arthur romanticize the era of King Arthur with beautiful and graceful horses, strong and dashing men, and pale and lovely women.|`|YMehaPY5aa	COMPARING AND CONTRASTING SELECTIONS: LE MORTE D’ ARTHUR AND SUNDIATA<br>  <br>  Le Morte d’ Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory is a tale written in the 15th century about a boy’s rise to King of all Britain, and the events and people that helped him get there; Sundiata, similarly, was a story about a strong and talented young boy becoming King of Mali in approximately 1230.

Sundiata, on the other hand, was concerned with rescuing his country and family from the tyrannous sorcerer. Sundiata was not worried with if his people thought he was chivalrous or valiant, all he wanted was for his kingdom to be safe and secure.<br>  <br>  A hero is someone who gives up everything that is of any value to save someone else from anything that might be harmful. Sir Lancelot was a hero in the way that he saved sixty-four prisoners because of his victory over Sir Tarquine, as well as the many other perilous endeavors he endured. However, Sir Lancelot did those things not out of pure love and a willingness to help another human being, but he did those things so that he would be remembered for the rest of time.

Both men had strong qualities of strength and kindness, even though Sir Lancelot did those valiant things for the wrong reasons; he was still chivalrous and charming all the same.<br>  <br>  In the terms of magic, both stories have an abundance of magic woven through the plot. In the legend of Sundiata, magic shows itself first in the form of soothsayers, telling Sundiata to sacrifice a hundred white bulls, a hundred white rams, and a hundred white cocks in order to defeat Soumaoro’s plentiful magical powers. The second time the reader sees magic is when Nana Triban is informing Sundiata of when she flattered Soumaoro into telling her which jinn, or genie, protects him and gives his arm the “strength of ten arms”. She then goes on to explain that Soumaoro took her into his magic chamber and told her everything. However, in Le Morte d’ Arthur magic is the platform upon which the entire plot is written. One of the main characters, who while not necessarily being in the lime light of the story controls most of the plot, is Merlin. Throughout the story, Merlin is always in the right position at the correct moment, waiting to turn things the way he wants them. One tiny example of magic in Le Morte d’ Arthur is how Merlin arranged for King Uther to masquerade as the Duke of Tintagil so as to deceive Lady Igraine into conceiving Arthur with him. There is another place where magic is seen, and that is when Morgan le Fey, Queen of Gore, and her companions the queens of north Galys, of Estelonde, and of the Outer Isles see Sir Lancelot and each wants him for her own. Morgan le Fey then casts a spell over Sir Lancelot so that he remains asleep while they take him to her castle and make him their prisoner. The Queens then obliged him to take one of them as his mistress, or he could stay in the cell where they held him prisoner.<br>  <br>  The courageous exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, compared to the astonishing things that Kamara and Kamandjan did, were more dangerous, violent, and gallant. Kamara and Kamandjan performed amazing things to give Sundiata’s troops hope. King Arthur’s knights, however, saved many people from the dangers and perils of which were abundantly present during King Arthur’s age. The feats of Kamara and Kamandjan, on the other hand, were completely unrealistic. Kamara bore down on a great mahogany tree and with one stroke of his sword, split the giant tree in two; this amazing action is somewhat realistic. However, Kamandjan pierced a tunnel through the Mountain of Sibi, which is completely and utterly unrealistic. The Knights of the Roundtable’s exploits were realistic, but the ways they did them were not. One example of this is when Sir Lancelot defeated the second giant at the castle of Tintagil; Sir Lancelot “drew abreast of the giant and struck him on the shoulder with a blow that<br>  carried through to the navel, and the giant dropped dead.” That is impossible. The relationships between men and women vary strongly in the two tales. In Le Morte d’ Arthur, the women were most often the damsels in distress, whom the strong and valiant knights had the opportunity save and appear dashing and chivalrous. On the other hand, in Sundiata Nana Triban played a very strong role in which she deceived the evil sorcerer and saved herself and Balla Fasséké from the sorcerer’s hold. Nana Triban was a woman that the king looked up too, not necessarily because he could save her and receive glory, but because she was a strong woman whom he was proud to be related to.<br>  <br>  Most of the pictures in Le Morte d’ Arthur are paintings, while most of the pictures in Sundiata are pictures of sculptures from the era from whence it was wrote. The paintings of Le Morte d’ Arthur romanticize the era of King Arthur with beautiful and graceful horses, strong and dashing men, and pale and lovely women.<br>  <br>  The sculptures of Sundiata have more to do with war; the two sculptures included in the story depict a sofa (a soldier or warrior). Both strong and courageous, these sculptures tell the reader about the history of Mali. The strength and determination it took to survive, to keep their history alive, and not to let themselves be occupied by another country. While pictures from both stories represent the theme and feeling of the story, the beautiful paintings in Le Morte d’ Arthur do a much better job of helping the reader understand what Sir Thomas Malory is trying portray. While these paintings portray an image of 15th century Britain that is perhaps not wholly correct, they are a beautiful interpretation of Le Morte d’ Arthur in all of its grandeur.<br>  <br>  Le Morte d’ Arthur and Sundiata are both stories about boys turning into men, good against evil, and they both portray human nature at its finest. Arthur and Sundiata are very similar, their rise to the top of the social ladder, how the were treated as young boys, and how they were nearly nothing before they became kings. However, they are also very dissimilar; for example, their morals, their outlook on life, and the basis of their character are entirely different. Arthur and his Knights are more heroic and brave, and Sundiata is more focused on getting things done. The women of both stories played rather large roles, either as strong characters, as in Sundiata, or characters who were their purely to be saved, as in Le Morte d’ Arthur. <br>  <br>  Magic was rather abundant, as both stories based on soothsayers, evil sorcerers, nice wizards, prophesies, and enchantments. It is seen more in Le Morte d’ Arthur than in Sundiata purely because one of the main characters is a wizard. Both stories are fantastic stories that keeps and holds the reader’s attention, with dramatic battles and amazing events that are flabbergasting.|`|yM3QtXgPaa	O MY GOSH!!!!

AA10176626	Leei:<br>  <br>  At Harvard, like many of the other elite and very expensive schools, the bulk of financial aid received by the students is institutional aid, rather than federal student aid.<br>  <br>  Harvard has a considerable endowment fund (though they've lost billions in the current economy), and the investment of those funds enables the school to provide an affordable education for every student who is admitted.<br>  <br>  If you are admitted, and you and your parents don't have the money to pay for a Harvard education, your expenses will be taken care of.<br>  <br>  If your parents have a total annual income of less than $60,000, you will pay nothing to attend Harvard.<br>  <br>  If your parents make between $60,000 and $180,000, they would typically be asked to pay just 10% of their income for your school expenses.<br>  <br>  By the way, part of Harvard's financial aid package includes an expectation that you will work 10-12 hours a week during the school year.<br>  <br>  So - your biggest worry is getting IN to Harvard - once you get in - the money is absolutely taken care of for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I hope this encourages you a bit.

We have a large number of students that have transferred from a public school and have found success doing school from home.<br>  <br>  As far as the social aspects you can look into the programs offered at the local ymca, and in regards to a homeschool try doing an internet search for homeschool group with your town name.

There are many online communities regarding home schooling. Google should help you out here.<br>  <br>  17 is a very late age to start home schooling. Nothing wrong with that, but its late. Ask your daughter what she would have covered in class this year. Determine whats good and what offends you. <br>  <br>  At 17, she should be thinking about some sort of advanced literature (reading shakespeare, romanticist poets, etc), math should be based on what she left at. Ditto science, but you can always go with environmental studies, and it makes for interesting home labs. Philosophy (Kant, Descartes, Acquinas).<br>  <br>  You should focus less on what she SHOULD think, but HOW to think. Critical thinking starts at around her age. She needs to know the basics or reading, writing, math, history, and social studies, but critical thinking is really important. Dont tell her what she SHOULD believe as much as get her to examine topics and form her own belief. She will love you for doing so as she grows up.<br>  <br>  If you are christian, jewish, muslim, or hindu, start with a good foundation in your beliefs, and get her to comparatively analyze the other beliefs, not in a way that attacks the others, but just so she learns the difference.<br>  <br>  Reading the news online, and reporting on major events is also good.<br>  <br>  For example, Iraq. Document the history of the USA with Iraq since the 1960's. Its interesting to learn our past with that country!<br>  <br>  Good luck though.|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	I do online school: Primavera<br>  IDK|`|KmBdh2CRaa	Every state has free homeschooling resources<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/freehomeschool" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/freehomeschool</a><br>  <br>  Also, there's no need to go out and get new friends, just because she' s homeschooling.

AA10176626	Esther:<br>  <br>  Students who can't afford their chosen school have several options for financial assistance.<br>  <br>  Far and away the most available of these options is the federal student aid program. The US Department of Education provides billions of dollars in aid to more than 9 million US college students every year. The government's programs include need-based aid, for students who demonstrate "exceptional need", and the Stafford lending program, the best educational loan available anywhere. <br>  <br>  Students who are interested in federal student aid must apply by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA. You can find the FAFSA at its one and only 'official' website - here: <a href="http://fafsa.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://fafsa.ed.gov</a><br>  <br>  Federal student aid is limited - after all, it is an "assistance" program, and not a payment program. The student aid system operates from the premise that the student and his/her parents are primarily responsible for the cost of higher education.<br>  <br>  Many schools are able to supplement the federal aid programs with their own "institutional" aid. These programs are designed to help students make up more of the difference between the Cost of Attendance, and the available federal aid. The more elite and expensive schools tend to have more of these types of funds available.<br>  <br>  Several states have financial aid programs of their own - examples include Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship, New York's Tuition Assistance Program, California's CalGrant, and Georgia's HOPE Grant.<br>  <br>  Finally, for those students who still find themselves short after applying for all possible forms of financial aid, there are the so-called "alternative" or "private" educational loans. For many years, these loans were a popular option that allowed students to borrow their way through schools that they otherwise would not have been able to afford.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the worldwide banking and lending crisis has put an end to the world of easy educational borrowing. Students loans are always high risk loans - even in the best of economic environments, and very few lenders are still accepting private educational loan applications at the present time. <br>  <br>  The few lenders that are making these types of loans are making them very conservatively. If you have experienced a difficult time getting approved for a loan with one particular lender, there's really not much point in "shopping around" - all of the lenders are scrutinizing student loan applications VERY carefully, and it is nearly impossible for an average student to be approved for a big dollar student loan without a cosigner. No one will be able to tell you where you can get an "easy" student loan from a legitimate lender.<br>  <br>  Because the private loan option has been pretty much removed from the menu of readily available education funding solutions, students are really in a bind. I am afraid that there is only ONE really good solution, and it's a solution that very few students want to hear.<br>  <br>  With private loans out of the equation, a student must "shop" for a school that he/she can actually afford. If your funds, plus the available financial aid, leave you several thousands of dollars short of what it will cost for you to attend a particular school - you're applying to the wrong schools. I don't shop at the Lamborghini dealer, because I know I'll be tens of thousands of dollars short of being able to afford a Lamborghini. Students who will be tens of thousands of dollars short of the ability to afford Lamborghini University should not be "shopping" there, either.<br>  <br>  There are no other solutions to your problem. If you have applied for the full complement of available financial aid - and you don't have a cosigner for your loan - you will not be able to afford this particular school, and you will need to select a second or third favorite option.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the disappointing news.|`|AA11635897	in that situation they usually take a few years off and work several jobs to save up money for college, then when they can afford it they start.

AA10176626	Nathan:<br>  <br>  If you are asking about money for "living expenses" while you are attending college, then, yes, financial aid is intended to assist students with the cost of food, shelter, and expenses that are directly related to the cost of attending college.<br>  <br>  There are no forms of financial aid that are designed to buy you clothes, pay your credit card bills, subscribe to DirecTV, and buy a Playstation 3 - none of those expenses are "college expenses".<br>  <br>  If you are asking the more general question - whether the government gives people money to pay their living expenses - again, the answer is "yes", but the yes is a very qualified "yes".<br>  <br>  The federal and state governments offer a series of government benefit programs designed to help very poor people survive. Most of these programs are called "means-tested" benefits, which simply means that eligibility is based on the applicant's very low income and very minimal assets.<br>  <br>  You have heard of many of these programs - they're things like Food Stamps, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (formerly known as 'welfare'), and WIC, the special supplementary nutritional program for women and small children.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in those programs, visit <a href="http://www.govbenefits.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.govbenefits.gov</a> for all of the details.<br>  <br>  I think you're really asking about aid for college students - and so the answer is as I explained it. Aid is available to assist college students with the cost of their housing, food and miscellaneous educational expenses. Aid is NOT available for non-school expenses. There are no programs that will pass along a few hundred dollars of "spending money" for college students, so that they concentrate on school and not have to worry about the price of movie tickets and happy hour.<br>  <br>  When you apply for federal student aid - by completing the FAFSA - your financial aid need will be analyzed incorporating the cost of your room and board, as well as tuition, fees and books. You will receive whatever aid your school can provide, based on your EFC score, and based on the school's available funds. <br>  <br>  There are no other, special applications for "living expense" financial aid.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped. Good luck.|`|QYXFai9Kaa	yes, there are financial assistance and scholarships covering your entire tuition and living expenses. the amount may be sufficient for a good independent living, including an apt and a car.
xT201PPpaa	3. The US joined WWII was to support our allies. (France and Great Britain) It also was because it would pull us out of the Depression. I just learned in my history class that WWII had the highest percentage of acceptance from the American citizens. Something else that us into the war was the "lend-lease". Lending supplies to the allies. We wanted into the war because we were "Pro-democrasy" and we didn't like the "Axis Powers".

Wilson had a 'neutral' attitude during the beginning of the war. It wasn't until a German U-boat sank a ship that had Americans on it that America became involved in the war. Because the US joined the war more women began working jobs that men used to. Women began to gain the idea that they should have the right to vote. This led to women gaining the right to vote.

XLKrrkKvaa	First you have to obtain a Bachelor's Degree with a major in English, then a secondary teaching credential which takes an additional year, You have to teach for a few years then apply for an administrative credential or MS in administration. Meanwhile you will have to find a job teaching, then learn to work with teachers while working on your administrator credential, learn the politics of your school district and then apply for the job of principal. I would say if you get on a fast track it would take approximately 10 years working as a teacher, department head, coordinator, vice principal and then get to your goal of becoming a principal.

09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	In Ministers of Reform, Robert Crunden traces the backgrounds of many of the leading achievers in the Progressive era. Although the statesmen, social workers, writers, artists, and thinkers were not bound to a common platform and were not members of any single movement, many of them shared common backgrounds and experiences that influenced their political/social ideas. Such commonalties include a religious heritage and (except in the case of Woodrow Wilson) an Abolitionist heritage. Abraham Lincoln was seen as a living ideal as did the Republican party until many became disillusioned by it. Protestantism and education also were important factors. Progressive leaders Crunden looks at include Samuel Hopkins Adams, Jane Addams, Charles A. Beard, William Jennings Bryan, John R. Commons, John Dewey, Richard Ely, Robert Henri, George Herron, Charles Ives, Robert La Follette, George Herbert Mead, Robert Park, Theodore Roosevelt, Upton Sinclair, John Sloan, Frederick Jackson Turner, Harvey Wiley, Woodrow Wilson, and Frank Llloyd Wright. The spirit of innovation and moral rectitude of the Progressive generation made its mark throughout American politics, society, and culture. One important point Cruden makes is that, although many Progressive leaders demonstrated tolerance at home, they often also showed a great deal of intolerance abroad.<br>  <br>  The Progressive Era in the United States was a period of reform which lasted from the 1890s through the 1920s. Political scientists call it the "Fourth Party System". The people at the time called it the "Progressive Era" but historians ever since have debated whether or not it was dominated by the old middle class or included ethnic workers, whether it began with Theodore Roosevelt becoming president in 1901 or started as a taxpayer revolt in the 1890s, whether it ended with World War I or continued into the 1920s, whether it was a precursor to the New Deal, and how much was influenced by European ideas. The Progressive party created by Roosevelt in 1912 was a short lived breakaway from the Republican Party, which took its name from the era.|`|xT201PPpaa	Well I just learned that (Progressive Era) and didn't learn a dang thing about ministers of reform. Let's see if I can find anything.
0WASp0bHaa	My son keeps milk, pop and snacks in his fridge. The cafeteria is only open at certain times. and it is nice to have a snack without leaving the building to do so. <br>  <br>  We went with our son to help him move in. He brought a small TV, and the fridge, computer, clothes, bedding, well there is a lot to move. You can do it yourself if you are bring your own car. <br>  <br>  His college would not allow microwaves. they will send you a list of what you can and can not bring|`|671SwG7Raa	The first day you have to move in all of your stuff.  Your parents should go with you because you are going to have a TON of stuff to move (bedding, all of your clothes, computer, etc.)  Before you move into your dorm you should find out what kind of things will be in your room.  In my dorm room there was a bed, dresser, minifridge, and microwave.<br>  <br>  You can bring anything you want into your room except for things that cook food like a hotplate or toaster.  A t.v. is fine.  The minifridge is to keep your food in.  Like water, soda and to keep leftover food.  They also give you a freezer where you can stock microwaveable dinners.|`|KcooLtkCaa	My parents went with me.  <br>  We were allowed to bring tv's.  I don't see why you wouldn't be.<br>  And as for the mini fridge, I'm not sure if I understand your question, but I used it to keep my food and drinks...|`|wipJ9OE7aa	In many instances parents accompany their children to college their first day when they get to move into their dorms during their freshman year. The parents usually helps the students move into the dorms, get their room together, go around campus and finalize things like the class schedules, and purchasing textbooks and take the student (if they don't have a car) to stores to get last minute things that the student might need. I don't know about Cal State, but depending on the living situation if you have a roommate, most of the time the school send you the name of your roommate and their phone number during the summer before school starts, so that you can contact that person and you can discuss what it is that you are both planning on bringing. So, you might want to bring a tv, while your roommate brings the microwave (if allowed at the college you're attending). Mini fridge's are for you to put your stuff in of course, juices, leftover food that you might have while you're at school.

AULA1cvtaa	- Take easier classes your first quarter/semester. I made the mistake of taking a full course load. Lets just say that it was the worst time of my life in that quarter. <br>  <br>  -Don't hide from people in the first few weeks, especially if you are living in the dorms. Go out and meet new people! <br>  <br>  -If you are dorming, during the first week, go door to door with your roommate and introduce yourselves. me and my roommate did that. Not only did  i meet some really good friends that way, but i became acquainted with most of my hall. Its a good idea.  <br>  <br>  -Never sit in the back of the classroom. If you get paired up with people next to you for class work or projects, you want to sit near people that will be helpful. In the back, the odds are higher of sitting next to a slacker.<br>  <br>  -Manage fun and study. If you have an essay, finish it as early as possible. You dont want to give up going out on a weekend because you have to do that essay thats due on monday. Finish your stuff on a weekday. <br>  <br>  -Party hard, work harder. I know it should be the other way around, but trust me, this one is better. <br>  <br>  -Join an organization, fraternity/sorority, or club. If you arent the sorority type, consider a coed fraternity. You lose the fraternity vibe and meet great people. I joined a coed fraternity and i dont regret it. <br>  <br>  -If you happen to join an frat/sorority, dont rush in the fall. wait till the spring when you are used to academics and college in general.<br>  <br>  -Be open minded. you will meet all types of people. dont be the one that calls the RA if people are drinking or being loud...unless its midterms/finals week or if its like 3 AM. <br>  <br>  Ok, thats it. Good luck and have fun!|`|32cdf0ea2c6e049c92e67ec40dfecfa9aa	College life is a little bit different depending on which college you go to and what your major is. Some majors like those in the health professions will take out so much of your social life. <br>  <br>  Be prepared to class by prereading the chapters, printing out papers you might need, n doing your homework. A lot of professors dont check or collect hw so doing it wont kill you. Dont text, go online, or call a buddy during class. Professors have the right to kick you out and report you even if you were prepared for that class. <br>  <br>  Find balance for work, school, n social life. You dont want to spend so much time partying or hanging out with friends. NOr do you want be a workaholic or study too much. <br>  <br>  I know college is going to cost the most out of your money so it wont hurt to cut off some unneccessary expenses. If you can, walk or ride your bike. Take public transportation if its offered rather than driving by car. If you can avoid dorming, go for it. Dont eat out too often not because it's expensive but its unhealthy. Brown bag a lunch or eat at home. Buy used books and try to resell them if you can after you're done with them. You get the idea. <br>  <br>  Be active and read and study more. It's good for the brain and its a good way to get ahead in your classes. Study with a partner before an exam or class. <br>  <br>  Take advantage of what your college has to offer and dont be afraid to ask for help when you need it. <br>  <br>  Don't agree or join something because everyone else is doing it or you think it'll make you look cool. Do as much reserach and ask. Lots of ppl join fraternites and sororities without thinking twice what it's all about. <br>  <br>  Cheating and plagarizing is a very serious offense in college so study more and ask for help when you aren't sure. <br>  <br>  If for some reason you don't like the college, transfer when you can. If you wait too long, your credits might not get accepted at the other college and you'd have to retake more classes. Be sure you are able to maintain the minimum GPA before you progress into your major or switch to another college. <br>  <br>  How that helped and if you have any questions, dont hesitate to ask! =]|`|oVJtehYMaa	Just work on discovering yourself and your passions and getting passionate about things.  Be willing to try new things.  Don't expect friends your first week (or even your first term; some people say the first year), because it takes time to make friends.  Get organized quick.

AA10176626	rvhome...<br>  <br>  The only sure thing in the college lending 'game' is the Stafford loan that you will be offered by the Department of Education. As a dependent first year student, you will be offered the opportunity to borrow up to $5500 from the Stafford program. Your loan "application" will be ridiculously short, because Stafford lenders do not ask questions about your income, your debts, or your credit history. You will not be asked for a cosigner.<br>  <br>  In subsequent school years, you will continue to be offered access to the Stafford program, and your borrowing limits will increase - to $6500 as a sophomore and to $7500 as a third and fourth year student.<br>  <br>  The Stafford is but one of several available forms of federal student aid - whether you qualify for other forms will be determined by your EFC score, and by the funds that your particular school has available. There is no way for anyone to predict those amounts for you. <br>  <br>  Your school will send you an aid offer letter, detailing the financial aid that you have qualified for, and providing you with further instructions on how to accept and receive that aid.<br>  <br>  The "other" type of student loan, commonly known as the "alternative" or "private" student loan is - at the present time - an endangered species . Some would tell you that it is extinct.<br>  <br>  These forms of loans are based on an extremely conservative analysis of your loan application. The lender will want to consider your income, your assets, your debts, and your credit history. The chances are almost 100% that you will be asked to provide a cosigner for your loan - because you won't be able to qualify for this type of loan on your own.<br>  <br>  A cosigner must have excellent credit, and the discretionary income to pay his/her own bills AND take responsibility for paying YOUR loan. Cosigning is not a tag-team event. In the unpleasant eventuality that the lender has to turn to your cosigner to collect, they will  pretty much ignore you (the borrower), and expect the cosigner to pay your loan - NOW. There aren't really that many people who have so much extra money that they can afford to take on the financial obligations of other people. To top it all off - cosigning is ALWAYS a bad idea.<br>  <br>  You asked about subsidized and unsubsidized loans - a subsidized loan is a particular form of financial aid, offered only to students whose FAFSA applications demonstrate "exceptional need". If you qualify for a subsidized loan, that loan will be included on your financial aid offer letter. You can not "apply" to be given a subsidized loan.<br>  <br>  I hope that information helped you - good luck!|`|5c6c2ed9e550cdae457d854eb7cac3fdaa	Subsidized is based on need, so if you or your parents don't make a lot of money youll be approved for that. Unsubsadized is available for everyone regardless of financial need.<br>  The requirements include to not owe other government loans, and to complete a tutorial online. It's pretty easy to get, they don't look at your credit score.<br>  Also with subsidized you don't pay ineterest - the government does, but with unsubsadized you have to pay interest either now or after you graduate.<br>  Hope this helps, good luck!
Mdk7DmiAaa	You can have just the BA in Psychology to teach in the high school setting, although many states require additional hours in the social sciences, specifically the histories.  You are correct many high schools do not offer psychology.<br>  <br>  The above poster is correct that a Master's is the minimum needed to teach in college, and most have Ph.D. degrees.|`|ea3e7518cd0711f403373eda49bf11e9aa	My school has a great psychology program: standard level, AP, and International Baccalaureate (IB). I don't know if they are in high demand right now but they should be in the future because many students nowadays are majoring in psychology. Either you become a teacher or a psychologist I strongly suggest you get AT LEAST a master's degree because that's what jobs in psychology require. Most of them actually require a Ph.D. in psychology, but you don't need a Ph.D. to become a psych teacher.

RvmYqQtRaa	As confused as you are. Ugh My ex was called a bird by her friends because she would fly away. Which meant she liked to move all over the place while leaving the ones that love her behind. I guess the only real answer I can give you is it's sometimes true.|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Sometimes I share about this problem too as its served with no real objective and this when you're in the midst of digitalized logic world.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its really nothing great to say it when you have to break so many tangles of do's or possibilities to realize its real meaning.<br>  <br>  Making this mystery filled statements will drive you crazy especially when you are in the midst of expecting results.<br>  <br>  The best is you raise the question what he or she means and if the response is to break further your head then its better to lay of this type of friends from closer ties friends list so that they do not hurt any further  in later of life relationships.|`|eaP3XMSaaa	if you love something you would not want to make it uncomfortable you wouldn't want to see it suffer because of you. you would let it reach its full potential, if it yours destiny would lead it right back to you.|`|ZzdurUuLaa	me too, bc one time i heard that quote, and i had a bird, and i let it go, and it never came back. and i loved my birdy.|`|vumtODbEaa	Yes, I honestly and truly do believe in that old saying, 110%. I dated someone for four years, we broke up off and on, but overall it was four years. Even when he was dating someone else, or I was, little things would bring us together. It all started in 7th grade and it has never stopped all because we let go and love brought us back =) Beleive in it, please please believe in this quote. It will take you to many beautiful places in life!<br>  Hpoe this helped!|`|Un3YxFvRaa	it's absolutely true..... your friend was telling you that he believed that if you really liked him the way he liked you, you would realize it.

I think you should go to him and ask what it means and tell him to stop playing around like a little kid and tell you how he realy feels.. Good luck
Tuhy5rnQaa	of course you can get into math honors next year even though u have a B this year. There shouldn't be any reason not to get the class. Honors classes are just more challenging then the regular version so if your up for it then sure you can get in. Getting into schools like Harvard isn't just about having good grades you also need other stuff such as doing after school activity's , community service, and in the future do well on the SAT or ACT.
rHqe7oMoaa	No, because you've already said "for the following purposes". Adding "among others" is superfluous and awkward.|`|iyKKqEXSaa	yes, your version is correct, altho slightly clumsy.<br>  <br>  for example, you might have written:<br>  <br>  Reports can be used for the following purposes:<br>  - Benchmarking... (etc.)<br>  - Demonstrating... (etc.); and... AMONG OTHERS.<br>  <br>  in this way, among others is used to indicate more things might be included in your listing, but aren't mentioned here/at this time.<br>  <br>  okay?<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	that works perfectly actually.|`|dhXCEumpaa	It is grammatically correct.

All that I could be, do, see if I could just control this one part of my life.<br>  <br>  I often think that one of the reasons I’m so unsure about the idea of anything so permanent as marriage is because there’s still so much left I want to do.

PTWnWkPRaa	Just ask yourself this question.. "what job would i get if i didn't complete high school.?"  A lot of employers look for people who have finished high school. Maybe try a sport at school or something to get you more influenced. Some parents give out "grade money" which is for like every A you get like 10.00 and for every B you get 5.00. It would be a lot easier to complete it now, then later. I would also suggest doing some type of college, even if it is online or something so you have some back round. education opens doors to your future.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You should at least finish high school.<br>  Trust me I wanted to drop out too. But I didn't.

And better jobs usually pay more too.

The teacher might have a better time understanding it, than if you got all worldly and technical. <br>  <br>  How about becoming a Big Sister. Positive role models are very important in a child's developmental years. In addition, we are an object of our environment. This means that if you are born to a rich family, you will probably turn out the same way. Just like someone living in a ghetto, will in most cases never leave the ghetto. They are not offered the same opportunities that the richy noted above is.<br>  <br>  So, that being said. This is a great opportunity to change one person's life. And who knows what might become of that. Maybe she will one day cure cancer. Or, maybe she'll be a Big Sister one day and her little sister will cure diabetes. Or, maybe you positive influence will get her to be the first person in her family to graduate with a degree... and maybe this will provide incentive for her little brother to do the same. <br>  <br>  Maybe your positive influence will stop her from doing drugs, or joining a gang, or getting pregnant.

AacmVYD9aa	Odetta's life began in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1930. She moved with her family to Los Angeles, California, when she was 6 years old. Odetta started studying music when she was 13 and later studied opera singing at Los Angeles City College, where she became interested in folk music. She came to prominence in the folk music world in the 1950s. Odetta was more than just a singer, her voice sang for many. It was as though she transformed herself into thesongs she sung. Odetta had not lived the lives of the people in her songs, but she was interested in them.<br>  <br>  Odetta's voice sang for many, The folk singer gave life to the songs of working people and farmers and miners, housewives and washerwomen, African Americans and whites. <br>  Odetta was more than just a singer, her classically trained voice and some guitar playing  channeled the colorful and sometimes deeply sad stories that make up American folk music. Odetta influenced generations of musicians and became an icon in the civil rights struggle. Odetta used music to preach messages of hope, justice, and humanity. In August 1963, she sang a song called "I'm on My Way" at the historic March on Washington, the civil rights demonstration where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. <br>  During this time, folk music was experiencing a boom. Singers like Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan began performing and recording songs in which they expressed their views on civil rights and other issues of the day. They and many other folk superstars were influenced by Odetta<br>  "The first thing that got me into folk singing was Odetta," Bob Dylan said in 1978. Time magazine, "What distinguished her from the start was the care with which she tried to re-create in the feeling of her folk songs.'' "I'm not a real folk singer,'' Odetta told The Washington Post in 1983. "I'm a city kid who has admired an area and who got into it. I've been fortunate. With folk music, I can do my teaching and preaching … . '' President Bill Clinton said her career showed "us all that songs have the power to change the heart and change the world.'' <br>  Odetta performed 60 concerts in the last two years, due to heart health problems. Her singing ability never diminished. Neither did her enthusiasm for singing. In 1983, she said that for her, music was still a way to express hope and grief. <br>  <br>  <br>  Odetta released album after album of songs. She was considered for Grammys in the 1960s. In 1999, she was honored with a National Medal of the Arts, than considered again as recently as 2005. At 77, on December 2, 2008, Odetta lost her battle with heart disease.<br>  "There's always something to sing about," Odetta said|`|au1yFfuxaa	It's your homework, do it yourself.|`|cMs9YJzZaa	Read it through..maybe two or three times.

vV1hPhfWaa	The first thing you want to do, in order to make this easier for you, is to summarize each paragraph seperately from each other.  If the paragraph is small, you can merge it with the following or preceding paragraph as well.  Try to break the main points of the paragraph into one or maybe two sentances.  Personally, I would leave out irrelevant quotes (like the one in the third paragraph).  Additionally, you want to keep everything flowing and chronological.<br>  <br>  For the first paragraph I would put:  <br>  <br>  Odetta, an influential singer/songwriter and civil rights activist, Died on December 2, 2008.<br>  <br>  For the second paragraph I would put:<br>  <br>  Using her voice as a social motivator, Odetta brought the hard-boiled atmosphere of the 1950's to life. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps.

Literally some have alumni they know standing by them to get recruits which is weird and funny at the same time. I have seen this a lot at football games. It is like a switch and bait after you pay the fee to join. ALWAYS PICK A FRAT WITH A FRAT HOUSE ask more than one person in the frat some will lie or act like the house your at is the Frat house and it really is just somebody's parents house.

The ones that always acted like suck ups though were never it either. But never was I attracted to any of them, just maybe enjoyed some easier than others.|`|lKpOMP6Qaa	How could you possibly ever get so close to a student that you begin to develop actual feelings for them? <br>  <br>  Or are you implying purely sexual attraction? In that case, I suggest taking estrogen supplements to counteract the high levels of testosterone of which is affecting your ability to interact with people on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  However, I extend -- how could you ever develop romantic feelings for a student? Romantic feelings take time, and periods of intimate relations and interactions before you become aware of this. Answering your student's "remarkable questions", if you so say, in class, is not grounds for 'falling' for a student.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, you did not specify an age. What.. a teacher and 1st graders?  Or university level students, perhaps mature students -- even post grades returning for additional education, -- and their professor who may be no more than a couple years older? Again.. there is no grounds for a situation to develop where the teacher would be interacting as such with his or her students, to lead towards "Feelings" !!....|`|WvrW3v2waa	Well I'm not a teacher, but I remember my 4th grade teacher.

There are many controversial issues in today's world; such as war, abortion, taxes, education, immigration, outsourcing, healthcare and many more. Our forefathers died defending our right to vote. It is our duty to pass the torch on to future generations, it is up to us that the flame does not go out.

The subject of the tallest building in the world seems to be very simple? Just measure the thing up to the top. This concept was working well until so many different types of structures and buildings started coming up and people decided it was unfair to be comparing certain structures with others. So, in an attempt to settle things down, the 'Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat' divided the ways to compare buildings into categories.<br>  <br>     1.

4RQh0kXlaa	In mine, it's 90-100 is a 4.0, 80-89 is a 3.0 etc<br>  <br>  So at my school you'd have a 3.0|`|eCjx7kLAaa	It depends a lot on how the grades match GPA values.  One way that might help, is convert these to the equivalent letter grade at your school, then convert those letter grades to the equivalent GPA value at the school you're trying to match to, then calculate the average GPA.  This helps wash out some of the ambiguity in a direct translation, but gives a general value.  Averaging those, you have an 83.8, which is a B/B- which would be somewhere between 2.7-3.0.<br>  <br>  Example of going NPA>Letter>GPA:<br>  80>B->2.7<br>  70>C->1.7<br>  88>B+>3.3<br>  87>B+>3.3<br>  94>A>4.0<br>  <br>  Which gives a 3.0.<br>  <br>  Note that unless you have a specific NPA>Letter and Letter>GPA systems you're using, this only gives you a general value, but it helps you get the rough idea.

k8Uv2CZGaa	In “How the Buffalo Were Released” Coyote and Geronimo are very much alike, but different in ways. Firstly, Coyote and Geronimo had different goals. Coyote main focus is to release the buffalo on earth from a man named Humpback. Geronimo and his followers, in search of an untied existence, main goal is to try to escape from the reservation . One of the most prominent differences between the two is that Geronimo is a real person; Coyote is not. Geronimo and Coyote have a few of the same skills, determination, bravery, and leadership, but these qualites didn't ensure that they would achieve their goals.<br>  Coyote and Geronimo showed determination in similar ways. Coyote didn’t give up when he turned himself into and a bird and failed. Instead the next day he turned into a dog. Coyote was determined to release the buffalo. Geronimo showed determination after being captured many of times, he continued on escaping from the reservations. <br>  Geronimo and Coyote showed bravery in the same way. Geronimo bravery showed when he was escaping the lands because he knew there could be punishment. Coyote showed bravery by entering Humpback’s home and releasing the buffalo because Humpback knew Coyote was a trickster.<br>  Geronimo and Coyote both had leadership and gained mythological status among their people. Coyote had councils to discuss his plan. His people thought it was a good idea .Coyote’s leadership was different than Geronimo’s. Coyote released the buffalo on his own; Geronimo had followers escaping with him. <br>  Coyote and Geronimo were in different situations but both were brave and had determination in similar ways. Their leaderships were different from one another. Coyote succeeded but Geronimo did not. Power or leadership doesn’t mean success.<br>  <br>  Pretty good. Wrap it up with a good conclusion. Couldn't edit it all. Had to go to bed. Good luck.
5ZZCM0Dvaa	he Great Depression was an economic slump in North America, Europe, and other industrialized areas of the world that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939. It was the longest and most severe depression ever experienced by the industrialized Western world.<br>  <br>  Though the U.S. economy had gone into depression six months earlier, the Great Depression may be said to have begun with a catastrophic collapse of stock-market prices on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1929. During the next three years stock prices in the United States continued to fall, until by late 1932 they had dropped to only about 20 percent of their value in 1929. Besides ruining many thousands of individual investors, this precipitous decline in the value of assets greatly strained banks and other financial institutions, particularly those holding stocks in their portfolios. Many banks were consequently forced into insolvency; by 1933, 11,000 of the United States' 25,000 banks had failed. The failure of so many banks, combined with a general and nationwide loss of confidence in the economy, led to much-reduced levels of spending and demand and hence of production, thus aggravating the downward spiral. The result was drastically falling output and drastically rising unemployment; by 1932, U.S. manufacturing output had fallen to 54 percent of its 1929 level, and unemployment had risen to between 12 and 15 million workers, or 25-30 percent of the work force.<br>  <br>  The Great Depression began in the United States but quickly turned into a worldwide economic slump owing to the special and intimate relationships that had been forged between the United States and European economies after World War I. The United States had emerged from the war as the major creditor and financier of postwar Europe, whose national economies had been greatly weakened by the war itself, by war debts, and, in the case of Germany and other defeated nations, by the need to pay war reparations. So once the American economy slumped and the flow of American investment credits to Europe dried up, prosperity tended to collapse there as well. The Depression hit hardest those nations that were most deeply indebted to the United States, i.e., Germany and Great Britain. In Germany, unemployment rose sharply beginning in late 1929, and by early 1932 it had reached 6 million workers, or 25 percent of the work force. Britain was less severely affected, but its industrial and export sectors remained seriously depressed until World War II. Many other countries had been affected by the slump by 1931.<br>  <br>  Almost all nations sought to protect their domestic production by imposing tariffs, raising existing ones, and setting quotas on foreign imports. The effect of these restrictive measures was to greatly reduce the volume of international trade: by 1932 the total value of world trade had fallen by more than half as country after country took measures against the importation of foreign goods.<br>  <br>  The Great Depression had important consequences in the political sphere. In the United States, economic distress led to the election of the Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt to the presidency in late 1932. Roosevelt introduced a number of major changes in the structure of the American economy, using increased government regulation and massive public-works projects to promote a recovery. But despite this active intervention, mass unemployment and economic stagnation continued, though on a somewhat reduced scale, with about 15 percent of the work force still unemployed in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. After that, unemployment dropped rapidly as American factories were flooded with orders from overseas for armaments and munitions. The depression ended completely soon after the United States' entry into World War II in 1941. In Europe, the Great Depression strengthened extremist forces and lowered the prestige of liberal democracy. In Germany, economic distress directly contributed to Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933. The Nazis' public-works projects and their rapid expansion of munitions production ended the Depression there by 1936.<br>  <br>  At least in part, the Great Depression was caused by underlying weaknesses and imbalances within the U.S. economy that had been obscured by the boom psychology and speculative euphoria of the 1920s. The Depression exposed those weaknesses, as it did the inability of the nation's political and financial institutions to cope with the vicious downward economic cycle that had set in by 1930. Prior to the Great Depression, governments traditionally took little or no action in times of business downturn, relying instead on impersonal market forces to achieve the necessary economic correction. But market forces alone proved unable to achieve the desired recovery in the early years of the Great Depression, and this painful discovery eventually inspired some fundamental changes in the United States' economic structure. After the Great Depression, government action, w

The only way to really solve this is to think of the 30:60:90 triangle or the 45:45:90 triangle. sin(60) = about .866, cos(30) is the same, so the answer would be 30 and 210 or pi/6, and 7pi/6.
iyKKqEXSaa	The term SEXUAL PREDATOR is used pejoratively to describe a person seen as obtaining or trying to obtain sexual contact with another person in a metaphorically "predatory" manner. Analogous to how a predator hunts down its prey, so the sexual predator is thought to "hunt" for his or her sex partners. People who commit sex crimes, such as rape or child sexual molestation.<br>  A SEX OFFENDER (short for sexual offender) is a person who has been criminally charged and convicted of, or has pled guilty to, or pled Nolo contendere to a sex crime. Crimes requiring mandatory sex offender registration may include child sexual abuse, downloading pornographic behavior material of persons under the age of 18, (child pornography), rape, statutory rape and even non-sexual offenses such as kidnapping. The term sexual offender is a broad term, with sexual predator being used to describe a more severe physical or repeat sexual offense. Sexual offenders are also sometimes classified into levels[1], where the highest level offenders have the most aggravating crimes and thus, the most risk to the public and usually must register as a sex offender for their entire lives. Low level sexual offenders may serve only a probationary sentence and only register for 10 years as well as having less restrictions placed on them compared to higher level offenders. As a label of identity it is used in criminal psychology. Especially in the United States the person, if convicted, is most likely required to register with the respective jurisdiction's sex offender registry, a county- or statewide database that is often public and accessible to everyone through the internet.<br>  <br>  basically, a sex offender is/can be more passively involved (altho not always), whereas a sex predator is quite actively engaged in his/her activities.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|igLGjvXjaa	predator looks but hasn't touched but may have threatened to, offender has actually acted out on his impulses

IWSc7xkiaa	Several states will hire teachers without an education degree as long as they have a degree in their subject. Most of these teachers are required to complete additional coursework to make up for the lack of an education degree, but the course work isn't very difficult or time consuming.

We don't all get what we want."<br>  <br>  You should also give her a nickname and refer to her only by that name. It should be something you can say in public without getting in hot water. 'The Troll' is a pretty good fallback, but, again, if you can work that nasty physical attribute thing into the nickname, even better. <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to say to her, stay cool. Don't get emotional. Jerks feed off of that. It's not really about how good an insult is, it's about delivery. If you want some inspiration, type in 'heckler' over on YouTube. Comedians are as mean as they come, and hecklers get the worst of it. Also, listen to some rap battles. Those guys are MEAN.<br>  <br>  But I'm really going to recommend again that you just ignore her. Chances are she's a miserable person for some valid reason or another, and is just taking it out on you. That doesn't make what she says to you okay by any means, but fighting back might just make her worse. Also, look at you, asking for advice on insults on a Saturday night. This whole thing is putting you in emotional distress lady! Chill. You'll be alright.|`|zbkbqTeoaa	She's probably waiting to feed off of any comeback you would give.  It means that you are providing her with the attention that she clearly wants.  <br>  <br>  As one of the other posters said, just look right through her as if she isn't even there.  If she stops you or makes you look at her, just act as if you've suddenly noticed her, say "Oh, hi," and move along.  <br>  "Don't you have something better to do with your life?"  works pretty well too.|`|NIXX4Rxjaa	Try using vocabulary that's above her head.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	If you're getting a graduate degree, that's the degree employers care about - so it's better to go to a state school and then get a graduate degree from an ivy than the other way around - of course, that's assuming that the ivy has a good program in your field.  There are many subjects in which the ivy league schools don't have the top programs.  Employers will know what the top schools are.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	It depends largely on your field.  Assuming the Ivy League school is renowned in your program, then yes it looks better to be a grad student there and have your undergrad elsewhere than vice versa.  However, in some fields, the most prestigious schools aren't Ivy League, engineering for example, tops are MIT, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and U Illinois, U Texas, etc.  Penn and Columbia are also important engineering schools, but don't look nearly as good on a resume as MIT would.  There are a lot of rankings for schools by program out there, often done by professional organizations in those fields, so look around.|`|IddUYNR3aa	I think this depends on your career choice. Different schools are tops in different fields. I wouldn't go to Yale to be a surgeon. The Ivy League law schools are vocational schools for politicians. There are better law schools if you are going to be a criminal prosecutor.

nzWux9Meaa	Absolutely, after you apply to the college and get accepted they will make you take a math and reading placement test. This test will put you into the appropriate classes. I am currently enrolled in a program that allows me to go to the college and earn college credits and high school credits. You should ask your counselor about this because it will save two years of taking generals and , for me, the government pays for it. Anyway, go for it and take a few classes, but I would not suggest taking any more than two courses because it might be too much. For me I generally did not get too much homework because they graded on a lot of exams. So based on the fact that you are taking advanced courses I would say go for it. This will help you get ahead of the game and I feel that it is a great experience.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Depends on your age.  If you are 18 then you may apply directly.  If you are under 18 you cannot directly apply; you must apply through your high school's counselors permission and you'll be restricted to certain courses only.|`|671SwG7Raa	Yes! It is possible!  I used to take courses for math at the community college at night while in high school.  Just call the school and tell them that you're a high school student looking to take college courses and when you want to enroll. They will give you info about when the classes are and the fees.  It is too late to enroll now but you could take classes in the summer or enroll for fall classes.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Yes, this is called concurrent credit.  If you take Freshman English during your Junior year in high school, depending on the rules of the state in which you live, the grade for the Freshman course will give you credit for Senior high school English.

l1ZBzSJjaa	The complete verb will be in the Present Progressive tense or the Past Progressive tense. Therefore, the auxiliary verb must be a form of "be" (the verb "to be"). For example: am, is, are, was, were. Even if you use more difficult auxiliaries, such as "will be", "have been", "will have been", these are still forms of "be" (the verb "to be").

i5tOQGgFaa	Ah...almost a preschooler but still a toddler in many ways.  It is a hard time for them.  Here are some ideas we have used.<br>  <br>  Flyswatter Painting:  Purchase some inexpensive flyswatters at your local dollar store. Give each child a flyswatter and a large sheet of construction paper. Squeeze a few dabs of paint onto each child’s paper. Then invite children to swat the paint flies. If you live in an area that is warmer this time of year...this is a good outside activity!<br>  <br>  I find that my kids at this age have mastered using eye droppers.  If you haven't used them yet, you may wish to explore with them first at the water table.  But I provide icecube trays and in three slots I add water and red, blue, yellow food coloring.  Then they explore color mixing and then also drip it onto a coffee filter.  If you use bold enough colors even the brown (that most turn all their water into) will seperate out on the coffee filter.  Bunch together, when dry, to make a butterfly.<br>  <br>  Bug stamps- I would provide a Bb page first...maybe in light blue paper...and have them stamp on the block letter Bb...then allow for free stamping.<br>  <br>  Honey-Combed Bee:  Make a white construction paper copy of the bee pattern. Squeeze alternating dots of yellow and black paint along each bee’s body as shown. Then invite each child to drag a fine-toothed comb through the paint to spread the paint down his bee’s body, resulting in stripes. Allow time for the paint to dry. The help each child cut out his bee.<br>  <br>  Bugs in the Grass:  Sensory:  Fill table with green plastic grass; hide assortment of plastic insects in the grass.  Provide magnifying glasses and let the hunt begin.<br>  <br>  Bobbing For Water Bugs:  To begins, fill a clear drinking glass with seltzer water. Use food coloring to tint the water blue. Invite a small group of students to join you at the center.  Show students the glass of water; then pass around a few raisins for them to examine. Drop the raisins into the glass. Direct students to observe closely as the raisins become water bugs and begin to dive up and down in the water.  Invite the children to offer explanations of how that happens.  Then explain that the wrinkles in the raisins trap the seltzer-water bubbles. The bubbles carry the raisins to the top of the water and then when the bubbles pop, the raisins fall. New bubbles become trapped in the raisins and they start rising again.<br>  <br>  Let’s Inspect Insects:  Let the children play the part of an entomologist.  Place the following items in the center: adult-size white button-down shirts (lab coats), plastic magnifying lenses, colored pencils or crayons, and small clipboards with paper. Then add insect habitats, such as an ant farm, butterfly garden, or ladybug farm. Or stock the area with plastic insects for students to inspect. Invite each child to don a lab coat and then use a magnifying lens to observe the insects.  Afterward, have him use the colored pencils and paper to illustrate and write about his findings. <br>  <br>  Insect’s Body <br>  Tune:  Head, Shoulders<br>  Head (point to head)<br>  Thorax (point to chest)<br>  Abdomen-abdomen (stomach)<br>  Head, thorax, abdomen-abdomen<br>  And eyes (point to eyes)<br>  And mouth <br>  And antennae, two (stick two fingers up)<br>  Six legs (wiggle three fingers on each hand)<br>  And there’s an insect for you.<br>  (May wish to leave off a verse each time you sing and hum)<br>  <br>  Bug Song <br>  Tune:  If Your Happy and You Know It)<br>  Oh, I wish I were an eensy-weensy spider.<br>  Yes, I wish I were an eensy-weensy spider.<br>  I’d go “creepy-creepy-crawly” down your hall and up your “wall-y”<br>  Oh, I wish I were an eensy-weensy spider.<br>  <br>  Yellow honeybee…buzzy-buzzy buzzy and my stripes would be all fuzzy<br>  Wiggly caterpillar…munchy-munchy-munchy all the leaves would be my “lunch-y”<br>  Small red army ant…trompy-trompy-trompy over hills and through the swampy<br>  Hungry litter skeeter…bitey-bitey-biter when you went outsides at nighty<br>  <br>  Do You See Bugs?  <br>  Tune:  Muffin Man<br>  Do you see a grasshopper, a grasshopper, a grasshopper?<br>  Do you see a grasshopper?  It leaps around like this.  (Squat down and hop)<br>  Butterfly…flits around like this (Flap arms and dart around)<br>  Brown spider…Creeps around like this (Bend at waist and touch floor with hands)<br>  Bumblebee…flies around like this (Make buzzing sounds while pretending to fly.)<br>  <br>  Buggy Wuggy:  Do the Hokey Pokey with the children substituting insect and spider body parts for the original human parts in the lyric-  “Put your feelers in.. Put our wings in…stingers…backbones…legs… etc.  Another version is to have pictures or rubber insects and call out an insect for them to pick up and put in.  Put your butterfly in, take your butterfly out...<br>  <br>  Worm Bag:  Cut out 30 strips, 2 ?” x 5 “ from colored paper. Put animals stickers or other stickers to reinforce shapes, numbers, letters, etc. on the bottoms of 26 of the paper strips.  On the bottoms of the other four strips, use a marker to draw a picture of a worm.  Decorate a lunch bag with silly, cartoon-styl|`|DPLjIsSaaa	You can try telling them that they should not like bugs, they bite. <br>  <br>  Here is an activity that you can do...Have the kids choose a bug... then have them go to there own categories that goes with the other bugs and on and on...|`|wsbjR513aa	Try www.perpetualpreschool.com. The ideas there have been already implemented; therefore, they work! <br>  <br>  Also, have you tried to do sensory with them using a water table? With the bugs theme, you could add sand to the table. Bury small rubber bugs in it and let the children dig them out! They are going to love it and will spend forever at that sensory table, that's for sure!<br>  <br>  I am about to do unit on Bugs as well; as a result, I have purchased (on orientaltrading.com) small rubber insect finger puppets for Language Arts. The puppets gross me out, but I'm sure, my toddlers will love them! <br>  <br>  You can also give your children magnifying glasses to examine the rubber bugs. Or bring the magnifying glasses outside and let the children search for insects in the grass. <br>  <br>  As you see, the possibilities are endless.<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck!

KMqgfhAkaa	It really depends, at least in part, on how well you want to do in both of them. If you want to fly by and pass while working full time, you could probably do it. But it wouldn't be as easy to make great grades in both while working full time... in a compressed summer schedule. I'd recommend doing one or the other (if you don't think you'll enjoy either) because they aren't always that easy. I've taken a little bit of biology and am in accounting right now. Accounting isn't terrible once you understand what you have to do. Good luck, no matter what you decide.|`|FRgKX9PRaa	if u are up to it...then go for it|`|AA11635897	I think it would be better to take something easier during the summer because those classes move so fast.
JbxrUJp2aa	Two people I know just found out that they got into Cornell...

It's all about statistics. Get a high weighted and unweighted GPA, high SAT scores, join clubs, and you're set.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	These schools have very different standards, Sweetie.<br>  <br>  For GW, being top 20% of your class and having a 1900 SAT will put you in the running.<br>  <br>  For Cornell, you'll want at minimum to be top 10% with a 2150.<br>  <br>  For Brown, top 5 in your class and a 2250.|`|g3JiJWyvaa	Hey, I didn't personally get in.

7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	It depends.  I'd ask your guidance counselor.  Do you have any specific colleges in mind?  Your counselor would know what that college requires as far as language credits.  I took 4 years of French in high school, and though 2 were only needed for the college I attended, I was able to test out of my college requirements.<br>  <br>  As long as you have four years of math, you should be fine with finishing with Pre-calc.|`|32cdf0ea2c6e049c92e67ec40dfecfa9aa	It depends since if a college is deciding between two applicants, it could be used as a determinating facotr. <br>  <br>  Really, it depends on what you plan to major in when you're in college. If you plan to go to the sciences, go for more math. Then again, it wouldn't hurt to know another language.|`|Rak2TnaXaa	I lived on collegeboard for my Junior year, and I realized that some schools want two, but three is definitely preferred (a lot of good schools require it).

If not, then math<br>  <br>  Or since ur a beast u could take both.  That's what i did and I'm doing pretty good in them|`|srBGRQqzaa	If you are going into a math-oriented major, then you would definitely be better off doubling up on math. Colleges would prefer that since the math class would be more useful to you.|`|0WASp0bHaa	No not at all. Most only need 2 years of the same foreign language. Some want 3. I have never heard of any, even ivy league, wanting more than that.|`|c819af3af49d8b8d19675e0d6c66de9daa	Where I live (California) you need two years of a foreign language to qualify for a CSU, and they recommend 3-4 years to get into a UC (the better state colleges).
YupMCYHlaa	The idea has a charm, but it's the wrong way to think.  People all have a tendency to think that they're the only one with a brain, that everyone else is an idiot.  But thinking this way makes a person very hard to work with.  And if everyone thinks this way, nothing will get done.<br>  <br>  Personally I would rather be surrounded by geniuses, I could learn from them. I have been in that situation. And even if you think you're smarter than someone, you can still appreciate his unique talents, you can still learn from him.  I think that's important.<br>  <br>  If you think you're surrounded by idiots, and that makes you -confident-, how do you think they see -you-?  8^)

tCsFxh5Aaa	I've found it helpful, when I'm trying to make a major decision, to make lists.  A list of all the reasons *to* choose each one.  A list of all the reasons *against* each one.  Take a few days to make the lists, so that you make sure they are complete.  Often, the lists will help you see more clearly which way to go.<br>  <br>  Your second choice could cause a problem with your desired goals.  If you have to miss school for a performance, that will be a problem there.  So you have to decide which is more important to you:  a "normal" school experience or the career goals you have?<br>  <br>  As for uniforms, they won't last forever.  They won't affect who you really are.  I wouldn't base a big decision on that--but you have to decide whether clothes or the school is more important.<br>  <br>  Homeschooling will offer the ultimate flexibility, but it may not include the contacts and such that you could make at an arts school.  Then again, if you get involved in theatre stuff or whatever, you'll be making contacts on your own.  So are you motivated enough to get involved in what you want on your own?<br>  <br>  Try making lists and thinking about priorities--which is more important:  clothes, "normalness", your career choice, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|n3AMignNaa	hey hunnz<br>  i think u should choose option two <br>  go to school with ur friends even thoughur career is important so r ur friends n life....<br>  dont be like vannessa Hudgens she home schooled.<br>  well she never enjoyed prom night n almost everybody likes that<br>  n to be a normal girl<br>  n u will have friends n dont forget hot guyss<br>  n u love cheerleading dont you so yea???<br>  <br>  I THINK U SHOULD GO WITH OPTION TWO
kt2i6eKXaa	it does, b/c you'll be exposed to religious rhetoric day in and day out. if you're not the type who appreciates that, then that school may not be for you. look for some other college close to home.|`|hzxplycYaa	Biola is a private, Christian school. They circulate their academics around Christianity. If this is what you're interested in, go for it. I'm a Christian myself, but I cannot STAND living in this kind of atmosphere for 4 years straight. I devote myself to my religious beliefs on my own, and am not interested in the likelihood of praying 24/7. A friend's older sister attends that school and seems to very much enjoy it. I heard it's actually fun and the professors are extremely laid-back. According to my opinion, this school is TOO expensive... apparently because it is a PRIVATE school. I think it's best to apply to Cal State Universities. I'll be attending either Cal State Northridge or Long Beach in Fall. They are highly reputable schools with great backgrounds. It is way more affordable and will most likely be less tense than going to a Christian private school (but this is just my opinion). It seems like you live nearby me because I've been considering Biola during my highschool years also. There are tons of Cal State Univs. nearby. I'd go for Cal state just for the recognition (i.e. everyone has heard of it). You might decide to move across the country someday & if prospective employers have heard of your school it can help

aEyriv5Waa	You should choose the courses that will lead you to a career that you will love.  You will not be happy if you are getting up everyday to go to work just for the money.  You need to enjoy what you do.  I ended up going back to school to pursue a career that I would love to have rather than worry about the money.  It was the BEST decision I ever made.|`|g3JiJWyvaa	In the words of a wise man I wish I listened to more often "you should be willing to do your career  for free"   This means, don't pick your career because of opportunity or money, pick it because you enjoy it. If need be, find another way to make income such as investing or part time job, etc. Money is only a problem to those who make it one.

o2awQyclaa	In 7th grade honors classes, students allow themselves to believe they are the cream of the crop and advanced in their thinking, as in most honors classes in high school and college.  The student with the Jewish comment believes that he is brilliant in saying such things but he is simply ignorant.  This is a topic that the teacher should assign to your class because comments such as that are idiotic. He is only picking and choosing the information rather than understanding the bigger picture which is what an honors class should be. <br>  <br>  You can speak with your teacher about how to overcome this matter and perhaps change the thinking of your peers to instead of making fun of minorities, they should look for ways to making the world better by understanding their culture.|`|ihv9nScYaa	your teacher should give them all detention -_-<br>  <br>  bring earplugs !

IWSc7xkiaa	I think basic life skills classes should be taught. Some students have no desire to go off to college, but they will still enter the workforce (most of them) and become members of society. I think it would be good to offer all students a class that teachers you how to write checks, information on paying bills (including different payment options), understanding basic tax forms, what to look for in regards to medical and life insurance, keys to creating a resume, tricks to making your job application look "professional", basic job interviewing skills, etc. I know that many schools offer business classes with some of this info. available, but I think this hypothetical class should focus on real world issues that everyone has to deal with.|`|G50ucmllaa	In high school I think there should be more options for students to peruse or gain experience in fields of interest.  However this is typically only possible at large schools or private schools due to the ability to pay qualified teachers in specific fields.  However, I actually think the schools have taken on too much responsibility.  Many schools are responsible for or teach students about morals, sex, character development, basic health, etc.  To me the school should reinforce many of these things being taught, but they should not be the primary teacher of them.  Parents need to take back their responsibility as parents rather than letting schools become parents.

Maybe one teacher could teach 4 different classes at different times of course.   Even your ideas and level is taught.  So an all male school with male teachers will most likely teach towards the males in a way that will allow them to excell faster.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	All of this is very variable by area.  In Manhattan, for example, often the wealthiest live in apartments, while in Chicago, condos on Lakeshore Drive are the elite address.  If you are in Des Moines, Iowa or Fargo, North Dakota, most of the wealthier people would probably live in houses.  When I was in grad school, I remember one of my professors telling me that he had hired an artist to do drawings of housing for various social classes in the U.S. for some research project he was working on, and the artist (who lived in Chicago) had drawn high-rise apartment buildings for the wealthy.  The professor had to ask him to redraw the pictures because this wouldn't have made sense to people in other cities.<br>  <br>  Since I was interviewing for jobs for the last couple of years, I got a sense of the housing opportunities in cities around the country.  Houses existed everywhere, and they ranged from those inhabited by the very poor (did you see the pictures of the houses people in the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans lived in before Hurricane Katrina?) to multi-million dollar homes for the very rich in most cities.  Most places had apartments - some had really nice apartments that most middle-class people couldn't afford to live in along with those for the poor and the middle class, while almost every place (except for rural communities) had apartments for both the poor and the middle class (don't forget that except for the very wealthy, most people live in apartments for a number of years before they can afford to buy homes).  As for condos, they tended to exist primarily in the larger cities, and they were split between being for middle class people and being for the wealthy - in a number of places, they were more for wealthy older people who didn't want to live in a big house alone or for professional people who wanted to live in the middle of town, often with great views.  <br>  <br>  Worldwide, there are similar problems.  In China, for example, most of the poor live in the countryside and there are no apartments or condos there, just houses, so the poor would live in houses.  The big cities are more expensive to live in and the wealthy tend to live in expensive apartments and condos in the cities.  <br>  <br>  As you can tell, this is just not a way of distinguishing the social classes, unless you are speaking about a particular location with particular housing patterns.<br>  <br>  It also isn't possible to give you a pattern as to how long it takes people to own a home, because a lot of this has to do with things like interest rates and the availability of credit.  A few years ago, a lot of people only a few years out of school, whether middle or lower class, were able to buy homes, because banks were lending money to them very freely.  I know of people in their mid-twenties, who were barely making minimum wage, who bought homes.  Now, on the other hand, it is much harder to borrow money, and some people with similar qualifications may never be able to buy a home.  It also depends on other factors.  I was 40 when I bought a home, because I spent a lot of time in school and moving around and didn't want to buy until I felt I would be in one place for a while.  I know some young couples (two incomes help) whose parents bought them a condo when they got married in their early 20s, and who then moved up to a house when the wife got pregnant.  It is hard to imagine what an average time span to buy would be.|`|kvLWTTlhaa	I don't know what your idea of an apartment is, but - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.corcoran.com/property/listing.aspx?Region=NYC&listingid=1435033" rel="nofollow">http://www.corcoran.com/property/listing...</a><br>  <br>  is an apartment in my best friend's building, and I don't really think that it's "poor class".

fz107eRDaa	Taking practice tests is helpful, but first you need to know how to do the questions. If you don't know have the right strategies and techniques, trying to solve the problems will be very difficult and often quite frustrating. However, once you see how the questions are constructed and begin to understand what the test makers want, the test will seem less challenging and certainly less mysterious. As we sometimes talk about in class, taking the LSAT is like training for a marathon. If you just woke up one day and went out to run 26 miles, you wouldn't make it and it would seem impossible to ever do. But if you train a little every day, learn your own strengths and weaknesses, and learn the best training methods, over time you would begin to feel not just confident, but good about your abilities. <br>  <br>  As far as actual preparation, there are a number of avenues available, including live or online classes, personal tutoring, or self-study with prep books. Because you have taken some practice tests already, you know where you are scoring and you should have a good idea of what sections are giving you the most trouble. You also probably have some idea of what type of score you need to get into a school that interests you. That knowledge can help you make the best choices when it comes to prepping for the test. <br>  <br>  While I am a big believer in the value of LSAT classes and tutoring, they are both expensive. Plus, if you don't need a big score improvement, you could probably get away with self-study (and either way, you can always take a prep class after self-study if you don't quite reach the score you want). I would start by buying a few prep books (I like the PowerScore LSAT Bibles and Kaplan's LSAT 180). Those books will give you strategies and methods for attacking the various questions but equally importantly they will help you understand what is going on "behind the scenes" in each question and give you a plan for how to proceed. <br>    <br>  Also, the other writer is correct--check out some law school forums, specifically the LSAT prep or prelaw area. You will hear a lot of prep advice there, and you can meet some other people who are in the same position as you are. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|55c41b1fb4acc7f2a5dfdc1847ab63d8aa	Wow! It's uncanny how similar our stories are. I actually just graduated from Boston University with degrees in music and music education. After doing my student teaching I was convinced that I wanted to pursue a career in law (which I had been contemplating for a while). I'm preparing for the LSAT now and I must tell you that this is one of the most important tests you will every take. I'm not exaggerating. Your LSAT score will determine what tier law school you can get into (tier 1 law schools such as Harvard, NYU, Columbia etc, tend to offer better job prospects to students). The LSAT score could also affect what kind of job you get (some employers want to know what your LSAT score is). I think in some cases, your LSAT score combined with your first year (1L) law school grades also determine if you're accepted for Law Review (which can help you get a job as well).<br>  <br>  To prepare for the LSAT, I suggest going to www.lsat.com and purchasing the "10 Actual, Official LSAT Preptest" series (I'm purchasing at least 20 LSATS). I'm also buying the December 2008 LSAT (it's the most recent one administered, and it's only $8). I'm also going to take a Kaplan LSAT prep course, which is going to cost about $1100 or more.  I'm also starting my own LSAT study group before I take the prep class at my local library.<br>  <br>  I know this may seem extreme, but I need to get at least a 168-170 on the test (I'm trying to go to Harvard Law). With the economy as bad as it is--and with the field of law being as saturated as it is--would it really be worth it in the long run to only achieve a mediocre score on such an important test?  Many students only do self study for the test, and it's up to you to determine how much preparation is needed. Trust me, after working at my local legal aid office and seeing new lawyers who were in $100,000+ in debt making $40,000 a year (which is comparable to what a teacher makes with a masters if not less), it pays to do well on this test and get into a higher-ranked law school with better job prospects.<br>  <br>  Sorry to sound so doom-and-gloom, but I've really done a lot of research into applying to law schools and the career opportunities certain students are awarded after they graduate. I went to BU after all which is right across the Charles river from Harvard and MIT. Trust me, in the legal field, rank of the law school you attend DOES matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S You also might want to try www.top-law-schools.com  it's a great site that offers advice on almost every law school-related topic, including LSAT prep.

34VXCyvVaa	The only reason I can think of for staying at home would be to save money.  That's a pretty major reason, but I still think you gain so much from the dorm experience.  For many college students, living in a dorm is your first chance to live away from your parents and away from your high school friends.  You learn how to live with someone who may be very different from you, you meet all kinds of interesting people, and you usually have a lot of fun.  You develop important social skills that will help you in life and in your career.  You also learn how to budget your time and money on your own when you're away from parental supervision and reminders.  Honestly, those late night dorm discussions with your girlfriends are some of the best because you cover so many topics -- politics, the meaning of life, faith and religion, sex and birth control, family issues, personal issues, career issues, education issues, the subjects you're studying in school, why guys are the way they are (a huge topic), dating issues, etc.  You can learn as much from your friends about life as you can learn about your future career from your courses.  And you don't tend to have those discussions if you're living at home with Mom & Dad.|`|oHGmXlE6aa	Dorm could be fun or it could not be. It depends who you room with.  Living in a dorm is not always better.<br>  <br>  Staying with your parents would lower the cost of your school dramatically. Which would be a huge help to your parents.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Depends what things are more important to you. Most people I know who lived in a dorm left after the first year and were pretty negative about it. But some people really like the social atmosphere.<br>  <br>  If you want to chat to lots of people, and are self-motivated, then it might be good. However good things about staying at home is that you can save money, still participate in family life (if you have younger siblings or you want to stay home for that), and probably have more time to do your work rather than being distracted by other people. It also depends how far away your parents are from campus. If you think you'd still be able to have a good social life living at home, which is very possible, then you won't miss out much that way.<br>  <br>  It also depends how much your parents would "take care" of you. If you think they would be controlling, maybe it's best to move out. If you think they would allow you more independence and doing things on yourself, then it's not so bad.<br>  <br>  Harriet

Graduate majors may determine more efficiently your career choice. <br>  <br>  For example,<br>  I have a friend who majored in French Literature in her undergrad studies but is now a practising surgeon.|`|pmlg4GAsaa	The only job you can get out of being an English major is being an English teacher.

You'd be better off with a 'real' degree than a degree from an art school, especially if you decide later you want to go to a graduate or professional school.|`|WtElgJDtaa	Im in your parents side, you will be wasting your talent...dude you took AP!! (advance placement, right?) but the thing is that if youre not interested in math, science, history, and english then once you choose a career when youre in university then itll be boring and itll be like a burden.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you can go to an art school and do what you love...the only thing is that being a artist is really hard since theres a lot of competition and so on...so can you make good living by being an artist...? NO! <br>  <br>  So thats what you really need to think about...<br>  Good Luck!|`|o4mwQowlaa	I would say a university definitely.  Having a BA is your ticket to pretty much any type of job, if you decide art will not be a full time endeavor.  It will allow you to focus on classes you want to take and mix in some others that may help you later in life.  Good luck!|`|srBGRQqzaa	Definitely go to a university and take art courses. I also am interested in art. I am going to UMass Amherst in the fall to study communications, which will lead to advertising where I will use my creative skills. You can pick a major in which you work art into.<br>  <br>  Also, say you change your mind? If you go to an art school, then you are stuck! A friend of mine went to the New England Art Institute and studied photography. She paid an arm and a leg, got out of college, and couldn't get a job. She can't even pay off those student loans.<br>  <br>  From an AP Art student who wants to use her creative talents in life, I would recommend studying art at a university. You will have more options, and can still use those AP credits!!

The ungloved hand rests on a large, leather bound book.  Several other smaller books rest on the marble topped table. This is an era where printing presses were entirely hand operated and it took an incredible amount of time to print one page.  Books were an expensive luxury and only the well-off could afford books and were educated enough to read them.<br>  <br>  He is obviously well fed—this is not a man who has to do hard, physical work to put food upon the table.<br>  <br>  The luxurious draperies in the background point to a well-appointed mansion.|`|rmnUrL35aa	old and medival|`|tIDmbaexaa	It's a good painting.

ASU is a great party school if you are committed to partying. Let's focus on academics first. The Barrett Honors College is an elite group of students at ASU, and as a group rank in the top ten private schools in the country. If you join this organization, so many doors are opened for you from research, to internships, to free stuff, Everyone in phoenix wants honors students. ASU is so huge that there are so many opportunities for people to get involved in anything they can dream of, especially if you demonstrate commitment.<br>  <br>  That being said, ASU has a very lively party scene. Mill avenue is literally attached to ASU and has dozens of bars. The school is surrounded by Greek Life, apartments, resorts, and houses. A huge fraction of the student population lives within a mile of campus. So yes, if you want to party or otherwise socialize there is plenty of that too. That's the great thing about ASU, if you want it its here.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	It's a good party school, just leave it at that|`|3KcdSxF5aa	its the biggest party school and when you find a big party school its not really going to be a big academic school

Parenthetical information is information which is not important to the sentence's essential meaning; thus it is placed in commas. An alternative is to place them in brackets, which achieves the same purpose.<br>  <br>  In today's writing, fluidity is preferred to sentences crammed with commas.

ziBI7XwYaa	How about Carnevale celebrations in Venice?<br>  <br>  The Venice Carnival is one of the world's greatest festivals. <br>  <br>  Just before Lent more than half a million people travel to the city for its 12 days of Carnival. <br>  <br>  Pageants, theatre, concerts, balls and masked self-display are all part of the celebrations, until Shrove Tuesday signals an end to the party. <br>  <br>  While most visitors come to watch the parade of costumes, music and street performers that pack the streets; others come to participate. <br>  <br>  Masks are on sale everywhere and a lot of temporary shops appear in the street during Carnival. <br>  San Marco Square is the heart and symbol of Venice and come Carnival time it is packed with costumed tourists and locals. <br>  <br>  In the square you can find a lot of mask making and a variety of designs for sale. <br>  <br>  The modern Carnival began in 1979. Its hey-day was in the 1700s but elements of the Venice Carnival can be dated back further. <br>  <br>  The oldest document mentioning the use of masks in Venice dates back to May 2, 1268. <br>  <br>  During the day people dress up and head to the Piazza to be photographed. <br>  <br>  Parents dress up their kids and businessmen can be seen doing their shopping in the classic white mask, black cloak and tricorne hat. <br>  <br>  In the evening those who have spent literally hundreds of euro on their costumes install themselves in the windows of Florian's and pose. <br>  <br>  Carnival is topped off with a ball for the glitterati - the Il Ballo Del Doge, held in a 15th century palace, the Palazzo Pisani Moretta. <br>  <br>  The ball is named for the Doges who ruled Venice in the 17th Century. <br>  <br>  The palace features frescoes by Tiepolo and Guarona, grand sweeping marble staircases and two marble floors candle-lit by chandeliers of Murano glass. <br>  <br>  Four hundred guests attend the Doge Ball each year, all making grand entrances by gondola or boat. <br>  <br>  The entertainment includes opera singing, minuet lessons and the world's most scrumptious dinner. <br>  <br>  Venice facts: Venice (Venezia) is built on 117 small islands and is divided into six quarters: Castello, San Marco, Dorsoduro, Cannaregio, San Polo and Santa Croce. The city has 150 canals and 409 bridges. Only three bridges cross the Grand Canal: the Accademia, the Rialto and the Scalzi.

Last summer I took 8 credits and our summer semester was about 2 months. Trust me when I say that no matter how easy the class may seem, cramming that much information into that short of a time span is very hard work. Also remember that it is 2 hours of homework per 1 hour spent in class, so given that summer classes are generally longer (sometimes 3 hours per day!) plan on quite a bit more than 48 hours per week.|`|XLKrrkKvaa	Calculate two hours of study for every hour of class, You will have 32 hours of study and 16 hours of class, therefore, your time commitment for college is a minimum of 48 hours per week.|`|QV76piegaa	16 in a normal semester I would say no problem... 16 hours in a summer session i would really think twice about though.

All the general information  that a person has to know can be done up through eighth grade. Beyond that is just torturing many students. The common question that many ask in high school, "why do we have to know this?" is warranted. Keep school compulsory up to age 16 (15 for the real troublemakers), however ,after grade 8, separate students either into  advanced academics<br>  (grades 9-12) or trade/technical education. The academic people can go on to be doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs, while the others will have a trade or needed skill.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I think that it is.

y39iNwFjaa	Mengele firmly endorsed the doctrine of National Socialist racial theory and engaged in a wide spectrum of experiments which aimed to illustrate the lack of resistance among Jews or Roma to various diseases. He also attempted to demonstrate the “degeneration” of Jewish and “Gypsy” blood through the documentation of physical oddities and the collection and harvesting of tissue samples and body parts. Many of his “test subjects” died as a result of the experimentation or were murdered in order to facilitate post-mortem examination. <br>  <br>  Like most “scientists” at work in the concentration camp environment, Mengele enlisted the aid of trained medical professionals among the prisoner population to perform the more grisly, or mundane, tasks and to carry out autopsies upon his dead victims. We owe much of our early knowledge of Mengele's activities at Auschwitz to Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, a prisoner-physician who assisted Mengele under duress, and then published his experiences, initially in his native Hungarian, in 1946. (His Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account appeared in English in 1960.) <br>  <br>  Josef Mengele had hoped to use the “research” he had garnered in Auschwitz in order to produce his Habilitation, a second, post-doctoral, dissertation required for admission to a university faculty as a professor in German-speaking lands. He never accomplished this objective.

xxsk7laeaa	You have your angle between the ground and a line from the ground to the top of the tower.  For point A, which we take as x distance from the base of the tower, we know the angle is 40 degrees.  Because we want to find the height of the tower, a length which is opposite from the angle we have, we can use tan to figure it out.<br>  <br>  tan 40 = opposite / adjacent = height of tower / x<br>  <br>  The same goes for point B:<br>  <br>  tan 54 = height of tower / ( x + 10 )<br>  <br>  Now you can solve for x with both equations, and then equate them:<br>  <br>  height of tower / ( tan 40 ) = ( height of tower / ( tan 54) ) - 10<br>  <br>  And then you can just solve for the height of the tower.  Hope that helps.

MCITbIlSaa	If you agreed to "the friend thing" then why are you having difficulty accepting her friendly contact? If you accept her friendship, on her terms, it could potentially lead to more. If it doesn't lead to more, and you shouldn't EXPECT it to, then the worse that will happen is you'll have a good friend. Granted, it may hurt for a while, not getting the depth of relationship you want from her, but her complete absence from your life would likely be no less painful. And who knows, one day your female friend, who likely has other female friends, may introduce you to the girl that will turn out to be "the one" for you.<br>  <br>  PS: I'm a guy, I know guys can be pretty clueless. Whatever you do, don't ASK her to introduce you to one of her friends.

87f0ad7fe13903495b1962fa8df652efaa	The Second Estate was a social level in pre-revolutionary France. It consisted of the nobility, about 2% of the population, yet it controlled 20% of the land and paid very little taxes The Second Estate is traditionally divided into "noblesse de robe" ("nobility of the robe"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government, and "noblesse d'épée" ("nobility of the sword").<br>  <br>  The Second Estate constituted approximately 0.5% of France's population. Under the ancien régime, the Second Estate were exempt from the corvée royale (forced labor on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the gabelle (salt tax) and most important, the taille (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.<br>  <br>  The French nobility was not a closed class, and many means were available to rich land owners or state office holders for gaining nobility for themselves or their descendants.<br>  <br>  Noblemen shared honorary privileges such as the right to display their unique coat of arms and the prestige right to wear a sword. This helped to reinforce the idea of their natural superiority.
