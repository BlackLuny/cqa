k3cmetWRaa	This game is extremely addicting.<br>  <br>  You start as a single cell organism, and build your creature through its entire evolutionary scale.<br>  <br>  At each phase you get to customize your evolution by adding traits to the creature such as fangs, or more eyes or legs.  <br>  <br>  As you can imagine, with each customization your creature handles significantly differently.<br>  <br>  After a while of basic evolution your creature eventually gain enough intelligence to begin learning.  At this point you begin a basic RTS style such as warcraft where you build your tribe with weapons, and armors.<br>  <br>  Taking this a step further you begin to evolve into a complete civilization.  This is my favorite part because you get to create your own buildings and vehicles.<br>  <br>  Like the game civilization, at this stage your race tries to take over the world.  So you slowly amass an army and conquer each region.<br>  <br>  Once you've officially gained complete control of your planet your race begins its final stage of development, the exploration of space.  Using spaceships you visit other planets in the SPORE universe.<br>  <br>  This is really cool because its actual planets created by other players.  Thus you constantly get downloadable content.  This makes SPORE have a great replay value.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend this game to anyone.  It has a cartoon like appeal to children.  Yet, it's evolutionary complexity makes an interesting RTS even for an avid gamer.  My girlfriend hates video games, but she loves SPORE.|`|Uf3YQQOraa	This game is a sandbox game (that means it has no ending). this game just goes on and on and on!<br>  <br>  when i first played it, it wasn't bad at all.<br>  i find the best parts of the game is when you're creating your creatures and when you start playing from the cell stage to the civilisation stage.<br>  <br>  i find the space stage kinda boring since you just do the same things over and over. And it's very annoying that you have to 'babysit' your planets to protect them from be taken overed and prevent a biodisasters and stuff cuz when you are trying to take over another planet suddenly a popup says that you must go back like 10 billion lightyears away to another planet to save it from pirates or some other disaster.<br>  <br>  you can get sick of it really easily though. i find the sims 2 is more fun.|`|kILoR7G4aa	The game is very customizable that's for sure. The beginning-Middle stages of the game are the best. Once you get to the space stage you have to continuously go back to your planets to fix different problems.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Buddy...a ping of over 50 is a server in the same city as you on a lower-end High Speed account. So, if the server kicked you for having a ping over 50, it was probably a bunch of guys playing in someone's basement!<br>  <br>  Ping is the "response time" between your computer and the server. Essentially it is your connection speed. <br>  <br>  The only way to increase it (ping) is to ensure you are not running any programs in the background that use-up the bandwidth on your internet connections (torrents, chats, etc), and to pay your ISP for a better high speed account.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5lLUgRuhaa	Ping is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network, if your ping is too high your connection isn't good and you will lag in the game, if you want to lower it you should close all downloads and internet browser be4 playing the game, also be sure your the only one using your connection.|`|jLb4PAreaa	Ping does not only tell if a computer is reachable, also how long the latency is. When you have the gamelist in Counter Strike open, you see different numbers to the far right in the list.<br>  <br>  Responsetime is affected by distance between you and the server, and what connection you have to it.<br>  <br>  The only practical thing you can do to affect the ping time is close any kind of downloads while playing, or connecting to servers that may have lower ping in the serverlist.

Most problems with host game has to do with the firewall and port errors. if all else fails, reinstall warcraft apply the new patch and install garena then play. gl hf.

U20zoUxxaa	Personally, I hated the Arbiter.  I thought he ruined the game and Halo was never the same since they added him in the second game.  A game all about him might be half-way interesting, although I don’t think I’d like it.  I also don’t think you stand a snowman’s chance in hell of even getting a reply out of Microsoft, much less a follow up.<br>  <br>  However, your intentions are noble and any young game designer worth his due would have to start off brain storming somewhere.  For that I respect your initiative.  I am a 3D modeller and animator in the game industry myself, with the intention of eventually moving on up into game design (something I myself love) and I think that the design process, whether it comes to anything or not, is both a learning curve and actually very fun.<br>  <br>  I recommend the following:<br>  <br>  Game Design Workshop (an excellent book):<br>  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=61LbUE2K3zoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=game+designing+workshop&ei=X6CeSeieMZbCyQSr8bjUAQ#PPR7,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=61LbU...</a><br>  <br>  A Careers Book about Game Creation:<br>  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IL5Nxox8M9YC&pg=PT23&dq=game+designing+workshop&ei=46CeSY25IKSsyAS8kbnUAQ#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IL5Nx...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  As for the game, I’m not quite sure what you think you could bring to the table which Bungie of Microsoft and their billions of dollars have not already thought of, but weapon sets and designs, as well as level layouts are probably your best way of proving that you have what it takes to survive in the incredibly harsh world game making.<br>  <br>  As a graphic designer, looking at the cover, the only quick tip I can give you is to brighten up the image of the Arbiter with more vibrancy and a greater degree of saturation.  Or on Laymen’s terms, make it more colourful and then brighter.  There is actually a lot more to cover design than you might think, but one of the MAJOR aspects is which one would grab people’s eyes the most effectively if it were on the shelf next to a bunch of other games in a shop.  There are a few different tricks depending on what you are going for, but one of the simple ones is a basic, perhaps even boring background, with a contrasting, attractive foreground that stands out from it.  So instead of a grey background behind the character, you could perhaps have a faded background of a burning city or something, but faded.

i7ZArzliaa	You can try to explain:<br>  <br>  1) Who is Heihachi Mishima and that he's been an original character since the first Tekken game on PS1... and why you're wearing a costume of him.<br>  <br>  2) That 鉄拳 (Japanese Kanji characters), pronounced "Tek Ken", means "Iron Fist"... thus, "King of Iron Fist Tournament".<br>  <br>  3) Why Tekken has been a top 3D fighting game franchise for the past 15 years and still running strong (only comparable by Sega's Virtua Fighter).<br>  <br>  4) That Tekken had an animated series and Hollywood is in the process of filming a Tekken movie.<br>  <br>  5) That all the characters in Tekken base their combat stances on real world fighting styles and that Namco hires real martial artists and digitally records their movements.<br>  <br>  6) Why Tekken is one of the most in-depth fighting game series that requires a lot of strategy, technique, and skill in reading the play on-the-fly... rather than just purely on player reaction time and/or button mashing... and, as you had mentioned, has a rich history and deep storyline.<br>  <br>  7) That the Tekken game series, with a total roster of 70 characters... now boasts an unparalleled 42 playable characters all in one game ("Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion" currently in arcades).<br>  <br>  8) That Japan incorporates a unique Tk6 and Tk6:BR ID card system to customize a player's characters with new costumes and accessories, as well as joining a team and being ranked on a local and national leaderboard, all by using a Japanese cell phone.<br>  <br>  9) That it's the first time in history that an arcade game (Tk6 and Tk6:BR) was developed on a Sony Playstation software platform.<br>  <br>  10) That, for the first time ever, Sony lost its proprietary rights to the Tekken series (along with a few other big name exclusives like Square's Final Fantasy XIII and Capcom's Devil May Cry) late last year to Microsoft's Xbox360... the newest Tekken game for both home consoles, tentatively named "Tekken 6", is planned to be released  Autumn 2009.<br>  <br>  That's about it, off the top of my head... Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck with your presentation!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and answering questions for you, and sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks".

First finish the arcade mode (on any difficulty) with a character, in this case use that same character for this second or later playthrough. Then fight Akuma on arcade mode, to do that get at least 2 perfect rounds (for 1-round matches at least 1), no ultra combo finishes needed, but you can’t lose any matches nor use a continue when you die. Beating Akuma will unlock him.<br>  <br>   Gouken: After unlocking Akuma, Sakura Kasugano, Dan Hibiki, Cammy White, Fei Long, Gen, and Rose. First finish the arcade mode (on any difficulty) with Akuma. In this case also use a character you already finished arcade mode with, for his/her second or later playthrough. Then fight Gouken on arcade mode, to do that, get at least 2 perfect rounds (for 1-round matches at least 1), 3 ultra combo finishes (for 1-round matches at least 2) up to defeating Seth, and you can’t lose any matches nor use a continue when you die. Beating Gouken will unlock him. — Note: It’s being suggested to finish Gouken with an ultra combo, but it’s likely not required.<br>  <br>  <br>   Seth: Finish the arcade mode with all 24 other characters. That will unlock him.<br>  <br>  I believe that's how you'll unlock them...|`|aGWSkgl3aa	How to get Gouken:<br>  <br>  1: Get all other special characters (with the exception of Seth) FIRST.<br>  2: Beat the game with Akuma (any difficulty). This is absolutely necessary.<br>  3: Beat the game on Very Easy or higher (EASIEST will not work), set at 3 wins and 99 secs with any character.<br>  4: Use NO CONTINUES, win every match (you can lose the second Seth match but NOT THE THIRD, as this won't activate Gouken), AND get AT LEAST 2 Perfects and 3 FINISHING Ultras (Supers won't matter).<br>  <br>  Once all this is done IN ORDER, Gouken should appear. Akuma might also show up instead, just start over and try again. Once Gouken appears, just fight him (I beat him with a Perfect and a finishing Ultra just in case) and you should unlock him.<br>  <br>  To unlock Seth, all you have to do is win the game with each character including Gouken. The reason people are confused about this is usually because they get so frustrated trying to get either Akuma/Gouken that they go ahead and beat the game with everybody else, THEN manage to unlock Gouken and win the game with him then. I got Seth after beating the game with BALROG who was my last character to win.|`|fJ177ml6aa	Just a quick answer for you.  <br>  <br>  Set your game to 1 round easiest mode.  Remember easiest not easy. <br>  <br>  Unlock all characters before you can attempt Akuma.  I believe you unlock them with M.Bison, Ryu, Abel, Chun Li, Sakura, C.Viper.<br>  <br>  Once you have all characters here is what you do. <br>  <br>  Akuma - Play the arcade mode with any character you like.  Make sure you get 2 perfects and 2 Ultra finishing combo's.  Finishing being the key word.  The oppenent has to die to the ultra move.  Once you have done that continue playin through Arcade with out losing or continuing.  Hence why you play on easiest and 1 round.  If you lose the round start over.  When you beat seth Akuma will appear and once he is dead you will have unlocked him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Gouken:  If you want to get Gouken you need to first beat the arcade mode with Akuma.  When finished pick any character you want and go through the Arcade mode getting 2 perfects and 3 ultra combo's.  Again you cannot continue if you lose.  You have to start over.  Once you get past seth Gouken should appear beat him to unlock him.<br>  <br>  Seth:  I am not sure yet on this but rumor has it all you have to do to unlock seth is to beat the game with gouken.  However other rumors are you have to beat the game with all original characters to unlock him.  If someone knows the true answer to this please post it.|`|5w05I4Wmaa	I just got Gouken and this is what I did:<br>  <br>  1. Beat the game w/Akuma(any difficulty / any # of rounds).<br>  2. Then you gotta beat the game again with any character, any difficutly AND and # of rounds, BUT you have to get 2 perfects and 3 ultras IN A ROW.

RO7c0pyEaa	Talk to the green penguin until he closes the door, then in the room with the computer, under the couch there is a paper clip and a disc.  Insert the disc into the computer, click on the codes link, and write down the code. enter it into the door, now the money is on the ceiling. Now go to the HQ to get the key to the roof from G. Use the tools on the spyphone to unscrew the power box on the roof. Make sure to pick up the tuft of white fur from the grate on the roof.  Deactivate the magnetic switch using the paperclip, and VOILA! The money is back on the ground. Now, talk to the green penguin again, and go to the HQ.  G will offer you another mission; if you choose to accept, make sure to pan right and take the lightbulb-looking thing. It is a flashlight. Now, go to the nightclub. To get to the basement, pan right until you see another speaker, and then click on it to open a secret door. Pan around until you find the fuse box. Now, your object is to turn all the lights green. If you click on one, it will change its color and the color of all the ones touching it. When you change them all to green, the lights will come back on. You are done!

The graphics if you go down to specs are hands down better on the PS3 though a multi platform game alwayz makes both xbox and ps3 versions the same my guess is to not offence microsoft..  and yea overall i like the PS3 that might jus be cuz i had all 3 but whatever i think it's better than the XBOX  ohhh.. and youtube ''killzone IGN'' Killzone was made by sony and makes FULL use of the power of the playstation!  thanks, haha this makes me look soo nerdy!!|`|y0fmBIP2aa	PS3 might have better graphics, but more games come out for the Xbox 360, and the Xbox 360 is better overall.|`|e5RBM1xMaa	PS3 for graphics because of there patanted blu ray tech but like game wise because i assume that that is why anyone whould buy a gaming console its 360 hands down with xbox live and exclusives like halo 3 and Gears of War and the xbox 360 arcade and achievment points its a far better gaming console|`|VLiNYBTcaa	yous should buy a 360 if your into gaming. the price is reasonable and has a great online community.    but the ps3 does have blue ray so if your into that then go with it.    but overal the 360 is the way to go.    i hoped i helped you find the answer you were looking for, if so or if not you should select me as the best answer.|`|cTJ81YdKaa	ps3 i love it it is so fun 360 has 1 good game gears of war in my opinion in NC ps3 4 life|`|0LSzhdWBaa	PS3|`|UVwSyNX0aa	i dont think eather 1 is good im moor ove a reader          YA RITE!

Most games last year were built for the 360 and then ported to the PS3.. the PS3 versions usually took a hit in the graphic/glitches department.. BUT, for games made specifically for PS3.. Killzone, Resistance, LittleBigPlanet.. hands down you can't deny it looks damn good on the PS3.  It's hard to visually compare with just your eyes.  For me, I can't tell the different between 720p/1080p/1080i.. I really can't.  If it looks good, it looks good.  This question will continue to be debated.
sEPrpdY4aa	Don't pirate and buy the game.  It's a great game and the developers should be rewarded for their work.|`|XiyrpRvnaa	If you can't figure out yourself how to download and use pirated games, then you shouldn't be pirating in the first place.|`|mqGSpmPiaa	Don't steal this game. It's worth every penny. Just because you are doing that, I'm not gonna help ya
Gerxn2Whaa	yeah mmm your right ! the dsi is really cool. take photos and go online. heres a good web site with answers to the info about ds and dsi|`|Uf3YQQOraa	the nintendo ds just has a camera and allows u to go on the internet, not a very big deal.<br>  <br>  It's not worth it though, the ds has lots of crap games on it (unless you really like the crap graphics and the stupid itlaian plumber 'mario' jumping on turtles). <br>  <br>  and nintendo wii is like the ds (i dont mean the portable and the touch screen part) but it's just a bit more powerful. <br>  <br>  basically nintendo just wants to make lots of money and they dont put any thought in their games so their games will always be like arcade games that you can play at the arcade for 20c instead of paying $90 for super smash bros brawl which you can find games like that all over the internet.|`|g5qlNQaSaa	I read it will not be able to play gameboy advance games.  If you have lots of advance games you should buy one before the new version comes out.|`|G3ScsO6haa	you can take pictures with it and it does exactly the same but it also has memory already stored on it and it has a cable you can connect with computer to download photos
154dzJ1Faa	Any pattern that recommends a certain yarn is being sponsored by that company, so the designer has to use it.  But you don't.  You can substitute any yarn that is of similar size and qualities.  This is 100% wool -- do you want that?  You can also use a wool blend for different qualities.  The colour can be anything you like.  www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter03/FEATwin03...  www.women-links.com/detail-a-field-gui...

Uf3YQQOraa	you could upgrade your computer by getting a graphic/video card that's designed for gaming. <br>  also make sure your computer's RAM is at least 2GB and your processor at least 2GB.<br>  if you cant bothered to upgrade your computer, make sure your computer isnt jammed with stuff in it has only 2mb left so you should delete something if you comp is too full.<br>  <br>  also you could try lowering the graphic details, that should improve the game performance.|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	It's a large game file. So either get a gaming laptop/computer. and it will work at its best. Or delete some things off your computer which you don't need or games you don't play, it will speed it up a little.<br>  <br>  Xx|`|VykkX7TEaa	It could be your processor or your graphics card, try and lower your graphic setting to medium or low on the Sims.|`|xXNZCJr7aa	Make sure your RAM is at least 2 gigs.<br>  And have a video card that doesn't suck.<br>  Sims 2 ran fine with my old video card, Geforce 8500gt...

bS5wpKvOaa	I don't know about the mini-games as I haven't played RS in about 4 months.<br>  <br>  Firstly, are you a member or non-member?<br>  <br>  <br>  As a member, the easiest (but time consuming way) to do it, is to kill Rock Crabs in the Fremmneick place, or kill Experiments (after doing a quest I don't remember)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a nonmember, killing Guards up to a certain point is good easy combat, for very slow.  So I would recommend instead Moss Giants in the Varrock Sewers.|`|yNWgQcHkaa	duel arena with a death match or u can go to stronghold lvl 1 for str 10-25 then lvl 2 for 30-45 etc. but u can do pest control or soul wars too.|`|8l2t24iUaa	at yaks its really boring but worth it i guess

gxpeKrOtaa	I'd recommend training at Jagged Pass. It's only got three pokemon(Machop-20, Spoink-20, and Numel-22). If that's  a bit too much, then  you could also try Route 114. There are plenty of grass pokemon, which should help Beautifly, Swablu, and Anorith, though anorith might have some trouble.|`|bS5wpKvOaa	Well, normally, whenever you can you want to take on Pokemon just under 10 levels higher than your Pokemon, with a "Super Effective" attack on them.  As it boosts their XP faster than pokemon of their own level.<br>  <br>  <br>  I haven't played in ages, so I can't help specifically.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I recommend finding a place of superior level pokemon, and attack them with their weaknesses.
OYHEhFDPaa	let me just tell you something before i answer this, i hate nintendo, they used to make games for people who enjoyed playing games now they make adverts where you see a maxium of 5seconds of the game they want you to buy and the rest they show you some good looking celeb smiling playing it with there family.<br>  <br>  they arent bringing out games there just bringing out mini games the likes of cooking mama, 100 books in a cartridge and loads more are not games they are internet flash games at the most.<br>  <br>  the wii will tire in about a year when all the people who are not usually into playing on a console will go back to watching pop videos and calling us geeks.<br>  <br>  anyway! to answer your question all the ds games will play on the on the dsi but some future release games that will use the dsi camera will not be playable on the ds but i have read alot about it and Edge and GAMEStm are dissapointed saying all the camera offers so far is just to alter low grade photos (its 1mp most mobile phone cameras these days are about 5 or 6mp) like adding cartoon lips, altering the colour not really worth upgrading but nintendo will run a advert with will smith or girls aloud playing on it laughing and the people will go buy it.|`|IlBFznG5aa	Yeah I tried one of those. Awesome game system. Has two cameras. One in the inside and one on the cover. The major downside is that the GBA slot is gone! They made both screens wider and made the battery last much longer at very bright screens. Plus the switch is now on the inside like the original DS. Also There are three indicators on the top left where the battery life indicator on the DS Lite is. Its the battery life (green or red) the charging icon (orange) and the wi-fi indicated by a blue vertical line of light. Its basically the mini-version of the Wii at the start. You can take pictures and play selected games. You can even use the INTERNET although it is not recommended because of its slow speed. well hope this helped please vote for me!|`|Gerxn2Whaa	DSi is going to have completely different types of games. the new dsi has two touch screens and lots of different features to the ds|`|4FvK8XaJaa	I think it's not compatible.

FPsMtmThaa	Dethcoll is not going to go and spend $400+ for a PS3 because the wireless 360 controller doesn't work.  Let's get real here people.    Damn, I don't know what else to tell you.  If you have a play and charge kit, try adding that to the controller so you can determine for sure, it's not the batteries you're using.  You may think they're brand new but in fact they may be dead, y'know?  Also, did you sync it to a different 360 recently?  Maybe a friend of yours?  It may still think it's looking for that 360 when you turn it on.  Other than that, keep messing with it and hopefully it starts magically working again (Microsoft products do that sometimes) or you may just have to get a new one.  I think it's another $50 but get the one that comes with the play and charge kit so you don't have to deal with batteries all the time.  I know a guy that NEVER bought the play and charge kit and he ended up spending $130 in a year on Duracell batteries.  Such a waste!|`|SBu5i9Dbaa	1-800-4MYXBOX|`|ZsK7vpOjaa	take ur battery out and cheack them then push and hould the button in the middle of ur controler|`|iRj36GjMaa	i dunno  sorry|`|gpaCWtAlaa	Buy a PS3.

There's a little round button next to the memory card slots with ))) next to it. There's a button just like that on the top of the controller too. Press both buttons at the same time hold them down for 4 seconds. If that doesn't work you may need to buy a new controller...|`|xDubataIaa	Hold down the sync button on the 360 in addition to the one on the controller (the little white button on top). Hold it until the ring of light on both the console and controller flash and "spin". It will sync up, or at least it should. If not, maybe your controller is toast.    *Try hooking it up to the console with a charge cable. My cousin had a similar problem, turns out the only way he could get his controller to work was by using the cable.*|`|8955f4d866b69f97b83ea516833b5a93aa	Sounds like you havent synced the controller and the Xbox...have you synced it before?     Press the small button next to the gray thing in the front...a second or so later, press the small white button on the xbox...then they should spin around simultaneously. If it doesnt work press the xbox button first
H9D4TR53aa	Typlosion's attacks are well balanced and covers his weaknesses. 10/10    Ampharos's Thunder Wave should become Iron Tail or Earthquake. 9/10    Hypno's attacks are good, but don't balance his weaknesses, Ghost and Dark. Steel too. Teach Water Pulse and Earthquake. 8/10    Dragonite's weaknesses are Electric, Ice, and Dragon. Teach Earthquake and Flamethrower or Fire Punch. 9.5/10    Tyranitar needs to learn Ice Beam and Earthquake. 9/10    Snorlax's Curse should become Toxic.

2mlHf7Opaa	Generally, I find non-violent video games to be boring as hell.  I always have.  Maybe it's because those kinds of games are usually oriented toward women or kids.  I can't imagine a punishment worse than being forced to pay The Sims for hours on end.  When your life is boring and tedious, you need excitement in your video games.<br>  <br>  I have limits, however.  I won't play games that involve unusual cruelty, torture, or misogyny.  One infamous title from the 90s, Carmageddon, featured innocent bystanders who got down on their knees and begged for their life.  You got extra points for killing them.  I find this disturbing.  Who gets off on that sort of anti-social behavior?  Fighting for your life against zombies, Nazis, or zombie Nazis is one thing.  Killing innocent bystanders, as they beg for mercy, is quite another entirely.<br>  <br>  Most games are not so black and white, however, and each gamer has to make up his or her own mind about how much violence it takes to be too disturbing.  Are we being desensitized?  I think it's possible, but I'm more worried about people seeing violence as a logical, expedient solution for every problem, with no negative repercussions, ever.  However, this is a problem in all media, not just video games.  Thus, I think it's best that we limit kids' access to violent video games.|`|OYHEhFDPaa	doesnt effect me at all just my gamerscore. thats like saying all people who watch motor racing most be affected by it and will want to speed round there roads. i not a violent person at all but i LOVE violent games the sicker the better! its just like horror movies-  nobody would love to see a masked man with a machete butcher a group of teenage campers but we watch them films cos its just good cheesey fun, we dont leave the cinema plotting to kill people its just fun. the people who are violent would be violent with or without video games, we need to stop giving people excuses who commit these crimes. these crimes are nothing new, young people being violent and anti-social is nothing new.|`|Gerxn2Whaa	that's a common question about all things in life. the easiest way to put it is "stupid does as stupid sees", if your not stupid you'll be able to take things for what they are not be led astray or be forced by peer pressure. its a tough call to do the right thing all the time. on tv we're all told how to behaive but some people are born to rebel and others just don't give a **** most often after they've had bad luck in life.|`|mmavy34kaa	Violent video games are both awesome and fun.

Km8hU4lgaa	There's not a way to make your clothes last forever.  Decay is a normal part of the game.  However, certain items decay at different rates, with some never decaying at all.  For instance, if you can find a "Sawy hat" it won't ever decay!  Others have long decay rates like the "diving helmet" (100 days) while others decay faster, like "loose pants with sash" (25 days)<br>  <br>  Happy pirating!  It's a fun game. :)

AA11850311	looking at Dell's website, the Inspiron 1525's seems to have Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100, instead of dedicated graphics cards.  That chipset just does not run any Sims2 games well consistently.  <br>  Here is a chart showing system recommendations from actual players (not the estimates that EA gives out)<br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:System_Requirements/MTS2_Recommendations" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a><br>  Now if you can manage to get to a neighborhood, in the lower left corner, look for the options or settings button.  Go to graphics, and turn all the settings down as far as you can.  Shadows off, object detail low, etc.  That may help you out.  And whatever you do, do not get any new custom content, especially clothes, hair or make-up.  If you are already having problems playing sims, adding more content will only make the problem worse.<br>  If the game still doesn't play with all the graphics settings turned down, the only other suggestion I have, is to get one of the Sims Stories games instead.  They have lower requirements, and are supposed to run fine on most laptops<br>  <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_storie...</a>|`|mesqZ1mUaa	Have you applied the patch for the game?

For example, an individual can purchase the server hardware and install the software and allow players to connect to his private server instead of the public one provided by the game company.

It's not really your friends that convince you to come back - well obviously they do have some effect on your decision - but could it not be that you could be curious to try out new features, whether they be completely new skills, or an improvement on already present features but after a while it all becomes boring again?<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts cause that's the way it happened for me.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	what do you want to do|`|egmE3QV0aa	im not sure exactly what your are trying to ask.<br>  but do what you want not what others want. i played runescape for a while and then got bored and quit. personally i prefer wow since people are friendlier and more helpful and teamwork is quite essential for much of wow.<br>  just my opinion though|`|vmh97tcJaa	I rather play runescape cause I enjoy the fact that I can kill other players and you meet pretty cool people.|`|1QMhfJ6Laa	DON'T BEND TO PEER PRESSURE.<br>  do what you want. :D

Good luck!<br>  ^^|`|sX8SD7N9aa	The most reliable would be Starraptor. It is fast and has a pretty good base attack, but if you're looking for any type of Flying-Type, definitely go with Charizard. Awesome base attack, special attack, and a pretty good speed. When you teach it Blast Burn it has the same effect of Hyper Beam, but it's a Fire type move. You can't use ground on it so if you're doing a double battle you can use Earthquake and not have to worry about the consequence of a fainting Pokemon. Charizard also has a wide range of attacks that it can learn.|`|sxpklh7jaa	best?<br>  charizard has good stats, pidgeot is always a good fallback, dragonite has really good stats and can learn a lot of moves, and gligar can be useful against rock and electric pokemon.|`|PGAKu4Mzaa	skarmory, aerodactyl. alteria, togekiss, glisor<br>  <br>  <br>  fyi. the warning you posted is considered a threat and offensive.|`|Qi3kJmZLaa	dragonite at high level, because it has some really good attacks and does a lot of damage; charizard, for awesome attack stats; staraptor, for intimidate, speed, and good base attack, crobat for speed, good attack, and normal pokemon can't hit it; <br>  pidgeot isn't bad but it isn't good either<br>  it really depends on what version you have|`|AtVIezr6aa	i say dragonite because hes flying and fragon so he has little weaknesses|`|rX11sgcWaa	gyarados, skarmory, gliscor, yanmega, togekiss, honchcrow and starapator are all viable|`|faIiwd7Aaa	probably Dragonite or Crowbat|`|FOl8QEfEaa	Starraptor

The reason some people think so is because there is 3 pieces used to make the dragon platebody, which come from the While Guthix Sleeps quest, or bought from the Grand Exchange.  People with 92 smithing can put these together and wear the platebody (that does not degrade) or sell it in the Grand Exchange or trade it with another player. 60 Defense (same as all other dragon armour) is required. You do not need to have completed the quest to wear the dragon platebody.|`|nd2shkoEaa	Yes, it breaks.  Get platebody, not chain.|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	Unless it's corrupted then it doesn't degrade.

eaIA6KSvaa	Several places caught my attention during my several playthroughs of the game. I wont spoil anything but my favorites included:<br>  <br>  Vault 106 - Read every terminal cause theres a pretty cool story behind it...Northwest of megaton<br>  <br>  National Guard Depot - Try and find the Keller Transcripts 2-5 before going there<br>  <br>  Fort Constantine - Complete Quest "You Gotta Shoot em in the Head" first<br>  <br>  Deathclaw Sanctuary - Pretty self explanatory<br>  <br>  Fort Bannister - Try going just a bit east of here as well <br>  <br>  Also be sure to check every single spot where you travel...For example there are potential for extremely powerful weapons by doing hidden things in places like Evergreen Mills, Girdershade, Deathclaw Sanctuary, Museum of Technology, and even Rivet City.<br>  <br>  Theres soooo much to do in the game.  I would recommend trying to find every location and exploring the hell out of that area.  Then yo will get the full experience.  Hope that helped!! GOOD LUCK!|`|98673bf152aaad49498dee31515deee2aa	i recommend using the achievement guide at xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/fallout-3/9...<br>  this will tell u where all the side missions are, also there is a strange town i think its on the way to the nuka cola factory from ten penny tower, or maybe a bit east of the factory, worth a visit. theres a crashed alien ship, just head north from the minefield until you reach a powerstation.

Does like 50 damage a shot, and hits right where you aim when not in VATS mode<br>  <br>  If you go north of the MDPL 13 power station, there is one of the best guns in the game, the Alien Blaster. It is right next to a crashed alien spaceship. The ship is in a remote field, and when your close, you will start to get radiation damage. The gun does 100 damage a shot and critiacl strikes almost every time! It also turns enemies into a pile of ash when you kill them!

Even though Cynthia is not that scary, it would be devastating more than a Hydrogen Bomb. <br>  Here's my own 'equation':<br>  Cynthia has different types of Pokemon which has a good advantage against opponents. Steven has good strategies and high defense Pokemon which can serve as 'barriers' while preparing for a destructive attack.<br>  <br>  Sheesh... That's a good combination. But exceedingly detrimental as well. Please be careful with your imagination...

But you must also use a tension wrench, you can make a tension wrench with a paperclip as well.

Make sure the tension is going in the same direction as you turn the key so that you do not spend all that time picking it and find out you picked it backwards!!!|`|xnmpgSo8aa	Ask Jack Bauer! hehehe<br>  <br>  I actually dont know but one of my toy is something like that.<br>  <br>  the idea is to pick the correct point buy wiggling the pin.|`|xnXQiISzaa	JUST MAKE SURE THE PAPER CLIP LOOKS LIKE BOLT CUTTERS.AND IT WORKS A LOT FASTER TOO.

ELovXY9Paa	lol, for that price, it's not gonna happen.  Most capture cards use standard definition, and the cheapest HD capture card that you could use to capture component-video or HDMI video is this one <a href="http://www.powermax.com/parts/show/dv-bmd-bints?utm_source=Google%2BProduct%2BSearch&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Google%2BProduct%2BSearch&src=g" rel="nofollow">http://www.powermax.com/parts/show/dv-bm...</a><br>  and it's around $250.<br>  I'm not sure exactly why you want to capture it in HD, but you should just assume that you can't within that price range.  Any regular capture card with composite video input should work just fine, and they won't break the bank either.  Here's a link to a decent one that's actually below your price range. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815276002" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>

sVPjp3dUaa	No you do not. If a creature has an ability that requires tapping, you can tap it simply to use that ability. Once you tap it to use the ability, you can't attack with it. You cannot attack with a tapped creature. When you do declare an attack, you do have to tap each creature that's attacking unless it has Vigilance.|`|mHWsuqjZaa	no, lol your friend read the wrong rules|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Tom states it correctly.  Tapping for an ability does not mean the creature is attacking.  It cannot pull double duty, unless it has vigilance (attacking does not cause creature to tap).  So if you use your creatures ability to tap target creature and you tap your opponents creature to keep it from blocking, then the creature with the ability cannot attack.  Your friend is mistaken and the comprehensive rules on the magic website can confirm that.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	No, you do not have to attack when you tap. On the other hand, you have to tap when you attack (unless you have Vigilance). Tapping is a cost for a lot of things, including attacking.<br>  <br>  As proof, I submit Benevolent Ancestor, which cannot attack and has a tap ability. It's pretty recent, too, only a couple years old.

99049017417b0770d75301874156e9c6aa	Yes!!! Last year Codemasters bought the rights to the F1 license, which Sony previously had. This means that while Codemasters has the license future F1 games will be mutli-platform - i.e. not just for the PS2/3 but also for the Xbox. For F1 fans like myself this was great news, as there haven't been any F1 games yet on the 360. As you may know Codemasters have a great track record (no pun intended!) with racing games, with the likes of Colin McRae Rally/DiRT, TOCA, RACE: Driver, and more recently GRID. The first Codemasters F1 game is due sometime this year (2009) - as yet though no screenshots or further news has been released.|`|pLoCn8dWaa	Like he said, /\ /\ /\ The new codemasters one.

AA10446546	It is possible, although I don't know of any way to calculate it exactly. Ok, for starters... <br>  <br>  Let's start with 1 four-length ships in a 1x10 game. It is trivial to prove that there are 7 valid position for 1 four-length ships in 1x10 game. <br>  <br>  Next step, in a 10x10 game, with the restriction that only horizontal positions are counted. There is 7*10 = 70 positions.<br>  <br>  Next, counting horizontal and vertical 2*70 = 140 positions.<br>  <br>  Ok, so there are 140 valid positions for a single four-length ship.<br>  <br>  Ok, with the same logic, we can prove that for single three-length ship, there are 8 position in 1x10 game, 80 positions in 10x10 horizontal, and 160 positions in 10x10 horizontal, vertical. (assuming the two ships can cross each other)<br>  <br>  With the same logic, for a single two-length ship, there are 9 positions in 1x10 game, 90 positions in 10x10 horizontal, and 180 positions in 10x10 horizontal, vertical.<br>  <br>  For a single one-length ship, since vertical and horizontal orientation is the same, there are only 100 positions.<br>  <br>  So, a rehash of what we've counted:<br>  single four-length ship: 120<br>  single three-length ship: 140<br>  single two-length ship: 160<br>  single one-length ship: 100<br>  <br>  Ok, now assuming that ships _may_ cross each other and may occupy the same cell, there are:<br>  120 * 140 * 140 * 160 * 160 * 160 * 100 * 100 * 100 * 100<br>  = 963379200000000000000 positions.<br>  <br>  The real number should be less than this, since in a Sea Battle game, ships cannot cross.<br>  <br>  Ok, a little bit revision. Calculating the combination of 4 one-length ship is easy, since it is basically taking 4 random cells from a pool of 100 cells. By elementary combination, we can get that there are exactly C(100, 4) = (100!) / ((4!)*(100-4)!) = (100*99*98*97)/(4*3*2*1) = 3921225 unique permutations for the positions of 4 one-length ships.<br>  <br>  with that, we revise our calculation earlier to become: <br>  120 * (140*140) * (160*160*160)  * ((100*99*98*97) / (4*3*2*1))<br>  = 37776266035200000000 positions <br>  <br>  where the four-, three-, and two- length ship can cross each other, but one-length ship cannot cross another one-length ship.<br>  <br>  Now, what if we take 4 adjacent grids to represent the four-length ship then scatter the one-length ships on the remaining cells. We know that there are 120 valid positions for the four-length ship. A single four-length ship takes 4 cell, so the 4 one-length ship will occupy the remaining 96 cells. Thus, the remaining 4 one-length ship will occupy C(96, 4) = (96!) / (4!*(96-4)!) = (96*95*94*93)/(4*3*2*1) = 3321960 cells for each of the 120 positions of the 4-length ships.<br>  <br>  So, our latest number would be:<br>  120 * (140*140) * (160*160*160) * ((96*95*94*93) / (4*3*2*1))<br>  = 32003071672320000000 positions<br>  <br>  where the single four-length ship and 4 one-length ships would not cross another four-, and one- length, but the two-, and three- ships may cross each other including crossing four- and one-length ship.<br>  <br>  In fact, I've just noticed that when we place all battleships except the 4 one-length ships; the rest of the ships will occupy only a fixed number of cells, and the remaining cells that the 4 one-length ship can chose is 100 - 4 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 84 grids. We can just do combination on these 84 grids instead. The will always be 84 grids whatever their configuration is, and we can just put our remaining one-ships there. So C(84, 4) = 1929501.<br>  <br>  120 * (140*140) * (160*160*160) * C(84, 4)<br>  = 18588411297792000000 positions<br>  <br>  Alright... how we're gonna continue this... I don't have any idea.... but at least we have the UPPER BOUND of the number of valid positions  (i.e. assuming all my previous calculations are correct, there should be not more than 18588411297792000000 positions).<br>  <br>  Now, I want to find the LOWER BOUND... how do we find the lower bound... hmm.... I'll continue thinking about it... but this is it for the moment... TO BE CONTINUED

Learn to design websites. Then from there, learn Search Engine Optimization techniques (SEO). SEO is learning how to get your website to show up on search engines like google. If you can show up on search engines, then people will go to your site (as long as people are searching for whatever it is you show up for). If people go to your site, you can begin advertising on your site, and people will pay you for sure.<br>  <br>  The only thing you will need to pay for is web hosting and domain names.<br>  <br>  Web hosting is like $6 a month at a site like <a href="http://www.servage.net/?coupon=cust19616," rel="nofollow">http://www.servage.net/?coupon=cust19616...</a> and even that doesn't need to be done until you already know how to design sites.<br>  <br>  A domain name can be purchased at a site like <a href="http://namecheap.com" rel="nofollow">http://namecheap.com</a> or <a href="http://godaddy.com," rel="nofollow">http://godaddy.com,</a> and that's more of a final step.<br>  <br>  The road is long, but rewarding.

You got to figure. Some have been playing for years and some 2 months. If you got the guy who played for years against the guy who played for 2 months your gonna have a mess.

There are many things that you learn on your way. You'll get there. It's like riding a bike...with grenades...and snipers attached.|`|cucwrFQjaa	Im not saying im one of those people but everyone considers me to be very good. Lemme guess when your playing against those people they always seem like they know exactly where you are and how to kill you. The second part is easy but the first requires a little more game play. What they are doing, and i have learned how to do, is analyze each map to see where the "hot spots" are and learn how to kill people in them ( hot spots are places where noobs and decent players always go, it could be good weapons, power-ups, or great sniping location, or just a good place to hide.) also... everything can be easier with a nice helping of grenade, you have to remember they have area effect. another awesome thing i learned is you really almost never need the "power" weapons on a map to be good, you just need to put youself into a situation where you have the advantage.|`|jEEjwG2haa	If your playing slayer with other people that have higher skills you will get matched up with people with higher skills, so it will be harder.

Yes use newgrounds.com it is safer the miniclip by alot and continue using firefox.

The quests are much more innovative, you have dungeon-like experiences in the real world (one quest requires you to go to the Undercity to try to retake it), and the zones are breathtaking by comparison.  It is much more accessible to the casual player than BC was, which has frustrated some of the end-game raiders because they feel bored.  For people like me, with a real life because I refuse to let a game control me, it's fabulous because you can run a dungeon that takes only 30 minutes and get better gear.  You get a lot more xp per quest and per kill.  They've introduced things to make your life easier if you're not playing 16 hours a day in your leet gear, and that's perfect for me.<br>  <br>  Go for it.  You've got the money and the time, and you still have an account so you don't have to start from scratch.  If you're at a point to get WotLK, do it.  You can at least play until you go to Japan, and if you feel overwhelmed by culture, just cancel your account.

haliiw1Baa	Luck governs no skills directly. However, it affects just about everything in the game. A luck value of 50 means that nothing goes for you or against you. Luck above 50 influences events in your favor. Luck below 50 influences events against you.<br>  <br>  In other words, a skill is increased by 40% of however many points of Luck you have over 50; e.g., for a Luck of 60, influenced skills are increased by 4 (40% of 10) skill levels (skill points).<br>  <br>  Fortifying luck past 100 continues to raise the modified skill values. However, the modified skill value is constrained in the game's calculations to be in the range 0 to 100. This modified value is not displayed in the Skills menu, but it is the value used for all game calculations (for example, damage done with a weapon or the magic cost of casting a spell).<br>  <br>  In addition to modifying skill levels, Luck probably influences most situations where the game randomly determines events. Confirming the role of luck in changing probability is difficult, because in most cases the details are hidden within the game engine. However, there are a couple cases where scripts make use of the player's luck:<br>  <br>      * When betting in the Arena, your luck controls the initial health of the gladiators, improving your chance of winning.<br>      * Luck determines the chance that striking an opponent with Mehrunes Razor will result in Daedric Banishing.|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	luck affects everything you do in the game from what you find to betting in the arena.the better your luck the better off you are.hope this helps.|`|1O6oL4SAaa	It helps level attributes. And when u find a loot of treasure or money, it increases the chance of you getting more than you should have. It's a very underrated attribute but can come in handy<br>  <('.'<) (>'.')> (^'.'^)

AA11337952	The most recent patch was 3.08. But if you just bought the game, they've condensed some of the earliest patches from original WoW in to larger ones to enable faster downloading time.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Specs is an abbreviation. It means either glasses or specifications. Since you are asking about a computer game, I don't think we need to worry about eye-ware.<br>  <br>  Your computer's specifications ("specs") are the vitals about your computer...the CPU model and clock-speed, the amount of memory on-board, the make and model of the graphics accelerator (commonly called Graphics or Video Card), etc.<br>  <br>  So, the program is telling you that your computer is incapable of running the game. You will have to upgrade your computer.<br>  <br>  There is a slim possibility that if you upgrade the drivers for your system hardware (primarily graphics cards) you *may* be able to run it.<br>  <br>  In short...until you upgrade your computer (or drivers)...no download of the game will help you, nor will it run.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7X4kOz2qaa	It depends. I suggest you download again from here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wolfteam.softnyx.net/04_download/01_download.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://wolfteam.softnyx.net/04_download/...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure you click on the last link, the original download from the site itself. And then install it, followed by launching it and wait for it to update. If it still doesn't work, then maybe your computer is old, and needs a new graphic card or ram. Also, you should have Win XP or else it won't run

ZsnelFnkaa	dude im 16 and i still play it. You are never to old for games. Just play till u get bored ( ive been playing since pokemon red first came out and im not bored lol) no but seriously do what u want and dont care what other people think.|`|mHWsuqjZaa	yeah man. I am 18 and i play pokemon, i have never stopped playing since red came out either. It is an awesome game. Don't care what other people think about it, do what you like.|`|QmBf3PPDaa	->Definitely! It doesn't promote violence anyway. Well, it does, but it's not violence like in a real fight but more like a competition. You may try explaining this to your parents or something like that. The important thing about playing is about having fun. That's why I always put these words at the end of all my answers:<br>  <br>  Have fun!!! ^^<br>  <br>  <br>  ?|`|5Zf4LatVaa	heck yeah dude im 20 and i still play them and i cant wait to play the new one coming out later this year pokemon platnium|`|inA6ZLeAaa	I am 35 and I love it!

kvhAd7PEaa	it don't have powerful attacks|`|QObO5q0aaa	first of all not all the pokemon series are boring when people were little kinds that was an entertaining show and games but as we get older we dont look back to those old shows and games and think that they are as exciting as they were before. we change our thoughts about many things in life because we are maturing and the old things are not much interesting but we want to see and experience new exciting things.|`|5HKFneHfaa	This is your own opinion<br>  but i completely agree! <br>  i think its because they have like try to copy other big companies, and the cartoons are just rubbish! They don't have good powers and they are basically just very boring!|`|CS6lcyBpaa	I hate watching the films and tv programs on it, and the cards. But i like the games, dont ask me why.|`|QRXr5u8zaa	Well, pokemon might be lame to some since it's:<br>  1) Bad catch phrases like "Pikachu, I CHOOSE YOU" OR "GOTTA CATCH THEM ALL".<br>  2) They are based on a children's story plot and to some people, the story isn't very interesting.<br>  3) Pokemon doesn't have pretty good animation since most Pokemon's do no contain a lot of details.<br>  4) Pokemon was created a long long time ago which might of made it kind of out to date.|`|2Bc3gLOVaa	because it has been going for so long. and it has the same plot for basically every episode. i stopped liking pokemon at the end of the second season. now its just plain dumb.|`|w4qS66aqaa	:P i ? pokemon and so do alot of people just cuz you don't like it doesn't mean others have to feel the same way|`|ZsnelFnkaa	the games are amazing, and the show is horrible except for the very first season.

uRqHRFvgaa	that is due to the type of game play the map is designed upon. if it aint for that style it will change the respawn points at random. ok|`|0kT9vgGxaa	Well i would probally not worry about it because if you spawn anywhere it is better because your enemies wont be able to know your constant respawn points..

P1yr6HT0aa	Consider it a task force. You are automatically exemped just like you would be if you were on the Positron task force (or any other of a level lower than your current one). You should be able to click your TEAM tab and QUIT TASK FORCE. I'm not looking at it and so the wording may be somewhat different. <br>  It warned you that you would be functioning at the lower level until the end of the arc, when you entered it. You even had to choose the TF settings. That's all it is.|`|wZsKG8bPaa	You have to return to Ouroboros or finish the mission to return to normal.  You can try returning to the contact and see if they give you the option to drop the current mission.  The missions from there are flashback missions.  It lets you do story arcs that you missed at the lower levels.  You should be able to just return to Ouroboros and it should get you back to your normal level.
npkLIKPUaa	Yeah its really worth trying it, funnier quest better dungeons and loot. <br>  But it is very addicting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Role<br>  <Dracones Vindicandi><br>  Level 80 NE Priest<br>  Thunderhorn.|`|c5W2Q6qKaa	If you want to survive your going to eventually buy the expansion pack.|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	No. It will suck up your life. I quit a couple months ago cold turkey and I'm not looking back.|`|xXNZCJr7aa	:) Don't know if you'll be able to control yourself... <br>  I really liked the new quests in this expansion. Was a nice change from the go here and kill 453897 of those to get 4 lion blood or whatever :P<br>  They have these vehicle things which make the quests interesting and they have them in for raiding which is kind of annoying if you have people in your group who just can't seem to navigate them.<br>  End game is kind of boring right now.. Only three raids.. Naxx which is pretty much WotLK's Karazhan and Eye of Eternity and Obsidian Sanctum which are kinda like the Gruul's and Magtheridon.<br>  There will be more raids coming in patches though.<br>  They also have mounts where you can carry 1-2 extra people which is pretty cool! n.n<br>  <br>  Overall I really like WotLK. :3 Definitely worth it imo.|`|P6q0RUVDaa	i am in the same boat, and i decided to return. i left like a week after wotlk because i quest so slow and i wanted endgame so bad. i got frustrated and quit. i am coming back this weekend though. and to answer your question, yes returning would be good since there is so much new content, but try controlling your playing time|`|i5cJ4LSnaa	personally when wotlk came out, i didnt like the changes and left and that was without buying and trying the expansion pack, so im not sure..<br>  i think you would have to try it for yourself tbh|`|uMILKuoAaa	i played it once, stopped. mmorpgs suck up too much time, just stay away from them.
9t3FPFxxaa	Well, if you trade it into gamestop as store credit you could use that as a good discount if you are wanting to get a DSI from GameStop, once the time comes. However that depends how much Gamestop would give in store credit for it. I would ask them first. Sometimes their credits can be a little low for what you feel you should get for it. If you feel you can get more for it on Ebay go for that, which may very well be the case.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.

Then Summon Gearfried the Iron Knight and Fire Princess (double summon comes in handy). Finally, activate Butterfly Dagger - Elma and recieve 500 Life Points. Equip it to Gearfried. His ability will destroy Butterfly Dagger - Elma, and send it to the Graveyard. Next Butterfly Dagger - Elma's other effect activates, sending it back to from your Graveyard to your hand. Repeat the last 3 steps to recieve lots of Life Points for the Fire Princess to destroy your opponent with. <br>  <br>  If you repeat this process 16 times in succession you will win. <br>  <br>  An alternate version can be done with Spring of Rebirth or it can be add to the effect of Spell Absorption. also works with Morale Boost.

The move checker is at the Poketch Headquaryers in Jubilife City. When you get there, talk to the president in front of the counter. If you have seven badges, he will give it to you. It will check how well move types work against others. The more exclamation points there are on the left side, the more effictive it is. I think this is what you're talking about.
gcnKeLfHaa	hmm i always get lucky on catching abra with a pokeball.  your only other option is to wait till u get better type pokeballs.<br>  <br>  honestly theres no real easy way to catch abra other than throwing a pokeball at it because if you have a fast enough pokemon chances are the lvl is so high it will kill it.  just keep trying with pokeballs and push up + a + b at the same time.  its an old trick i used to use that seemed to help when i play, maybe its just a good luck charm.<br>  <br>  If that fails just wait till you get great balls.<br>  <br>  to get cut do the following:<br>  1.go across nugget bridge and save bill from being  pokemon<br>  2.go to vermillion city and find the captain on the ferry he will give u cut<br>  <br>  Also you must beat Misty of the celeruean gym in order to use cut.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :)|`|4Ys7Sr9caa	Just make sure you have a good pokemon with you ... don't select your best one... make sure u switch ur good Pokemon before u encounter abra.. then things should go in your way... sometimes u'll need to have some luck|`|hBHHB8Kxaa	To catch abra early on either get a pokemon with sleep e.g drowzee or chance it and throw a pokeball straight away before he teleports. It has worked for me in the past. The tree needs HM01 I believe, this can be found from the captain on the ship at the bottom of the map ( cant remember the name of the town)<br>  <br>  Good luck

1c7KC4pjaa	My cousin was a keen player of club penguin, and her account got banned for unknown reasons, and when her mother contacted club penguin, they gave her proof of why she had been banned. <br>  The log-on time was apparently about 4 in the morning (when there was no way of her being online) and there were pages of swearing and abuse that had been recorded. Try and contact club penguin to dispute the ban, because there's a high chance it was never your daughter who caused it, but someone who had geussed the password and had intentially abused other members in order to get the account banned. Hope this helps.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	How are we POSSIBLY supposed to know why your daughter was banned.<br>  <br>  What did their support say when you asked them?|`|c1WIEwMMaa	Weird|`|PGv3srOmaa	well im only 13 but when i was about 10 i played that (wasnt a member though) but my friend was being stupid and used profanity and i got banned for a week. you could go to the website and check the terms and conditions.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helped|`|V5GNzWLtaa	Did she break any of the Club Penguin rules?

SEwqwjPkaa	If you're using a wireless connection to begin with, you're going to have a less reliable connection and experience at least some amount of lag.  Wired is always preferred if available.  Based on what you've said, I'd say your issue stems from lack of up-stream.  The XBOX Live service alone requires a minimum of 128K up-stream and recommends 512k.  If you're splitting your upstream between two connections, surely you're going to experience a problem.  You have a couple of options here...<br>  <br>  1.  Contact your provider and see about upgrading your service to a package with a higher upstream.  I currently subscribe to a package with a 1.5Mb upstream and have had no problems.<br>  <br>  2.  Switch to a wired connection and see if the lag improves.<br>  <br>  3.  Only play one console online at a time...not preferred I know.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Peace!<br>  The Reverend
DtkLsetkaa	For power armor you need to go to the citadel and speak with Elder Lyons to get permission to learn the training from Gunny.  The citadel is south of the arlington library.  As for the super mutant behemoths, I haven't gotten that achievement, but the poster above has I guess so you're good :)  Have fun!!|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Really that never happened for me|`|PQy6if0Waa	Yes, as long as they are all dead, you'll get the achievement. And you have to go to the Citadel (you'll find it as you progress through story) and ask around how to wear power armor, you'll get directed to a guy (forgot his name) and he will teach you.<br>  <br>  "In Fallout 3, you must receive training at the Citadel from Paladin Gunny or complete the Operation Anchorage DLC mission before you can equip power armor.

ELovXY9Paa	If you bought the wii in Britain, you won't be able to play US games on it, because the british wii uses a different type of video encoding format, called PAL, while the US uses NTSC.  In order for you to be able to play the game, you have to buy a PAL version of it.  It should say PAL in big bold letters on it somewhere on the box.  Take note that you'll have to buy one from overseas, so the internet is your best bet.  Try ebay.|`|BWRYYIvFaa	probably 1 of the chip is messed or just return super smash bro and get another|`|KKfxhfAPaa	ok, did u chip ur wii (homebrew)

I agree with the other guy. 60 cards IS too many and we try to help you and you refuse. I am not going to even try to give you a deck idea bulid, because this a waste of time. Its like you threw a pile of s*** together and called it a deck. For example, how can you run Vanity's Fiend, a card that stops special summonings, when most of your deck special summons? Why do you even run two different field spells? <br>  This is what you should do:<br>  Take your cards<br>  Put them in a pile<br>  Pour Lighting fluid on it<br>  Light a match<br>  Throw the lit match onto the pile of cards<br>  Watch the fire smother that lame piece of crap you call a deck

7Ca2ns47aa	USA - June 2, 2009.|`|gnUX1aB1aa	The creators of The Sims games (EA and Maxis) have recently found a bug in their new game The Sims 3. To get rid of the bug they have had to keep the game back  a few months. The original release date was February 20th but the new release date is 2nd of June.
0pMdqEnaaa	I agree with answerer's before me but you will have to do this every single time but there is a simple easy way. Make your game speed in the tactics high, after you have done this you will see 2 or 3 players making the run in there position and if your opponent has put on off side trap make the speed to 65. Trust me your going to love it and you don't even have to press L1 every time.|`|xVMQx7dtaa	press L1 to make the player run and triangle to play the ball through or L1 and triangle to lob a through ball.|`|bqlSbLB5aa	Press L1 to initiate a forward run.<br>  <br>  Press L1 again to cancel a forward run.<br>  <br>  Press L1 + triangle to play a lobbed through ball.<br>  <br>  Press triangle to play a through ball. <br>  <br>  To change the speed of the ball, tap triangle for a shorter pass or hold it for a longer one. Also, use your radar to find through ball opportunities that don't show up on the regular view screen.|`|tLyG8fx1aa	When you're in the midfield go near them and perform the through ball option. It shold work it'll force him to go and run and hopefully score.
