20090310025432AAyAvMo	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why do I keep seeing the same questions on yahoo philosophy?	Now, don't take it offensively or anything. It's always nice to see bright minds questioning the aspects of life and all, but what is the dealio with the halt in social progress? I mean, when are we going to get a new renaissance period or a new enlightenment period where we start thinking differently and coming up with new ideas? Are we ever going to branch out into a new form of "revolutionary" thinking, or has that well been tapped? When will originality make a comeback? Because if not, we're looking at a very dull and absurd future.

20090310030120AAQEbcJ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your opinion on dreams? do you think they have meaning?	So.. I'm sure Im not the only one who is curious about our dreams.. and am not the only one who would like to know why we have them... my belief is that no one honestly knows why we exist.. and we would all like to figure it out, dreams can take us to a whole other world with out leaving your bed, I've had dreams I've felt more alive than I ever have in my waking life.. I think there is something about them that is very real.. there's just something we can not quite grasp no matter how much we would like too.. I mean like think about it really... if there was absolutly nothing.. no planets.. no people no animals... not even the color black or white. I think if you start there then everything that exists is just a thought right? I think dreaming is pretty much the most amazing escape from daily life/ realitly and pain. Maybe.. everything you have ever known or seen becomes part of your dreams... no matter how odd it seems whatever you are truly wanting or longing for deep inside your heart or even something you unconsiously locked away in the back of your mind can become your own dream.. I think dreams tells you how you really feel about everything.. like your relationships.. friends and family.. people in general. I hope someday we can come up with the technology to record our dreams.. they say on average you have about 5 dreams a night but we only remember bits and pieces of one or two. Anyway.. this is just my opinion none of this is offically a fact.. I just wanted to know others opinion.. am I crazy lol.. or do you agree with me at all??

20090310032742AA2fgI0	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	When you have a feeling for someone(that butterfly feeling) do you think they can have that same?	feeling about you. Or They can try to block it out just because. If you get those feelings about someone you can try to force them out because they can mess up your relationship you're in. I believe both girl and guy had that funny feeling for each other(at the same time) but they know how to control them.       I also believe men dont talk about those feelings as much, casue they're suppose to be this alpha male thingy. so in order for them to not look like a wuss, they deny the feelings. it a lil puppylove feeling that can go away.      Take angie jolie and brad pitt, what if they were fighting those feelings and couldn't do it know longer. or ppl that work together or ppl just hooked up and didn't know it would be like that.

Here is the poem, it may be easier to read it in this link:      Mending Wall   Something there is that doesn't love a wall,   That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it   And spills the upper boulder in the sun,   And make gaps even two can pass abreast.   The work of hunters is another thing:   I have come after them and made repair   Where they have left not one stone on a stone,   But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,   To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,   No one has seen them made or heard them made,   But at spring mending-time we find them there,   I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;   And on a day we meet to walk the line   And set the wall between us once again.   We keep the wall between us as we go.   To each the boulders that have fallen to each.   And some are loaves and some so nearly balls   We have to use a spell to make them balance:   "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"   We wear our fingers rough with handling them.   Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,   One on a side. It comes to little more:   There where it is we do not need the wall:   He is all pine and I am apple orchard.   My apple trees will never get across   And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.   He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors."   Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder   If I could put a notion in his head:   "Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it   Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.   Before I built a wall I'd ask to know   What I was walling in or walling out,   And to whom I was like to give offense.   Something there is that doesn't love a wall,   That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him,   But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather   He said it for himself. I see him there,   Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top   In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.   He moves in darkness as it seems to me,   Not of woods only and the shade of trees.   He will not go behind his father's saying,   And he likes having thought of it so well   He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."      OR        http://www.ketzle.com/frost/mending.htm       QUESTION:       1. What is the "something" that "doesn't love a wall?"      2. Do you think this poem has a deeper meaning, or is it just about a stone wall?      10 points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please read, kinda long?	i dont know a link for it! sorry! please read, 10 PTS BEST ANSWER!          Creative Short Story    The hallway was silent as the teen escaped the humid, sticky summer air and walked into her familiar high school. Everyone knew what had happened; the news was all anyone could talk about in their little California town. The whole state knew the wildfires were getting bad...but no one could have predicted it impacting anyone at their school like it had.       Sympathetic glances were thrown her way as she dragged herself through the school. Her peers wanted to talk to her, to make her feel less alone. But what was one to say? The subject made it far too awkward to act normal around her. It seemed like everyone was bending over backwards trying not to make her upset, or trigger a nerve.      Of course Rachel knew nothing would be the same. Even her best friend Elizabeth had no clue how to comfort her in her darkest times. "Rachel, I'm really sorry about everything that happened. You know your dad was like a second father to me, and I practically lived at your house..." Was the only thing Elizabeth had said.      "Yeah, I know." Rachel's short reply came.       Even the teachers disregarded her spaced out behavior. "Rachel." Mrs. Keopke called. "Rachel." She repeated a little louder. Elizabeth kicked her softly from under the table.      "What?" Rachel replied, startled.      Mrs. Keopke sighed and said,“Never mind. Hailey?"      The saddened math teacher was originally calling on her for the answer for the eighth math question, but changed her mind and shuddered when the front page newspaper headline crawled back into her memory.       Rachel and Elizabeth made their way through the lunch line, but when they got to their regular table, Rachel wouldn't touch her food. "Will you please eat? You're starting to worry us." Hailey stated quietly.      "I'm just not hungry..." Rachel mumbled, staring at the table.      All the people sitting down looked defeated and went back to eating. Elizabeth shot her a pleading look, and Rachel grudgingly picked up her sandwich and took a bite. Getting the food in her system wasn't for herself, Rachel was selfless, she would do almost anything for anyone if it made someone happy. Everyone stared at her until she swallowed. Once she did, Elizabeth smiled and the mood was instantly uplifted.       Rachel was absolutely dreading eighth hour. The teacher had an unexplainable hatred for the two best friends, and that feeling was returned. Rachel took a deep breath and stopped at the doorway.      "Come on Rachel." Elizabeth told her, obviously confused.      "I can't go in there! Mr. Rehailing loves making me miserable! It's going to be horrible!" She practically screamed. It was the most and loudest Rachel had talked all day. Elizabeth was taken aback by her outburst.       Rachel took a deep breath to prepare herself and walked in, trying to act confident. She sat down and prayed for the next 45 minutes that lay ahead to go smoothly. Even Mr. Rehailing seemed a little more tolerant of Rachel's spaced out behavior. All was going fine until the stressed out teacher snapped. "Excuse me Ms. Harford," Mr. Rehailing started, referring to Rachel. "I would appreciate it if you would pay attention just like everyone else. I am very sorry about the tragedies of the death of your father and your house burning down, but instead of dwelling on this, you should listen to the lesson and find closure on your own time." There was not one person whose jaw did not drop to the floor, including the principals', who happened to be standing in the doorway,      "Excuse me Mr. Rehailing! Can I please talk to you in the hallway for a second?" The appalled principal said.      Rachel tried her best to hold it together, but failed miserably. "Come on Ray." Elizabeth whispered comfortingly. She took Rachel’s arm and led her out the door and into the girls’ bathroom.      "Thanks Liz." Rachel whispered back.      "Don't listen to anything he said. Okay? That dude is crazy, not to mention evil." Elizabeth stated, trying to get the whole situation on a lighter note.      Rachel’s' lips curved up the slightest bit, maybe not even a visible smile; Elizabeth could have imagined the whole thing, but it gave her hope that her best friend would be okay. All that Elizabeth needed was hope. Now that she had it, she would hold onto it with everything she had. "Thank you so much for being here for me. I really appreciate it...I know I can be a handful sometimes." Rachel said this time with a tiny smile, at least it was visible this time.      Tears ran freely down both their faces, which was very odd, not for Elizabeth, she was always the open, emotional one. But Rachel tried with every bone and muscle in her body, with every inch of her mind, to be strong. Some people may wonder about such dedication to this seemingly silly thing. When she was ten, her dad let his guard down, and her mom stepped out of their lives forever. That was the only thing Rachel knew about

20090309150058AAFBo3k	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	This is a poem i wrote today. I wrote it about my favorite music/ visual artist because she inspires me and i find her beautiful. Its not really complete but this is what i came up with.      "I can hold, for you, all sands, soils, suns, and seas. I am them. I am born of this."   She says this time and time again but does not utter a word. I look upon her; earthy and world born. The leaves and flowers adorn her, and  the beauty that she possesses flows deep into them.    Flows like her delicate arms as she sings ".....is she suffering?"   Natural like the streams she speaks of often. Unlike the flowers surrounding her. She never wilts, nor droops.    Never caves beneath the oppressive cold winds of the wild. She blooms with, and not against it.   Ages like the wine that crosses her lips that she parts often to bless us again.   Small but she cannot be broken you see.   The sweetest fruits tempt the wildest of beasts.    Nape of neck. Small of back. Curve of shoulder.   Slim hips that this cruel world will not allow to bare fruit.   But in this time i refuse to believe that her works are in vain.   You see   She lulls me to sleep every night with quiet whispers and sighs.   Arouses me to life in the morning with strain in her voice and sorrow in her heart that slips from her mouth as she exhales.   In these times where much of her work has been done, I wonder where she is. I wonder if she write stories of her dreams as i do.    I wonder if she sits in silence spinning webs of the thread that cling to her.   I wonder if has looked on her work and seen what shes done for few.   I wonder now.   ".......is she suffering?"      Thanks for reading.   I know its a bit long but i hope that you think it's ok.

Sorry there aren't indentions for the paragraphs.  :D      Today was unquestionably the last day of my world, but here I was, standing on the shore of Lake Michigan with my hair whipping around me like an auburn mane and my teeth gleaming like pearls in the sunlight.     I had to keep that smile plastered to my face.  Everyone was going to form their last memory of me today, and I refused to go down as a sulky little brat.  As sad as I was inside, I couldn’t let it show like Skylar, who sat at my feet in solemn silence.    Most of us had been like that all day.  All along the vast beach I could see people slouching over on rocks, pouting at the shimmering blue-green water.  They’re grave attitudes made keeping my spirits up feel futile.     “Oh, for crying out loud!  Stop standing there all smiley,” Sky barked.  I jumped as she chucked the rock in her hands at the lake, shattering its surface into a million crystals.     “Rela-”   “Don’t tell me that,” she snapped, cutting me off.  “This isn’t a time to be wearing a smile so just stop, okay?  It’s not helping.”   I drew in a deep breath.  This was the millionth time she’d done this in the past hour, when was she going to give up?   “Sky,” I began hesitantly, glancing down.  Her eyes weren’t exactly patient, so I had to talk fast before she cut in again.  “I don’t want to be sad-”   “No one does!”     “Will you just shut up and let me finish?”

20090309151116AAO3xd7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like the beginning of my book?	My life is alright, I'm a good kid, I dont cause trouble and I'm interested in fantasy. Tommorrow is my first day of Fifth Grade, I'm a little nervous   but I know I'll get through it. I live with my mom and my two annoying, but intelligent sisters. My moms name is christine, my sisters names are   Sarah, and Felisha. I would describe them as smart troublemakers. I'm the only decent kid in the family. My dogs name is tyco, he matches me. I could start   at any point of my life telling it to you, but I have to get to bed, I really do have a big day tommorrow, atleast I think. "Wake up sweetcakes!"      I hate when she calls me "sweetcakes" It gets annoying. Anyway heres the big day, I hope it doesn't fail on my fun meter, I think school is boring, but lets    see. It seems that my teachers name is mr.anderson, and he teaches math, social studies, and science... yawn... The other kids look weird to me, alot of them   are small because i'm in fifth grade. Well heres my classroom, a couple of desks, a whiteboard, books, hey...? Whats that... Hmm this teacher   might not be boring at all, he has guns and swords and armor hanging on the walls, It's either hes cool, or a crazy nerd. I cant wait to find out, you know i'm being   sarcastic... right? okay. Hmm... He actully looks like a cool guy. He has a nice haircut, with a design, a scruffy itallian beard, a formal jacket, wich smelled like   coffee had spilled on it, and he actully didn't put me to sleep. He act's out the battle scenes in social studies, he gives us candy for solving problems in math,   and in science he actully lets us use college devices. I hope this year is going to be okay. for once it might be fun. Some of the kids are weird... I do    like this girl named Freitta, she is chinese. There is a kid named Zachk, he picks his nose and wipes it on people, that is plain old disgusting...   There is a bigshot that plays football named kyle, he thinks he is all that, I hate kids like that, immature and useless. I've made a best friend and his    name is Trevor, we talk about everything together. The day was okay -- not the best not the worst, but okay. When I got home my mom cooked us a nice meal,   and my sisters had terrorized my room, again. I had to brush my teeth, and go to bed... Probably one of the best school days I have ever had. Anyway, Fifth   Grade is nice, and I enjoy it so far. Day two is coming up, and we have a field trip tomorrow. Everytime I go on a field trip I get in deep trouble, or    wander off into the woods. I'll have to act on my best behavior, this is fifth grade you know.

20090309154012AAMGIyN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can someone please read this?	Okay so I have to write this story for my English class and I was hoping I could have someone read what I have so I know if I should continue with it or come up with something else. Thanks to everyone who reads and to those who leave comments constructive or otherwise.      Daytime was just far too predictable. Growing up in a small town with an even smaller population of 820 people – 821 including myself –  made your day so slow paced you often end up staring at a wall wondering how you haven’t died from shear boredom yet. Today I was going to school and coming home for lunch. Other than that…nothing.   I groggily pulled myself out of bed and walked over to my window. Peering out I could see that it was going to be a sunny day. A rarity here in Central Falls.  I quickly pulled out a outfit from my closet and walked into the shower. With that done I went downstairs for breakfast. “Hey Kiddo!” My mom called from the living room. Though she preferred being called ‘mom’ I often times slipped. “Morning Carol.” My mom – rather step mom- and I had never been that close. The only thing we ever had in common was our love for my dad. But when he died he took with him any good feeling I might have had for his young wife. The only response I heard was a grunt, but I didn’t care. I walked over to the cabinet and pulled out a box of cereal. Carol walked into the room then. “Why don’t you ever eat anything else? I swear you go through ten boxes a month all on your own.” This is one of the reasons I disliked her. She liked to nit pick. “I like cereal.” I lied. I just didn’t like cooking and cereal saved me the effort. “We’re almost out.” I added. I could have gotten it myself but she didn’t exactly trust me with money. Not after I spent it all on a cute outfit. She forced me to return it the next day. But not before I managed to hide the matching shoes. “You know what?” Her voice sounded unusually cruel. She never acted upset with me unless I truly deserved it, so this brought me up short. My head snapped up to look at her. She just continued to stare at me- her eyes glaring with fierce intensity. Did she really want me to answer that? “I’m tired of this. I thought your attitude was due to your father’s passing. Now I can see it’s just the effect of teenage revolting.   If you want cereal you’re going to buy it. And with your own money.” She added before   I could request she give me any. “Fine.” With that I walked out the kitchen door leaving my uneaten food on the counter. I wasn’t hungry anyway. I walked past the two cars in the driveway. Mine and hers. I would have drove to school but in my haste to get out of the house I left my keys behind, and returning would be not only unnecessary but embarrassing. I looked down at my feet as I walked along humming to myself a song I had just heard the previous day on the radio. “Ugh!” Suddenly there was not a sidewalk in front of me but a boy. Okay so boy was an understatement. This guy looked like a god with his hard jaw, softly rounded lips, thick eyelashes lining the most beautiful eyes I had ever seen. I couldn’t help but stare up at him while he glared back at me. Then it dawned on me. I had just crashed into this ‘Angel like Man’ and was rude enough to stare at him in awe. “I’m so sorry!” I finally managed, my cheeks coloring a vibrant red. His glare softened slightly. “Just watch where you’re walking. You never know who you’ll walk into.” With that he walked away while I stared dumbly after him. Wasn’t he going the wrong way? He looked about my age and if that were the case… the only high school around here was in the direction I was walking in. Had he been going in that direction he might have saved me the embarrassment of walking into him. Maybe he forgot something at home.

20090309163050AAZiTaM	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Should we do all things that are important, as if our life depended on them being completed?	Most things people put off till to tomorrow -- put off till later as if they will be different later, when more than likely they will do the same thing continually until it is too late. But if ones life depended on it, they would do it as quickly as possible.

20090309162222AAxJ2Vs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Langston Hughes poem?	We should have a land of sun,   of gorgeous sun,   And a land of fragrant water   Where the twilight is a soft bandana handkerchief   of rose and gold,   and not this land   where life is cold.      We should have a land of trees,   of tall thick trees,   Bowed down with chattering parrots    Brilliant as the day,   And not this land where birds are gray      Ah, we should have a land of joy.   Of love and joy and wine and song,   And not this land where joy is wrong.                  Where does the metaphor appear in this poem?  WHat does Langston Hughes want us to see from this metaphor?  What other peotic devices has he used in this poem?

20090309160722AARbUxP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What is your interpretation of this poem?	Would you believe it, I got lost again    And all roads led to Rakestreet. Which was which,    The short road or the long? A girl of ten    Behind her counter, drew me a thumbnail sketch      Of space in time. The Big House was, she said,    Five minutes away, or seven hundred years.    Nephin, nebulous in its hat of cloud,    A reference point. I would never get out of here      Unless I fell in love with my condition—   Rakestreet, with its boy behind the bar,    Its sweatshop, and its permanent television    In the background, rumbling from afar      Of war and worldly sex, greed and ambition,    While the dead slept under lichened stone    Behind Kilmurry chapel. Older than religion,    Older than history, this quiet need to atone      By staying local, once at the very least,    For an hour, a day, a lifetime. Marry the girl,    Buy up the stock, become one with the deceased—   Let Crossmolina and the Big House world      Be damned to its own eternity, Lough Conn    Forever signaled, never come upon,    Lose itself, like the reason I came    In the first place, and my aboriginal name.

20090309163619AAWyfMp	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Dishonesty -> insanity.  I reckon.  What say you?	Okay, here's my argument.      P1:  Sanity (def) 1:1 relationship with reality.  Not necessarily all of reality, just the bit of reality necessary on the day.  (sorry, talking in shorthand)   P1a: Insanity (def) inability to distinguish reality from fantasy.      P2:  Lie (def) deliberate overlay of fantasy upon reality, with the deliberate intent of replacing the reality one is hiding, with the fantasy one is creating.      THEREFORE.... do do, do.      A lie is a deliberate act of insanity       AND THEREFORE  wham bam, thank you ma'am...      Dishonesty is a CAUSE of insanity.      Shall I continue?  that THEREFORE      Insanity is caused by dishonesty  (Can I reach that one?)      Anecdotal:  my dad was a shrink.  I never met a loopy (his word, not mine) who wasn't a shocking liar.  In fact, I have NEVER met anyone mentally unwell at all, who was not a terrible, terrible liar.  I've seen them smoke a cigarette while telling me they didn't smoke, for heaven's sake.  I'm not going into why they lie - obviously, hangups - but THAT they lie.      So there.  Have fun.  Dissect!  Best dissection, or should I say dismemberment, gets ten points!      tra la la...  ;o)      Oh: and just to top it off, Yahoo  want to categorise as ...      Sports, handball.        What a stunner.

20090309161422AAwJ0Cs	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can I enjoy what people can offer me and not focus on what they can't offer me?	I easily move on from people when I find a few things I dislike about them. At first I do try hard to make things work but if the main things are missing I really can't go on because it's usually very draining for me. Like, I reaaally love deep conversation and I ditch people if they aren't able to reach the depth that I desire and am used to. I really don't like to think I'm arrogant and above everyone. I reaaally don't think I'm like that. I just like to find people exactly suited to me and I feel most comfortable and happy in deep, open conversations. Also, I'm not afraid to be alone and wait for the right people to enter my life. Problem is, I often feel great people are booted out of my life when if I was a little more accepting of certain traits that I dislike, my friendships would last much longer. And while I hate the fact that I easily move on from people, it's so easy for me to do it because I'm content alone/with few friends that are totally right for me. But it's an awful mentality, isn't it? Just because some people aren't completely what I seek I leave them. Why can't I just enjoy whatever they /can/ offer me and not focus on what they can't offer me? =o(. It really bothers me but I don't quite know how to change it. I want to hold onto people more tightly. I don't want to be so independent. I want to care more for people and be more accepting. How can I work on this?

What reward did Kipling suggest the "white man" gets for carrying his "burden"?      Who did Kipling think would read his poem? What do you think that this audience might have said in response to it?         THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN:      Take up the White Man's burden--   Send forth the best ye breed--   Go bind your sons to exile   To serve your captives' need;   To wait in heavy harness,   On fluttered folk and wild--   Your new-caught, sullen peoples,   Half-devil and half-child.      Take up the White Man's burden--   In patience to abide,   To veil the threat of terror   And check the show of pride;   By open speech and simple,   An hundred times made plain   To seek another's profit,   And work another's gain.      Take up the White Man's burden--   The savage wars of peace--   Fill full the mouth of Famine   And bid the sickness cease;   And when your goal is nearest   The end for others sought,   Watch sloth and heathen Folly   Bring all your hopes to nought.      Take up the White Man's burden--   No tawdry rule of kings,   But toil of serf and sweeper--   The tale of common things.   The ports ye shall not enter,   The roads ye shall not tread,   Go mark them with your living,   And mark them with your dead.      Take up the White Man's burden--   And reap his old reward:   The blame of those ye better,   The hate of those ye guard--   The cry of hosts ye humour   (Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--   "Why brought he us from bondage,   Our loved Egyptian night?"      Take up the White Man's burden--   Ye dare not stoop to less--   Nor call too loud on Freedom   To cloke your weariness;   By all ye cry or whisper,   By all ye leave or do,   The silent, sullen peoples   Shall weigh your gods and you.      Take up the White Man's burden--   Have done with childish days--   The lightly proferred laurel,   The easy, ungrudged praise.   Comes now, to search your manhood   Through all the thankless years   Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,   The judgment of your peers!

Re-write the following as if you were talking about yourself, but make it sounds personal (And believable), not textbook.       Scorpio is the astrology sign of extremes and intensity. Scorpios are very deep, intense people, there is always more then meets the eye. They present a cool, detached and unemotional air to the world yet lying underneath is tremendous power, extreme strength, intense passion and a strong will and a persistent drive. Scorpios have a very penetrative mind, do not be surprised if they ask questions, they are trying to delve deeper and figure things out and survey the situation. They always want to know why, where and any other possible detail they can possibly know. Scorpio's are very weary of the games that other people try to play and they are very aware of it. Scorpios tend to dominate and control anyone that lets them, or anyone that they find weak. The person that a Scorpio respects and holds close to them is treated with amazing kindness, loyalty and generosity. On the outside, a Scorpio has great secretiveness and mystery. This magnetically draws people to them. They are known to be controlling and too ambitious but only because they need control for this makes them feel safe.      Thanks in advance. xxx

20090309160018AAdqkCd	Arts & Humanities;History	Academic resources on 'female healers' as victims of the European Witch hunts?	I'm looking into the idea that the victims of the European Witch hunts were mainly female healers (mid-wives, etc.). The fact that the majority of the victims were female is a verifiable fact, but where does this idea that they were medical specialists come from?   Does anyone know of any unbiased academic sources for this information? All I seem to be finding are radical feminist tracts or crackpot pseudo-historical theories.       Since this idea of the woman healer/priestess as the main target of the witch hunts has become so pervasive in modern times you would think there would be some good solid evidence (archaeological, written records, etc.) but I'm just not sure this theory can be backed up with valid historical evidence.       Does anyone know of any good sources on this subject that aren't written by someone with an agenda? (Regardless of what that agenda might be.)      Two I've found so far that aren't terrible are 'Woman as Healer' by Jeanne Achterberg and 'Witchcraze' by Anne Barstow.

A POISON TREE              by: William Blake (1757-1827)                  WAS angry with my friend:               I told my wrath, my wrath did end.               I was angry with my foe:               I told it not, my wrath did grow.                               And I watered it in fears,               Night and morning with my tears;               And I sunnèd it with smiles,               And with soft deceitful wiles.                               And it grew both day and night,               Till it bore an apple bright;               And my foe beheld it shine,               And he knew that it was mine,                               And into my garden stole,               When the night had veiled the pole:               In the morning glad I see               My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

20090227145732AAQWTw8	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does this quote relate to the world today?	The primal instinct of social interaction and logical cohesion seen in humans gives us the ability to build civilizations and cultures--our God given intellect enabling us to surmont the challenges that face us by relying on the rational processing of human thought; Although this privelege of ours--this diving gift from the most high was built on the emphasis of intellectual expansion and thus, society as a whole was built on this solid foundation,human nature and its various impediments -- greed, power, control and the like-- that defies the divine nature within us all and lowers us to the mundane, emphasizes our innate nature to have faith in a higher order. In times of perilous mutiny, when anarchy runs rampant and the analytical components of human intellect does not convey to logical reason, human revert back to an elemental phase of savagery; depending more on the physical attributes that coincide with their existence--the lowers orders of Maslow's Hierachy of Needs-- that the inner savage within us emerges and competes with the intellectual aspect of our being. -- Zahir A. McNeil

20090309171242AAd5kSp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my writing.....any suggestions?	I wrote about a paragraph out of my fantasy story that I plan on writing for fun soon.Here it is.....      Karen Numasse proceeded cautiously down the dark, rather frightening, hallway that seemed to go on for an eternity. She would never have guessed that this was part of the same structure as the glorious Temple of the Light. Even the lower quarters of the white robes laid several stories above her. The stone floor was damp for some reason and Karen shivered as her foot stomped on something that squished under her weight, then shivered again simply because of the cold. She refrained from looking down at whatever it was she had trodden over, partly because of her fear that it may be yet another deceased rat and partly because she knew it would not have done any good. The corridors of the floors several stories beneath the ground level of the temple were very badly lit, and there were large gaps of darkness between the pools of light that surrounded the lanterns hanging on the walls. The servants often tried to skip their duties when they were ordered to light the lanterns this low in the temple as it was usually useless. Karen stared at every dwindling flame on every lantern that she passed fearing that it may go out any second. She could use Cal’Aldazar to light the hallway easily, but keeping the hallway lit for long would begin to drain her energy slowly, and the Father knew she needed all the energy that she could muster for this task. She scowled and gripped the note she clutched in her hand tighter as she stepped in yet another puddle, causing the hem of her dress to become even damper than before. Father of Light! She could have wept! No, she would not let her guard down; she needed every ounce of concentration she possessed to do this. Grinning slightly with relief as she entered a pool of light, she lifted up the letter that had brought her down here. Unfolding it and carefully smoothing it out, Karen read it yet again…..      excluding the parts that you have to have read the rest of the story to understand,was it interesting?What did you think of it?Any suggestions on how to make it better?Any input would be greatly appreciated.

20090309171242AAnCDuI	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Looking for the titles of these books?	I am looking for the titles of these two books and was wondering whether anyone knew what they were called.      1)The first book I remember picking up and scanning in the bookstore a few days ago.  I was in the teen section and there were a lot of copies so it was probably a popular book.  The cover had a woman's face with a close up of the lips so the eyes were cut out.  She was wearing glittering gold lipstick.  The summary said the main character's (I can't remember her name) stepfather had just died and her mother shipped her off to live with her grandmother in Connecticut.  The main character had a man who she kept seeing around.  I flipped to a random page and it was talking about the girl how when she went out to her car she found gold glitter dust everywhere and big animal foot prints that she thought were a dog's.      2) The second book I read quite a few years ago.  It was fiction and about a man who worked for the CIA but who had quit.  Since he was a skilled detective a vampire comes to him and tells him he has to help the vampire solve a bunch of vampire murders.  It turns out the vampire murders are being caused by a scientifically created vampire who needed to feed on the blood of other vampires in order to survive.        I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could tell me the names and/or the authors of either of these books.  Thanks.

I was chatting up the play I'm in rehearsals for at a reading I did yesterday, only to discover myself surrounded by women who had auditioned for my role and weren't cast.       There followed an uncomfortable pause, punctuated by the odd cricket sound and many a nervous harrumph. Naturally, I tried to mollify everyone by making the excuse: "I guess you sucked." But they weren't buying it, and rendered my liver grievous harm.      Okay... I'm kidding about the last couple of bits, but what do you do in a situation like that?       It started off with them asking me what else I was working on, so I told them and did my actor's duty of gently plugging my show. I didn't know any of them auditioned. I felt terrible.       Is there any smooth way out of that situation?

It was like a nightmare, with tidal pools of emotions flying right at me. Ugh, why do people act like they are never going to see someone again when they go off to school. I mean it’s not like I wasn’t going to call. I’d like to see them try and stop me.     I hated packing. It was one of those things I could never be sure about. Did I bring my flip-flops for spring? Did I remember my scrapbook from the summer? I hated not being sure. I’ve always been organized, whether it was my room, or planning one of my mother’s many marriages and even making sure my boyfriend Dexter’s socks were put away.  If my mother were to take even a sock out of my room, I would know it. It helps that every time she comes in my room, she makes a habit of picking up my hairbrush or books, and when she’s examines it to her liking, she puts it back somewhere around the room. I never confronted her about this; I knew later when I would find her she’d be back to writing one of her books.      That was the one thing I have always been sure about in my life. When that curtain was down, watch out. My mother would sit in the sunroom and type, just type. The familiar sounds of my childhood, the click and clack of those keystrokes. It was as if that was my own lullaby written by her. But it wasn’t the one I listened to every few nights. Not the one that soothed my pains and sobs at night.   ***    There was a knock on the door. Damn I, I had just started packing my clothes and was folding that by item and color. I hated being interrupted. It was the day before graduation. My family and friends would soon be joining me; however it was still early for them to arrive now. I had a guess at who would be at the door though.    And I was right.    As soon as I opened the door, I was ambushed. Suddenly all I could see was think black curls, and I was being embraced so hard I could hardly breathe.  The familiar hair, the anticipated hug, and that smell of dog, he was finally here.    “Dexter!” I gasped, “I can’t breathe!”  I struggled to get free and yet part of me wanted to stay. I haven’t seen Dexter in a month, a long one at that. Every night he would call and tell me about how Monkey, his dog was and what new adventures him and his band mates got into.  It was my favorite time of the day, only because I could finally talk to him . I never expected to feel something like this. A couple of years ago, I would wince at the sound of love. I saw how my mother would fall in love and out and get hurt on several occasions. I didn’t want that for me. Love just wasn’t worth the pain. It was amazing how I could feel like this and my mother the total opposite.  She hoped that with every marriage, she would get that love that her characters in her books would always get, the I-can’t-stand-to-be-away-from-you kind.  I just never thought my rules and standards for guys would be thrown away. Especially for this kid right here.    “Oh, sorry Rem,” Dexter suddenly realized that he was holding in a tight bear hug. “I just missed you so much. You know you missed this amazing man just as much.” He smiled at me and pulled me closer to him again. I was bracing myself for another bone-crushing hug. Instead he crushed his lips against mine and I succumbed. I missed this part especially.  He pulled back after a minute and led me inside, plopping me upon the couch.     “So how does it feel to be a college graduate? Now that you proved your intelligence, you can run around with your diploma all over Lakeview. That would definitely be first on my list of priorities.”    “Of course it would, since you wouldn’t have any job offers to get ready for.” He laughed and just looked at me. I hated it when he did that. I never know what he’s thinking. Then before I knew it, I was smiling too. God, let’s face it, I missed this crazy kid, and I don’t care who knows it.    I slid off the couch, and sat in his lap. “So, what’s the deal with truth squad? Any new gigs?” Truth squad was Dexter’s band.     “Ah, the band,” he sighed, “well that’s part of the reason I came down here. Ted was driving us crazy with all this blabbering about covers, and complaining about the potato song. If I didn’t leave, I was about to bet him that he couldn’t chug a gallon of milk, so he’d get sick and shut up.”    This was the Dexter I so clearly remember. He was constantly betting everyone with idiotic challenges.  Whether it was I Bet You A Quarter That The Next Commercial Is About Detergent or Twenty Bucks Says I Can Name More Names That Start With The Letter P While Ted Makes A Sandwich. I wonder if he ever heard himself talk before.     He started to reach into his pockets with an excited expression on h

20090309124443AAIS9Ak	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How come God lets bad things happen to me and you?	God loves us right, so why not give u what would truly loves us why to give us what we want? If our intentions are no way damaging to ourselves or others why should they be missed or delayed?      For example: I want to do really well at school like most others, yet I see people who aren't exactly nice but, yet they do better. It feels like it ignores some natural unwritten law in which the good do well and the bad well, only in their eyes do well.      Secondly: I really fancy this girl, if we were to go out I would treat her like she were a princess, but yet, my intentions are prue and we still aren't going out, instead there are complications!!!!      I'm in no way unreligious I just want to understand God. I see bullies having fun tormenting people in lessons and yet there is so litte justice, why would God do this? am I doing something wrong or missing something?      Soz for many questions :)

20090309125559AAH9XEw	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Wedding Photographs still not delivered?	Our wedding photographer stated in her contract:      "The photographer agrees to promptly edit and present images for client proofing and release for prints in approximately four to six weeks.  In the event the photographer is unable to provide said images within the specified time period due to an act outside the photographer's control, the photographer shall make every attempt possible to deliver said images as soon as possible thereafter and may offer the clients a discounted rate or compensation."      Well, she is currently at 10 weeks past the wedding date and we still do not even have proofs, much less prints. There is no reason for this delay and I have not rushed her, simply asking when she thinks they'll be ready, "next week"..."next week". Do you think she should compensate us for this extra 4 weeks of waiting? The novelty has worn off, no one is as excited to see them anymore. We paid her a lot of money, all upfront, so how much do you think she should refund if we originally paid her $2,700?

There are so many, can someone tell please tell me what form I need, a link to it perhaps or the name of it.

20090309130612AATxPXE	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Does this poem have a simile?? answer this and u can have 10 points?	Treasures    by Ron Carnell       It's so hard to find the perfect breeze,   One blowing none too hard nor soft,   Carrying a scent of wild flowers,   And moving clouds about aloft.      It's so hard to find the perfect sky,   One blue and deep and bright,   Carrying a sense of openness   With geese and wrens in flight.      It's so hard to find the perfect night,   One warm, quiet and unflawed,   Carrying a mood of solitude,   And a closeness to our God.      Yet no perfection's so hard to find   As that which you extend   And none I'll ever treasure more,   Than to simply be your friend.
