Uc7BNCxRaa	I play FFXI and have for the last 4 years and 11 months.  As for Yahoo! Answers, I'm trying to spend some time here, too.<br>  <br>  Yeah, getting stuff done does take time. In the nearly 5 years of play, I have 4 level 75 jobs, one level 72 job, a 56 job, and several level 30, 20, and below jobs.<br>  <br>  I've gotten to Sky (ZM12 or 13), Sea (Cop 8-4 done), and am working on Treasure and WOTG missions.  Yet, there is a lot I don't do like Assault, KSNM, Salvage, etc.<br>  <br>  Right now, my long term goal is to get Maat's cap.<br>  <br>  Honestly, there are people who spend a lot more time and are more serious about FFXI than I am.  There are many who already have their Maat's Cap, who upgraded various relic weapons to the highest level (4th, I think), completed ZM, CoP, the quests afterwards, Treasures, WOTG missions, etc., plus have most (if not all) of the Relic Armor.<br>  <br>  I figure as long as I'm happy and am having fun that that's all that matters.|`|Cl8FwsI2aa	No.

056440fa395da52240b41fd2644a15bcaa	I'm 25 and will be purchasing the DSi for myself and for my girlfriend. The DSi seems to be marketed towards an older crowd. Yes it is true that there are very childish games for it, but then again there are also fantastic resources for the DS such as the language learning games, cooking applications, the Korg DS-10 which is a professional grade synthesizer made specifically for the DS and tons of other apps and games geared for the older crowd. With the new DSi you will get a functional web browser included and dual cameras. You will be able to fully customize your dashboard with apps that appeal to you. This makes the console geared for everyone because anyone can customize the console for their age and preference. Nintendo created the DSi to appeal to everyone. I think once it hits the market people will realize that it's not just a little kid toy anymore.|`|D0i0RDmraa	Gameboy isn't kid's play any more.There are epic games like Final Fantasy remakes on it(Final Fantasy is well known for it's deep storyline if you don't know about it)In the past,yeah Gameboy is probably some kid stuff but now it changed.|`|4fa79abc921b5615b3a81280bdca2d2baa	well as long as you're not playing like princess fashion designer, i think its fine|`|T44Y0UuYaa	I wouldn't say childish...it just doesn't have very good games and it resulted as a epic failure...I sold mine, but everyone has opinions...theres Xbox fans...PS3 fans...Wii fans...even DS fans...I don't think its worth as much as it is sold...it's not that great|`|UzV0jc2haa	It wouldn't be your cup of tea.

Gh0qq0s5aa	You can get the wood circles from any craft store (JoAnn's, Michael's, A.C.Moore).  The pins can be purchased there too but they are pins for badges(like the kind used on name tags) so you won't have to use diaper pins. The wood circles or cutouts as they are called cost about .39  - .49 each.  You may also find other shapes to make your buttons out of which will make them even more unique.

obPSaYf3aa	I purchase equipment from bowlingball.com as well as from their EBay auction.  The only thing is that they probably have a lower overhead (rent, utilities and salaries paid) that they can pass savings on to the bowlers without going bankrupt, so the prices they advertise can be very close to wholesale, but for the bowler to keep in mind the bowling balls are not drilled out, which is an extra expense once you receive it in the mail.  They also offer free shipping directly on their website, which they don't on their EBay auctions.<br>  <br>  The equipment I purchase from bowlingball.com is top quality and I may also seek out "x-outs" or "blems" which are deeply discounted and don't have any defect other than just an off color spot on the coverstock.  I've bowled a high game of 300 three times and a series of 805 with bowling balls I purchased from them, so it's definitely a legitimate operation and they don't sell defects that will not work on any lane surface.  Give them a try!  You'll be satisfied with their customer service and product.|`|yUxh8Eozaa	no i havent, but i have bought a pterodactyl of pterodactyl.com... it was a little pricey too but oh well|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Yes, first of all they promised to set up a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss product lines, but lo and behold, they send Steven Seagal instead. Now I respect Steven Seagal for his contributions to the war on terror in such classics as 'Under Siege', but I was really looking for a Major 'Dutch' Schaefer to handle my bowling requirements. This would've all been acceptable, but Steven Seagal abruptly left to shoot some orphans in the face about 15 minutes into the consultation, which was really inconsiderate, and Jean-Claude Van Damme took his place. Jean-Claude was polite and most courteous, but what I really wanted was the original meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I called Dolph Lundgren and asked him to ask Chuck Norris if anybody had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger, but he was far too busy kicking old age pensioners to fully concentrate on Dolph's reasonable request. Jean-Claude Van Damme, angered at his seemingly inferior status as Chad/Alex Wagner to Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaefer completely flipped out and immediately stripped my wallet of ￡5.83, precisely 1/10th of the cost of a shiny new bowling ball. Don't deal with these crooks.|`|2MGJAwM9aa	I asked this question a few weeks ago and it apparantly is very very cheap . I dod not buy them though . Maybe they are just having a sale or something ?

Should be all fixed.|`|aUOrdK8Haa	u cant, teh computer got an AI virus that, in any game makes al the characters dumb (Artificial Inteligence loss) the only way 2 fix it is steam.... by asking them of course <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i didnt help<br>  <br>  bye
wAiVxAKNaa	The first team is better. <br>  <br>  While your second team may have a lot of legendaries, let's look at its weaknesses.<br>  <br>  -Three Dragon types. While Dialga may be resistant to Dragon because of its steel nature, the two other Dragon types (Palkia and Rayquaza) are weak against other dragon attacks.<br>  <br>  -Weakness to water. Infernape and Groudon are nice, even with Groudon's Drought ability. However, one Rain Dance and Groudon could be done for with a water attack. Infernape's special defense is not amazing either. <br>  <br>  Your first team is much more well balanced type wise.|`|MFAVIW1waa	The first one coz not many people would want to verse you if your team only consists of ubers. Only people with an uber team would. Team one is also better coz they're all different types so one type can't take out half the team. <br>  <br>  Infernape: Close Combat, Flare Blitz, ThunderPunch, U-Turn/Stone Edge<br>  <br>  Staraptor: Close Combat, Return/Roost, U-Turn, Brave Bird/Aerial Ace<br>  OR<br>  Skarmory; Brave Bird/Drill Peck, Roost, Spikes, Whirlwind<br>  <br>  Ampharos: Thunder/Thunderbolt, Rain Dance/Power Gem, Signal Beam/Thunderwave, Focus Blast<br>  <br>  Dialga (Usually banned): Dragon Pulse, Earth Power, Aura Sphere, Thunderbolt/Flamethrower<br>  OR<br>  Blissey (coz your team needs a wall) Softboiled, Thunderwave, Seismic Toss, Aromatherapy/Stea;th Rock/Shadow Ball <br>  <br>  Empoleon: Surf, Ice Beam, Rest/Stealth Rock, Sleep Talk/Roar<br>  <br>  Torterra: Wood Hammer, Earthquake, Stone Edge, Synthesis/Curse<br>  OR<br>  Bronzong: Rest, Sleep Talk, Earthquake, Gyro Ball or Light Screen, Reflect, Gyro Ball, Earthquake<br>  <br>  Make sure you have at least one wall coz if your entire team are sweepers, they don't stand much of a chance against teams with a lot of walls.<br>  <br>  Oh and can someone also tell me how to ask questions (where is the link to ask them) coz i forgot.|`|vSH2puTRaa	Depends on what your looking for. Remember that most of the second team is banned. In the end, the game comes down to math, and the second has the better stats. They may have some type weaknesses, but if you pitted both teams against one another (assuming they both have reasonably good movesets) the legendary team would come out on top.<br>  <br>  The second team is much more balanced, but again dialga is banned. Switch him out for a salamence or vibrava and you have a fairly solid team.|`|LupVriVyaa	the second is much better as they have better stats and learn better moves naturally
YEooEeKGaa	lol... there is definitely a culture of "everyone should be playing basic strategy" at blackjack tables and the hardcore players tend to get annoyed if a beginner is playing on the last few boxes and making basic strategy mistakes. i believe its more because its easier to work out "what if" scenarios based on the last few boxes. so if the beginner didn't split his tens, then dealer would have busted and everyone would have won instead of dealer hitting 21 and everyone losing.. this is all nonsense if your just a basic strategy player. its just people blaming their bad luck on someone else.<br>  <br>  but in terms of winning and player numbers, the more crowded the table, the slower the game gets. this is a good or bad thing depending on what your looking for in a blackjack session. if your a card counter then you do have a positive edge on the casino, so you want as many hands per hour as possible to max your hourly rate. most players are playing with negative expected value though, so technically they are worse off the faster the game gets....|`|M7G3MZb5aa	-There is no effect on the house advantage of the game when you play with other players as opposed to playing alone.  To a non card counter, there is no effect.<br>  <br>  -You will be dealt more than three times as many hands per hours when playing alone as you will playing at a ful table, so winning and losing will happen slower.<br>  <br>  -For card counters ONLY, there is a way to fine tune playing strategy based on the number of players at the table, that results in increased profits by the tiniest fraction of a percent, it is there though, so in a way, it CAN matter how many players are at the table.  The effect is VERY VERY tiny<br>  <br>  -The other poster is correct, you are significantly more likely to be harassed and annoyed for playing decisions at a full table.  Just ignore them, if they insist you play your hand a certain way, tell them to buy it from you for the amount you have in the betting circle so they can play it themselves, they always shut up after that.|`|c1fa93189fad57291cf2802937b455e2aa	From my personal opinion I think it is. I count odds in black jack between the dealers and mine hands and what chance I have of getting a number that would win compared to the dealers. <br>  <br>  With more players, I cant count the odds, it'll take forever and waste of money with more players.|`|CNxPiK1uaa	ys. the more people there are the less cards your gonna get

All you need to do is get a spare battery and a memory card to use to hack. To know how, just go to YouTube or something and look and see for any tutorials on hacking and getting free psp games.

RVpl9ZeIaa	Apparently, none of these people have ever seen or used a CYBERDARK deck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't listen to any of them. Cyberdarks need Hunter Dragon for both their effects and Allure of Darkness. Blizzard Dragon, Spear Dragon and Luster Dragon CANNOT be equipped to Cyberdarks because they are level 4. Cyberdarks need level 3 or lower.<br>  <br>  The synchros are mainly for INTIMIDATION. There is also a chance you can use Monster Reborn and/or Brain Control to get 1 of your opponent's tuners. This is what is known as being prepared. None of these guys know what that means either.<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  -1 Proto-Cyber Dragon<br>  +1 Exploder Dragon<br>  <br>  <br>  Side Deck [optional]: 15<br>  1 Plaguespreader Zombie<br>  1 Cyber Dragon<br>  1 Proto-Cyber Dragon<br>  1 Exploder Dragon<br>  2 Pitch-Dark Dragon<br>  1 Dust Tornado<br>  2 Dimensional Prison<br>  1 Soul Taker<br>  2 Light-Imprisoning Mirror<br>  1 Giant Trunade<br>  1 Cyberdark Impact!<br>  1 Foolish Burial<br>  <br>  <br>  You asked for a Cyberdark deck, this is one of the best their is available with the current meta. You'll need dark monsters for Allure, and also to help fuel the cyberdarks.<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any questions.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	dragons :-) yay. no offense but this deck sucks. you have dragons and machines, they don't work together. make a dragons deck, or a machine deck, not both.|`|K8tucvCwaa	to synchro summon, you need tuner monsters in your deck which you don't have yet, ex. physic commander, and another monster, the synchro monster you can summon will be equal to the total levels of all the monsters you have offered to the grav.|`|qXsbRsiXaa	This is a good but bad deck. Its to much all over the place monsters and the thing about synchro are :<br>  <br>  Synchro Monsters require Tuner Monsters to be Summoned. When the total Level of the Tuner monster and the other monsters on your field exactly matches the Synchro Monster's Level (no more, no less), by sending them to the Graveyard, you can Summon the Synchro monster. Some Synchro Monsters require a specific "Tuner Monster" in order to be Synchro Summoned (such as "Junk Synchron" for "Junk Warrior") or monsters of a particular Type or Attribute as Material Monsters, but others do not. Because Synchro Monsters belong in the Extra Deck, they return there whenever they would be returned to the hand or Main Deck, like Fusion Monsters before.ref Also, like Fusion Monsters, they cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard if they were not properly Synchro Summoned first. <br>  <br>  And yeah you need tuners in this deck to get the synchros. Its very good to run Synchros because of how many zombie decks that are out there. but I'd take out the allures and replace them lighting vortex's. I'd put in a shrink or sak Armour just to destroy attacking monsters. I'd take out a hunter dragon probably put in a Blizzard dragon, Spear Dragon, or Luster Dragon. Side deck a Different Dimension Reincarnation. Try to get a mirror force and thats all i can think of right now but your strategy  as of right now is to get out your fusions

9e01398f4b24992106c5908fefc0ada9aa	high, allows you to swing around really fast get kills on other players faster. Personally I play on 10 never had more kills than when i was lower|`|tall10gkaa	past 5 is good because you can move the aim around faster|`|d0fLx0LPaa	I always played on 7 or 8 because then you aren't swinging around too fast but enough that you're faster than other players. Try playing around a little bit in a custom game to see what fits you because it really depends on what feels comfortable to you.

DvAvrVejaa	I sell on Etsy and I feel as though I do very well.  If you feel like selling on Etsy is a route that you might want to pursue, I urge you to go forth with that.  Etsy's fees are extremely fair and since they specialize in selling and buying handmade goods, the market is there (as opposed to trying your venture on Ebay).  Etsy charges $.20 for every item listed, which includes five pictures, and unlimited description, and it stays listed for 4 months!  Here is how their fees work:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/fees.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.etsy.com/fees.php</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I would not charge so little for your items.  Often, sellers believe they need to have rock bottom prices to attract buyers and thus receive sales.  This has quite the opposite effect in reality.  Most times, a buyer sees a low price and thinks "low quality".  Charge what you FEEL your items are worth.  When I first started selling my hats on TwoSeasideBabes, I charged very little for them.  After much prodding, I raised my prices and I sell more quanities and more consistently.  Don't cut yourself short to make sales and don't undercut your talent!  <br>  <br>  Selling handmade goods is hard work...you cannot expect sales to simply come to you.  Just like any small business, you need to treat it seriously and invest work, effort, and money into it.  You need to market and promote to get your name out to the buyers.  Here is how I do it: <br>  <br>  Twitter: It's an excellent tool for getting your name out there. Twitter is like blogging, only you get 140 characters per post. The more followers you have, the more you get noticed. 14% of my store traffic comes through Twitter and I have made definite sales because of the followers that I have there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com</a><br>  <br>  Blogging: This is yet another great tool that is absolutely free. It allows you to promote your items and those of other Etsians (atleast that's what I do...I also want to get the Etsy name out there...and not just mine). It doesn't take much time and it is easy to post the links for your blog on Etsy forums, chat rooms, and on Twitter.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Flickr: An excellent tool for getting people outside of Etsy to see your products. Post your pictures, leave a description, but don't obviously market your store there. You can get your profile closed for this. You can place your store information in your profile but not the photo descriptions. Post pictures into various groups to get noticed even more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com</a><br>  <br>  Google Base: Don't freak out...it's way easier than you think. Upload your RSS feed from your store into Google Base and watch the clicks. Use Let's Ets to upload get your RSS feed easily...save it as an .xml file! Then upload it into Google Base...it's that simple! Do it every month. I make 32% of my traffic through Google, and Base is the easiest way to do it...for free!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.letsets.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.letsets.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/?gsessionid=J..." rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/?gsessionid=J...</a><br>  <br>  Plaincraft: It's all about SOE's...and Plaincraft allows you to do that easily. Simply upload 3 items per day to see how popular your items are through the votes your recieve.

I buy art and other items on there all the time.|`|l4DBJdJGaa	etsy is a wonderful place to sell things. i shop on there all the time and have my own shop. they provide you with buttons to post on your blog/facebook/myspace/etc. that will help you to generate people to your shop. also, when you have an account you "heart" other shops, which draws in people.<br>  <br>  as for pricing our your stuff, don't be afraid to charge a little more than you think it's worth. that was the hardest part for me too. <br>  <br>  as for the economy and whatnot, over the past years there's been a surge in the crafting and handmade world. people are beginning to steer away from commercial type stuff and looking for things that are unique. people are starting to lean more towards the handmade because it provides a since of nostalgia and homeliness. so don't worry about it! <br>  <br>  when you're on etsy, check out the commission forum. some people are on there just looking for someone to make something in particular. see if you fit the bill and can score some extra money that way.|`|xvCW5OsYaa	im not familiar with etsy.com but just a quick glance tells me that's the right place to sell them because people shopping there are looking for something like yours<br>  as far as retail markups sell to make a profit i dont know how much does it cost to make Package and ship equate that all in i would do it like this. pay your self an hourly wage an base the price by that then add everything else on top<br>  <br>  don't just sell in one place put some on ebay and put a link to your other store this will get you better flow from people like me that havent heard of the website<br>  <br>  keep track of all your items and keep an email that customers can reach you check this several times a day and be nice to them consumers are stupid and will never know the product as well as you<br>  <br>  otherwise its a great way to make some extra cash<br>  <br>  o and dont worry about the economy there's still lots of people that buy during recessions|`|djLDZXoZaa	from what i hear from other crafters, its just like anything other store (online or not).  you have to advertise to get business.  and sometimes it takes a bit of time to build up a customer base.<br>  dont worry about the economy.  of course you wont do as well now as you would have 2 years ago, but this is true for everything.  if someone wants a plushie *you* need to be able to sell it to them.  and if your going to be making them anyways, why not sell them?<br>  <br>  good luck!

KWA6qwk2aa	From glancing over the card games section questions it seems that pretty much everyone is having trouble with Yahoo Games right now. Most likely their server has crashed or they are down for maintenence and my best suggestion would be to wait it out. They'll fix it sooner or later. If it makes you feel better i'd suggest logging a ticket/e-mail (or whatever they call it) to the bug reports section of Yahoo!Games.
oa0xr3Yjaa	If you want to post it for other people to see, you can post it on a game site such as www.ign.com or www.gamefaqs.com. You may have to create an account but directions on the respective sites will help you through that. If you're talking about using a code on an internet game, you will have to go to the game and find a cheat input box or area, and input the code.|`|nkTEhBTyaa	What do u mean?|`|xRWmM39waa	there are no cheat codes for a pc game unles it has a section in the options or such dedicated only to cheat codes.. aside from that in the drive there wont be a code that simply unlocks things.|`|2wsw2gzgaa	Easy....

2NBOraeJaa	Of course!  Assuming that you're using Polymerization instead of another fusion spell card: Polymerization requires that the fusion material monsters be in your hand or on your side of the field, and that you send them to the graveyard to special summon the fusion monsters from your extra deck.  Since the fusion material monsters for Five-Headed Dragon are simply any five dragon type monsters, monsters that are considered dragons because of DNA Surgery are still dragon type monsters.  Sheep tokens that are special summoned by Scapegoat are, like any other tokens, considered monsters.  Although sheep tokens cannot be tributed for a tribute summon, you can tribute them for anything else, and, in fact, fusing them together is not even considered tributing them.|`|XiOfPxpdaa	yeah it's a grate combo it's simelere to my fusion-tribute combo it's grater then any stradegy i've seen or even that i've made that combo right thair would put a stopper on my 1 turn kill i pulled off with a hero deck (that combo of mine was something i never thot of i just had the hand not even knowing my deck had that combo) it's even grater then that! wow i'd love to duel you! ^_^<br>  <br>  edit;<br>  <br>  ignore gameingG five-god dragon's efect summons himself without the fusion spells|`|o18WpWoUaa	Yes. I've never even thought of that.|`|7WGKtkd0aa	No, because when you activate dna surgery it only changes the type of the monster not the attribute and all scapegoat are earth-based monsters.|`|OZ4oDLxMaa	yes and that is a great straigy

So I guess that it depends on what kind of games you like and your age.|`|D0i0RDmraa	Well depends on what kind of player you like.If your into those intense action violence or whatever.I urge you not to get it.But if your a casual player who like music and a challenge.Patapon is a good choice.Oh yeah,just don't chuck your PSP away due to fustration,it actually takes a while to master the controls.

SSeUemEIaa	Sniping in CoD is great!  Leading your shots always helps and you can shoot somebody from over 100 feet away! I own Rainbow Six Vegas 2 and there are too few urban maps.|`|D0i0RDmraa	Try Crysis...if your good at it you might be able to kill some one a decent distance away..problem is the players in it are pretty good as well so you have to hide well.Oh yeah you have to get the expansion pack too as well.You won't regret it.|`|yawTQThvaa	Please rent Gears of War 2. Many maps have numerous sniping points for you to discover, and playing the game with a team adds to the fun.<br>  <br>  The game utilizes a one button cover system, that allows you to quickly pop your head around cover and snipe an unsuspecting enemy.<br>  <br>  Gears 2 is a tactical shooter as well, as you will soon discover after spending only a short time with it. The only downside to the game is the occasional lag matches, and the very steep learning curve. It is also third person, unlike many other shooters that are first person, but it is an easy transition. I personally prefer it.

yawTQThvaa	You should get the Xbox 360 Pro Bundle. It comes with a 60GB hard drive (which is good to start out with) and wireless controllers. It's really the best bang for your buck (as far as Xboxes go.)<br>  <br>  I do not reccommend the Arcade bundle, seeing as it has no hard drive (which you'll need to save games and download content,) and unless you plan on downloading a TON of content, you may as well not spent a lot on the Elite bundle.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to get though, make sure you purchase a WARRANTY on it. It's better to have one and not need it than to need one and not have it.<br>  <br>  As for games, Burnout Paradise, Gears of War 2, Bio Shock, Assassin's Creed, and Street Fighter IV are a few good titles that come to mind. I hear Call of Duty 4 is fun too.|`|9DLJju3saa	Definitely Call of Duty 4!! It undoubtedly has a better single player, and Cod5 wouldn't be anything without it. The guns suck in World at War, and whoever has the best one always wins. Cod4 has way cooler missions, there's nothing like the ghillie level, and I actually care when my teammates die. It has more and better game modes, more solid gameplay, and is an overall better gun. Although it does have Nazi zombies, its not enough to make it better.|`|TmWTesu1aa	i recommend buying fallout 3,dead rising (my #1 game for like 2 years now),saints row 2,or guitar hero 4.<br>  <br>  Also buy the 360 elite because it wont overheat as quick as the original 360 and you can barley hear the humming|`|9mrjbqJaaa	Resident evil 5 package with the red 360 (Assuming you're old enough and it's available in AUS)|`|AVzWvfhJaa	It all depends on what your going to do on it. If your going to download a lot of things, such as demos or movies, anything like that, get the $300 system. If your just going to play games casually, get the Arcade system. But if your a hardcore gamer, get the Elite. For games, it all depends on what your into, but i personally recommend Gears of War 2.

Then get on the fan with the penguin and then switch to the other person. then turn the fan on. then switch to the penguin. then put a penguin minion in the hole. and then it should knock down a rock  with items in it, push all the rocks down. then it should give you all the pieces for a tractor. then drive the tractor back to the middle (where the building is) and make the tractor go up the ramp thing. and then knock down the ice. then go into the door.<br>  <br>  hope this helps
ByM5bvqsaa	If you liked all the other Tales game, then you'll like this one. I thought this was an ok game though, cause the gameplay is exactly like the other tales, nothing really new on the battle system.<br>  I recommend getting Star Ocean 4, the Lost Hope.  It's also got a real time battle system except there's so much more you can do during battles. Battles are more active and at a fast pace, you're guaranteed to have fun if you an rpg fan like me :D|`|ap2QzoANaa	IGN gave it an 8.2 and said it's "a formidable RPG with loads of intense action, an ensemble of memorable characters and a grand, if somewhat meandering, story"<br>  <br>  I'd say pick it up.

I couldnt wait or pre-order the game for the demo, but what you can do is create a United Kingdom account and download the Demo off their PS Store, they had it there a long time ago. Thats how I got mine like a month ago.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh i thought you meant the demo, but yes I do believe that Killzone 2 will be avaliable on PSN, it would take a while but it will definetely be avaliable for download sooner or later...it might take a while but I do think it would benefit them if it was there to download.

My favorite of the three is Mass Effect. It's simply amazing and revolutionary. The graphics, physics, traveling to other planets; if you enjoy outer space, space travel, and science fiction in general, Mass Effect will suck you in.<br>  <br>  Now the other two games. Fallout 3 and Oblivion are both made by Bethesda, and they are both extremely detailed and awesome games. Oblivion features a bigger map, more in game cities and locations to go to, and more expansions (for now). If you like magic/wizard games with spells, healing, and all that nerdy crap, Oblivion is more your type of game as it is all hardcore fiction.<br>  Fallout 3 on the other hand is geared towards a realistic game setting. It's post apoctolyptic Washington D.C. The U.S. and Chinese get into a nuclear war and people traveled to underground fallout shelters known as vaults. Fallout 3, in my opinion, features a much more fun, realistic, and more detailed story line than Oblivion. Fallout 3 uses guns, missile launchers, mini nuke's, and several other cool weapons. The downside is there's barely any good locations to travel to and the game can get boring after a while. Also, so far there's only one expansion (operation anchorage) but two more come out, one called the Pitt, comes out in a couple of weeks!<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you should get Fallout 3. Fallout is looking promising for new content as it's a new game and the story and theme of the game will suck you in if you allow them to. I'm obsessed with the game and as far as Mass Effect goes, a new one is coming out later this year and Oblivion is kind of old.
sgRDJUXqaa	You have to purchase a CD key to make an account.  Whether you choose to buy the actual game in a box at the store, or whether you choose to download it online, you still need the CD key.  (Buying the game gives you an instruction manual and also makes install time a lot faster, but Blizzard offers the game download free.)<br>  <br>  No, you can't play for free.  It's $0.50 a day.|`|574eb859c301df997d80bbd93890321faa	If you buy the game at a store, the disc will allow you to download the game onto your computer. To play the game, however, you will need to register an account and this costs money each month. Even if you download the game to your computer, you will not be able to log in if you don't have a valid account.|`|rZarc9g3aa	nope sorry,<br>  <br>  you have to buy the disk but you also have to make an account and pay.<br>  <br>  besides its the worst video game ever made and you'll be addicted. <br>  <br>  destroy the CD and go buy a decent game.<br>  <br>  no offence lol<br>  <br>  :)|`|R6ajHB27aa	yes you will still pay for the account, and you cannot play without paying the account.
l6lh6fT8aa	Static abilities (like Protection from Blue, Elves get +1/+1, etc.) do not go into effect until the spell resolves. So yes, it can be countered.<br>  <br>  However, this is not to be confused with characteristic-setting abilities (like "This creature's power and toughness are equal to the number of cards in your hand" or "This creature can't be countered") are in effect when a card is not in play.|`|eu0AJenBaa	He is correct.  It can be countered because the abilities do not activate until the card is in play.|`|m1vmXBIHaa	when you actually play a card (the exception of land)...the card is "not in play untill it resolves" meaning that as long as it isnt countered then the abilites activate. If you play Voice of All and I do not counter it then its protection ability activates.

Answers I have ever read. Not only that, the dumbest thing I have ever read by someone on the internet. I highly advise you to not purposely break your 360.<br>  <br>  If your warranty is up and your 360 wasn't made in 2005, you will have to pay at least $150.00 for repairs. I would advise you to save your money for a brand new elite system for the troubles.<br>  If you really must know how to overheat the 360, run a game in the 360 and duct tape the air holes on the back. Let the 360 run for several hours and keep an eye on it.<br>  <br>  This is an extremely stupid and risky thing to do because if you 360 catches fire and then your carpet and house goes up in flames, your going to be in some big trouble. Instead of overheating and breaking your 360, why don't you MOD it?! Do something cool with it, if it doesn't run as well as it used to and save your money and house from going up in flames. I modded several original xbox's.|`|1Uk6j3Ccaa	I heard that you can wrap it in a towel while its on to overheat it.

SQ25DKk7aa	You first of all need a memory stick to store them on, to run any games outside of official means (homebrew or otherwise) you'll need to be running custom firmware, which you can easily find by a google search just search for "Firmware Tutorial" and of the like, though if you have more recent firmware *above 1.8 from memory* you'll need a pandora battery, which is essentially a "hacked" battery, you can buy them from dealextreme.com for about $11US
yawTQThvaa	Did you buy them new or used? If you bought them used, it could be a problem with either of them, but most likely the disc. Either way, check to see if the disc is scratched or dirty, and try cleaning it. If you still can't get it to work, you should be able to exchange it for another copy as long as you have your receipt.<br>  <br>  Also, try playing the game in someone elses Xbox, and see if it freezes in the same spot.<br>  <br>  One last thought... Some games have glithes in them that are fixed with an auto update from Xbox live. You might try connecting. A silver account is free if you don't have one.
MFHMwJ3baa	I just used the elephant rush and beat it in 4:55. You basically buy the elephant from the start, buy a few supply pads, and recruit a bunch of marines from your elephant. Then you rush to the covenant base before they can build their defenses. It takes practice to do but you'll get it in no time.
SaeUxO6Gaa	It's an ace plus either a 10, Jack, Queen, or King.  <br>  <br>  Suit is irrelevant.  The goal is to get 21 without going over it, and aces count as 1 or 11... jack/queen/king counts as 10.  <br>  <br>  Because the game is called blackjack, casinos often show an ace and a jack as the logo or design on blackjack tables.  Ace jack isn't better than ace king/queen/10 - they all automatically win.|`|y822j5h5aa	In most blackjack tables the suit does not matter, the best hand you can get is any 10 or face and an Ace, which is Blackjack!<br>  <br>  I have seen some tables that offer some gimmick bets with long odds, and one of the gimmick bets was a suited blackjack that paid off high odds.|`|niyc4VhZaa	In modern casino blackjack suits are irrelevant.<br>  <br>  The best hand you can get is simply called a "blackjack" or a "natural" (meaning natural 21), and is made up of any ace and any ten value card (ten or face).<br>  <br>  However, in the old days of American gambling a blackjack had to consist of an actual Black Jack (club or spade) and the ace of spades.

There are no specific differences in eggs that will affect whether the hatched is shiny or not.|`|2qCbHRa3aa	there is a 50% chance of a hatching a newborn only if the Pokemon is breed ed with a shiny ditto.

AA10529592	Personally, I love HaloWars because i've played the downloadable demo. If you're a fan of Halo and a hardcore gamer i suggest you buy HaloWars instead of GTA4. My favorite part of the game is that you can control an army of spartans and ODSTs. It has unbelievable mulitplayer and adds alot of variety to real time strategy. Ign gave it a 8.7 which is very impressive. I would definitely buy HaloWars|`|1Uk6j3Ccaa	I know I wouldnt but thats just me....it seems that its just a regular old strategy game dressed up in Halo to gain popularity. I would go for GTAIV.....or just wait to play the demo and see for yourself.|`|5kJ2yD7uaa	It depends whether you like real time strategies or games like grand theft auto (shooting,racing,etc)<br>  Halo wars is a pretty standard RTS with elements of the halo universe thrown in.<br>  Good luck!|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	I hate GTA. <br>  So I'd definatly pick halo wars over GTA anyday.<br>  <br>  It looks fun.<br>  <br>  But Better games are RE5 And Street fighter 4|`|CGJdITxzaa	Well it depends on what type of games you like if your a 1st Person gamer you should not get it get Halo ODIST or however you spell it but if you like games like command and conquer or Starcraft or just normal Warcraft not World of Warcraft then get it
IcSoWu3Raa	Golden Fishing Rod Catch every type of fish once. <br>  Golden Bug Net Catch every type of bug once. <br>  Golden Slingshot Shoot 15 items out of the sky, then you get it if you shoot it down. <br>  Golden Shovel Bury a regular shovel in the ground, and then dig it up a full day later. It will then be golden. <br>  Golden Watering Can Keep the environment perfect for 16 days in a row. Pelly or Phyllis will reward you with the golden can. <br>  Golden Axe Trade a scallop seashell to Pascal for the golden axe <br>  <br>  Magic Rock<br>  Hit all the rocks in town with either a shovel or an axe until you find one that releases a money bag when you do. Continue to hit it as many times as you can until it finally stops releasing bags of money. With every hit you do, the rock will release more gold. This can be done once a day.<br>  <br>  Become friends with Sable<br>  Whenever you enter the Able Sisters store and try to talk to Sable (the hedgehog sitting behind the sewing machine in the back left corner), she usually just ignores you, or tries to tell you talk to her sister because she's busy. To develop a "friendship" with Sable, you must talk to her at least once every day for a number of days. Eventually, she will start having conversations with you, and even thank you for stopping by.<br>  <br>  Become friends with Brewster<br>  Once a day you can buy coffee at the cafe'. At first he just gives you coffe and says "Thanks...". But If you buy some from him coffee every day he will start asking you questions, treating you like a friend, asking you if he can put special ingrediants in your coffee, and thanking you for coming by.<br>  <br>  Grow Golden Roses<br>  Water dying black roses with the golden watering can, and they will return as golden roses the next day.<br>  <br>  4-Leaf Clover<br>  If you town becomes covered in weeds there will also be clvoer patches. If you are lucky, you will pull up a four leaf clover. This is pretty rare however, most patches you dig up will not contain the clover. The clover can then be used as an accessory in you character's hair, or if you place it in your house it will act as a bookmark in a book.<br>  <br>  Retro Animal Crossing Bootleg<br>  To get the Retro Animal Crossing note to listen to at your house, tell K.K.

02WnhLpeaa	Whats the name of the game?  Its imposable to know possible errors without knowing what game you have.<br>  <br>  I would recommend going to the web site of the "game" and looking to see if anyone else has the same issues.<br>  <br>  Normally if the game doesn't show the video/graphics then i would check to make sure you are using a "supported graphics card".<br>  <br>  It says supported, but i'm sure somewhere in the fine print, you can find  which graphic cards it supports.
WoxkKYYUaa	I totally feel your pain on this one! It will take a lot of practice for that motion as well as for those of Guile and Vega.  Unless you are familiar with the franchise's many previous iterations, the motions may feel awkward and take a while to get down.<br>  <br>  Your solution would be to spend a number of hours in the Practice and Challenge Trial rooms of the game working on it.  I found that I was better off using the left analog stick rather than the D pad.  Experiment a bit with the range of motion on it.  You will find that you don't have to move it all the way to the end of its range in order for the input to be received.<br>  <br>  The motion for Chun Li is to hold it away from the opponent for a 2 second count before moving forward then back then forward again.  On the forward input you also enter a button input.<br>  <br>  If you can do her Kikoken you are halfway there.  It is that same motion but instead of hitting a punch button instead move the controller back then forward along with a Kick or all three Kicks for the Ultra.<br>  <br>  I am trying to get a Fight Stick because this easier on an arcade stick than the little controller for my hands.  Good luck!

3a671a7fc22386bc37b64483d80da9a6aa	Centrino processors are usually slower, less performant processors. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend against getting a Laptop for gaming, Especially since you want to run very graphic intensive games like Crysis and Call of Duty.<br>  <br>  In about a year, your Laptop won't be able to run the latest games fluentyl anymore, and you will be unable to replace the graphics chip, when the processor is still suitable for the games.|`|5ee7c1e88df7f1fac02bc321de4f5b51aa	Dude... you're trying to decide over power and screen size... come on, this should be a no brainier, especially when you want to play new games on it.|`|fcf3322f178b74d8c7ad5fbc4a360f70aa	if you want to consider the speed and the performance of the laptop then you go for TOSHIBA. (since you want to play games like what you've said which require great performance) Why?<br>  <br>  having the same size of RAM, cache memory is a very important factor because it acts as a "station of instructions nearer to your processor" from the hard disk drive. the "von Neumann bottleneck" explains that accessing the memory or HDD ,in this case, is the main reason of computer's slow performance. if your computer will access many times the HDD then it will spend a lot of time. but if it has a great size of cache which acts as a station of instructions then it doesn't have to access the HDD so many times. therefore, the performance would be much better.<br>  <br>  and besides, toshiba is not just an ordinary brand which you can buy easily anywhere.<br>

If someone bets big before the flop, it may be prudent to fold those cards, because although Aces are good, a deuce kicker might screw you over. If you are big blind and no one raises, you should definately stick around for the flop. It also helps if they are suited, because then you have straight, Ace high flush, and high pair possiblities.|`|SXGgMdj8aa	It most depends on your position. For example if you are at a table with 9 players and you are first to act there are 8 hands behind you that could have you beat. This is not a good situation as A2 is not a big favorite against that many random hands. However if you maybe only had 1 or 2 players behind you it is in good shape because it is unlikely a random hand will beat it.<br>  <br>  If you need any more information about the game I suggest you check out full tilt. They have a poker academy, a forum, a glossary of terms, and you can play there for free. <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/?key=MDAwMEE0RUYwMDAxRjg2MTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDA-" rel="nofollow">http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/?key=MDAwME...</a>|`|UVUYG5jaaa	there is no "correct" answer, you can play with 2-5 and get 2-2-5 on the flop (its happened to me)...the other guy had A-2 and thought HE had the pot...any hand is dangerous, any bet is dangerous|`|2MvI9cpTaa	It depends on what position at the table early and middle fold any ace-rag. In late position I would raise with an ace if It is folded around to you. Any ace with a low kicker is not a good hand unless you have two maybe three players at the table.  good luck at the table

Sometimes they even randomly pop out at you!!!|`|da878ec739a1d54b8d6e2e8964bb695caa	people sell em on the auction all the time and coltzans shrine is a good bet too, you might also want to check other peoples shops.|`|8be98f97a6a6be385d9cba3140130d07aa	UM KEEP EARNING NEOPOINTS AND THEN GO TO THE MARKET AND BUY DUBLOONS|`|bd14a4902137ec78206435a85e0b4133aa	Go to Coltzans Shrine every 12 hours.

AA11022791	Human/Night Elf Hunter or Rogue.<br>  <br>  Both Hunters and Rogues, are quick, deal lots of damage, can solo easy and are loved in groups.<br>  <br>  If you want a pet with you, be a hunter.  If you like to become invisible and avoid enemies, become a rogue.  Hunters are by far the most often played class of the game, which makes being a rogue a bit more unique.   Rogues also can pick locks and pick pokets, in case you like that ^.^<br>  <br>  I am a mage myself.  I love the whole casting spells aspect.  I would have been a  Shaman, but Alliance couldnt have shamans when i started.  Now that burning crusades is out, you can try a Draenei Shaman, and remain in the alliance if you want to be able to have a pet, be a caster, deal lots of damage, all in one.<br>  <br>  Just as important as class, is your realm.  Choose a medium to light server so it wont get too busy.  I recommend Ysera (im in that one obviously) if you need any help, send me a message through yahoo<br>  <br>  See you in game!|`|AA11058119	Well, I'd say try all of the classes that interest you out (level them to 20 or so)  and see which one suits you best.<br>  <br>  But if you want ranged DPS (damage per second), then go with a hutner. They're the only ranged class that uses guns/crossbows/bows. They also get a pet that you can control and attack enemies with. It's an easier class to play, but also an easy class to kill if you can get in close on them.|`|LzDF0OIpaa	Rogue. Easy to play, best dmg, can survive very well while solo'ong.<br>  <br>  If u like player versus player then go for human or gnome races for the racial abilities perception/escape artist.<br>  <br>  Trust me.|`|MRgLUCYsaa	im a level 60 human hunter and he kicks a**|`|da814c50d47acd62f96bea963e84b2d7aa	Human Hunter,all the way.|`|j1aQW5pvaa	this is a question for the ages.  although i too am a hunter.  lol<br>  <br>  all the classes have good abilities but its all about how you play, my best advice is to play all the classes to 10 and stick with the one that was most fun for you.  chances are you will find one that you like before you get through all the classes.<br>  <br>  but know this...  no matter what class you play, the game doesnt really start till 60....um, well 70..|`|7fe9f5474d9af0fab4dfbd29c1d35ab7aa	I would definately say Hunter.  as for race that is really up to you.  Most of a hunters damage comes from the type build you use i.e. beast mastry, marksmanship, or survival.  Marksmanship tend to have a higher DPS (damage per second) and beast mastry tend to let you level faster.  I use the overpopulated Night Elf but I just like the way they look.  Once you get to the higher levels race becomes trivial it is all build and weapons.
AA10793857	i dont think there's a cheat. i dont really play pokemon crater becoz of the lack of cheats. my user is 'ooibowei' you just have to walk aimlessly around the map hoping you are lucky enough to get one or trade with other people|`|AA10606366	Simple, defeat all the gym leaders, including the elite four. Then, go to the wild and explore. Explore the cave map and grass map. it is easier to catch legendary pokemon in the cave map. You can catch Mewtwo, Mew, Groudon, Jirachi, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Deoxys in the cave map. You can catch Articuno, Zapdos, Rayquaza, Latios and Latias, and Raikou and Kyogre in the grass map.|`|851e76bebee294312f0a0f122ac941c5aa	is thet game on pc or somnthing else I know only on pc|`|3tuS8gGwaa	try and trade them if they are available .first put as many pokemon as u want and then trade for the other|`|4af75bfee9eb11160529ec6b214bc0cfaa	Use GameShark or Gamecode and you will have it in minute.|`|4c21e032e8f7a33b6f82f8fe2fc0df74aa	Well it is easy.You just have to get all the badges including the elite 4.For this if you want to go the easy way.Just make all your pokemon in your team to level 100 and then defeat them all.Really the Johto and Hoenn are much easier than Kanto.Then you go and explore the maps.You can know them easily because when they are wild they already have higher than level 70 or 60.If  you want to know me, my username in pokemon crater is adilmt.|`|7jLDoqk5aa	walk around the grass after you defeated the gym leaders and elite 4|`|uNgEHYPYaa	You just hav to defeat the gym leaders or trade some if available.

935c64147de98df18c1d1fb076334471aa	As far as i can guess, I think the Final Fantasy Anthologies/Chronicles/etc was released to commemorate the anniversary of FF franchise. As such, if FF3 wasn't released then, it wouldn't need to be commemorated I guess.<br>  <br>  As for Dracula X... well who knows?

Although it may be useful at times, it is not effective in most standard games.<br>  <br>  Togekiss is good as Scarf Special Attacker or a ParaFlinch Rooster.<br>  <br>  Rotom is generally outclassed by Gengar unless you're using Oven Rotom (obtained after getting Secret Key event in Platinum) which has Overheat.<br>  <br>  Lucario is great. Sword Dance ExtremeSpeed version is most common and deadly.<br>  <br>  Vaporeon is awesome as a defensive wall and Wish healer.<br>  <br>  The last Pokemon out of those 3 should obviously be Garchomp because it is by far the strongest Pokemon listed there. Garchomp can have competition with Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Dialga or Palkia, taking them down with nearly no problem at all. However, if you're planning on battling WiFi against other players, besure to know that Garchomp's usually BANNED due to its power and being in the very top banlist tier "Uber" along with things like Rayquaza, Darkrai, Giratina and Mewtwo.<br>  <br>  A set as Sword Dance, Fire Fang, Earthquake and Outrage, holding Yache Berry, is the most effective set for Garchomp. Jolly nature is a MUST and speed MUST be over 330 when it is at level 100.<br>  <br>  If you look at the programming of the Pokemon game, the damage calculation is done by the formula below:<br>  <br>  Damage = ((((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * AttackStat * AttackPower / DefenseStat) / 50) + 2) * STAB * Weakness/Resistance * {RandomNumber Between 85 to 100} / 100<br>  <br>  After 1 Sword Dance, Garchomp's Attack is max at 718 with Jolly Nature, and Outrage has 180 Power (with Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) on Garchomp) and Earthquake has 150 Power. Garchomp is also the fastest out of all non-legendary Dragons, therefore can sweep with ease. Fire Fang is only for Skarmory and Bronzong, who are immune to Earthquake and resists Outrage. Do make sure you only use Physical Attacks on this thing as it will benefit from Sword Dance. If you don't like the confusion from Outrage, Dragon Claw is a good alternative.<br>  <br>  Its defense and HP are high and beyond expectation, as non-STAB Ice Beam cannot kill Garchomp with its Yache Berry without at least 269 in Special Attack or I believe around 300+ in Attack (STAB can kill). This allow you to set up Sword Dance and then revenge kill for massive damage. Any team that does not have at least 2 things with Ice Attacks that can hurt Garchomp is epic fail. Garchomp has no other weaknesses besides Dragon and Ice, and it is immune to Thunder Wave, all electric attacks and resists Stealth Rock. Such a powerful Pokemon, if you use well, or abuse it well, you can almost guarentee for a win. As I said, Garchomp's usually banned.<br>  <br>  By the way, STAB is Same Type Attack Bonus, which is if your Pokemon's typing is same as the move it is using, the move's power is increased by 1.5x of its original power (Hence Earthquake from 100 becomes 150 on Garchomp).<br>  <br>  If you have WiFi, feel free to battle me.

T1u29djmaa	I am literally a pokemon master.  Listen up!<br>  <br>  I am going to get platinum version too.  <br>  <br>  in the game, by what i've heard from pokemon.com  and www.psypokes.com, Giritina will be in origin forme only in the alternate world and land forme while in the Sinnoh world.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't come out till March 22.|`|grTNCMb9aa	You catch it in origin form in the torn world or whatever-when you leave the torn world with it,  it becomes the other form- you can keep it origin form by finding a item in mt.cornet near the big waterfall in a cave above but it requires the move and use of waterfall to get it  and you make it hold the item <br>  To get both forms youll  need two of that pokemon and the item i just talked about  <br>  Its supposed to be some kinda orb like dialgas and palkias|`|BEiSd278aa	Well, I think you capture it around the same time you would capture Dialga/Palkia in Diamond/Pearl (the final battle with team Galactic's leader) and you catch it in origin forme, but once you get bak to the real world, it will revert to altered forme but a "nearby item" will allow you to change at will. (WATCH THE MOVIE : Giratina and the Sky Bouquet)<br>  <br>  hope this helps! :)

cKi84gjsaa	1.<br>  Visit Kakariko village while an adult and locate the Cukku Lady. Talk to her <br>  and she will give you an egg. Wait for it to hatch overnight then find Talon <br>  asleep in a house in the village - use the Cukku to "cluck" and talon will be <br>  awoken. Now go back to the Cukku lady and she will give you a bluer Cukku egg.<br>  <br>  2.<br>  Now, take the Blue Cukku to the lost woods. Find an odd somber looking man sitting near a tree where the skullkid was standing and show him the <br>  Blue Cukku and you will receive a mushroom.<br>  <br>  3.<br>  Now head back to Kakariko village and bring it to the potion shop (near Death <br>  Mountain Pass). Enter the shop and pass the counter on the left to go out <br>  back. Walk up the stairs to find the witch who is looking for this mushroom. <br>  Do this and you will get a new potion.<br>  <br>  4. Now go all the way back to the lost woods, right back to where that odd guy <br>  who gave you the mushroom was. There will be a kokiri girl, give her the potion <br>  and she will give you the Poachers Saw.<br>  <br>  5.<br>  Now head over Gerudo Valley, give the carpenter near the bridge the poachers <br>  saw, he will give you a broken sword in return, give the Poacher's Saw to the <br>  carpenter at the bridge to Gerudo Valley. He will give you a Broken Sword in <br>  place of it. <br>  <br>  6.<br>  Now go to the top of Death Mountain, pass the Goron cave just continue <br>  climbing. Give the broken sword to the Goron up at the top. But there is ash <br>  in his eyes from an eruption and he cannot see well. So, he will give you an <br>  eye drop prescription.<br>  <br>  7.<br>  Take this Eye Drops to King Zora. (You need to go to jabu jabu's alter and go left, do the mini ice temple and be sure to bring back a bottle of blue fire to melt king zora)  and he <br>  will give you Frog Eyeballs. Now go to Lake Hyla, you will need to jump the <br>  fences with Epona. DO NOT WARP!!!! Go into the hut/lab (not the fishing area) <br>  and show the lab worker the Frog Eyeballs.<br>  <br>  8. <br>  Run to Lake Hylia and give the eyeballs to the scientist at the Lake <br>  laboratory. He will then exchange the eyeballs for eye drops.<br>  <br>  9.<br>  Now you have four minutes  before they expire so run as fast <br>  as possible, take Epona to Kakariko village, go up Death Mountain Path, and <br>  quickly show the Big Goron the eye drops.<br>  <br>  10. <br>  You will now have to wait three days. Or you could just play the Suns Song six <br>  times to fast forward time. By the time three days have past you will have the <br>  Biggoron's Sword.

MK5Ddtiiaa	You can't make it go away because that what happens on the ride. Your stomach is dropping with you and you feel weightlessness. That is why people scream because of that feeling. You are suppose to put your hands up (if allowed) and scream or yell. Its fun. I just put my hands up though and don't scream or yell. Still, just ignore it if its bothering you or don't ride them anymore if you don't like it.|`|wyvSAhtZaa	No, you cannot. It is caused by gravity. When you are in free fall, such as on those drop tower rides, or when you travel over a hill fast, you are actually experiencing weightlessness or lower g-levels. While in free fall, your body is in "flight or fight" mode. Even though you know you are completely safe, and you are strapped in, your brain is telling you that you are falling. Since nothing is supporting your body's contents while in free fall, they seem to float around in your stomach. Blood will not sink to your feet, as there is no up or down while in free fall. It is the same as when you are in orbit.      I have found ways to minimize this sensation. You just tighten your stomach muscles, and this seems to help.|`|OTex8cv5aa	That is why people S*C*R*E*A*M !!!! when they ride.    Try screaming.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	no and i don't see why you'd want to. thats the best part of the ride as far as i'm concerned.   thats why i go on roller coasters. there's nothing like the loosing your stomach feeling. and the bigger the drop the more of that feeling you'll get.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	NO. The reason is that it is an involuntary response of your body to the sloshing around of the liquid in your inner ear which affects your balance because of the forces acting on your body. You have NO choice when it comes to an involuntary response. Your inner ear thinks you are falling and it acts accordingly. Even though you can SEE you are NOT falling, you get the same queasy feeling just as if you WERE falling. The exact same thing happens in a fast elevator that is going down, but in this case, you ARE falling in a sense. My fear of heights, elevators, flying, and high bridges does not come from the actual motions involved, but rather from the mere thought there is nothing but empty air under me. The strange thing is, I have NO problem with roller coasters. But, in an airplane, it is all white knuckles and loads of alcoholic beverages and I NEVER loosen the seatbelt...|`|5AI4xIB3aa	Usually, if you eat something spicy,sometimes it goes away. I'd never do this because the feeling is the fun of it. Still...|`|GBlIkUJdaa	Take Dramamine.  It is used for motion sickness.  It is very effective, especially when traveling by boat.|`|v1w4jsrMaa	go on a big roller coast expierence it then bam u get rid of it atleast it worked for me|`|9uMwBOThaa	no u cant make it go away  everyone feels it, but some people deal with it better than others

nBUDjyhgaa	The largest scale I've seen is 1/16....Not near big enough to ride. Try asking the guys at www.kitmaker.net.You may have to open your own account, but it's all free.Lots of world-class modelers with a wealth of information.Years ago, I did see a STuG IV built from a small CASE <br>  bulldozer/ tractor that was RC....Bigger than the bed of a pickup truck.
43zXRpLYaa	Everyone who has answered before me is WRONG!<br>  <br>  When you get in on your birthday for free, the ticket is worth $69. Go to the annual pass center and they will take that off the price of the annual pass.<br>  <br>  Say you get the Southern California Select annual pass for $134. They will take off $69 so all you pay is $65. If you do the payment plan you would pay $5.42 per month.<br>  <br>  When I went on my birthday I paid $25 to get a park hopper ticket. Since I live in Southern California they gave me a 2-fer park hopper. Two weeks later was my daughters birthday, so we went back and her ticket was free and since I had the 2-fer I got in free too. I went to the annual pass center to get my pass for this year. They gave me $69 off for my birthday AND the $25 I paid for the park hopper. That's $94 total. I got the Southern California annual pass for $174. They took off the $94 and I only had to pay $80. I used my credit card and did the payment plan for $6.67 per month.<br>  <br>  So yes, you get the $69 taken off the total price for the annual pass.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	You have two choices.<br>  <br>  You can get the 1-Day/1-Park admission ticket and then upgrade that to the Annual Pass, basically getting $69 off of your AP.  But with this since you got the free admission you DO NOT get the gift card.<br>  ---<br>  Q: Can I upgrade my free birthday ticket to another ticket type?<br>  A: Yes, the free birthday ticket may be upgraded to another ticket type on your birthday. However the celebrant is responsible for the incremental cost and the new ticket may only be used by the celebrant. The 1-Day / 1-Park ticket good for 12 months (an option for certain passholders and multi-day ticket holders) may not be upgraded. <br>  -----<br>  The other way is to buy the AP at full price in advance and go that day using the AP.  Since you didn't get the free ticket you are entitled to the Gift Card, but it can only be used at select stores.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the pass already, I would suggest just getting the free park ticket and then upgrading to the AP.  This way you don't have to worry about how to spend the gift card.|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	Okay, i had the same idea so i called them up and here is the deal....<br>  <br>  You CANNOT use the gift card to buy an annual pass. you already have to have an annual pass on your birthday or buy it before you will be able to get the gift card. the gift card can be use at most of the shops. i say most because there are some things that are not run or owned by Disney. so they will not take the gift card. and you cannot exchange it for cash.

2GNFQPdmaa	Free games do not have big budgets<br>  <br>  Games without big budgets do not get high-quality 3D graphics.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a free MMO, you're not going to find something on the cutting edge of graphics.|`|BgZCETPZaa	Guns<br>  Runescape<br>  Ragnarok|`|lhek8CMRaa	Fly For Fun (Flyff) <a href="http://flyff.mmosite.com" rel="nofollow">http://flyff.mmosite.com</a><br>  FlyFF is the flagship MMORPG from Gala-Net, Developed by Aeonsoft, the game takes place in a beautifully rendered 3-D environment and features an exciting mix of high flying vehicles intertwined within fantasy-inspired game play with impressive Anime style graphics.

The community is totally amazing and you can barely see anyone using the word "noob". The PvP system is awesome and the good thing about it is you don't have to be a high level to be good at it or even give it a try. The upgrading system is probably the fairest you can find in any game.<br>  <br>  Granado Espada(Sword of the New World)<br>  <a href="http://ge.mmosite.com" rel="nofollow">http://ge.mmosite.com</a><br>  Granado Espada distinguishes itself from many modern-day MMORPGs with its Multiple Character Control (MCC) system. Rather than playing one character at a time, or using two clients to do so, a player may control a party of up to three characters in a single gaming session. This party play aspect of the game gives Granado Espada more of the feel of traditional, non- networked console and PC RPGs. The character order may be set within the Barracks at the beginning of the game, and any member of the party can be selected to lead the other characters or act alone at any time throughout the game. The other two characters can be commanded to follow or attend the lead character as the party moves through a given area. <br>  <br>  If no one you like, you could search yourself in <a href="http://gamelist.mmosite.com" rel="nofollow">http://gamelist.mmosite.com</a>|`|dvlNp56yaa	runescape is the best MMORPG thats free in the gaming world and warcraft isn't free the trial you have to pay for too you have to buy it in a store. also runescape is the second best MMORPG game out there.<br>  <br>  so try it out it actually has graphics and if you dont like it i got another game but it isnt as good probly the worst MMorpg wich is  nowhere-else.org|`|re6l4375aa	World Of Warcraft, the trial is free|`|stEFmt1qaa	If you haven't played the best MMORPG it World of Warcraft.

tIHAHtkxaa	Ch ya! its a great game just bought it today for 360 a little pricey but well worth it great game since it is a prequel u won't have a problem understanding anything story wise and the combat system is very sophisticated but don't worry there a tutorial to go thru in the beginning but you can skip it completely if you already know the controls.

CYwvuqclaa	for the base series which had charizard there are 16 holos and there are non non-holo versions. For the fossil and Jungle sets there were 16 holos and then duplicate non-holo versions of the cards which made up a set but only in the Fossil and Jungle series. For example card number 3/64 in the jungle series is a holo flareon and card number 19/64 is a non-holo flareon, you need both of them to complete your jungle set. hope i helped.
