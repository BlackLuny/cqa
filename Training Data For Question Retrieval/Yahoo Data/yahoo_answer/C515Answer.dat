But, dropping around 20lbs in a healthy way and get used to being healthy and exercising, will help you short term (mentally and physically) and also keep you with good habits as you age.<br>  <br>  = )|`|unYshaUkaa	You shouldn't lose any because I'm pretty sure that your not overweight and even if you are it's whats on the inside that counts and most people destroy their health trying to lose weight and that can't be good for you.

Dont let your weight go under 130lbs.<br>  Dont rush your weight loss either, you lose too much too fast then you get stretch marks, excess skin and you are very likely to put all the weight back on v.fast.<br>  Try to to stick to losing about 1 - 3lbs per week.<br>  Eat large breakfast (low carbohydrates - High Protein) and small dinner. Snack on fruit through out the day.<br>  Go for a 20 - 30 min brisk walk or jog before breakfast, speeds up ur metabolism.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

If you were more confident in your birth control method you wouldn't have to deal with these added worries.
Cd9mhy1Laa	its not PREGGO it's pregnant. You can't get pregnant from using your brothers towel sperm dies after being exposed to air. You can only get pregnant through sex or internal implantation of a seed. <br>  <br>  YOU CAN get pregnant on your period by having SEX though.|`|IVjspiStaa	yes.you can<br>  and<br>  no not from that.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You should always use your own towel and let others use theirs.  I don't think you will get pregnant from that.<br>  <br>  best wishes|`|AA11879143	I'd say there's about a 0% chance of your being pregnant. Sperm can only live for a few seconds outside of the body, and even if they were still around, there's no way they could find their way from a towel, through the exterior and interior lips of your vagina, and into your womb - they need lots of fluid to swim through.<br>  I'd go so far as to say that no woman has ever gotten pregnant through a towel unless there was a huge gob of very fresh semen and she rubbed it directly into her cervix.<br>  <br>  However, it is possible, though the odds miniscule, to get pregnant while menstruating. <br>  <br>  Believe me, there's simply no way you could get pregnant in the case you're describing.|`|2zGKZB6gaa	You should really be using your own towel. Think about it... That is a gross thing to share. And yes, like everyone else has said, you can get pregnant while on your period, but it would take actual intercourse which you... are going to avoid for a very very VERY long time. ;-)|`|2WqYM2pRaa	You can get pregnant during your period, but you cannot get pregnant from rubbing against a towel. Do you realize you need to actually have sexual intercourse in order to get pregnant?|`|jzpKHdjsaa	Yes it is possible to get pregnant while you are menstruating, but not without sexual contact. You don't have to worry about a towel.|`|XMlRn30laa	If your brother is cumming on the clean towels, then putting them back, I would stop sharing towels with him.  Sperm cannot live very long outside of a body, so I wouldn't worry if he did get some on the towel.  But, yes, it is possible to get pregnant even while menstruating.  This is rare, but better safe than sorry.|`|YFusGTQZaa	Don't worry about it. You can't get pregnant DURING your period, but you can like 2 weeks after your period ends (which is like the middle of before/after). <br>  <br>  And P.S. There's no way you can get pregnant off of just using the same towel so no need to worry what so ever.|`|G7gRVB1Oaa	You won't get pregnant from your bothers towel. If it were that easy to get pregnant I would have had 20 kids by now. But, the answer is although it is very unlikely to happen you could get pregnant while having your period.|`|bba25281f7abd1fa799d66dffff4994eaa	Yes you can get pregnant while you are menstruating.  You should not be sharing towels.  And you and your brother should not be dressing in the sake room, this is inappropriate!|`|IuvNR5Mbaa	you are not going to get pregnant from sharing a towel with your brother but yes you can get preggers if you have sex while you have your period.|`|9bRUJ9lwaa	Absolutely. Now you're gonna have to tell your mum your own brother impregnated you.|`|htNL7aaxaa	No, you will not get preg from sharing towels!  But try using your own towel!  What if your bro used part of the towel to dry his butt off, and then you go and dry your face off with that part??!!!  yuck|`|5vUtwTv9aa	your not gunna get pregnant from that..and you can get preggo while on ur period but its like highly unlikely|`|zDHbfX3gaa	Yes.|`|rVzfcAX7aa	I highly doubt it<br>  <br>  From now on get your own towel.

RCpkdx4haa	it is conterproductive. your muscles don't grow from working out, they grow from the recovery from the workout. when you lift weights, you're actually tearing muscle fibers. when they are rebuilt, they grow a tiny, tiny bit. that's where muscle growth comes from. lifting with different muscle groups on consecutive days is fine because you are allowing the previous day's muscle group to recover, but continually working the same group on consecutive days is definately counterproductive. make sure you get protein within a half hour of your working out also. about 15-20 grams, from lean meats like fish or chicken. milk is also a great, after workout drink without spending a bundle at your local health food store.
85KL0eUUaa	No<br>  You aren't<br>  You're 12, you're in a healthy weight range for your age<br>  It's like, bmi of 15-21 is healthy for a 12 year old.<br>  They are just jealous coz you aren't fat or going to be fat.<br>  Seriously, they're jealous, own it.|`|7YYZtqdkaa	The pattern for losing those extra pounds is not difficult - eat less food and exercise more often - the issues appear when we actually try to put that into practice! There are loads of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The only method that really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away twenty five pounds, it really does produce success!|`|a26R2PuWaa	I say no you're not to skinny. And Honestly I used to discriminate towards women i did not like. But my brother in-law let me hear a song and it's called <br>   "one more drink" by ludacris and T-Pain. Anyways at the end of the song Luda says stop DISCRIMINATING. And now every time I look at women I like I think of ONE MORE DRINK.|`|ZDGBCE50aa	no,you are slim but you are only twelve tell them not to worry.|`|uTxUxoVRaa	okay girls honestly i am going to be mean and honest you think you are thin but later you think you are fat. that can drive a man nuts you are what you are. i  am sorry if this offends you.
6NZeItMAaa	One way to start your change is to simply cut down on what you eat. You can still have that spaghetti you love, but try smaller portions…and adding that small salad.<br>  <br>  Fruits and vegetables should also be added to your diet.<br>  <br>  ABOUT JUNK FOOD…<br>  <br>  Junk food is one of the major contributors to our weight problem.<br>  <br>  They are empty / useless calories! <br>  <br>  We have to get over our obsession with all the junk food. <br>  <br>  What we don’t want to do though, is to send our body into shock by stopping it cold turkey. <br>  <br>  Wean yourself off of it. Instead of 10 cookies at a time, try 8…then try 6…gradually. <br>  <br>  While changing your diet is a great start in your Journey, it may not be enough. Adding exercise can help to speed up the process.<br>  <br>  Now, exercise does not have to be a full-blown, 5-day a week, 5 hours a day exercise plan! <br>  <br>  Start by walking. Start slow – walk around the block. As time goes on, increase your speed and distance.<br>  <br>  If you are up to it and your doctor agrees, do more cardiovascular exercises at a gym or the local YMCA. <br>  <br>  One key to exercise is to vary your routine. Not only will that help you from getting bored stiff doing the same thing over and over, it helps keep your body from “learning” that routine and compensating. If you do the same thing over and over, your body becomes trained. So, keep it guessing!<br>  <br>  Some great ways of exercising:<br>  <br>  Bicycling, swimming, racquetball, tennis, walking, running, yoga, Pilates, weight training, aerobics, nature walks, fitness programs at your local gym or the YMCA.<br>  <br>  There are many ways you can exercise. You just have to find one that you really like!<br>  <br>  But the key here is to do something! Even just walking is MUCH better than sitting on the couch.|`|Kk6wAZDtaa	I hear this question alot and most people turn right to diets. Everyone's heard the say "DIETS DON'T WORK!!!" They do in some cases. <br>  <br>  1.I have the Wii Fit and its worked wonders. It tells you your BMI and where you are on the ever valuable... FITNESS SCALE!!! It also tells you what you need to work on and to improve on. <br>  <br>  2.I'm on a swim team and swim every day. I have become very fit and gained huge amounts of muscle tone from it. Everyone needs a good healty sport or physical activity besides driving up to the gym and running on the tredmill. People who do so, end up rewarding themselves with smoothies, lates, and fatty snacks. <br>  <br>  3.If your searching for a good exercise routine then here's one: Wake up at a cool time in the morning (Daybreak?) and take a dog for a walk or just go for a walk. Avoid straight and narrow roads and aim for the Everest replicas lol. When you eat breakfast, skip the Fruity Pebbles and Apple Juice. Have a fried egg, fruit, and toasted toast with butter. Don't forget milk! (Milk is a great source of calcuim!) During Mid-day, I reccomend participating in that afternoon activity or sport I told you about earlier. At night, try to avoid working out. Cool down from your earlier activity and treat yourself to some more milk!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|9ZgvC2quaa	HI,<br>  <br>  I think your weight-loss goal is a bit excessive.

Also try whole wheat and whole grain breads and pastas. eat lots of protein and fiber. Try working out 3-5 days a week. THE BEST WAY to lose pounds is by working out and eating healthy.

sQu3LLqtaa	Fattening suppers as you don't burn them up.  Apparently more people are killed by fattening suppers than the sword.|`|8SRjELNBaa	eat twinkies & drink protein shakes.|`|o65klEwWaa	How old are you? Different advice for different ages. (OK have now edited for your age)<br>  <br>  DON'T GAIN FAT - GAIN MUSCLE. Eat plenty of protein, and exercise with weights (eg: walking up and down the stairs with a can of beans in each hand). Don't worry, you won't look like Arnold Swarzenegger. It takes years of SERIOUS weight lifting to get that big. Exercising with weights for a 13 yo can be tricky, especially if you don't have access to a gym. Try using your own body weight for resistance at this stage. Check out youtube and google "weight training" to find full solutions - keywords: squats and pullups/chinups. One other brainwave I just had was for you to have a quick chat with your school gym teacher. They love to pass on advice and if you mentioned that you were interested in bulking up, you may find that they would allow you to use the gym equipment (climbing ropes, etc) after school or during lunch. You never know until you ask - they may be able to accommodate you in some way.<br>  <br>  Try to eat three main meals and 2-3 large snacks per day and ensure that the snacks are mostly protein based. The meals should be 1/3 protein and 2/3 whole food carbs with the entire size of the meal being about the size of both your fists held together. Whole food carbs are unprocessed veg and fruit and whole grains. Don't be put off by the sugar in fruit, this is a sustainable energy source (High GI).<br>  <br>  Being a teenager, you should probably add some full-fat dairy products (avoid low fat/low sugar/processed items), but don't start to get a taste for high-carb items like fried foods and sweets, as you may find your metabolism will swing the wrong way later in life and you'll end up a fatty.<br>  <br>  Remember, being skinny, you are in an ideal (and enviable) position to create a beautiful body. By building muscle you will tone and add definition. If you are a boy you will gain bulk, if you are a girl you will look toned and beautiful. Fat people have the difficulty of having their muscles obscured by their fat, so it is hard to see any body building results.   There really is no good reason for any person to want more than 10-20% fat on their bodies.<br>  <br>  One last thing, if you are a girl (and I think you are not judging by your avatar, but I'll leave this in for others) and are aspiring to add bigger boobs, that is another story. Boobs are just sacks of fat. Unfortunately our genetics dictate where we store fat on our bodies and some WOMEN store fat in boobs, others around the waist or inner thighs. Don't try to get fat in order to get boobs. At 13 you have no idea how big your boobs will end up, as teenagers grow them at different rates.|`|UEGxo7Yoaa	Well, its not fat you need to gain.<br>  I mean, yeah, just try to eat more. <br>  Or eat at irregular hours, it will throw your metabolism off and then you'll gain fat.<br>  But just eat more, you know, but still work out.<br>  Because what happens when you arent too skinny, but your way fat?<br>  You gotta healthily gain weight, you know?
sQu3LLqtaa	Phentermine is the better one as Apidexin is not included in the 5 best diet pills that are supposed to be Orovo Detox, ZCA Stack, Phentermine, Hamcho Slim and Hoodia Chaser.

I've found that excercing, even though I don't have a lot of extra energy for it, helps make me more sleepy in the evenings.<br>  <br>  It doesn't address the reasons that you are overeating, so if you generally eat even if you aren't hungry because of emotional reasons, you should probably see a therepist to try to have them help you deal with that before spending money on this drug.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Quit drinking soda pop, even diet soda pop. Start drinking lots of water.<br>  For breakfast, eat a bowl of Special K or Cheerios with Skim Milk.<br>  Between meals, eat some dry cereal when you get hungry.<br>  For Lunch, eat a Turkey sandwich on Wheat Bread, using mustard or Fat Free Mayo.<br>  For Dinner, eat some type of lean meat, a Vegetable, and a salad.<br>  In the evening, if you get hungry, eat some dry cereal.

It the powerlifts it changes your biomechanics which may help a little, but it is muscle hat will help. You are likely overtraining your bis with to light a weight. Try adding in 15s even if you an only do 6 or 7 reps do them. Then get the 20s and do sets of 5. Keep increasing weights and changing up the reps and your strength will improve, as well as your size. Try to do around 9-14 sets for bicepts split between 3-5 exercises, which should be changed week to week. Track your poundages and try to improve every week even if its 2lbs or 5lbs extra or try one more rep with the 15s than you could do last week.<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake.

For the adolescent who are in the growth period and it is the normal. As different physical condition. You just need to keep suitable exercise and take suitable food.

A headache is the first sign of dehydration so make sure to make time to drink water before during and after your workouts!|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Drink more water|`|Z2ErfHpoaa	Drink some sort of sports water, maybe eat something with some sugar. You might be getting a drop in blood sugar due to the increased exercise, eat something before-hand. Good luck!
4kiV8CaNaa	Muscle only builds under fat (fat does not turn into muscle) so you still need cardio and diet to lose the fat.
7e93c8ae2870f2afdb6338542707db20aa	No, because you could be 30lbs overweight and be hangin with guys 40, 50 or more pounds overweight.  In your case, however, it sounds like you may be a bit disingenuous simply because you are fishing for compliments and validation.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	welll the way they see it, they know they are fatter than you so they'll be like "well if your fat, what do u think of me<br>  i dont really know how they feel coz im not fat but i wouldnt hav made a big deal about it|`|02m3W938aa	No, as long as you don't run up next to obese people and yell "OH MY GOD I AM SUCH A FAT ***" regularly, it's not really rude to criticize your own weight in front of others who may be bigger than you.<br>  <br>  However, if you talk about it a LOT, then it could just be that you're being obnoxious and obsessive. And if you workout five hours a day, it's not a wonder your girlfriend dumped you--how much time can you really spend with others when you spend a fourth of your day or more working out?!|`|PXvAYYD5aa	My friends & I argue a lot about that,<br>  I'd consider it a little offensive, IF you were fishing<br>  for compliments.

AA11081018	you might find it hard to loose weight doing all that muscle building excersize.... as you get about 30 days before your deadline cut the pushups in half and add stairs... lots of stairs... not running but walking briskly... the ups will build up you leg strength the dows will help with your balance and cardio excersizes are best for burning weight off.... do not go below a gallon of water and maybe even push it to 2.... BUT then 4 days before your weigh-in drop the water to about 1/2 gal and NO soda pop or sugary drinks very light on the OJ cause its high in sugar during the whole time....<br>  <br>  Good luck

I tried a lot of the products like Hydroxycut, but they only made me dizzy and nauseous, not skinny! :) lol<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you check out things like acai berry or colon cleanse products that help to boost energy levels and speed up metabolism naturally. Add them to a strictly healthy diet and a lot of exercise, and you should start to see results pretty quickly. Remember - there are no miracle pills, so if you want to lose weight, you can't just sit around on your butt all day eating pizza!<br>  <br>  Anyways, let me know if you have any other questions.

I had never taken a supplement before and was quite nervous about taking it- I did research all the ingredients and I liked what I found.  You should check into it also.

Good luck- I hope you have as much success as I have had. cheers|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.<br>  <br>  Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.<br>  <br>  First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern.

I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> along with getting some good info.

And vice versa.<br>  <br>  As far as exercise goes, for serious weightloss, you probably need to A: do more than that and B: up your intensity. The first 20 minutes you spend excercising, you're not even burning fat.
6sPcYQr0aa	Get a guy friend that will work out with you that you can trust and that knows what he is doing. Or get a female trainer or friend... doesn't matter, it has been shown that people that work ut in groups, work out  harder and get better results than people that workout alone. Or go to the gym when its empty. Good luck and God bless.

ZhiYghZ1aa	try to revolve your meals around vegetables and fruits, not a lot of carbs. you should buy fresh vegetables and start making your own dinners like stir fry with a little rice, vegetable sandwich with veggies, beans burrito with veggies. oatmeal is a good thing to eat for breakfast it fills you up easily and keeps you full for a long time. i don't know if you eat dairy but if you do try to not over eat that but make sure you still get all your nutrients. i know when your not eating meat you feel like you have to turn to dairy or breads to fill up your diet with protein, but the truth is most omnivores get way to much protein but your probably getting close to what you need. just try to eat a variety of foods so you know you are getting in all your amino acids.<br>  the best thing you can do is exercise even if you start out with running a 1/2 mile a day then you should work up to about three miles a day. try to find an exercise you like whether its runner or dancing.|`|7s5OU7Sxaa	check out the calorie restriction society<br>  super healthy people who have a reduced calorie intake<br>  you can get excellent low cal. high nutrition recipes on their website below.(recipes under society services)<br>  when i was a vegetarian i got very thin. these people are even thinner than i was.|`|r1fLDlhCaa	hah when i first went vegetarian, i lost ten pounds just from not eating the meat, but then my mom thought it was unhealthy and i have to eat meat now. when i first started eating meat i gained thirty pounds within a year and a half (yuckkkk) ive lost most of it though|`|fOfqPATaaa	cut your meals in half =)

This disorder is the result of a failure, partial or complete pancreas to synthesize insulin or an inability of cells to use insulin to absorb glucose.<br>  you may also refer here for more info:|`|iK3YYRaTaa	People develop diabetes because the pancreas does not make enough insulin or because the cells in the muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly, or both. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose, also called hyperglycemia, damages nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation.<br>  <br>  Main Types of Diabetes<br>  The two main types of diabetes are called type 1 and type 2. A third form of diabetes is called gestational diabetes.<br>  <br>  Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. In this form of diabetes, the pancreas no longer makes insulin because the body’s immune system has attacked and destroyed the pancreatic cells specialized to make insulin. These insulin-producing cells are called beta cells.<br>  <br>  Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common form. People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. This form of diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin properly. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells to be used for energy. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. In time, however, the pancreas loses its ability to secrete enough insulin in response to meals.<br>  <br>  Gestational diabetes is diabetes that first occurs during pregnancy. When women are pregnant, their need for insulin appears to increase, and many can develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.<br>  <br>  Other Types of Diabetes<br>  A number of other types of diabetes exist. A person may exhibit characteristics of more than one type. For example, in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), also called type 1.5 diabetes or double diabetes, people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30.<br>  <br>  Most people with LADA still produce their own insulin when first diagnosed, like those with type 2 diabetes, but within a few years, they must take insulin to control blood glucose levels. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas stop making insulin because the body’s immune system attacks and destroys them. Some experts believe that LADA is a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes.<br>  <br>  Other types of diabetes include those caused by<br>  <br>  genetic defects of the beta cell, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes mellitus <br>  genetic defects in insulin action, resulting in the body’s inability to control blood glucose levels, as seen in leprechaunism and the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome <br>  diseases of the pancreas or conditions that damage the pancreas, such as pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis <br>  excess amounts of certain hormones resulting from some medical conditions—such as cortisol in Cushing’s syndrome—that work against the action of insulin <br>  medications that reduce insulin action, such as glucocorticoids, or chemicals that destroy beta cells <br>  infections, such as congenital rubella and cytomegalovirus <br>  rare autoimmune disorders, such as stiff-man syndrome, an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system <br>  genetic syndromes associated with diabetes, such as Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome <br>  <br>  Wow what an answer.Wow , good question, you get a star!|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	The Balance of Glucose and Insulin: <br>  Diabetes is a disorder that affects the way your body uses food for energy. Normally, the sugar you take in is digested and broken down to a simple sugar, known as glucose. The glucose then circulates in your blood where it waits to enter cells to be used as fuel. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps move the glucose into cells. A healthy pancreas adjusts the amount of insulin based on the level of glucose. But, if you have diabetes, this process breaks down, and blood sugar levels become too high.There are two main types of full-blown diabetes. People with Type 1 diabetes are completely unable to produce insulin. People with Type 2 diabetes can produce insulin, but their cells don't respond to it. In either case, the glucose can't move into the cells and blood glucose levels can become high. Over time, these high glucose levels can cause serious complications.<br>  <br>  Pre-Diabetes: <br>  Pre-diabetes means that the cells in your body are becoming resistant to insulin or your pancreas is not producing as much insulin as required. Your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be called diabetes. This is also known as "impaired fasting glucose" or "impaired glucose tolerance". A diagnosis of pre-diabetes is a warning sign that diabetes will develop later. The good news: You can prevent the development of Type 2 diabetes by losing weight, making changes in your diet and exercising. <br>  <br>  What is Pre-Diabetes?<br>  Type 1 Diabetes: <br>  A person with Type 1 diabetes can't make any insulin. Type 1 most often occurs before age 30, but may strike at any age. Type 1 can be caused by a genetic disorder. The origins of Type 1 are not fully understood, and there are several theories. But all of the possible causes still have the same end result: The pancreas produces very little or no insulin anymore. Frequent insulin injections are needed for Type 1. <br>  <br>  Type 1 Diabetes<br>  Insulin and Diabetes<br>  Type 2 Diabetes: <br>  A person with Type 2 diabetes has adequate insulin, but the cells have become resistant to it. Type 2 usually occurs in adults over 35 years old, but can affect anyone, including children. The National Institutes of Health state that 95 percent of all diabetes cases are Type 2. Why?

It usually appears during the second trimester and disappears after the birth of the baby.<br>  <br>  Like Type 1 and Type 2, your body can't use glucose effectively and blood glucose levels get too high. When GD is not controlled, complications can affect both you and your baby. Your doctor will help you work out a diet and exercise plan, and possibly medication. Having GD increases your risk for developing it again during future pregnancies and also raises your risk of Type 2 diabetes later in life.|`|ryroJmT5aa	High fructose corn syrup is what I believe. Basically the food industry started using an artificial sweetener several times more potent than regular sugar. Every time you drink soda, iced tea, or eat syrup you are ingesting this ingredient. Also all the carbs like bread, fries, bagels, and noodles which basically break down into sugar. Over time the body becomes resistant to insulin, and your organs get eaten away from all the sugar.

RoqVeuLmaa	If it hurts, it is obviously a problem for you, whatever its cause.  A couple of possibilities:  a cyst that is increasing in size, or a varicocele (varicose veins in the veins that drain the testicles).  The latter of these is very common and can increase in size over time.  It can be quite uncomfortable.  Occasionally, they need to be surgically corrected, but usually don't cause too many problems.  <br>  <br>  If your urologist is unresponsive to your concerns, I would suggest a different opinion.  Ask them for a specific diagnosis and a plan for how they will help it improve.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Tell them it hurts, and tell them where. Explain the pain to them, and they should do tests on you.

May God Bless You.|`|gnIEDg6maa	I would call the first urologist back again.  He knows your history.  Tell the lump has not receded and you think the size has increased.

They will pull your chart and he will decide if he needs to take another look or refer you to someone else.  I think he will see you and take action.|`|lIfO2MGGaa	A sist in an area that has no bone present can stay there for a very, very long time.

s3Sz1wRBaa	I don't think its because your still in puberty or that you haven't matured all the way, its most likely your genes. Your dad and bro got one set of genes and you got another.|`|gnIEDg6maa	To answer your questions?  No, no and no.  Be glad you are missing lots of hair, UGH.  Look at the money you will save on hot waxing and removing it. Sorry about the penis but it will get the job done. Learn good techniques, fingers, tongue, etc. That will more than make up for it.|`|rVsnBLfdaa	I would not worry, body hair varies according to the individuals genes.

If you were a 'late bloomer' - then you must have started puberty later than age 12.  If that's the case, you won't end puberty until at least age 25.   Anything is possible.

Oq5a5hRhaa	As soon as you put it in blood got on the string?<br>  <br>  Then I would suspect that you had blood that was already lower in your vagina than the tampon was. This blood rubbed off onto the string.<br>  <br>  I doubt it leaked when you first put it in. That usually only occurs after several hours of wearing it.<br>  <br>  Just put on a pantyliner when you use the first tampon of your period, and you'll be fine.|`|osoTq2dcaa	sometimes this is going to sound gross but wipe before putting the tampon in ... the blood could have just got on your string that way ... since it was right away|`|TGMUFytraa	You're not doing anything wrong, you just have a heavy flow and the tampon cannot collect all the blood. My friend had such a heavy flow that she had to use a tampon and pad. You may just stick to pads because of how heavy your flow is.

2y3rFvZIaa	Sex in a pool has nothing to do with chlorine, it is all about the protection. IF protection is properly used, no the HIV will no spread. IF there is no protection used, it depends which partner is HIV+, the amount of viral load that person has. If it's male to female and the male is HIV+, her risk is very high with out protection, if it's female (and she is HIV+) to male his chances are a little lower and if it's male to male with out protection the receiver is at a high risk if the insertive partner is HIV+.|`|1A9exac8aa	If two people are having sex in a chlorine filled swimming pool, and one has the HIV/AIDS virus, would it get spread to the other person?<br>  <br>   Yes, chlorine will not kill the HIV/AID's virus since well AID's is immune to anything (can never get rid of the STD so far)<br>  <br>  Would the chlorine do any good to kill off the virus in the water?<br>  <br>  And don't do it if your boyfriend or some guy told you it would, totally false. nd also dont do it if he has ANYTHING espically AID's.

Don't worry about having surgery unless your doctor says you really need to get it. I don't think it shrinks your testicles. Try not to worry about it. You'll be fine.
Cqyit1hzaa	yes, anytime someone who plurges it hurts their body, if she continues and it becomes a lon term thing she could end up with life thretening heart and many other organ diseases. My advise is to tell you grlfriend that you don't want to see her get hurt, and that you wish that she would stop, if she is smart she will listen, if she cant controll her indulgence in comfort foods in moderation then give her some healthy ideas that include comfort foods like chocolate, for examole special k chocolate cereal, they also have chocolate snack and meal bars, or try switching to light chocolate ice cream, the good thing about light ice cream is that you can hardly tell the difference. try to motivate her to try healthier foods that are less in cals and fat rather thatn letting her plurge, like i said it's going to hurt her!!|`|WuxsTx1taa	Yes it is dangerous to her.

AA11622061	You could be allergic to something.

Conjunctivitis is also known as pink eye. Your conjunctiva is a thin and moist skin tissue that covers the front part of your eyeball. It also covers the back of your eyelids. Your conjunctiva contains cells that help fight infections caused by germs called bacteria or viruses. If your conjunctivitis is mild, then it may heal without treatment.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your conjunctivitis is moderate or severe, then you may need treatment. Having your conjunctivitis treated may help you heal faster. You may be less likely to have eye problems from your conjunctivitis. Treatment may help many of your symptoms, including any redness, pain, and itching in your eye. You may become less likely to spread the infection to other people. This may help you go back to work or be around other people sooner than without treatment. <br>  What causes conjunctivitis? The most common infections that cause conjunctivitis are from viruses or bacteria. Conjunctivitis is also commonly caused by allergies.<br>  <br>  Allergies: You may have allergic conjunctivitis. This happens when the cells in your conjunctiva react to an allergen. An allergen is something that causes an allergy. Some common allergens that may appear during certain seasons include grass, dust, weeds, and mold. Allergens that commonly occur all year round include animal fur, feathers, and cockroaches. Eye medicine, mascara, or contact lens fluid may also cause allergic conjunctivitis. You may get allergic conjunctivitis once or it may happen again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bacteria: You may get conjunctivitis from bacteria. You may put bacteria in your eye by accident when you touch your eye with your hand. Things that touch your eye like contact lenses and contact lens fluid may also give you bacterial conjunctivitis. Bacteria from a sexually transmitted disease (STD) may also give you conjunctivitis.<br>  <br>  <br>  Viral: You may get viral conjunctivitis by being around people with conjunctivitis or other infections. Some viruses that may cause conjunctivitis include adenovirus and varicella (the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles). If you are under a lot of stress, herpes simplex virus may cause conjunctivitis. Common places you may get viral conjunctivitis include work, school, and swimming pools. Viral conjunctivitis often gets better on its own without treatment. <br>  What are the signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis? With allergic conjunctivitis, you will usually have symptoms in both eyes. You may also have signs of other allergic conditions such as asthma, a rash, or a runny nose. With bacterial conjunctivitis, you may have crusty eyelids when you wake up in the morning. You may also have tiny bumps on your conjunctiva. Discharge may be watery with allergic or viral conjunctivitis but is usually thick and sticky with bacterial conjunctivitis. If you have viral conjunctivitis, petechiae (small dots of blood) may appear on your conjunctiva. You may also have symptoms of your virus, such as sore throat and fever (high body temperature). Other common symptoms for all three of these types of conjunctivitis include:<br>  <br>  Redness in the whites of your eye. Your eyes may also appear pale or milky.<br>  <br>  <br>  Itching in your eye, throat, or skin around your eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  Burning or stinging in your eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  Watering (tearing) of your eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mucous or watery discharge from your eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  Swelling of your eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pain when you see bright light.<br>  <br>  <br>  Feeling like there is something in your eye. <br>  How is conjunctivitis diagnosed? Conjunctivitis may often be diagnosed with a physical exam and questions about your medical history and symptoms. Your caregiver may ask you if anyone you know has conjunctivitis or another type of infection. He will ask you if you or any of your family members have allergies. Your caregiver may ask you if you wear contact lenses or if you take any medicine. He may also ask you whether you have an STD. You may need any of the following:<br>  <br>  Eye exam: Your caregiver will look at your eyes, eyelids, eyelashes, and the skin around your eyes. He will ask you to look in different directions. He may gently press on your eye or eyelid to see if there is discharge. He will also look for redness and swelling in your eyelids or conjunctiva. Your caregiver will also look for signs of infection or allergies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tests:<br>  <br>  <br>  Slit-lamp microscope: Your caregiver will use a special microscope with a bright light to look into your eye. He will look for signs of infection or inflammation. This microscope also helps your caregiver see if the different parts of your eyes are healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Visual acuity: Your caregiver may use this test to check your vision. He will see whether your eyesight is clear and sharp. You will read letters or look at images to test how well you can see.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fundus exam: Your caregiver will give you medicine that makes your pupils larg|`|ldADbhYmaa	The best thing for Pink Eyes is polysporin Eye and Ear anti bacterial drops. I had my very first case of pink eye at Christmas, and those drops cleared it up quickly. You just have to make sure that you use it until you have three consecutive days without the puss-y buildup in the morning!! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	We always use cold tea for a sticky eye but if its been diagnosed as conjunctivitis really you need to take her to the docs for eye drops.|`|8QxXAmn4aa	Of course, faith still needs to kick in a little bit for it to work better and faster.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	"Conjunctivitis" only describes the state of the tissue involved.  <br>  <br>  It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, allergies, chemicals...<br>  The correct form needs to be determined to find the right treatment agent.  An antibacterial will do noting for an allergy or a virus.<br>  <br>  Neither cooled boiled water (wrong tonicity: can produce redness!) <br>  Or milk (non sterile) are good for eyes except as emergency first aid for chemical irritants in the eyes when they should be used in vast rivers, not tiny amounts.

5fdf8c08a32627423e60de5a4fbf5b31aa	Ouch!  I can't relate to your pain being that I am a guy, but I can surely understand and see how this is a serious matter to be concerned about.  The statement about blood pressure sounds very plausible, as having low blood pressure can cause oxygen starvation to the brain, resulting in losing consciousness.  If you know your period is coming on, eat a piece of sweet candy or fruit to keep your blood sugar level from dropping, as having a rapid drop in glucose can also cause a person to pass out.  Take some Midol to help with the cramps, but I would strongly advise you to see your gynecologist, as other have stated that you may be anemic, which means your hemoglobin levels (red blood cell count) may be low, causing oxygen starvation to the brain during your period due to blood loss.  An old but good remedy for anemia is to eat pomegranates, which are good for you and contain anti-oxydents to help fight against certain cell damaging cancers.|`|0c9ea495e40e98b59b80023b9ff26225aa	look up info on Poly-cystic ovarian Syndrome and endometriosis....I've heard both can cause really bad side affects like that...

AA12249160	The vagina is a self-cleaning mechanism; douching is not a good idea, as you said.  Just stick with the external cleansing.<br>  <br>  The lubricant, being water-based, will not interfere with healthy vaginal flora and will work its way out naturally.  If you're having an allergic reaction to the latex, there are non-latex alternatives.|`|AA11628609	Well, it is always good to go pee afterwards, especially for ladies who are prone to urinary tract infections.

4075a1d6a5251f5d89731dae4e2734d2aa	Well, one thing you can do to find out if you had motion sickness is get pills called Dramamine and take them while eating chocolate and its hot outside and see if you still feel sick. Dramamine is motion sickness pills. My step sister takes them. She has motion sickness.

Dont enter immediately. Most likely u cant stand hot temperature, not the brand of chocolate u ate :)|`|AA12329318	It may be as simple as you were dehydrated at the time, and chocolate will be somewhat of a hinderance with that. As a woman, you may be low in iron, all women need iron supplements. Being low on iron will make you feel dizzy also, and with the heat added to it all, it would make you feel sick as you described. Or you could just have a mild case of motion sickness, when its hot. Try iron, seriously....and drink lots of water when its hot.|`|17d6412d640086c29fe389a4aee40ff2aa	It sounds like motion sickness to me...there's really not a lot you can do, other than to keep cool, or to step out for a few minutes and get some fresh air.  I haven't tried dramamine or anything like it, so I don't know how well they work.<br>  <br>  One other thing that helps is to make sure the car is riding smoothly...If you or the driver brake(s) and accelerate(s) hard, that will make it worse.|`|AA10283901	Yes, you are getting car sick!<br>  <br>  I have had that issue for years.  I get very sick, especially with bad drivers!<br>  <br>  Take an OTC pill, DRAMAMINE!  It's specifically for motion sickness AND it works!

IHFOwIulaa	I will surely recommend taking Glutathione supplements. But of course the first step to get a legit and authentic brand. There are alot of low quality/counterfeit glutathione brands in the market today so be careful. I always order from superwhiteningpills because their brand is very good and I believe in them.<br>  <br>  The 2nd thing is the dosage. Make sure youre taking the right dosage in a day or it will not work. You also need to take vitamin c. These infos can be given by the seller.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Glutathione really does work in skin lightening, if we talk about science,  it is a Tyrosinase inhibitor and I have read some science journals that discusses the relationship of skin whitening and glutathione and so im very certain that its not just placebo. Better read their site for better understanding.<br>  <br>  It been almost like 6-8 months, I cant remember, since im taking glutathione pills. Im impressed because alot of my office pals and friends noticed my skin and they are all envy of me, lol.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who ordered glutathione from somewhere else but it didnt work on her, maybe its fake.<br>  <br>  So find the right brand for you, be consistent and hope for the best

In the future, make sure to floss multiple times a day and brush your teeth to prevent plaque and bacteria from building up in between your teeth.<br>  a great product that helps with this is brytonpick! its a portable flosser that you can carry with you everywhere! check it out at brytonpick.com|`|r41AlP3Uaa	I dont think brushing will get rid of it.

tMtBe1lKaa	In Oregon, the standard practice is to give the patient Oxygen while being assessed if it is away from the hospital, unless we suspect the patient has COPD. then it is a patient by patient basis. In the emergency room, it depends largely on the case and doctor. In our labor rooms, we have O2 available, but don't give it to every patient. There are machines that check o2 saturation levels constantly, and while I don't put all my faith in the machines, I think that is why we don't go straight to o2 in the labor rooms. Many moms to be hate having a mask or tube and that is true with most everyone. I think the epidurals are a cultural thing. Some come in and expect the entire labor to be pain free as soon as they hit the bed. Others come it and relish in the full childbirth experience- pain and all. I have seen one girl come in and be in labor 34 hours before we could talk her into having an epidural so she could relax a bit. Not an hour after the epidural was given that baby came out. It does seems that birthing centers are basing much of thier practice on customer service and less on actual health of thier patients.<br>  <br>  Many patients have good saturation levels during traumatic emergencies that don't result in blood loss, and may get more traumatized having masks and tanks put on. teach a man to fish, and he will be able to eat. Teach a man to concentrate on his breathing, and he will be less focused on his injured toe. :)|`|UETAqR8Taa	endone is a good pain relief, but dont where to buy it

R9KvEhMxaa	Well, the problem here in California is that the medical marijuana system has essentially become a system to shield drug abusers. For every person with a legitimate use for it, there's hundreds to thousands who are just in the system to get an abusable drug with less legal hassling. <br>  <br>  I do not have a problem with the AIDS patient taking it, or the cancer patient taking it.<br>  <br>  I do have a problem with the twenty year old with vague 'back pain' with no physiological cause who refuses to consider anything else but marijuana, and isn't interested in anything else.<br>  <br>  I have a problem when I see posts by ten year olds on this forum, asking how much to sell some of his parent's massive stockpile of medical marijuana to his middle school friends so he can get lunch money. Because his parents, who are too busy selling the stuff, and who have no medical condition at all, aren't paying the slightest bit of attention to him.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for other states, but in California, this has become a major issue. And as long as systems like this are rife with such exploitation and abuse, it will continue to be ammunition against the issue, derailing the effort to get any research done on the substance, and against any sort of halfway legitimate medical use.|`|mCF4wGjdaa	Hi Kyle,<br>  let's stick to facts shall we?<br>  <br>  Marijuana is a narcotic. That means that it makes changes to your mind. Changes over which you have no control.<br>  <br>  Very specifically, this drug makes you incompetent, insecure and diminishes your perception.<br>  <br>  The "high" is the state in which you can no longer realise what is going on around you and you slip into a fantasy world where everything is "cool" and you just **** up your whole life without ever once noticing it.<br>  <br>  It takes 3 years to clear it out of your system.<br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|7HyUHLvQaa	Karma, your wrong it DOES NOT take 3 years. It is cleared within 25-37 days depending on factors. That is a long time compared to other drugs but is defiently not 3 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  TO answer your question: medical marijuana gets you high? It's grown like regular marijuana and med marijuana is potent, I KNOW.  It is good stuff, and grown properly. It is an amazing pain killer at times.<br>  <br>  <br>  People still find it illegal, and line it up with severe drugs (crack, heroin etc)<br>  <br>  -oNe love|`|sVrkjixAaa	Medical marijuana gets you "high", and it's a fact. Actually, here in California medical marijuana is seen as more potent and valuable than many types of illegal weed. <br>  <br>  The system right now is easy to take advantage of, and I have no problem with countless numbers of people getting undeserved medical marijuana. Marijuana not only can stimulate hunger and relieve pain, it is also the best drug to relieve stress. No anti-depressant on the market is even close to being as healthy as marijuana, alcohol and tobacco are both far worse medically, and even most store-bought medications (over the counter and prescription) have more dangerous side-effects than marijuana.<br>  <br>  Marijuana does not make you incompetent, insecure, or any less intelligent. The only way it messes up your life is if you are caught or it prevents you from getting a job, both negative consequences of a law bred from ignorance.

So, the second thing you mention is actually pretty relevant.<br>  <br>  I really believe that having thoughts about killing yourself is an emergency.  It's not something to be taken lightly.  You need to talk to someone who can help you and quickly.  <br>  <br>  If you had just said you were having some symptoms of depression, I would suggest talking to the school guidance counselor about your classes.  Perhaps they could switch you to a new schedule that wouldn't be so taxing.  <br>  <br>  I do, however, believe you need to talk to a mental health professional as soon as possible.

9alw0BY7aa	.Be truthful.You're bound to break brackets a lot when you're wearing braces,you just have to watch what you eat and be careful.Hey,wanna make yourself feel better?Each time I go to the dentist,they get annoyed because I break 5-6 brackets each time through.I'm trying to be more careful,but I know I'll at least break 2-3.<br>  <br>  Just be careful,try not to break any more.<br>  <br>  P.S What colour r they? just curious ^^<br>  just make an appointment and they will see to it|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Mine were much weirder because the whole thing came off the day I got my braces.

8tWub9HMaa	one of the best vitamins for energy is vitamin b12. i would suggest getting b12 complex pills an taking them daily. granted, its not an INSTANT noticable difference. it will take a few weeks to get in your system. but once it does you will notice a difference. you will wake up less tired, and be more energized throughout the day, and it will not keep you awake at night! make sure its b12 complex and that it has every type of b vitamin in it. you need them all! this helped me ALOT when i was sick and depressed for 5 months and i had absolutely no energy in me. the only thing is, youd need to take this pill on its own to be fully affective. so if you take other pills or not, take this one seperatly from them and dont eat until about 30 minutes to an hour after taking it. this way your body digests it faster and you get the effects faster. be sure to take it in the morning. also one more thing. might seem weird but once you start taking this, your pee might turn orangish yellow. so dont be afraid, its just the b12 that makes it that color. also drink lots of water in general if you dont already. and have you gotten yourself tested for anemia? you might have low iron and that can make people EXTREMELY tired all the time. maybe you should go get a blood test? anywho, whatever you decide i hope everything goes ok! bye|`|MzZwQS3zaa	there is this thing called vitamin c drink all like to drink it and eat well first in morning eat :milk and egg and bread and go do sport in the park run there like 20 times then go back home at luanch time drink mango juice and eat fish or meat or chiken and go  look at tv and eat 1 peice of candy then go shopping  and go back home and eat meatloaf and go drink hot milk and to the BED<br>  "THANK YOU"|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Super Nutrition Vitamins,  ECGC Extract and Caffeine stack<br>  <br>  I wrote about it on my website, check out my homemade fat supplement on my blog<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42</a>|`|tMtBe1lKaa	Don't go for the energy snacks and drinks, they are basically sugar and if you drink them to get energy to excerxise, you are probably going to take in more calories than you will work off.<br>  <br>  What has been proven to work is water. 8 cups a day. This hydrates you and gives you more energy. Also, a multivitamin will help. make sure it has iron, folic acid, vitamin b-6 and b-12. These are some of the hardest minerals and vitamins for women to get in diet, and keep in their bodies, but they are also the most important in terms of energy. You want the package to say USP on the outside. that means that what they say is in it, really is. Many supplements might as well be dust. <br>  <br>  Snack on almonds if you can. there's a power punch of good for you stuff. Granola and raisins are high in those vitamins and helps me feel more energetic. <br>  <br>  Most adults need 8 hours of sleep. kids and teens need up to 14. Make sure the room is dark, or you may not sleep as well.<br>  <br>  And start your workouts slow. even walking is a good place to start. breathing has alot to do with it also. Before you begin, breath in to the count of 10, and out to the count of 10. try to do this a couple times a day, or when you're feeling tired.<br>  <br>  good luck. drink water!|`|EQAwlKZ5aa	The best way to improve your metabolism and feel energized is to eat little and often. Instead of eating three big meals, eat 6 small meals that are high in protein. Each meal should be about the size of your fist. You can also eat nuts which are really good for you. Eat a handful every day. Trust me eating little and often is the way many athletes eat. It will definitely give you more energy. Also, if you wake up very early, like at 5 am and have a small meal, then go back to sleep for an hour, you will be able to work out when you first wake up. This will boost your energy for sure. <br>  Hope this helped!|`|g29VfDGvaa	Bee Pollen, Acai Berry and B Vitamin Complex. <br>  <br>  Lots n lots of water too.|`|3MnmLIIHaa	nigella(oil of black species) is only way.|`|wC0S3xOuaa	I was wondering about the same thing.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  Go to the Doctor and get your Blood checked for Diabetes.

(Though, most people losing weight do have occasional stalls for no reason -- the key is to be more stubborn than your body!) <br>  <br>  As a side note, be careful that your calories aren't too low; 1200 calories is the recommended minimum daily intake to ensure that you're getting all your nutrients, and with all the exercise you're doing, your body may require even more than that. Keep an eye on your energy levels and don't be afraid to slow down a bit. Slow and steady is what wins the weight loss battle.

It depends on whether or not your hymen has already been broken through normal activities.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't hurt after the first couple of times.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you bleed also depends on whether or not your hymen is intact.

AA11999819	The different Medicare "parts" refer to the US Code that established them<br>  <br>  Part A - inpatient Hospital insurance.  Free to those who have paid via payroll deductions for 40 quarters.  Requires payment of deductible once per benefit period (period restarts after 60 days out of the hospital)<br>  Part B - Medical insurance (for doctor bills, medical supplies, outpatient facility charges, independent labs, etc.).  Costs about $88/month, can be deducted from your SS check quarterly.  There is a deductible, then coinsurance, usually 20%.<br>  Part C - Medicare replacement plan (also known as Medicare HMO or PPO).  The Medicare premiums you pay are given to an HMO, which assumes risk for your care.  You have to see docs only in your plan, choose a Primary Care provider and get referrals for specialty care, but there are usually no deductibles and you pay only a small copay for each visit/service.<br>  Part D - Drug coverage.  Plans vary, but most have high out of pocket expenses before coverage kicks in.

AA11103615	The Bates Method for Improving Eyesight is a method discovered at the beginning of this century by Dr. W. H. Bates, M.D. (1865-1931), a prominent American ophthalmologist, and developed by him and his followers to improve sight and restore natural habits of seeing, which have been lost through strain, tension and the resulting misuse of the eyes. Thus the aim of the method is to teach people with problems of vision the faculty of easy and attentive seeing whereby the eyes and mind work together harmoniously to give good sight.<br>  Since the Bates Method is a means to improve sight and restore the natural use of the eyes by re-learning the art and skill of seeing, it is not, therefore a medical treatment, but a method of re-education, in the form of both active learning, such as learning a skill like drawing and painting or how to play tennis, and also the receptive awareness of how to appreciate what we see, such as the appreciation of a painting, a beautiful garden or a cathedral.<br>  <br>  The practical benefits of the Bates Method are imparted by means of a pupil-teacher relationship wherein the pupil is shown, first, relaxation of the eyes, then the body, and then the body and eyes, whilst seeing. As the relaxation progresses, the mind, the eyes and the body begin to focus together more harmoniously, allowing the sight to improve naturally, by itself, as does the health of the eyes, whilst already good sight can be preserved.<br>  <br>  According to Dr. Bates researches, the focusing of the eye is accomplished by the action of the extrinsic muscles surrounding it. These muscles are comparatively finely balanced and are easily disturbed by conditions of nervous stress and emotional pressure so that errors of refraction are produced. However, the muscles of the eyes are not amenable to direct physical re-training since, according to Kinesiological research made in the U.S.A., stressed or fatigued muscles are made weaker by exercise. It is therefore not part of the Bates Method to 'strengthen' eye muscles by exercising them, despite recommendations given in popular books and articles on the subject. Relaxation will always precede exercise.<br>  <br>  Since in most cases of faulty sight interest in seeing has been replaced by straining, trying to see, or boredom, self-criticism, etc., the first step in improving the sight is to stimulate interest by suggesting the pupil replaces the attitude of trying to see by that of looking for something, for example different colours, trees, birds, flowers - whatever is suitable and is accessible to the particular state of sight without glasses or lenses. From this point, the pupil is beginning to learn how to do without glasses, wholly or partly, depending on need, since it is axiomatic that the sight cannot improve whilst glasses are worn.<br>  <br>  The circulation through the eyes is stimulated by encouraging blinking, and splashing the closed eyes with water, morning and evening. The eyes are also nourished and relaxed by the use of light, letting the head swing with closed eyes facing the sun or a lamp. Needless to say that the sun is never looked at directly. The eyes are always rested by palming after taking the light.<br>  <br>  The sight is further helped by learning relaxation in movement through the use of various types of swinging movements, which also help to re-establish the natural vibratory movements of the eyes as well as expand the awareness of the visual field. First, the pupil stands with feet apart and rhythmically swings from side to side, allowing the relaxation to deepen. Next, the pupil turns the body right and left, letting the whole body, including the eyes move as one. Awareness of movement in the visual field is a sign that the swinging is being well done. A simpler but more versatile way is to swing the head and neck only. This is very helpful in releasing tensions in the neck, which are often associated with poor sight. Further observation of the pupil often reveals poor co-ordination in movement, of hand and eye, of both eyes together. These difficulties respond to deepening relaxation and the development of attention and awareness, and are further helped by providing a focus for the mind with such activities as juggling, drawing, dancing, ball games, etc. As the pupil progresses, more specific approaches can be shown according to need, through working with charts, reading practices, techniques to encourage centralisation of sight, such as counting, looking for, comparing, edging, tracing. But it must be emphasised that no good will come from trying to see, the all too common reaction of the pupil when being presented with the challenge of identification of letters or reading. It is always necessary to avoid useless struggle and to do the best one can, accepting whatever is seen, no matter whether it is clear or blurred.<br>  <br>  Thus, through the practice of relaxation, movement and focusing of attention under the direction of interest and awareness, the pupil's sight can be restored to it's natural and normal state, although the time needed is very variable. Much depends on the understanding and quality of energy of the teacher, as well as the patience, persistence and interest on the part of the pupil.|`|c522c9e22cb6b036d13b1e0b1171fd9daa	haha!|`|c8587336ebb02a0325e4d26384d2e2dbaa	No but this website has a vision supplement that i use and it works great for your vision...

fYEp45mAaa	Tricky...the thing about getting a root canal is that once the nerve is removed and the tooth is filled, the tooth becomes weak since it is no longer vital (.."living") it's like a shell so it may be susceptible to cracking, plus you may more than likely need a crown too (not always necessary but usually the way the Dentists like to go) which then costs you more money. <br>  <br>  As for getting a filling, it's faster, and cheaper and can be removed and replaced but it gets costly (as you are experiencing).  <br>  <br>  You could always get it pulled, however, it leaves a space plus the adjacent teeth may start to shift into it's place creating smallish gaps between your other teeth, and the bone that was surrounding that tooth will start to resorb (go away) since it no longer has anything to hold on to.<br>  <br>  Your Dentist or the office's treatment coordinator should be sitting down with you to tell you the pro's and con's of getting another filling or getting the root canal so that you can make an informed decision.  That's why you pay them the big $$$$.|`|90eM5tMaaa	root canal or pull it out|`|ReB7knjcaa	Go with a Cavity repair cause those Damn root canals are a persons WORST NIGHTMARE!!!

dcWN4v6Jaa	Braces are about 5 grand. If you need headgear its 10 grand. My friend has headgear so she told me. I'm not sure how long you would have them but, you should ask your orthodontist. No there aren't any alternatives for braces if your have crooked teeth. Here is some info.<br>  <br>  <br>  Getting your braces put on doesn't hurt at all. Its after 4-6 hours it gets sore so take Advil right after so it doesn't hurt. Eat soft foods for a week or so such as yogurt,smoothies,ice cream,jello,and others. Here is some information about braces. Also tightening means they take out the old wire and replace it with a thicker and shorter wire. That doesn't hurt. If it does just tak a painkiller. <br>  <br>  <br>  WEBSITES<br>  1. <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf..." rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...</a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.bracesinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bracesinfo.com/</a><br>  3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...</a><br>  4. <a href="http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br..." rel="nofollow">http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...</a><br>  5. <a href="http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...</a><br>  <br>  PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES<br>  1.

Cost about 5 grand, but depends on your teeth. But trust me ITS WORTH IT! The metal and bars for a few years is a small price to pay for a beautiful perfect smile for the rest of your life. I would say do everything you can to try and get them, and keep them on as long as the orthodontist says to (don't take them off early!). Don't worry about looking attractive in high school, when you can have a beautiful smile in your adult life where it really counts. I love braces, they gave me what I thought I would never have, so Id say get them on asap, because the sooner the better! Good Luck!|`|BJ0kC81saa	Metal ones are approximately $5,000.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and also in High school. I got ceramic braces on today. People from 5 meters away couldn't see them.

It all depends on your teeth.

Also, numbness can actually be a part of an anxiety attack you were having whilst sleeping. I know, I've had that more times then I would like to remember.

iS8UxcJsaa	Causes<br>  Though most cases of dry skin are caused by environmental exposures, certain diseases also can significantly alter the function and appearance of your skin. Potential causes of dry skin include: <br>  <br>  Weather. In general, your skin is driest in winter, when temperatures and humidity levels plummet. Winter conditions also tend to make many existing skin conditions worse. But the reverse may be true if you live in desert regions, where temperatures can soar but humidity levels remain low. <br>  Central heating and air conditioning. Central air and heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity and dry your skin. <br>  Hot baths and showers. Frequent showering or bathing, especially if you like the water hot and your baths long, breaks down the lipid barriers in your skin. So does frequent swimming, particularly in heavily chlorinated pools. <br>  Harsh soaps and detergents. Many popular soaps and detergents strip lipids and water from your skin. Deodorant and antibacterial soaps are usually the most damaging, as are many shampoos, which dry out your scalp. <br>  Sun exposure. Like all types of heat, the sun dries your skin. Yet damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetrates far beyond the top layer of skin (epidermis). The most significant damage occurs deep in the dermis, where collagen and elastin fibers break down much more quickly than they should, leading to deep wrinkles and loose, sagging skin (solar elastosis). Sun-damaged skin may have the appearance of dry skin. <br>  Psoriasis. This skin condition is marked by a rapid buildup of rough, dry, dead skin cells that form thick scales. <br>  Thyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism, a condition that occurs when your thyroid produces too little thyroid hormones, reduces the activity of your sweat and oil glands, leading to rough, dry skin|`|TuGkVqwraa	Just because of Hot sun.|`|LCbveXvXaa	Dehydration.

Imagine having a toy built in that you can play with like that all day. Sounds like you have too much time on your hands.  I am concerned about your peeing so often. You should be able to go much longer than that without peeing if you have any bladder at all.  Do this.  For one day, write down what time you peed and how much you peed.  Measure it.  Then measure the water  and all other fluids you drink. You cannot put it out if you don't take it in.  You may be drinking more than you think you think you are or may be going longer between voiding  than you think you are.  This is probably the case. If you are actually peeing every 15-30 minutes, take all this information to your doctor.      You are right, it is a sign of diabetes.  If you know anyone who has a meter, you can check your own blood sugar.  Do not eat or drink after midnight or for 8 hours before testing.  Of course if iyour sugar is too high, you MUST see a Doctor for further testing.  As for the playing, I dunno.|`|pSNKzohZaa	Yeah I would say forcing urine back into your body wouldn't be to healthy.

Some people are even asymptomatic, they can test positive for the virus but never have any symptoms. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Most individuals have no or only minimal signs or symptoms from HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. "<br>  <br>  Herpes simplex virus can cause symptoms on the mouth (oral herpes) or genitals (genital herpes). <br>  <br>  About 50 to 80 percent of American adults have oral herpes, which is commonly called cold sores or fever blisters. <br>  <br>  About one in five adults in the United States has genital herpes. However, most people don’t know they are infected because their symptoms are too mild to notice or mistaken for another condition.<br>  <br>  Herpes is most easily spread from genital-to-genital or oral-to-genital contact during an active outbreak or during prodrome -- the few days just before an outbreak. <br>  <br>  Oral and genital herpes can be uncomfortable, but they are generally not dangerous infections in healthy adults.<br>  <br>  Herpes does not affect the immune system. It is rare for adults to have any health problems from genital herpes.<br>  <br>  However, having genital herpes makes it easier to acquire and/or transmit HIV, a virus that can cause AIDS. <br>  <br>  There are several days throughout the year when herpes can be spread even when no symptoms are present (called asymptomatic reactivation or asymptomatic shedding). <br>  <br>  The surest way to prevent the spread of genital herpes is to avoid sexual contact during an active outbreak and to use condoms for sexual contact between outbreaks. Suppressive (daily) antiviral therapy with valacyclovir has also been proven to reduce the risk of transmission to a partner. <br>  <br>  Most couples decide together how to reduce the risk.|`|dtzlrB9Faa	Herpes can lay dormant for years or possibly a lifetime. I know people that only know through testing that they carry the virus.  The test for herpes is NOT given in routine std screens so even if your boyfriend was tested for std's before he many not have been tested for herpes.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	Herpes is one of those wonderful things that does lay dormant.

AE3lv4pRaa	The basic principle of weight gain is simple: You need to consume more calories than you expend. Follow these 10 tips.<br>  <br>  1. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  2. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, fish and meat over bread. Choose eggs over vegetables.<br>  <br>  Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  <br>        One hour spinning = perfect body <br>  <br>  3. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  4. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  <br>        16 healthy Ayurvedic mantras <br>  <br>  5. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  6. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  <br>        Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  7. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  8. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  <br>        Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  9. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  10. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|PyQhb7gCaa	eat and sleepppp ..|`|Oe7SOJyDaa	At GNC there is a product called Muscle Milk, it is not going to make you in to SheMan or anything but it will def help pack on the pounds.

XL3gqhVxaa	Definitely mental pain, no question. With physical pain, it's a lot easier to determine a cause and take medicine or have some other treatment to fix it. Mental pain is much more frustrating and complex and can take months or even years to figure out some kind of diagnosis, not to mention treating it is extremely difficult, if not impossible in some cases. (And don't even get me started on the philosophical argument of why the mind is more important than the body...)|`|el8yX5q3aa	WOW...that is hard to say.

Refined foods like white flour, sugar and products made with them, tea, coffee, and soft drinks deplete energy, bring about wrinkles, unattractive skin and premature aging.<br>  <br>  Lack of healthy blood. Healthy blood adds a glow to the skin and keeps it well-nourished, moist, and free from dryness and roughness.<br>  <br>  Inadequate cleansing. Very often, our skin looks superficially clean; but they really are not. Dirt and dust particles can hide in the pores of the skin and clog sweat and sebaceous glands. Proper cleansing not only removes all the dust, dirt and make-up, which accumulate during the day, but also stops the oil-secreting sebaceous glands from getting clogged.<br>  <br>  Diet<br>  Diet plays an important role in maintaining the health of the skin. Diet should supply all the nutrients needed to build health, namely, protein, carbohydrates, fats, essential fatty acids and all the essential vitamins and minerals. Such a diet will consist of liberal quantities of seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, supplemented by special protective foods like milk, vegetable oils, yogurt, honey and yeast.<br>  <br>  Nutrients play an important role in maintaining a healthy skin.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  Your skin is unusually dry and rough. You have blackheads and whiteheads. You are probably lacking sufficient vitamin A. You could also be suffering from the deficiencies in iron, iodine and the B Vitamins. Adequate amounts of protein and vitamin C are also important.<br>  <br>  The vitamins of the B group are important in producing beautiful skin.<br>  <br>  Vitamin B1 aids skin health by helping to keep the circulation normal.<br>  <br>  Vitamin B2 or riboflavin deficiency can lead to brown pigmentation, or liver spots on the skin. These ugly spots usually disappear if generous amounts of vitamin B2 are given over a period of six months. Severe riboflavin deficiency can lead to oily skin and hair and small deposits of fat under the skin of the cheeks and forehead and behind the ears. More severe deficiency of riboflavin causes the skin under the nose and at the comers of the eyes and mouth to crack and become sore.<br>  <br>  Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine deficiency can result in dermatitis or eczema.<br>  <br>  Niacin deficiency can also cause an eczema type of skin eruption with brown pigmentation, largely on the face, forearms and legs.<br>  <br>  Deficiency of pantothenic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid, and biotin: This also leads to types of eczema. The symptoms will go away completely when these vitamins are generously added to the diet.<br>  <br>  It is clear that Vitamin B plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy skin. So, diet that is rich in Vitamin B can go a long way in skin health. One of the important food in this connection is brewer's yeast. Even the person whose skin seems smooth and healthy usually notices improvement in texture and glow, a week after adding two or more tablespoons of brewer's yeast to the daily diet. Persons with eczema should, for an entire month, take a tablespoon of yeast stirred into citrus juice or water after each meal, between meals, and before retiring. If the diet is adequate in all other respects, the eczema is usually cured in a month 's time. <br>  Anemia and Pale Skin: Anemia results from lack of protein, iodine, calcium, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, cobalt, copper, and iron. Take diet rich in Vitamin B. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are especially important.<br>  <br>  See Also: Diet For Natural Beauty<br>  <br>  Natural Aids for Beautiful Skin<br>  Several natural aids have been found useful in promoting healthy and beautiful skin.<br>  <br>  Lime Juice<br>  <br>  Lime juice is an important natural aid for healthy skin.<br>  <br>  1. Lime Juice Formula<br>  <br>  Squeeze lime into a bowl. Add a glass of boiled whole milk and a teaspoon of glycerin to it. Stir well and let it stay for half an hour. Apply this mixture on the face, hands and feet before going to bed at night. This treatment every night will help you to look young and beautiful. It will also help cure pimples.<br>  <br>  2. For very oily skin<br>  <br>  Squeeze lemon juice in a bowl of iced water. Splash this over the face, massage for five minutes and then wash off with water.<br>  <br>  3. T o improve a dull and greasy complexion<br>  <br>  Mix half teaspoon of lime juice with one teaspoon of cucumber juice and a few drops of rose water. Apply on the face and neck and leave on for 15 minutes. Remove with water.<br>  <br>  4. To improve a dry and rough skin<br>  <br>  Take an egg yolk and mix in a few drops of lime and olive oil. Spread on the face and leave it till the skin feels dry. Wash off with ordinary water and splash on cold water.<br>  <br>  5.

3BMBZtDxaa	It sounds like you may be getting depressed.<br>  <br>  Two ended relationships which you didn't want to end, reaching your 30's, and not enjoying your job. Those are basically what lead people into depressed moods.<br>  <br>  Do you have any vacation time from your job? You may want to take a break. Go on a little vacation to anywhere that relaxes you and just sleep and let it all go. That way you can come back refreshed and ready to face the word.<br>  <br>  Have you ever thought about maybe changing some things? Maybe move around some furniture, going out on some dates, getting a new wardrobe, finding a new job, etc.? I've heard this helps people refresh and it makes them feel like they've started over and left the past in the past. It's worth a shot, right?<br>  <br>  Many woman who are reaching their 30's feel this way. It's okay, you're definitely not alone. The only thing you can do is rebuild your strength mentally and get some change. I would highly encourage you to start dating again and try to find that perfect someone, someone who can make you happy and get you out of this rut! <br>  <br>  Just think about what you want to do and maybe take some of my suggestions into consideration. If worst comes to worst, just head into the doctor. They can diagnose you for having depression, or find another cause. If it is depression they can give you some anti-depressants which should help you out. It's definitely better to catch this early on before it gets worse and the anti-depressants won't be as effective.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck! x|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	You are young at 30...and please do not give up .....life as yet. You have another 40 to 50 years of  living to do. You say you had two relationships which you implied ended outside your control. This does not mean however that this was your doing....perhaps your partners were not your type or perhaps they were just dumb. You may be guilty of picking the wrong partners...not everyone is skilled in the art of picking his/her lifetime partner/s you know. But so what..that is not a crime....no one is perfect...and you are imperfect in this skill. <br>  Before you give up can you do something. Please go to your doctor and have a physical check up...including full blood work. At least you will eliminate any physical problems which may be causing your problems. Are there any other symptoms with the exhaustion..like sleeplessness...irregular menstrual problems...aches and pains..nose bleeds ,no appetite....etc? If so the visit to the doctor is more imperitive|`|7fbab04eeb275afda4e156dada80d0d5aa	I know how you feel.  I'm exhausted myself, I'm working 3 jobs and doing a few more jobs for free.

I suppose you have to wake up each day hoping for the best, and doing the best you can to make that happen.

See www.theroadback.org/Lexapro View the first page in section 2, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  for an effective method. A detailed method, more suited to benzodiazapenes, or Lexapro is shown on page Z.22; then see pages R, V, and, if applicable, young women's depression.

Relying on pills alone to treat those disorders is not a good idea.|`|tbeO3Lataa	I was with my doctor yesterday because I am still in the process of finding my right dosage.

I would say, it is more likely just a temporary effect, I certainly hope it is.|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	i have no idea im about to start on lexapro this week.|`|ruamFLoiaa	Lexapro is an antidepressant.  It is usually prescribed for depressive symptoms.  I could see how taking yourself off of the medication would lead to this side effect.  You probably should take the dose prescribed until you meet with your doctor.  <br>  <br>  Are you seeing a therapist?  Many times, therapy is helpful in symptom reduction.  There have been studies that show that it can, in some not all cases*, be sufficient to help symptoms of anxiety and depression.<br>  <br>  *I say not all cases because there are folks with really severe symptoms who cannot go off of their medication without really bad consequences and I don't want anyone who has bipolar disorder or schizophrenia reading my words and thinking it would be a good idea to go off their meds.          <br>  <br>  It sounds like, however, you might be helped by a therapist's guidance.  I wish you luck and hope you can get in to see your doctor soon.

(your daily need is [your body weight in pounds]x13)<br>  one day a week eat 1000 calories above your daily need. <br>  eat every 2-3 hours. <br>  eat fresh fruits and veggies. <br>  eat protein(meat, fish etc.) <br>  eat less carbs(rice, bread, pasta) <br>  so 70% protein, 10% carb, 20% fat.<br>  <br>  the running and workouts might burn 250-2500 calories a day. <br>  so  in total youll prolly get a 1750 calorie deficit a day. <br>  <br>  you need approx. > 2574 calories a day. <br>  2970 if you do weights. <br>  you should eat 1970 calories a day. 1379 from protein. <br>  if you burn 1000 calories a day(itll go up after the first week, cos of a increase in your RMRand go down after the fourth week, cos of plateus)<br>  youll lose 2 1/2 lbs a week, about 1kg(5 day week, take at least 1 day off)<br>  change your exercise, amt of work, effort, reps, sets, distance, speed,  once every 4 months. <br>  if you dont overeat once a week, youll slow down weight loss after 3-4 weeks. <br>  drink lots of water.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	The caloric need per day.

Losing weight rapidly means gaining it back very easily. What you need to do is change your lifestyle. So instead of thinking of this as a diet, this should be a lifestyle change. The best method for losing weight and staying energized is to eat little and often. Instead of eating three big meals and snacking between meals, you should eat 6 small meals that are high in protein. Each meal should be about the size of your fist, maybe a little bigger. Another thing to remember is to never skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast will slow down your metabolism. Another benefit of eating little and often is that it boosts your metabolism making it easier for you to lose weight. You should also exercise. You should do cardiovascular activity four times a week, and weight training twice a week. Maybe you should start slowly then work up to that. The best type of exercise is resistance training done in a cardiovascular fashion. This way you get the benefits of cardiovascular exercise and you will also help tone your body at the same time. <br>  Don't push yourself too hard. Doing this slowly means keeping the weight off forever. Don't ever cut a whole food group altogether. For example some people think that cutting out fat will help them lose weight. This is wrong, your body needs fat, it's essential for your well being. Just follow this plan for a few months and I guarantee you will feel the difference. Not just in terms of your weight but also your energy levels. <br>  Good luck with everything. Just be patient and stay motivated. I hope this helped!|`|NNp7bhPraa	Is it possible?? Nobody can answer that question because everyone's body is different. I definately do not agree with trying supplements/pills/magic weight loss tea etc.. that stuff is usually HORRIBLE for your body. The best way to achieve that goal is to have somebody make a workout schedule for you and go at it. Find some exercise activities that you enjoy and can stand doing every day for the rest of your life. If you have a good mix of cardio/weight training/healthy eating habits you can accomplish a lot. Don't focus on a time limit of 4 months. It's nice to have goals, but in reality everybody needs to be exercising reguardless of their size. It takes a lot of time to understand how your body works.

Go to the gym, follow a good program for your muscles and start lifting weight... you can use protein ore creatine, so you won't feel so tired the next day... but feeling tired is very normal... When you lift or try to lift more than your muscle can take, some cells crack up... you know what I mean? the next day they're just regenerating and multiplying depending on the effort you made one day earlyer... so... TRAIN! ;)

AA11932760	Quitting smoking is a great opportunity to learn about ourselves.<br>  Congratulate yourself  on having the desire to stop - then you are over the worst, but still need to maintain your resolve. It's just so easy to start thinking that just one won't hurt, but it does. Just one achieves nothing except feeling the need for another. Whatever you do, don't have just one. Beware - alcohol will weaken your resolve.<br>  Here's a few home-brewed tips that might be useful.<br>  It's not just nicotine addiction - there are 50+ chemicals in cigarettes. Also the main problem is habit.<br>  We have been used to having body sensations which we translate as 'my body needs something', which we have attempted to satisfy by having a cigarette.<br>  When we try to stop smoking, we still get these 'my body needs something' sensations, and we still feel that we want a cigarette. We have to train our body to be more selective. When we feel we need something, we have to work out what it is that we actually need.<br>  A glass of water is an excellent substitute if nothing else comes to mind, as it helps with the clearance of the toxic substances in our body. Another good substitute is a bag of salted peanuts, used in combination with the water.<br>  Another thing to do is to find an activity which occupies the mind or body. Go swimming - nobody wants to smoke while they are swimming. Slowly, as our body adjusts and translates the 'want something' feelings into something other than cigarettes, then the feelings begin to go away. We know its not a cigarette that the body really needs, because as soon as we've had one we still have the feeling, and want another!<br>  We will have a few bouts of feeling or even being short tempered. We must try to bite our lip, and control; ourselves. Recognise the short temper as being the removal of toxins which are trying to find a way out. They went in through the mouth, and they try to get out that way to. We must learn to keep our mouth closed, and force the toxins out the other way.<br>  <br>  After we have stopped for a while we will begin to feel that just one wont to any harm.<br>  All that leads to is a desire for just another one. We must guard very strongly against the desire to have just one.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	use a quit-smoking product like gum or patches|`|856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Mindfulness Meditation  by  Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD|`|29f413f2aa411d3f05400de6315579f5aa	Dude newports r horrible!! lol if i smoke them the next day my lungs r in so much pain. how do u do it? ... well if u cant quit definately consider switching to marbs. lol , sorry i culdnt help .|`|2ec21eecc640ea27a1f4dcfc11d28d6baa	Sorry for the bad news but there isn't a way to quit without stress.

c8brcdbxaa	This information comes from the Havard Health Letter (see complete reference below)<br>  <br>  Sneezing and Sunshine<br>  <br>  "For many people, the sun is something to sneeze at. They step outside on a bright day and...achoo!<br>  <br>  It's not just a coincidence. A British physician first described the photic sneeze response in 1875. In the 1960s, a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist surveyed medical students and found that about a quarter of them sneezed in response to sunlight. A 1983 study of 460 Swedish blood donors came up with a similar percentage. It may be an inherited condition; geneticists with a sense of humor have proposed the name autosomal-dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst, or ACHOO, syndrome.<br>  <br>  The sun is the usual culprit, but any sudden bright light can be a trigger: a camera flash, for example, or an ophthalmoscope, the instrument doctors use to see inside your eyes. In most cases, the cause seems to be not the light as such but the transition from darkness to light.<br>  <br>  This is a condition in search of an explanation. One theory is that light hitting the retina in the back of the eye sends a signal coursing through the optic nerve and stimulates vision centers in the brain. But the nervous system is interconnected, so a signal also gets sent to the brain's "sneeze center," located near where the spinal cord enters the brain. Another possibility is that intense light floods neuronal circuits, so nerves in the nose are inadvertently activated, causing nasal congestion and that familiar tickling sensation that leads to a sneeze.<br>  <br>  Like people with seasonal affective disorder, photic sneezers may have nervous systems that are especially sensitive to light. But instead of influencing mood, it triggers nasal secretions or nerves that activate the sneeze center.<br>  <br>  The photic sneeze response is usually nothing more than a temporary nuisance. A couple of sneezes, a friendly gesundheit, and it's over. But there are unconfirmed stories of it causing problems for baseball players catching fly balls. Airplane pilots are sometimes bothered. And if you're driving, you may want to be extra careful coming out of a tunnel; not only are drivers momentarily blinded by the light, but some may close their eyes as they let out a photic sneeze."|`|f3e072bed6df7202666903156393e46caa	The bright lights causes you to squint, which affects your sinuses and thus you sneeze.  Or it could be environmental allergies.  As far as the headaches you may just be sensative to light.  Dehydration and being out on a hot sunny day will give you a headache.  See a doctor if it continues to bother you.|`|bbGiTotHaa	maybe you have alllerrgiiies and you have sensitive eyes...like me

ntPvdl1paa	If you're going to be doing the types of exercises you're referring to in your question and at the frequency you've indicated (5 days a week), together with a close to zero intake of junk food, fat and carbs, then you'll see results fast (within a week - or two - max). Some of this, however, will be water loss and perhaps muscle loss - but there will be some fat loss thrown in there too.   It sounds like you'll be focusing mostly on proteins - which is probably a good choice if you want to get into shape fast.  Only thing I'd recommend is don't go too low on the complex carbohydrates if you're exercising intensely - your body will need some fuel to go on, and proteins can only go so far.   But doing a few weeks or a month of what you've described won't hurt.  You should get results fast.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	Haha, I am 15 and you know what I say, if you are planning on joining the military don't.

LBcRolYiaa	I've found that when you're happy in a relationship, weight tends to sneak on you.  You might start to slack off going to the gym to spend time with your partner and go out to eat more often than usual.  If your partner tells you they like the way you look, then you may feel content with the way you look and stop trying to impress.  Your weight may go up, but your partner's perception of you is still great.  That makes you happy and not so worried about the weight gain.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're in an unhappy relationship, you may start preparing yourself for the next single day.  You could go to the gym, buy new clothes, get a hair cut, all to make yourself feel better about a failing relationship.  This will also make you feel better about returning to the dating market in the end.|`|0rNMm8lLaa	i gain weight when im happy. when my hubby went away for a little while, i lost 10 pounds! i guess it depends on the person tho.|`|11iIIQlYaa	Yes and Yes to the first and second question. Yes because you will become comfortable with you boyfriend/girlfriend and looking good will not be as big of a thing anymore. Also yes because when you are unhappy in a relationship this causes high amounts of stress which is a big cause of weight gain. Stress can be the cause of depression which will lead to pigging out . But as long as your eating correctly and excercising enough, (and yes sex does count as excercise) you should stay in shape. = )|`|2a4e559578a482dc4c8c039f53fe7e81aa	I lose both ways.

ZMfbtGYEaa	Depends on the kind of yoga you do. If you do beginner level classes, the kinds of results you will see will be in flexibility and strength, but not necessarily weight loss. Flexibility and toning come gradually, but I'd say you'd notice changes in a month or two, if you are going 4-5x a week.<br>  <br>  If you do power yoga or vinyassa yoga, you will see more of the toning and weight loss changes, along with flexibility. These types of yoga are more intense and more aerobic, hence the more fat burned. Again, a month or two.|`|O6DbXWGqaa	What kind of results do you want? and what kind of yoga are you doing?
AA12266619	It's not "electricity" in the conventional sense, just electrical disturbances, which mainly occur due to sodium (sometimes, calcium) ions shuffling in and out of the cell membranes. This is known as an action potential. True, there r many things about the human body that the scientists haven't fully understood, but this is not one of them. So, there's no need get worked up like this.<br>  <br>  Then, in some tissues, like the bones and teeth, a negative electric charge develops, which helps in deposition of calcium (a positive ion), which is thanks to "Piezo-electric" effect--electric potential developing because of changing mechanical pressure on the surface of a solid.<br>  <br>  Bye.

NcWZEKUgaa	5 minutes is fine.  Many training programs put more emphasis on physical distance than on time.  For example, if you did 9 miles for your long run one week, then the program may call for 10 miles the next.  Because my speed seems to vary from week to week, I increase in intervals of 10 minutes instead of miles.<br>  <br>  Be sure to pick a week where you scale back to give your body a chance to recover.  Most programs don't recommend increasing distance each week without a break along the way.  For example, increase your long run each week by a mile or 10 minutes, for 3 to 4 weeks in a row.  Then scale back to a shorter distance for your longest run of the week, maybe 50% - 60% the distance of your last long run.  For me, I did 10 miles last week on my long run, and this week is a scale back week for me.  So my runs during the week will be shorter and slower, and my long run on the weekend will only be 5-6 miles.<br>  <br>  If there's a goal or race you're training for, there are many resources on the web you can use.  Try www.runnersworld.com and click on 'TRAINING' for lots of tools.  Also try www.halhigdon.com and look under 'TRAINING PROGRAMS' for all sorts of training programs for different distances and running skill levels.|`|AA10086990	For mileage, I've read 10% per week.  Adding 5 minutes per week should be fine.  Depending on how fast you run, that's probably a bit less than 10% weekly.  With those workouts over an hour, make sure you are properly hydrating and fueling your body.  You should have either a sports drink or water along with some kind of food or gel.

It really moves along quick and gets your heart rate up for a cardio and strength session.  If you have extra time you could spend extra time on a certain body part- calves, triceps- etc.

fc45bdbe3503c05cc9ceaf000ebe81deaa	What you need to do is start now, <br>  <br>  A HUUUUUUUUUGE part is eating healthy. You don't have to give up everything you want, just learn to proportion. Eat small things throughout the day. (healthy, preferably ;P) And weekends can be treat days (EAT SOME COOKIES!)<br>  <br>  If you can't afford a gym or there's no free sources around you- you can run and stuff. Running is a good weight loss, but not much toning. For toning, you'll have to do individual exercises. (Crunches, push ups, etc. When doing crunches, keep your legs in the air, knees bent. OR, you can keep your legs down, knees bent, one leg up so that leg's foot is on the opposing leg's knee and put your hands behind your head, then you reach left elbow to right knee, right elbow to left knee. (you don't actually touch, tho.) the last one works on your abs AND obliques).<br>  <br>  It's really about motivation. The first two weeks or so are going to suck because you're changing your lifestyle. This is the period you'll need to be the most serious about your diet/exercise. If you break in that period, dieting will be that much harder. Also, the first two weeks or so is when you'll lose water weight. If you can stick it after that, you'll be losing body fat.<br>  <br>  I'm 5'7 and 133, I've gain much muscle lately due to strength training. Remember gaining muscle will make you gain weight. Once you gained muscle you'll look much better than have looseness when just losing weight without gaining muscle.|`|bbGiTotHaa	maybe for about a half hour daily?  if you arent eating fatty foods then 30 minutes or less is really all you need|`|11d3c13fafe745b46ec870217f806f59aa	i agree with what the other answers are, except you MUST eat small  meals through out the day. every 2-3 hours have a meal of about 200-300 calories for a total of about 1200-1400 calories a day. do not go more than 3 hours between eating, it will significantly slow your metabolism down. and ALWAYS eat a carb and a protein together when you eat. this keeps your blood sugar the most stable, therefore keeping your metabolism running on high gear. you say you're a vegetarian, make sure you get protein from another source. you have to have it to build those precious muscles! that's what burns your fat 24/7 is the muscle!|`|2cb76365cfdb454a1489f9fc0962b97baa	Four words, eat right; exercise more. Its that easy. If you're going to run everyday, start out slow easy, don't overdo it and stretch before you run. Build up your strength  and endurance to run more. Eat two regular meals a day(breakfast and dinner) and just fruit for lunch, which supplies the right amount of vitamins and energy to get you through the day until dinner. Most likely when people get hunger pangs, it's not really hunger at all, but rather stored (potential) energy wanting to be used up. If you eat when you're not really hungry, you'll get lethargic after wards and not want to exercise at all. Just remember that not all hunger pangs are telling you to get up and use your potential energy. Monitor yourself for a few days and get to know the way your body reacts and stick to those eating habits. You'll start feeling better and lose the weight you want to.

08SHo8RGaa	Ive always felt safe when my partner, whoever she may be, is on the pill and we use a condon combo, especially if you've only just met. Ten years of multiple partners and no babies, woohoo!|`|22e9590ce9511b278391b2984231e0e6aa	Personally, I've had really good luck with the NuvaRing. It's nice that unlike the pill, you don't have to remember to take it every day: you just put it in for 3 weeks, and take it out the week you get your period. I'd recommend what others have said: the pill/ring/shot and condom combo. That way, you have really good protection against pregnancy (99% for hormonal treatment when used correctly), and protection against STD's from the condoms. That's really really important especially if you may be with multiple partners. As for people saying condoms only, I'd have to disagree. I've broken condoms before, as has pretty much everyone I know who has had sex. I think the clincher for me was having to go to CVS and buy a pregnancy test for my friend. Even though it wasn't even me who might have been pregnant, I was petrified. I'd say talk to your gyno about the different options. In terms of hormonal options (the pill, the ring, the shot), they each have ups and downs.<br>  <br>  The pill, for instance, needs to be taken at the same time every day to remain effective. The pill has been in use the longest of the methods, and has a good track record. Some people experience more side effects (pms-like symptoms, etc) at the beginning, do to the fact that the hormones are circulated through your bloodstream.<br>  <br>  The ring has the advantage of being a monthly thing. However, some people say it makes them uncomfortable to put it directly in their vagina. [It is similar to an ob tampon.] It also dispurses most of the hormones directly to your reproductive organs, less in your bloodstream, and therefore causes fewer and milder side effecs.<br>  <br>  The shot is usually only every 3 months, which is nice. It has similar symptoms as the pill, and some people report some tenderness at the injection site. This one's probably not for you if you're not into shots.<br>  <br>  All hormonal options have the advantage of making your periods lighter, more regular, and less crampy. A few months in you may even notice your skin clearing up if you have acne. One downside is that the hormones can make you want to eat more, which can cause weight gain. However, if you monitor your food intake, you should be fine. <br>  <br>  Condoms are the best way to prevent STD's short of abstinence, but as birth control they can expire, break, or degrade do to use of oil based lubricants. Personally, I don't like to leave the fate of me having a baby in the hands of whoever I'm sleeping with. <br>  <br>  Abstinence is all well and good, and I'm sure you'll hear it again and again, but I believe that if you're mature enough to make plans ahead of time (birth control), there's no reason you should enjoy safe sex.|`|79428e8783564e94408813d9dc891931aa	all i can say is read all the side effects.. i thought i had read on up on the ring.. 2 weeks into i had this awful hormonal surge that i took out on everyone around me..<br>  <br>   i checked into it some more.. dug deeper and found out that.. LOTS of women were having they same problems.. some even having thoughts of suicde...<br>  <br>   thats something that isnt wrote on the package.. and your doc dont warn you about..|`|e0hKtVXMaa	hmm, how about abstinence, but condoms work fine|`|5f68d77ce3bf8be720bd05c8a3650d9caa	I would use birth control pills. I take Mircette, but of course you may find another kind you like better. It's just a really good backup to condoms (or no condoms) and other methods. You should probably be on the pill, if you choose that option, at least 2 months before you have intercourse to ensure it's in your system. You don't have to wait that long, but its more reliable. Remember nothing is 100% safe.|`|YAyy380haa	I use the depo shot....I like it because you don't have periods......and u can stop at any time u like......I have never had any problem with it...all u do is go in once every 3 months and get a shot in u'r arm or hip (I recommend the hip, doesn't hurt as much).  and of course the dreadful yearly pap....That's what I recommend...good luck|`|n8fbtelFaa	ABSTINENCE|`|sL11VQ2Kaa	In your case the best birth control device comes free;  it's your face!|`|vvPL4f4Faa	As a healthcare provider this question is not as clear cut as it seems. It depends on your health history, your lifestyle, ect. And truthfully, there is not an abundance of options. Read about all of them and you can make a more informed decision. Additionally, each option could have an individual effect for you. What the pill does to one person may not be your experience at all (which is sometimes the problem with asking other people's advice) And you may need to try several options before you find one that best works for you. Not a real clear cut answer is it? Unfortunately, that's most of medical science...it's alot more gray than black and white.|`|54c94e598a6ae497084c240208a1a43faa	just use condoms..they are safe and you won't have side effects from dumping chemicals in your system..don't buy the cheap brand ..as they break more often...

999014eccfc3d9bf7577e0bd097de6d1aa	Well, I'd say start with 30 minutes...then move up to 45..or as long as you can stand. No more than an hour though, I'd say watch tv or listen to music while on the treadmill so it wont seem as long. Good Luck|`|vYxw4X8Paa	I used to have an Alpine ski machine and it was recommended to go 20 minutes three time a week, and it was so easy that I sometimes would go for an hour, if I had the time.  The secret is to increase your "resting" heart rate.  When you do that, the rest of the benefits will fall into place.  Good luck!  You can do it.|`|djiG8OzCaa	There's more to it than how long you stay on it. You need to increase your speed as you increase your time. Start out at 3.7 for 30 minutes a day for a few weeks, then move up to 4.0 for 45 minutes, and keep going from there until you are at a slow jog. Walking will not reshape your body unless you walk like 40 miles a week at a fast pace. Jogging is more likely to keep you in shape and build muscle. Take it slow and don't get discouraged.|`|U4CLmiJWaa	Start out by running 10-15 minutes because you are just starting to workout, and gradually increase your time as you improve. After a couple weeks you could be doing like 30-40 minutes. AS for ways to lsoe stoamch fat, Sit-ups, but also running will help you lose fat.  Good Luck!

UtULKA43aa	400 crunches is a lot. No it isn't what am i saying thats how much i do! lol. its good to do anywhere from 100-400. So , you dont necissarily have to do 400. And DO NOT do them every day. This slows down the process. By doing crunches, you're ripping your muscles and if you rip them too many times, you wont see results. Do them every 2-3 days to give them time to heal first. You will get faster results. I can't tell you excactly how long it will take, it depends on how mcuh your exercising and what your eating. By burning fat, this speeds up the process because it makes the abs more visable. Hope this helped :D|`|YzQJMHaXaa	You can't just do crunches and expect to see results, when you do crunches your only exercising one muscle group in the stomach area when there are tons of other muscles you need to exercise to  see results as well. And by doing stomach crunches, you might strenghen one muscle in the abdomien area, but you'll never be able to see it if you have layers of fat covering it.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	thats pretty good.  Now that school is in session and I don't have much time that is how many I do 3 times a week.  Back when I was at summer break I got up to 2000 straight.  That was only after I increased them week by week though.  But yes if you diet right and think smart that is excellent.

As for putting on weight and getting hips, you can see that happen in your mid-20s|`|kXLmkuNYaa	Statistically they say girls stop growing at the age of 18 but I think this depends on whether you have gotten your period already or not.

vbyTGAVWaa	The online body fat calculators are completely useless, so I would just disregard that result. The best way to check your body fat percentage would be with body fat callipers. You can purchase Accu-meausure body fat callipers on ebay. I find these to be much more accurate than the body fat scales as well.|`|WOJzCzMgaa	I'd use a mirror!

The most accurate way is when they do a test that requires you to be completely submerged in water and they take measurements about your body density and plug it into an equation.  These tests cost around $500 or more.  The next best test is the 7 point body fat measurements done with high quality calipers.  This test isn't very accurate due to the fact that a person has to take the measurements and readings.  The electronic measurements vary so much due to your body's hydration level.  If you're dehydrated you will seem fatter.  It measures by sending electricity through your body.  It measures how fast the pulse goes through your body since water conducts better than fat.  The purpose of measuring body fat isn't so much an accurate percentage, but it gives you a reference point on where you are relative to yourself.  I use an electronic measurement and i'm in the 21% range, and I monitor it for changes +/- 4%.  I dont care whether it's 21 or 35%, it's how I look and feel.
vA6sKKkTaa	Absolutely not dear. You look skinny.

VJwjkxBJaa	Amber, I have calculated your Body Mass Index (BMI) according to the information you have provided.  Your BMI is 13.9.  A healthy BMI for a person of your height and age is somewhere between 17 and 23.  Your BMI puts you in the 12th percentile of persons of your age and height.  This means that 88 percent of people your age and height have a higher BMI than you do (basically that means you are thinner than about 88 percent of them).  <br>  <br>  Also, the "ideal" weight for your age, height and gender is somewhere around 94 pounds.  Take that information and do what you want with it.  My suggestion to you would be to try and simply live a healthy lifestyle - don't try to make your body as thin as possible.  That can be very unhealthy and lead to dangerous habits.  Being too thin can be just as bad for your health as being too heavy can be.  From what you have said, I think you are probably as thin as you should be and you would still be very healthy if you even gained 5 - 10 pounds.<br>  <br>  Be very careful when you are losing weight when you are already below your ideal BMI.  Don't ever feel guilty because you ate 100 more calories than you planned for that day, and be aware of eating disorders - I hope you have learned about them.  I had a cousin who developed an eating disorder as a teenager (she wanted to be super thin) and her body eventually stopped digesting food and she died as a result.    <br>  <br>  If you are interested in learning more, just search for Body Mass Index in any search engine.|`|bbGiTotHaa	what the **** is your problem STUPID?!?

If you're working out alot, you might gain some, but that's only because muscle weighs more than fat.  Focus more on inches. 1600 calories is not all that much unless you're obese and wanting to lose a whole lot.  Another thing, don't eat 3 big meals a day.  It's better to eat 6 small meals at closer intervals.  That way, your body doesn't get hungry and shift into starvation mode, which will cause it to store the fat.|`|rpxl1N6vaa	Wow im in 7th grade and i weigh more....

798bfe510cff8f33375d0d611719cba1aa	If we offered you a miracle remedy that cures "Hair Loss/Baldness" would you buy it? Certainly you would.  You won’t find it in a Pharmacy but at the Grocery Store.<br>  <br>  Try the Natural Cures for Hair Loss/Baldness.<br>  <br>  Loss of hair at a very tender age has become a common disorder these days. It causes a great deal of concern to persons affected by loss of hair, especially Indian women who regard good hair growth with thick long hair as a sign of beauty.  Hair is formed in minute pockets in the skin, called follicles.  An up growth at the base of the folic, called the papilla, actually produces hair; when a special group of cells turn amino acids into keratin, a type of protein of which hair is made.  The rate of production of these proteins " building blocks," determines hair growth.  The average growth rate is about 1.2 cm per month, growing faster on women between the ages 15 and 30.<br>  <br>  Causes:  The most important cause of loss of hair is inadequate nutrition.  Even a partial lack of almost any nutrient may cause hair to fall.  Persons lacking vitamin B6 lose their hair and those deficient in folic acid often become completely bald.  But the hair grows normally after the liberal intake of these vitamins.  Another important cause of falling of hair is stress such as worry, anxiety, and sudden shock.  Stress leads to a severe tension in the skin of the scalp.  This adversely affects the supply of essential nutrition required for the healthy growth of the hair.  General debility, syphilis, chronic cold, influenza, and anemia, also gives rise to this disorder.  It makes the roots of the hair weak, resulting in the falling of hair.  Unclean condition of the scalp can also cause loss of hair.  It weakens the hair roots by blocking the pores with the collected dirt.  Heredity is another predisposing factor which may cause hair to fall.<br>  <br>  Treatment:  The healthy condition of the hair depends, to a very large extent, on the intake of sufficient amounts of essential nutrients in the daily diet.  Hair is made of protein and adequate protein is necessary for luxuriant hair.  Women require 60 grams, men 80 to 90, adolescent boys and girls 80 to 100 grams of protein.  It is supplied by milk, buttermilk, yogurt, soyabean, eggs, cheese, meat, and fish.  A lack of vitamin A may cause the hair to be coarse and ugly.  A deficiency of some of the B vitamins, of iron, copper, and iodine may cause hair disorders like falling of hair and premature greying.<br>  <br>  Lack of inositol causes loss of hair.  Any person having trouble with his or her hair should eat foods rich in inositol such as yeast, liver, and molasses.  Research has, however, shown that women have a low requirement of inositol. Although this vitamin may help to stimulate the growth of a woman’s hair, its lack is probably not a major cause of slow growth.  Women are generally deficient in iodine and vitamin B1, either of which can slow down circulation to the scalp to such an extent that hair may fall out and new hair grow in very slowly.  Women who keep their diets adequate in iodine, the B vitamins and iron have a better growth of hair.  According to Adelle Davis, a world famous nutritionist, "increasing the intake of protein, particularly of liver, wheat germ, and yeast, and supplementing the diet with a teaspoon of inositol daily usually stops a man’s hair from falling, and I have seen three or four persons whose hair became thick after these improvements were made."  Persons with a tendency to lose hair should thus take a well-balanced and correct diet, made up of foods which in combination should supply all the essential nutrients.  It has been found that a diet which contains liberal quantities of (i) seeds, nuts, and grains, (ii) vegetables and (iii) fruits would provide adequate amounts of all the essential nutrients.  Each food group should roughly form the bulk of one of the three principal meals.  These foods should, however, be supplemented with certain special foods such as milk, vegetable oils, honey, wheat germ, yeast, and liver.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies:  Several home remedies have been found useful in the prevention and treatment of the loss of the hair.  The most effective among these remedies is a vigorous rubbing of the scalp with fingers after washing the hair with cold water.  The scalp should be rubbed vigorously till it starts to tingle with the heat.  It will activate the sebaceous glands and energies the circulation of blood in the affected area, making the hair grow healthy.<br>  <br>  Amla oil, prepared by boiling dry pieces of amla in coconut oil, is considered a valuable hair tonic for enriching hair growth.  A mixture of equal quantity of fresh amla juice and lime juice used as a shampoo stimulates hair growth and prevents hair loss.<br>  <br>  Lettuce (salad-ka-patta) is useful in preventing hair loss through deficiencies.  A mixture of lettuce and spinach juice is said to help the growth of hair if it is drunk to the extent of half a litre a day.  The juice of alfalfa (lecerne) in combination with carrot and lettuce juice, taken daily also helps the growth of hair to a remarkable extent.  The combination of these juices is rich in elements which are particularly useful for the growth of hair.  While preparing alfalfa juice, the leaves of the plant only may be used when it can be obtained fresh.<br>  <br>  Daily application of refined coconut oil mixed with limewater and limejuice on the hair, prevents loss of hair and lengthens them.  Application of the juice of green coriander leaves on the head is also considered beneficial.  Amaranth, known as chaulai-ka-saag in the vernacular, is another valuable remedy.  Application of its fresh leaf-juice helps the growth of the hair and keeps them soft.<br>  <br>  Mustard oil, boiled with henna leaves, is useful in healthy growth of hair.  About 250 grams of mustard oil should be boiled in tinned basin.  A little quantity of henna leaves should be gradually put in this oil till about 60 grams of these leaves are thus burnt in the oil.  The oil should then be filtered through a cloth and stored well in a bottle.  A regular massage of the head with this oil will produce abundant hair.<br>  <br>  Another effective home remedy for loss of hair is the application of coconut milk all over the scalp and massaging it into the hair loss.  It will nourish the hair and promote hair growth.  The coconut milk is prepared by grinding the coconut shavings and squeezing it well.  Washing the hair with a paste of cooked black gram dal, (urad dal), and fenugreek (methi) lengthens the hair.  A fine paste made from pigeon pea or red gram (arhar dal ) can also be applied regularly with beneficial results on bald patches.  Regular use of castor oil as hair oil helps the luxuriant growth of the hair.<br>  <br>  Certain home remedies have also been found useful in case of patchy loss of hair.  The seeds of lime and black pepper seeds, ground to get a fine paste, is one of the valuable remedies.  This paste applied on the patches, has mildly irritant action.  This increases blood circulation in the affected area and stimulates hair growth.  The paste should be applied twice a day for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Another useful remedy for patchy loss of hair is the paste of liquorice (mulethi) made by grinding the pieces in milk with a pinch of saffron.

M3XBrAB4aa	One way to solve this without any medication is to try practicing your singing in front of anyone you can. That way, when you perform, you won't be as nervous and will have more confidence.<br>  <br>  However, you might have performance anxiety (like me) and anytime you perform you get insanely nervous. You can talk to your doctor about it and ask him for a pill to take before you sing.<br>  <br>  I personally have pills that I took before I got oral surgery (I was awake, so they wanted me to keep calm), so I know there is medication out there for you.|`|0a242be8841b340143b7c0ac2e594dbfaa	i use to get stage fright myself, you just need to breath and take it slow before you go on stage, in order to get rid of mine, i took a theatre class and did some improv, you'd be surprised at how much confidence it gives you in front of a crowd. you can also take a type of public speaking class. or do a little meditation before going on stage this could help clear your mind and you can even make your self a chant giving yourself confidence. good luck & best wishes!|`|my1fRrfVaa	the more times you do it the better and also surround yourself by positive things if you surround yourself by positive things it'll put you in the right mode for it|`|z5nNcslGaa	Dunno, but why did you post this in Diet & Fitness?

I'm on a medication that I'll probably have to take for the rest of my life - but it's inexpensive and has no side effects.  To answer your first question, it's complicated - it would probably help if you read the article in wikipedia.  Just type in "hypothyroidism" in the search box.  Good luck!|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	A hypoactive thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormone. You treat it by taking prescription replacement thyroid hormones.

6d0ce236c26e437069d6dbfccb6a0592aa	There is a number of good resources available on the Internet. The first stop is to go to KidneySchool at <a href="http://www.kidneyschool.org/splash/toc.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidneyschool.org/splash/toc.s...</a> Each of the 19 modules take about 20 minutes to get through but by the end you'll be up to speed and ready to proceed. From KidneySchool (if you or someone you love is on or about to start dialysis) I hope you'll be interested in the healthier dialysis options available to people who dialyze at home. The site for home dialysis information is <a href="http://www.homedialysis.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.homedialysis.org</a> particularly the discussion boards here <a href="http://forums.homedialysis.org/" rel="nofollow">http://forums.homedialysis.org/</a><br>  <br>  The busiest discussion boards relating to dialysis on the Internet is over at <a href="http://www.ihatedialysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ihatedialysis.com</a> a site that sounds like it could be negative but in fact there you'll find blunt talk about what it means to be on dialysis and how to face the many challenges that come with kidney failure.<br>  <br>  And there are a number of Yahoo groups that focus on dialysis and kidney disease. My favorite group is Dialysis_Support which you can join here: <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dialysis_support/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dia...</a>|`|AA11281967	A kidney dialysis is performed when one is in kidney failure. The person is hooked up to a machine that filters the blood and returns the filtered portion back to the body. This prevents the buildup of poisonous wastes in the body as the kidneys would do if they worked.
6d0ce236c26e437069d6dbfccb6a0592aa	Dialysis does something that is hard to do - it takes some things that are bad for you out of the blood but it leaves other things you need in the blood. So no, sweating or eating only certain foods cannot replace dialysis. If dialysis isn't available then inducing diarrhea is a last resort to create a bridge until you can receive dialysis.<br>  <br>  Obviously inducing diarrhea is not a good strategy unless it was a true emergency, there is no way to tell what has been removed, in what quantity. The two things that build up that can do you the most harm is potassium and fluid. If you can't dialyze due to weather or any kind of emergency than be very careful to control potassium (think fruits, nuts) and fluid.<br>  <br>  Here is what to do if you need dialysis during an emergency <a href="http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/dialysis-during-an-emergency/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/dialysi...</a><br>  <br>  And here is an emergency diet sample menu for those on dialysis <a href="http://www.nwkidney.org/images/website/docs/nutrition/emergencymenus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwkidney.org/images/website/d...</a>|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	No.  There is nothing you can take.  That is the whole point of dialysis.  It removes the toxins from your blood.  There are no alternatives.  <br>  <br>  I hope you're on a transplant list and it happens soon.|`|5f30a11f0d2690faff701f530dc46b82aa	You will have to stay on your dialysis until your doctor tells you otherwise.

A humidifier can help with dry air in your home, which can lead to bloody noses, stuffy noses, chapped lips, and even dry furniture.   Get one that has a very fine mist.

AA11287099	It is quite obvious you are getting misinformation from many of the misinformed girls that posted above me.  WEED IS NOT BAD PEOPLE!  and if haven't smoked it or don't know about, then DO NOT POST HERE!<br>  <br>  Coming from a daily smoker...me, I can try to describe the answers you seek.<br>  <br>  The first thing I am going to say may be the only truth about weed.  Like all drugs, weed affects different people differently.  Each person will react in a different way, especially on the first time.<br>  <br>  Most people on their first time, don't actually get "high".  Some do, some don't.  It took me to my third time smoking before I got high. You may not even notice anything different.  The only prominent symptom getting high for the first time will be "the munchies"  you will WANT to eat snack food like crazy!<br>  <br>  No, you will not throw up your first time.  I have only seen five people every throw up on weed and all were avid smokers. They threw up because they took too large a hit, or they were already intoxicated from alcohol and the high made them "spin" more!  It is possible to throw up if you take too large a hit.  If you know how to or have ever smoked a cigarette before, you already know how to take a hit from a joint, just hold in the smoke a little longer.<br>  <br>  Yes, if you do get high your memory may be lapse a bit.  Sometimes you remember everything and sometimes you don't.  Sometimes you feel in a euphoric dream world and sometimes you become lost in what is going on around you. <br>  <br>  You might say stupid things too.  If you do get really high your entire perspective WILL change and things you understood before you may not be able to comprehend while high.  Like, I wouldn't drive if you are high.   However, stoners are a lot like monkeys when high.  The more you do something high the better you are going to get at it, but still stay away from driving.  Video games and watching movies are my two favorite things to do while high.<br>  <br>  If your mom grew up in the 60's then she probably has smoked weed in her life, so yes she might be able to tell.  If you don't want her to find out, just try to act as normal as possible around her and maybe be a little bit more relaxed and quieter than you normally are.  If she does suspect you have been smoking weed, confront her about it and ask her if she  ever tried it while growing up.  Who knows you might get into a bonding conversation about drugs with your mom.<br>  <br>  You should be able to control yourself just fine, the experience of being high is different for each person.  Have fun your first time!|`|7KYC625daa	I'm a nurse. Please don't start using this drug or any drug for that matter. Weed has a tendency to make a person feel more relaxed and develop the munchies. However the long term effects can be devastating. Your brain cells start to diminish as well as a dependency on the drug. I see a lot of people addicted and have many health problems because of this particular drug. Think about the long term results of using anything like drugs. You are worth the best life has to offer, and this isn't it. Take good care of yourself now before it's too late. Also weed stays in the body for about a year after using it. And people can smell the weed on your clothes. Take care and please follow my advice. Your future is number one and your health, right?|`|31b0fc8067019a543b7d878e6695bd4aaa	DO NOT START SMOKEING  WEED. YES UR MOM OR ANYONE WILL TELL IF UR HIGH.

YOU WILL TURN STUPID BECAUSE IT WILL KILL SO MANY OF UR BRAINCELLS.YOU WONT GO ANYWHERE IN LIFE. YOU JUST WONT HAVE A GOOD FUTURE. IT WILL BE EVEN WORSE IF U GO TO JAIL FOR GETTING CAUGHT WITH IT. SO YEAH.   RESPECT YOURSELF|`|37053f0b6ba8cf3e0265c585652b9ea2aa	obviously your not a nurse because cannabis definately does not stay in your system for a year, it stays in your system for a month, and thats after heavy use. <br>  and mark, if your scared your moms going to find out youve been smoking, you shouldnt be smoking at all|`|4pd8QgiLaa	You won't throw up (never in the 1000 times I smoked did I vomit)<br>  <br>  Your mom will know only if she previously did it (I have several friends w/ ultra-conservative parents who never know when we're high, bc they themselves never did it and have no idea what to look for, if you're really obnoxioius, then might think you're drunk)<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you try it w/ your friends when you know you won't see your parents w/in the next 4 hours.  Go to their house and just chill.|`|5eb3c1865a52008ae2a1455ce56a8446aa	Well you are yourself but weed makes u like tired. and yah you should remember everything. i never threw up when i did it.  yea your mom would DEFINITALY know your high. your eyes would be red and blood shot and the smell of weed is really strong, so if ur gonna do it bring like cologne and minty gum. oh and to the person who said you could die.. Thats not very likely. a little bit will NOT kill you. My friends do it ALL the time. and my friends friend smoked a lot of weed and was high for like 2 days. never died. they do it  alot and they are only 13-15 yrs old. They do a lot of other stuff like ecstasy and acid, shrooms, etc. But nothing extreme like meth. try it if you want to but it can become an addiction if done enough.|`|AA11305862	When I was younger I did try it...I don't anymore though. Everyone reacts differently to taking it. Yes your mom would be able to tell. You really can't control yourself. I mean you do have some control but not enough. Also the THC in weed can stay in your body for a month, 3 months, even a year. It varies.

Even though you probably feel bigger than all your friends, the best thing is to get into some healthy habits.<br>  <br>  Start by getting some good exercise each day.  The best way to start out is to walk, ride a bike, or swim.  Running is good if you can.  Work up to 30-45 minutes, 4-5 times a week, working hard enough that you are breathing heavy.  If you are just starting out, that is enough to get in shape.  And it's free!<br>  <br>  Since you are under 18, you shouldn't focus on losing weight.  But you might want to consider keeping a food diary.  Write down everything you eat, and how much.  People don’t always notice what they put in their tummy until their tummy doesn't fit in their pants.<br>  <br>  You are still growing, so you will still get bigger over the next few years.

bd48356d45ad5fcaa19fb26a6b14a2c1aa	it can help you lose weight but wont do it all for you and certainly isnt that good for you, if losing some pounds of any description and inches is what you want then I would suggest you use a diet that is all natural and is rich in protein and vitamins. This allows your body to get all the things it needs to function correctly and so you don’t feel hungry or tired. By doing this instead of going on one of these current craze diets you will be successful. I used a protein based diet with Herbalife after a friend who had lost weight recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so fairly easily. There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right path to choose, I could tell the difference right away. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. They are fun to work with as well as being serious about helping you lose weight.<br>  I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them, the tips you get and encouragement are excellent (their advice and time is FREE). I am still with them so I stay healthy. The owners will advise you on what to purchase depending on what you want to lose, my sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in less than five months. The website is www.myhealthabc.com, if you want to lose the healthy way and quickly then this is for you. You just leave your details and they call you up, I would suggest that if you aren’t sure or don’t want someone to ring you then go to their main site www.myhealthabcmall.com and you can see all the products and packages. This is what I did before I went to the first site and left my details so they could contact me. You can see with all the products and detail they have that they mean business. Its nice to have contact with real people who care about you losing weight and improving your health instead of someone just trying to sell you something.  I am confident now that I will continue to keep the weight off with the help I have received. I think so long as you are serious about losing weight then these guys will genuinely get you there.|`|bJW2IbFfaa	No--please don't waste your money on these diet pills!

When patient blood is being drawn into the dialysis machine, there will be less blood circulating in the patient, causing a decrease in blood pressure resulting in giddiness. If patients are allowed to walk about with a compact dialysis machine, what happen if patient fainted? Having a compact dialysis machine is not beneficial to patient. And smaller, compact machines having similar functions as the big bulky machines are often more expen$ive.<br>  Since it a compact dialysis machine doesn't benefit the patient and is more expen$ive to produce, it is not economical to produce one. Therefore, I don't think there is a compact dialysis machine available in the market.

Now we can both say we have helped someone live. <br>  Actually another cool thing worth a mention:<br>  when i donated blood (same time i went for the marrow match- ) they called me 2 days later to tell me that the blood had been used already (within like 3 days).One part of the bag was used on a cancer patient who had a brain tumor. He was 29. He bled durring his surgery and he needed it fast. The other was a 55 year old man who had surgery on his back. A spinal fusion. They said that they were so greatful to get my blood type finally-- becuase they  actually had to wait on his surgery untill someone with my specific type donated.

b9d7e1ea8425adc0a8398611a1d49c2caa	I seems to me that you are just jumping into a low carb diet. Have you decided which low carb diet you want to partake in? There are several diets and they are relatively different.<br>  <br>  The diet I have been doing for 4 years, I consumed 20 grams of net carbs per day for 2 weeks. Then I gradually added carbs to slow down my weightloss. Now, I don't count carbs so I stopped going thru the other phases that were required because I love the food on low carb. I will stop my answer there however, I want you to decide which low carb diet to be on and partake of it healthily not crazily.|`|tGYtM9OCaa	Here is the truth about low carb diets.  Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for the brain and the central nervous system.  In addition, it is the only source of fuel for the kidneys and the erythrocytes (red blood cells).  An average person needs about 130 to 150 grams/day to function normally.  In a shortage, the liver will break down protein to make carbs (gluconeogenesis) and ketones (ketogenesis) to fulfill requirements.  Whenever the body breaks down protein for energy, it creates a lot of ammonia in the system which is toxic, so the liver will turn it into uric acid (which can cause gout) before the kidneys flush it out.  Since the kidneys need carbs to function, they are working overtime while short on fuel.  Much of the weight that you lose on the Atkins diet is cannibalized muscle tissue (for the protein) and water (from urine production).  Any fat lost is simply because by cutting out carbs, you are simply cutting calories.  Also, the loss of muscle mass reduces your resting metabolic rate just like any other starvation diet does and makes it harder to burn calories.<br>  <br>       The risks of this diet include overworked kidneys, gout, and hypoglycemia among many others.  I have personally had to give first aid on 5 separate occasions to people who became hypoglycemic because they tried to workout while they were on the Atkins diet.  If you want to lose weight the healthy way, try a balanced diet that minimizes empty calories and combine it with regular resistance exercise and cardio.

Everyone has acne in middle school. It's not the end of the world yet. I'm sure you've probably heard to keep your face clean. Shower every day, and if you play sports or something make sure you shower before you go to sleep. All that sweat and filth really works on you if you go to sleep like that. And don't touch them.

If that's the case, then it's something you'll usually grow out of, but may have a problem with again when you're MUCH older.  If that's the cause, then basically what's happening to you is that your bloodpressure is too low or dropping suddenly on you.

7f60ce89990234aeb15b00211e12a0a0aa	There are many ways a person can get a hand rash, but all have some aspects in common. The skin is exposed to something irritating. It reacts with a rash. Hand eczema is another name for the same thing.<br>  <br>  Most hand rash cases are called "contact dermatitis" because they are caused by contact with substances found in the environment. A powerful irritant, like some industrial chemicals, acids or cleaning fluids, are obvious causes of contact dermatitis. More often, the irritant is milder and the problem starts out as dryness of the hands. A few of the more common irritants are over drying due to frequent hand washing, soaps, cleaning agents or even ingredients in skin and personal care products.<br>  <br>  The inflammation appears as redness, swelling and itching. The skin looses its ability to serve as a barrier and keep the outside world out. It allows more outside irritants in. Until all the irritants are removed, the skin will not heal. Once skin becomes red and dry, even so called "harmless" things like water and baby products can irritate skin further. This is a cumulative irritant dermatitis, in that it is not one big irritant but a lot of small ones.<br>  <br>  The tendency to get skin reactions is often inherited. People with these tendencies may have a history of hay fever and/or asthma in combination with food allergies and a skin condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema. Their skin can turn red and itch after contact with many substances that might not bother other people's skin.<br>  <br>  Less commonly, some cases of Hand dermatitis are allergic. This means after a period of exposure the substance caused sensitivity against it to develop in the skin to that, and only that, substance. The culprit could be anything, but rubber, metals and preservatives are common. Even prescription skin creams can do this. Then, afterward, whenever the skin is exposed to the same substance -- even slightly --it becomes inflamed. An example of an allergic reaction it is poison ivy dermatitis.<br>  <br>  The least common forms of hand dermatitis are often the most severe. Dyshidrotic hand dermatitis forms blisters under the skin, especially on the sides of the fingers and on the palms. It is internally produced, and seems to worsen with stress. Hyperkeratotic hand eczema develops thick scales and fissures. Either these may be forms of psoriasis, or at times psoriasis may look similar. These are more internally caused, and often also affect the feet.<br>  <br>  Dermatologists use a combination of methods to heal the skin. A prescription ointment or cream will be prescribed. If this cream doesn't seem to be helping after 7 to 10 days, call the doctor. It's possible one may need an oral antibiotic if an infection is present. Patients with severe hand rashes may be given oral or injected steroids. Keep hands away from irritants. The next section will explain what to avoid while the skin is healing.<br>  <br>  Frequent hand washing and water contact should be avoided. To do this, protect hands by using gloves and creams as barriers. Dirty the gloves, not the hands. Take rings off to wash because they trap soap and water next to the skin. Use lukewarm water and rinse thoroughly after washing with soap. Use a mild soap (Dove, Basis, Olay, Cetaphil) or a soap substitute (Cetaphil lotion, Oilatum-AD). Blot the skin dry carefully.<br>  <br>  Apply moisturizer while the skin is still moist. Repeat after each hand washing, immediately after bathing and after removing gloves. The rule of thumb for moisturizers is: the messier, the better. Moisturizing creams are better because they are thicker and last longer on the skin. Lotions, which contain mostly water, are the least effective as moisturizers.<br>  <br>  Wear waterproof gloves while peeling and squeezing lemons, oranges, or grapefruit, peeling potatoes, and handling tomatoes. Wear them for tasks such as dishes, folding laundry (the fabric soaks the moisture out of the hands), peeling vegetables or for handling citrus fruits or tomatoes. Always replace gloves that develop holes. One should have enough waterproof gloves so that the insides of the gloves can dry between uses.<br>  <br>  Plastic or vinyl is better than latex and powder free is much better than powdered when choosing gloves for people with sensitive hands. Heavy-duty vinyl gloves are better than rubber gloves. One may become allergic to rubber. Also, if latex gloves are worn at work, keep in mind that petroleum jelly based products and some others will damage them. Be sure to use an approved moisturizer if latex gloves are worn. Buy 3 to 6 pairs and place them in convenient locations, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry areas. Wear leather or heavy-duty fabric gloves when doing non-wet housework and gardening.<br>  <br>  Use of thin white cotton gloves as an absorbent liner under them underneath the waterproof gloves is highly recommended. Cotton gloves can also be worn alone during the day to protect hands from irritation. These cotton gloves should be washed frequently. A greasy ointment (prescription or white petroleum jelly, "Vaseline") applied to hands and covered with cotton gloves at night can really help.<br>  <br>  Don't pick at any loose ends of skin. These loose ends are best clipped off with a small nail clipper or scissor. Painful spits and cracks can be sealed with "New Skin" (or if one is really careful, Krazy glue). Minor, repeated friction with tools or papers is the main problem for some. Keep hands out of the cold, dry air and wind. Protect ones hands for at least four months after the dermatitis has healed. It takes a long time for skin to recover, and unless one is careful the dermatitis may recur.|`|iiExfNYQaa	if the patch of red isnt too big it could be a spider bite|`|IvoaNyN2aa	MAYBE IT IS RINGWORM??

Josh Bloom,  Leslie Mackler<br>  <br>  <br>  Find More Results for: "cure Osgood schlatter "<br>  Personal you - knee...<br>  Keep your hair on! And...<br>  * EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER<br>  <br>  Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of pain and tenderness at the tibial tuberosity in active adolescents. It is typically a self-limited condition that waxes and wanes, but which often takes months to years to resolve entirely. It is best managed with conservative measures (activity modification, ice, anti-inflammatory agents) and time (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, several case series and retrospective studies).<br>  <br>  In chronic cases that are refractory to conservative treatment, surgical intervention yields good results, particularly for patients with bony or cartilaginous ossicles. Excision of these ossicles produces resolution of symptoms and return to activity in several weeks (SOR: C, several case series). Corticosteroid injections are not recommended (SOR: C, case reports and expert opinion).<br>  <br>  * EVIDENCE SUMMARY<br>  <br>  Advertisement<br>  <br>  No prospective, interventional studies evaluate the treatment of Osgood-Schlatter disease. One case series followed the natural course of the disease in 261 patients (365 symptomatic knees) for 12 to 24 months; 237 (90.8%) patients responded well to restriction of sports activity and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The 24 patients who did not improve with conservative measures underwent surgical excision of ossicles, and all returned to normal activities (mean time, 4.5 weeks). (1)<br>  <br>  In another case series of 118 patients (151 knees), 88% responded to intermittent limitation of activity (weeks to months) or cylinder casting if limiting activity was ineffective. The remaining 14 patients showed no improvement from these measures; all had surgical excision of an ossicle, sometimes combined with a tubercle-thinning procedure. Only 1 of these patients (7%) did not have complete relief and return to full activities at 6 weeks. (2)<br>  <br>  Retrospective analyses also support a conservative approach. One retrospective survey of 68 young athletes with Osgood-Schlatter found they required an average of 3.2 months off all training and 7.3 months of some activity restrictions. (3) In another survey, 20 of 22 (91%) adolescent athletes with Osgood-Schlatter were able to manage their symptoms with ice, aspirin, and mild activity modification. Only 2 needed to stop playing all sports for any period of time, and none required surgery. (4)<br>  <br>  Another retrospective review analyzed 50 patients with Osgood-Schlatter (69 knees) for an average of 9 years. No treatments or activity restrictions were recommended. At time of follow-up, 36 (76%) had no limitations, but kneeling continued to be uncomfortable in 60%. (5)<br>  <br>  No interventional studies have explicitly evaluated commonly recommended conservative treatments such as ice, analgesics, activity restriction, stretching, strengthening, or anti-inflammatory medication. Corticosteroid injections are generally not recommended, due to case reports of complications, primarily related to subcutaneous atrophy. (6) One small case series demonstrated improvement in Osgood-Schlatter disease pain in 19 of 24 (79%) knees after using an infrapatellar strap for 6 to 8 weeks. (7)<br>  <br>  Refractory cases have been treated with a variety of surgical interventions. In 1 case series, 67 patients (70 knees) (mean age 19.6, 77% male) with at least 18 months of symptoms despite conservative treatment underwent resection of an ossicle (62 cases) or excision of prominent tibial tubercle (8 cases). These patients were followed for 2.2 years, with 56 (90%) patients with ossicle-resection able to return to maximal sports activity without pain, tenderness, loss of motion, or atrophy. (8)<br>  <br>  Another case series compared 22 patients who underwent drilling of the tibial tubercle (with or without the removal of the tibial tubercle) with 22 patients who had excision of loose ossicles or cartilage. Seventeen of the 22 (77%) patients with ossicle excision had complete resolution of symptoms compared with 8 of the 22 (36%) in the patients who underwent tibial tubercle drilling. (9)<br>  <br>  One surgical series evaluated excision of tibial tuberosity in 35 patients (42 knees) who did not improve with conservative treatment for an average of 13.25 months. For 37 of 42 knees (88%), patients reported complete relief of pain, and all returned to activity without limitation. The average time to return to sports was 15.2 weeks. (10)<br>  <br>  * RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHERS<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Academy of Family Practice recommend activity limitation, ice, anti-inflammatories, protective padding, quadriceps/hamstring strengthening, and time in the management of Osgood-Schlatter disease. (11,12)<br>  <br>  * CLINICAL COMMENTARY<br>  <br>  Few patients have poor results with conservative measures<br>  <br>  Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common problem that all primary care physicians must be ready to recognize and treat. While the research (primarily surgical series) indicates that 10% to 12% of patients may not improve with conservative measures, I have not had nearly that high a percentage of patients who require surgical intervention. Surgery is only offered after the tubercle attaches to the femur, or the tubercle fails to attach at all. In fact, I do not x-ray typical cases of Osgood-Schlatter disease unless evidence suggests patella tendon avulsion, or if parental concern is high. This means that, in most cases, the primary care physician has quite a while to try conservative measures before incurring the expense of radiography or an orthopedic consultation.|`|81vLLV8Caa	to mr terence, people are just trying to find an answer to his problem and yet u ask people to **** himself...... do u think its a blessing to have this disease?

iiExfNYQaa	you have strained your eyes and broken a blood vessel|`|IvoaNyN2aa	pink eye maybe it is contageous...here is info<br>  <br>  Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids.<br>  <br>  While pinkeye can sometimes be alarming because it may make the eyes extremely red and can spread rapidly, it's a fairly common condition and usually causes no long-term eye or vision damage. But if your child shows symptoms of pinkeye, it's important to see a doctor. Some kinds of pinkeye go away on their own, but other types require treatment.<br>  <br>  Conjunctivitis can be caused by infections (such as bacteria and viruses), allergies, or substances that irritate the eyes.<br>  <br>  Causes of Pinkeye<br>  Pinkeye can be caused by many of the bacteria and viruses responsible for colds and other infections, — including ear infections, sinus infections, and sore throats — and by the same types of bacteria that cause the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) chlamydia and gonorrhea.<br>  <br>  Pinkeye also can be caused by allergies. These cases tend to happen more frequently among kids who also have other allergic conditions, such as hay fever. Some triggers of allergic conjunctivitis include grass, ragweed pollen, animal dander, and dust mites.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a substance in the environment can irritate the eyes and cause pinkeye; for example, chemicals (such as chlorine and soaps) and air pollutants (such as smoke and fumes).<br>  <br>  Pinkeye in Newborns<br>  Newborns are particularly susceptible to pinkeye and can be more prone to serious health complications if it goes untreated.<br>  <br>  If a baby is born to a mother who has an STD, during delivery the bacteria or virus can pass from the birth canal into the baby's eyes, causing pinkeye. To prevent this, doctors give antibiotic ointment or eye drops to all babies immediately after birth. Occasionally, this preventive treatment causes a mild chemical conjunctivitis, which typically clears up on its own. Doctors also can screen pregnant women for STDs and treat them during pregnancy to prevent transmission of the infection to the baby.<br>  <br>  Many babies are born with a narrow or blocked tear duct, a condition which usually clears up on its own. Sometimes, though, it can lead to conjunctivitis.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of Pinkeye<br>  The different types of pinkeye can have different symptoms. And symptoms can vary from child to child.<br>  <br>  One of the most common symptoms is discomfort in the eye. A child may say that it feels like there's sand in the eye. Many kids have redness of the eye and inner eyelid, which is why conjunctivitis is often called pinkeye. It can also cause discharge from the eyes, which may cause the eyelids to stick together when the child awakens in the morning. Some kids have swollen eyelids or sensitivity to bright light.<br>  <br>  In cases of allergic conjunctivitis, itchiness and tearing are common symptoms.<br>  <br>  Contagiousness<br>  Cases of pinkeye that are caused by bacteria and viruses are contagious. (Conjunctivitis caused by allergies or environmental irritants are not.)<br>  <br>  A child can get pinkeye by touching an infected person or something an infected person has touched, such as a used tissue. In the summertime, pinkeye can spread when kids swim in contaminated water or share contaminated towels. It also can be spread through coughing and sneezing. Doctors usually recommend keeping kids diagnosed with contagious conjunctivitis out of school, day care, or summer camp for a short time.<br>  <br>  Someone who has pinkeye in one eye can also inadvertently spread it to the other eye by touching the infected eye, then touching the other one.<br>  <br>  Preventing Pinkeye<br>  To prevent pinkeye caused by infections, teach kids to wash their hands often with warm water and soap. They also should not share eye drops, tissues, eye makeup, washcloths, towels, or pillowcases with other people.<br>  <br>  Be sure to wash your own hands thoroughly after touching an infected child's eyes, and throw away items like gauze or cotton balls after they've been used. Wash towels and other linens that the child has used in hot water separately from the rest of the family's laundry to avoid contamination.<br>  <br>  If you know your child is prone to allergic conjunctivitis, keep windows and doors closed on days when the pollen is heavy, and dust and vacuum frequently to limit allergy triggers in the home. Irritant conjunctivitis can only be prevented by avoiding the irritating causes.<br>  <br>  Many cases of pinkeye in newborns can be prevented by screening and treating pregnant women for STDs. A pregnant woman may have bacteria in her birth canal even if she shows no symptoms, which is why prenatal screening is important.<br>  <br>  Treating Pinkeye<br>  Pinkeye caused by a virus usually goes away on its own without any treatment. If a doctor suspects that the pinkeye has been caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotic eye drops or ointment will be prescribed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it can be a challenge to get kids to tolerate eye drops several times a day. If you're having trouble, put the drops on the inner corner of your child's closed eye — when the child opens the eye, the medicine will flow into it. If you continue to have trouble with drops, ask the doctor about antibiotic ointment. It can be applied in a thin layer where the eyelids meet, and will melt and enter the eye.<br>  <br>  If your child has allergic conjunctivitis, your doctor may prescribe anti-allergy medication, which comes in the form of pills, liquid, or eye drops.<br>  <br>  Cool or warm compresses and acetaminophen or ibuprofen may make a child with pinkeye feel more comfortable. You can clean the edges of the infected eye carefully with warm water and gauze or cotton balls. This can also remove the crusts of dried discharge that may cause the eyelids to stick together first thing in the morning.<br>  <br>  When to Call the Doctor<br>  If you think your child has pinkeye, it's important to contact your doctor to try to determine what's causing it and how to treat it. Other serious eye conditions can mimic conjunctivitis, so a child who complains of severe pain, changes in eyesight, or sensitivity to light should be reexamined. If the pinkeye does not improve after 2 to 3 days of treatment, or after a week when left untreated, call your doctor.<br>  <br>  If your child has pinkeye and starts to develop increased swelling, redness, and tenderness in the eyelids and around the eye, along with a fever, call your doctor. Those symptoms may mean the infection has started to spread beyond the conjunctiva and will require additional treatment.|`|bda34fda9e8ddfa03fadca6d9f10e927aa	If it's only one eye that's affected, it sounds like it might be a classic case of bacterial or viral pink eye.

bVL1lMgoaa	For post menopausal women even ones under the age of 40.. can take soy tablets. they seem to do the trick nicely. I have a friend that has a long history of having breast cancer due to estrogen pills in her family and the soy pills help with the mood swings. There are also other side effects that can lead to heart disease. So be careful with things not perscribed.. Always ask your doctor if the treatment you prefer is best for you.. here is a website and a small excerpt from it to help you make up your mind.<br>  <br>  "SOY AND MENOPAUSE <br>  <br>  With all that we know about the pitfalls of conventional medicine's treatment of women in menopause, it makes sense that women are turning to “natural” approaches to relieve menopausal discomforts. The beneficial effects of estrogen on these discomforts are indisputable, but as women become more informed they see that the risks – especially of breast cancer – may be too great to justify its use. Others stop using conventional HRT because of side effects, and look to natural remedies to help them control their menopause symptoms. "<br>  <br>  And this is about DHEA from previous person.. Be careful and research thing thoroughly.. and Always talk to you doctor about these things too..<br>  <br>  "Safety Considerations<br>  <br>  High doses of DHEA over long periods may suppress the body's natural ability to synthesize the hormone. [2]<br>  <br>  Patients with kidney disease or multiple sclerosis have taken extremely high doses: 6 to 8 grams of DHEA daily, without adverse side effects. [7] Up to 1,600 mg of DHEA have been administered daily to subjects without side effects. [11] In early experiments, doses as high as 3,000 mg were administered. At extremely high doses over a longer period of time, some women temporarily experienced acne and increased expression of male attributes including facial hair growth and deepening of the voice. [11]<br>  <br>  Animal studies have shown that DHEA at high doses can lead to liver enlargement and liver damage. [2, 4, 21] Some animal and epidemiologic studies suggest that higher serum levels of DHEA may be associated with increased risk for ovarian and perhaps prostate or other types of cancer.<br>  <br>  Prostate and other cancer patients should consult their physician regarding DHEA supplementation."|`|IvoaNyN2aa	in my opinion i would just get some dhea..you see we all have this is our cells and it diminishes as we age..<br>  <br>  when we take dhea, our bodies turn it into the estrogen we need and in men it makes testerone<br>  <br>  try some..it gives you tremendous energy<br>  <br>  i take it and my doctor tested me tomake sure i took the right amount and he was pleased<br>  <br>  you take 10 mgs for every decade after 40<br>  <br>  ask your doc<br>  <br>  <br>  usually doctors dont like patients with cancer taking soy  it stops hot vflashes but doesnt cure the othervsymptoms<br>  <br>  my doc told me about dhea.....thank god|`|oR3kBEX1aa	yes u can find it now <a href="http://www.skincarefairy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.skincarefairy.com</a>

gieCJDbnaa	yes, it will work. You may have to wrap the band around a couple of times, but it will provide the pressure required to slowly move your teeth into position. You can also purchase the correct type of dental bands which are clear from several sources as well.|`|KPP3ahlYaa	Well, if you cannot pay for full braces, why not try the front teeth braces or something like that? My friend has got braces only on her front 4 tooth to close the gaps in her two front tooth. Doesn't cost as much as braces, and it's faster than putting on braces. She had it off in just 4 months. <br>  I don't encourage using rubberbands without a dentist's advice.|`|AA11689215	The gap in your front teeth is embarrassing, but you are willing to walk around with rubber bands surrounding your teeth?<br>  <br>  If it works in your head, go for it.|`|H4nSvUs6aa	I don't think you should do that.  You may end up loosening your front teeth or moving them out of position.<br>  <br>  A dentist once told me that my son had a gap between his two front teeth, and it was due to a strand of ligament there.<br>  They basically have to cut it across and pull it out. After that the gap would close. We decided that we didn't want to go that route, and have just accepted that little gap.<br>  Take care!

Also you can use a bowflex and stretch bands.  along with that go out for basketball, baseball or wrestling.  I would do these every other day.

As much as I hate to say it, if he's been impressed with the idea that this thinking is okay, it will probably stick with him for a long time.

You wanted your husband to get help so now get help for you and your son.|`|VJyAD4dOaa	He acts this way because he has watched this behavior his entire life. It's been imprinted in him. The only way to deal with this is to seek family counseling. Your daughter has most likely learned that she should look for abusive men in the future who treat her like crap. I'm sorry to say that and I'm not blaming you. I am telling you what happens when there is someone abusive in a family. Your daughter and you are in a victim role because that's also what you've been living with for years. You ALL need counseling and there is plenty of it out there that is low cost or no cost to you. An abusive household effects everyone in the home. This isn't just about your son, even though he is displaying the most obvious behavior. I grew up in a home like this and ended up with an abusive man. After a lot of therapy and working through my issues, I was able to start a different life with someone who doesn't treat me that way. And DO NOT let the abusive father/husband back into the home. These men are the most difficult to rehabilitate and he is not likely to change.  PLEASE SEEK COUNSELING for everyone in your home.<br>  <br>  P.S. I saw the addition to your question - He needs a new therapist. A good therapist will bring you in on some sessions and let you voice your concern. If your son fools this therapist, and it's not helping, get another one. You have to keep trying until you find what works. Good for you for putting him in therapy! My nephew was fooling a therapist and they switched his therapist. The second therapist made progress with him. It's not a good match for your son and time to move on to a new one.

Some people like it all gone, others preferred it just trimmed or done around the edges (bikini line).

Or, if you have the money you can go to a salon and get a bikini/brazilian/playboy wax for around $25 and up.

That is, their self-image or sense of self often rapidly changes. They typically view themselves as evil or bad, and sometimes they may feel as if they don't exist at all. This unstable self-image can lead to frequent changes in jobs, friendships, goals, values and gender identity.<br>  <br>  Relationships are usually in turmoil. People with BPD often experience a love-hate relationship with others. They may idealize someone one moment and then abruptly and dramatically shift to fury and hate over perceived slights or even misunderstandings. This is because people with the disorder have difficulty accepting gray areas — things are either black or white. For instance, in the eyes of a person with BPD, someone is either good or evil. And that same person may be good one day and evil the next.<br>  <br>  In addition, people with BPD often engage in impulsive and risky behavior. This behavior often winds up hurting them, whether emotionally, financially or physically. For instance, they may drive recklessly, engage in unsafe sex, take illicit drugs or go on spending or gambling sprees. People with BPD also often engage in suicidal behavior or deliberately injure themselves for emotional relief.<br>  <br>  Other signs and symptoms of borderline personality disorder may include:<br>  <br>  Strong emotions that wax and wane frequently <br>  Intense but short episodes of anxiety or depression <br>  Inappropriate anger, sometimes escalating into physical confrontations <br>  Difficulty controlling emotions or impulses <br>  Fear of being alone <br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question...|`|AA11538639	Impulsive, temperamental, mood swing, aggressive, paranoid, irresponsible, war-monger.|`|Qp2j90Ytaa	Crazee to the maxxx... lol<br>  <br>  my ex-gf was diagnosed a few years after we broke up.<br>  <br>  I knew something was wrong but we loved each other that we had it on and off trying to make it work.<br>  <br>  I was attracted to her energy and sense of adventure... <br>  she was extremely impulsive.

wzjOVqo7aa	Post-traumatic stress disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that's triggered by an extremely traumatic event. You can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when a traumatic event happens to you or when you see a traumatic event happen to someone else.<br>  <br>  Many people who are involved in traumatic events or witness them have a brief period of difficulty adjusting and coping. But with time and some healthy coping methods, such traumatic reactions usually get better on their own. In some cases, though, the symptoms can get worse or last for months or even years. Sometimes, they may even completely disrupt your life. In these cases, you may have post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>  <br>  Post-traumatic stress disorder may affect survivors of such traumatic events as sexual or physical assault, war, torture, a natural disaster or an airplane crash. Post-traumatic stress disorder also can affect rescue workers at the site of mass casualties or other tragedies. These kinds of events may cause intense fear, helplessness or horror.<br>  <br>  It's important to get treatment as soon as possible to help prevent PTSD from getting worse.<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder typically begin within three months of a traumatic event. In a small number of cases, though, PTSD symptoms may not occur until years after the event.<br>  <br>  Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may include:<br>  <br>  Flashbacks, or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time <br>  Shame or guilt <br>  Upsetting dreams about the traumatic event <br>  Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event <br>  Feeling emotionally numb <br>  Irritability or anger <br>  Poor relationships <br>  Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much <br>  Hopelessness about the future <br>  Trouble sleeping <br>  Memory problems <br>  Trouble concentrating <br>  Being easily startled or frightened <br>  Not enjoying activities you once enjoyed <br>  Hearing or seeing things that aren't there <br>  Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms can come and go. You may have more symptoms during times of higher stress or when you experience symbolic reminders of what you went through. For example, some people whose PTSD symptoms had been gone for years saw their symptoms come back again with the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.<br>  <br>  When you have PTSD, you may relive the traumatic event numerous times. You may have upsetting memories. Or you may see reminders wherever you go. You may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences, for instance. Or you may see a report on the news about a rape, and feel again the horror and fear of your own assault.|`|gZth9QDMaa	eat a lamb chop or two|`|tGZd6ef0aa	seek therapy......this is a memory that has scared your emotions, and is now beginning to call on you.  through therapy you can let out the emotion, and you can be honest with the therapist.  if you do not seek help soon, it will begin to run your life....depression, anxiety, shame, guilt....all this will begin.  get it out you as soon as possible.

Drink your fair share of water, don't eat too much and work out to maintain your metabolism. <br>  <br>  The second is more problematic and gets worse as you age because collagen is not regenerated so the tissue becomes less elastic. Also, most people gain weight as they age because of a less active life style and a drop in metabolism.

I am sure that after a 6 month period of eating fresh foods you will see differences in your health.|`|9b6Nxvljaa	i once tried  the coffee grinds after you make a pot while it's still warm not hot. you take that, rub into the area and wrap Reynolds plastic wrap tightly around the caffeine absorbs the water out of it. the process gets kinda messy so you may want to to it in the bath tube.  its temporary not permanent but it works for like one day on the beach. i have done it|`|O6DbXWGqaa	Right, if you really want to get rid of cellulite you have to commit to this because it is an ongoing process but it works. <br>  <br>  You need to cut out all processed foods (chips, any packaged food, no artificial sugar, no caffeine etc) <br>  The more natural foods you eat the better for you. No white bread, no white rice, no potatoes, no white pasta - these all have negative effects on your body because they are refined products and the body can't break them down...hence they turn into fatty deposits which is what cellulite is. <br>  You need to drink 2 ltrs of water every day to help flush out fat cells and toxins and green tea which is full of anti-oxidants.<br>  You need to also take Silicea (gel form) which helps with assisting in the skins elasticity, a natural supplement. <br>  <br>  You need to exercise everyday and the best form of exercise is running for a min of 45mins or if you can't run then power walk (and I mean power walk) for 1 hr, to help with circulation and movement - which is what you want. <br>  <br>  You also need to exfoliate every other day with a good body scrub and when you exfoliate make sure your movements are upwards, towards the heart, you don't want to push all your toxins down towards your legs. <br>  After you shower everyday you also can use a cellulite cream (which only works if you do all of the above) depends on your budget..I use Biotherm Cellulite cream or Christian Dior Cellulite cream but Garnier Cellulite cream is just as good. <br>  <br>  Also, if you can afford it, get a cellulite massage (deep dissue) to help release the the toxins or cupping which is fantastic. I get it done every month on my butt and legs and what cupping does is draw all the toxins to the surface and it feel fantastic. <br>  Endermologie is also great which is a specific massage for cellulite but it can get pricey. <br>  <br>  Any other questions let me know.|`|wrtmOnPYaa	Theres a product out there called Nivea, or something like that, and it works for my mom.

Start eating healthy, get rid of the junk foods, drink plenty of water daily, & exercise. Walking is the most natural form of exercise, so get into a daily regimen of walking. Try to slowly increase your distance & speed, so as to burn more calories. Pre walk stretching is very important, so as not to end up with shim splints, which are very painful. The walking will work  wonders & if you want more exercise, you cna bike, swim, or go to a gym, & have someone work with you, so you'll get fit.

Whatever you've been doing is working for you, so keep it up.  :)  Lifting weights will help you with cutting down your body fat.  Muscle helps your body burn calories more efficiently.  Every 3,500 calories that you burn, you lose one pound of fat.  Eat foods that are low fat, high in fiber, and nutrient rich.  Also, drink plenty of water.  <br>  <br>  Make sure that you are eating small meals every 2 hours so that your body gets accustomed to buring a consistent level of calories.  When you don't eat for a long period of time your body goes into starvation mode and your metabolism slows down.  It does this because it senses that it's not receiving any calories and therefore wants to conserve what it has.  make sure that your body's engine is running smoothly and not sluggishly so that you can burn those extra calories.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Walking and Swimming is the best of over all workouts.|`|cHtP31pZaa	A good diet, a lot if cardio, and Hydroxycut Hardcore will help a lot.

P9MtNi2laa	GO TO THE DOCTOR NOW!!  Although I doubt it, what you are describing suggests something communicable.  If that is the case you want to nip it in the bud before it spreads to someone else you care about.  You could also have something else that is very dangerous, an abscess.  Abscesses, if left unattended long enough, can kill you.  And it could also be what you think it is, it could be a pulled muscle.  Whatever it is, you will need something stronger than aspirin for the pain.  I recommend Lortab 7.5 mg.  You can only get that by prescription. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what you think, or of any other answer you get here, GO TO THE DOCTOR NOW!!!  Don't read any more, don't guess anymore.  Don't put it off for another minute.  Go to the doctor NOW!  If you cannot get in to see your family doctor, go to an immediate care facility.  If you can't find one of those, go to the Emergency Room.  Just go to a doctor NOW!!!|`|RjUhISEIaa	Sorry to hear about this but there only one answer to give...both of you go to the doctor and get a medical opinion and not from us here.

NaHz7qyoaa	Sometimes you can concentrate to much and miss the point all together. Sometimes your mind just thinks differently and picks up on differently points as important. <br>  <br>  I often miss the point that everyone else thinks is important. But what you can learn to do is, see what you do pick up on and learn why. Often you will get the point a different way, but still understand the same thing. It's difficult at school because you are marked according to a formula and teachers don't always take the time to think outside the box. I had a huge arguments with teachers and tutors about my English. Because although the way I wrote things was technically correct it didn't fit their way of looking at it. So they change my grammar and change the meaning of the piece then fail me for not writing what they wanted, or not making sense. When it did originally.<br>  <br>  Look at what you are picking up from the lectures, talk to the lecturers about what you picked up on and see if they can help you come round to understand what is important and you need to listen out for. <br>  <br>  You're not necessarily at fault here, sometimes the world needs alternative thinkers.

Es liberador, es divertido y no se hace da?o a nadie. Sirve cuando hay estrés , para ayudar a conciliar el sue?o, para aliviar el dolor menstrual, para conocer mejor los puntos de placer y despues compartirlos con la pareja, para hacer los ejercicios Kegel (los de la musculatura pelvica), para hacerse un regalo, porque no se ha  terminado con la pareja y se desea terminar. <br>  <br>  Forma parte de la individualidad sexual a la que ni siquiera creo que se debería renuinciar por el hecho de vivir con alguien, porque quienes comparten un lecho no tienen las mismas necesidades sexuales, ?que pasa si uno quiere y el otro no? Si tenemos una mente cuadriculada o bien uno se queda con las ganas o el otro se ve obligado a mantener relaciones sin desearlas. Si en cambio aceptamos que el autosatisfacerse es parte de nuestro repertorio sexual de pareja se acabó el problema.

lCk02AH9aa	Yes, one of my trainers  years ago, hated the term cardio... when it was being used for a fat burning exercise because cardio can be the bike, but so can fat burning, your heart rate really needs to be in the fat burning zone to burn fat, too high... a cardio zone and it just kind of skips the fat.  Of course your fat % will go down, but faster if you slow it down into that zone.<br>  <br>  3500 calories= 1 lb.<br>  Now depending on your height, weight, and level of activity an average person (female)may burn 2200 cal. a day. So to maintain you weight you would eat 2200 cal. So if you are trying to lose weight you need to drop the calories and increase exercise (fat burning exercises... ride a bike or a brisk walk)But, as a 48 year old man who is... or will be active around 2950 cal. is what will maintain you.  So you will want to drop that. But it isn't this simple... because muscle is heavier than fat. If you drop your calorie intake too low (under 800) your body thinks it is being starved (which it is) and then your body will want to save the fat (it's layer of protection) and will sacrifice the muscle. Plus it's not like you can get on a treadmill and run a few hours till you've hit 3500 cal. burned and hop off and instantly weigh a pound less. Your body has to process it. Best bet: drop calories to around 1500 on days you don't lift weights, eat 3 healthy well balanced meals, don't skip breakfast it is what gets your body started, drink at least 80 oz.of water, have 1 snack... like an apple, and a fat burning exercise (keep in the fat burning zone for at least 45 min) you should see great results fast in the beginning, but then it may slow, which is fine,because you may hit a plateau. Just switch things up a bit in your exercise routine to move out of it. Also yogurt... have a fat free yogurt with breakfast and lunch if you can, studies have shown that yogurt helps get rid of fat, and that 2 yogurts a day more than tripled the fat loss of those who had none, and 1.5 times more fat loss than those who had 1. Lifting weights is great too, it builds more muscle, which in turn burns more fat. Just remember muscle is heavier than fat so as you build it your weight may not go how you thought it would, so keep measurements, because sometimes the weight doesn't change but the inches do. Days that you do lift weights... 30-60 min. before your workout drink a protein shake... I like myoplex lite... and if you feel like you need it, or it is going to be awhile till you can eat and get some protein in you after your workout have another shake. The myolex lites only have 180 cal. and 25g protein so an extra 360 on workout days isn't bad at all. Even the days you lift... do not forget to do fat burning.<br>  Eating advice- eat! try not to skip meals, passing on a meal really is not good. Stay away from sugar substitutes, splenda and stevia are fine.<br>  example-<br>  <br>  BREAKFAST<br>  <br>  1/2 cup cereal(hot or cold) with 1/3 cup skim milk OR 1/2 bagel OR 1/2 english muffin OR slice of toast OR 1 reduced fat waffle w/ 2Tbsp. sugar-free syrup<br>  AND<br>  Fresh fruit- 1/2 grapefruit OR 1 cup melon OR 1 small apple, orange, peach OR 1/2 cup of canned fruit in natural juices OR 1/2 cup fruit juice<br>  AND<br>  1 cup skim or 1%milk OR low-fat yogurt (100 cal. type... yoplait for example)<br>  AND<br>  1 Tsp. reduced fat margarine OR 2 Tsp. low sugar jelly OR 1 Tsp. fat-free cream cheese OR 1 Tsp nondairy creamer (if you like it in your coffee)<br>  AND<br>  water (always) you can have coffee or tea too<br>  <br>  Now this may seem like alot of food but it isn't, it's choices you can combine to have something different everyday. <br>  If you chose... lets say... Life cereal with milk, 1/2 cup of OJ (I like Topicana light and healthy), a yogurt, and coffee with creamer... you would have a pretty good breakfast that only has about 325 cal.<br>  <br>  Stay away from bacon and sausage for now,fast food and fried foods. I really love bacon, but if you are trying to lose weight, they will not help in any possible way. Once you have it your goal... that's a different story, now and then is fine, because you are then trying to maintain, not lose.<br>  <br>  LUNCH<br>  <br>  2 slices of diet bread (I love Pepperidge Farm light style) OR 1/2 pita bread<br>  AND<br>  2oz. of skinless chicken OR turkey breast, OR 2oz. shrimp OR tuna (in water) OR 2 oz. fat free cheese OR 1 oz. lean roast beef, ham, OR low fat sandwich meat<br>  AND<br>  1 cup total of salad, veggies,or combo of both<br>  AND<br>  Fresh fruit OR canned (same as what you would have for breakfast, just not the juice option)<br>  AND<br>  1 Tsp. margarine or mayo OR 2 Tsp.peanut butter OR salad dressing (1 Tbs. regular or 2 Tbs. reduced-fat)<br>  AND<br>  1 Tsp.fat-free mayo OR salad dressing OR 1 Tbs. Ketchup OR 1 Tbs. mustard<br>  AND<br>  a drink... water is great, so is tea<br>  So now a lunch might look like this...<br>  a sandwich with, mustard, turkey, lettuce and tomato. Small salad with dressing (Kraft fat-free Caesar Italian), and a small apple. Now this meal may run you around 380-400 cal. <br>  Now if you don't want the bread, just a salad make it a big one... say 3 cups total, but don't forget to add your meat to it.<br>  <br>  SNACK<br>  Usually I have my apple from lunch here with some peanut butter (1 Tbsp) or a fat-free yogurt either way 100 cal.<br>  <br>  DINNER<br>  1/2 baked potato OR 1/2 cup pasta, rice,corn, peas, or mashed potato OR 1/2 a hot dog or hamburger bun OR slice of bread OR small roll<br>  AND<br>  4 oz. of fish, chicken breast, turkey breast, shrimp, scallops, or crab OR 3 oz. lean beef, pork, veal, lamb, salmon, or leanhamburger patty OR areduced-fat hot dog<br>  AND<br>  pick 2 of these- 1/2 cup cooked asparagus, beans, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, spinach, summer squash, tomatoe sauce, or zucchini... a salad that totals 1 cup<br>  AND<br>  1 Tbs. fat-free margarine OR 1 Tbs. Salad dressing OR 2 Tbs. reduced fat salad dressing OR 1 Tbs. sour cream OR 1 Tbs. ketchup OR 1 Tbs. taco sauce OR 1/4 cup of salsa.<br>  AND<br>  drink... water... tea<br>  So now this meal may look like this<br>  1/2 cup of wild rice with grilled salmon, steamed asparagus tips, a small salad with dressing... and this would be about 370 cal.<br>  <br>  so lets see breakfast 325, lunch 400, snack 100, dinner 370 that totals right about 1200 cal. not too bad. Now everyday may not be 1200... and this days set up might be a good one on lifting days. <br>  good luck to you|`|AA11192489	You need to eat something before you work out. <br>  <br>  Don't get confused by one person telling you this and another person telling you that... the weight loss industry is rife with conflicting advice from different sources. <br>  <br>  It's really quite simple - use more calories than you consume.<br>  <br>  You need a certain amount of calories to maintain your current weight - this is known as your BMR. Find a calculator to tell you what that number is, and then subtract 250 - 500 calories. Then, you will want to exercise enough to burn 250 - 500 calories average per day.<br>  <br>  You should adjust your caloric intake if needed - If you don't find that you are losing weight, reduce your caloric intake by another 250 calories per day, then wait a week for results before reducing caloric intake any further. If you find that you are losing more than 2 pounds per week, then increase your caloric intake by 250 calories per day, and wait a week for results. <br>  <br>  Running increasing your metabolism will not cause you to lose less fat. Walking is, however, a very good weight loss activity.<br>  <br>  Here is a BMR calculator for you. There are several available on the internet. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.internetfitness.com/calculators/bmr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetfitness.com/calculato...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  As for what and when to eat - I recommend whole grains whenever possible - Whole grain bread, pasta, cous cous, popcorn, oatmeal, whole grain cereal, etc. Also plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and lean meats, mostly fish and poultry.<br>  <br>  Try to eat at least every 3 - 4 hours. This serves a few purposes - it will keep your blood sugar stable, which will help you to not have cravings, and it will also keep your metabolism going. You can eat three meals and two or three snacks a day, or you can eat several small meals a day to accomplish this.

MJdUkar5aa	You probably won't feel like kissing right after you get your wisdom teeth pulled out. Also you might have a bad breath problem for a day or two. Ask your dentist if it's OK to use a mouthwash. The bad breath thing will go away, it is the gluggy blood in your gums which comes away as you are healing . You will have a sore jaw for up to a week afterwards, and will need to make sure you have some strong pain killers in the house. Panadeine forte or something like that.|`|AA10283901	I have had NO problem (after the healing takes place, of course) with this issue, whatsoever!

vvP7njBgaa	Well when your born you can get born with an illness called Sepa<br>  Its where you cant feel anything so like you have to cehck if you lost any teeth in the morning and always check your tempreture. When your a baby you chew on your lip. Say if you fell off a building you wont feel anything.  So yeah I guess you COULD get Sepa but I would not recommend it as doing so will determine a very short life :-)|`|kvIt9Oo7aa	I broke my left arm about ten years ago.

f3de2abf8efbc1bab78ab950c86227b2aa	Ok, I've never really counted calories but... the amount of food you should eat depends on your activity level, not your current weight (unless you're a bodybuilder, in which case you need more protein even on days you don't work out, to maintain enormous muscles).<br>  <br>  I believe for sedentary people it's around 2000 calories for females and 2500 for males. Add up to 1000 calories depending on how much you work out.<br>  <br>  One good eating habit that I read about all too often is to eat three reasonable meals plus three small snacks throughout the day. While this may sound really crazy at first, the science behind this is to space your food intake throughout the day, so you don't get the scenario where you're crazy with hunger and binge on your next meal. Also, it avoids drastic spikes in blood-sugar levels which might affect your performance in work and daily life.<br>  <br>  To help you, here's an old article from the Men's Health Abs Guide 2008:<br>  <br>  Snacks that are 200 calories and under<br>  - Stick of string cheese (80)<br>  - 5 cups of light microwave popcorn sprinkled with hot sauce and Romano cheese (150)<br>  - 6 strawberries dipped in yogurt, drizzled with chocolate sauce (150)<br>  - Canned tuna with balsamic vinegar on whole-grain crackers (175)<br>  - 1 cup reduced-sodium cottage cheese with fresh peaches and cinnamon (200)<br>  - Two handfuls of olives (200)<br>  - 1 cup blackberries, blueberries or strawberries with 6 oz light yogurt and 1 Tbsp low-fat granola (200)<br>  <br>  Snacks that are between 250 and 400 calories<br>  - One egg on a whole-grain English muffin with melted cheese (250)<br>  - Clif bar (250)<br>  - Peanut butter and jelly on a whole-grain English muffin (200)<br>  - Oatmeal with milk, brown sugar, walnuts, and any fresh or dried fruit (300)<br>  - Slice of whole-grain bread topped with peanut butter and banana (300)<br>  - 1/2 cup hummus with roasted vegetables (400)<br>  <br>  Fruit and vegetables take care of you by providing you with feel-full fiber, so you don't have to worry that much about portion control, to be honest.|`|AUQEBaaKaa	You will need 2150 just to keep your body functioning...add more if you are active.
BbbAmjXqaa	This might sound complicated but I'll simplify it!<br>  <br>  Weakness , headaches , and fatigue are usually the first symptoms of secondary polycythemia (the making of to many red blood cells ( and often white blood cells to fight infection). It is caused by either a natural or artificial increase in the production of erythropoietin (a hormone that controls the making of red blood cells). It can be due to myeloproliferative syndrome (the making of to many cells in the bone marrow), or it could be related to low oxygen levels.<br>  I recommend going to a doctor and asking him about secondary polycythemia (poly-glass-ee-me-a).<br>  I hope this helped, and I hope it isn't to complecated.<br>  XxX|`|R7mnEUOZaa	You need to speak to your mum again and tell her you are worried and would like to go to the doctors for a check up. The other option is to see the school nurse and she will see your mum.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	I'd go to your school nurse and tell her what your feeling and she an maybe talk to your mom. Your mom might listen to an adult. And if your mom asks why you didn't tell her then just simply say I tried but you wouldn't listen. It almost sounds like mono.|`|QNT6nrHpaa	To begin with it sounds alot more serious than you realize. Your health is the most important, and I am sure your mom will agree. If it is that bad, sit her down, tell her everything, or just let her read this post you left. You can just leave it up on the computer where you think she will see it while you are watching tv,or outside. Kinda like you would want her to see it. If the computer is in your room leave it up and ask her to check something in your room, then she will see it. I have a 16 girl and a 13 son, and their health is important. She,I know feels the same, but sometimes we get wrapped up in everyday life that we brush things off. But you feel really strong about this so, if all fails, then make the Dr`s appt. and go, even if it breakes a rule. By the time you try all else and only if you get nowhere, then take the next step, and just go. It might be the best decision you could make as a young  fella. Good luck, and don`t let anyone here try to give you a diagnoses. Mleissa

AlfFeJ4Waa	Take a little break, you might be getting a cold.<br>  <br>  There are lymph nodes all over your neck and in the back of your mouth.  (also in your pits and genitals)  thats why the doctors always feel you up like that :)<br>  <br>  Lymph nodes are like fortresses of your lymphatic system, a network of tubing where white blood cells like to hang out together. <br>  <br>  When a bacteria (which is what you probably have), wants to take over.. your body will naturally make everything in that system more active.  It's your bodies way of B*tch slapping that bacteria dead.  <br>  <br>  When this happens some times just the back of the mouth is sore, some times it's just one side, some times it's everything.  <br>  <br>  I would take a break from singing if it is getting uncomfortable. 
7tpAq9eWaa	I'm 15, and I've grown SO MUCH in the last year. just be patient, you will probably have a growth spurt soon. and have a healthy diet, a balanced diet. dont like go bulimic or anorexic, just eat healthy. stay away from tast food and stuff. if u get enough vitamins and minerals it will help you lose weight and grow at the same time :) but yeah just be patient! you stop growing when youre like, 25 at the latest, so you got time. if i may ask, have u started ur period? because right after you start it you grow a lot, well i did. i started it before the summer (yeah i know im rly old for it..) but yeah. and do lots of sports, but not excessive. basically keep a balance. it depends on how tall u r and how much u weigh where that balance is, but its not that hard to find! just eat until you've had enough but not until you're bloated, and do sports regularly, at least once a week. :)|`|lqyCUPxPaa	You cant make your self taller that comes with growth unless you wear high hells but you can loose weight easily by choosing good meals salads and exercising every day go to a place where the let you run track do 10 laps a day and drink plenty of water.|`|bvI9r7Psaa	You cannot become taller unless you take Human Growth Hormone, which is illegal without a prescription, or you undergo drastic operations where they cut your leg and gradually pull to make your legs longer.  You could drink a lot of milk, but as a girl most of your growth has already happened so that will not help much.  We can't give you an average weight without knowing your height.  You are not out of puberty yet, and as long as you start exercising early and eating right, you will soon grow up to be healthy and beautiful young woman, so don't worry too much.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing to do is eat right -- wheat products instead of white products, fruits, vegetables, lean meat (chicken and fish are the best), and daily cardiovascular exercise (biking, swimming, jogging).  Take up a sport at school and you'll be fine.
D6IsSOOfaa	when i get mine they are just like that.... best thing to do is wear the tampon and also a pad, i know its uncomfy but it works and change you tampon every half hour that way you should be able to catch it before it leaks again|`|JMd2cfNIaa	The soloution is obvious. You have a heavy flow and you obviously don't have a tampon with a high enough absorbency. Try the super tampons. And when you were using pads you weren't using ones with high enough absorbency levels either. There is nothing wrong with you at all, you just have a heavy flow, lost of women have heavy flows. just make sure you have tampons and pads to accomodate your needs. And when your using tampons maybe also buy some pantyliners for a bit of extra protection|`|6gv0Igq0aa	Go get checked out by a doctor about this.Other than that,you need to change the tampon more often when you know you are leaking heavy or wear a pad with the tampon so it doesn't ruin your clothes.|`|xwjoqf81aa	You really need to b seen by ob/gyn! i had lots of period problems my whole life! i mean a normal period for me would be 7-14 days long that was at 15yrs old and even to this day. my family doc put me on birth control ortho-tri cyclon! my periods were only 3 days long then and not as heavy! You could have cysts that are rupturing, and that could be what is causing such heavy flow! Have your mom take you to the doctor. be completly honest about sex and everything because those factors really do matter! Good Luck Sweetie!  God Speed!
MsrPhN8Iaa	It can cause major liver damage, and your stomach to bleed. I've done them a few times, and i too felt tired/weak for a few days after that. When walking downstairs, especially, my knees felt like they were about to give out. I'm not a doctor,  but I wouldn't do them  too often if i were you, just in case.|`|6qzAS8praa	Yeah, it does cause a lot of damage to your body actualy. It causes severe liver damage, and probaly a lot more. You could also die and go into a seizure if you take too many of them. Trust me, if you wanted to get messed up and have a good time, don't take cough medicine, its pathetic and stupid.

OG6jViGLaa	I don't think it's "normal" (meaning common) because most guys are animals. They care more about sex than a relationship, so that's usually what they go for.<br>  <br>  There are a large number of men (a small percentage of the population, but there are still a lot of them) that haven't had a romantic relationship with a woman by the time they're 30. Oftentimes, it's because they haven't found the right woman, are focused on a career/education, or are just more interested in other things. I know some guys (often called "nerds", I know) that prefer working on their hobby instead of putting a lot of energy into pursuing and maintaining a relationship..... and some married men would call them "lucky" ;-)|`|eUWBpSCwaa	it's normal, but not common, don't you like that? your not common lolz<br>  <br>  maybe your not just into it, don't stress yourself or think something is wrong with you, do you think your gay? lolz stop thinking like that, it might make you gay if you'll auto suggest that thing. your question appears to be telling another question lolz<br>  <br>  guys like you are rare, let me guess, people/girls used to say your the snob type, they say that you look sober and sometimes unapproachable.

GGmaSpHDaa	Generally weight training does not decrease agility in a sport as long as that sport is still practiced. <br>  <br>  Having said that, it is better to avoid a workout with high reps per set (e.g. 12-20 reps) and short rest time (< 1 min) between sets.<br>  <br>  Better to activate more fast-twitch muscle fibers with a workout that has 5-8 reps per set, and rest 2-3 minutes per set. Three to five sets per exercise. Your agility should improve.<br>  <br>  Give priority to exercises that use large numbers of muscles at one time. E.g. Squat, lunge, press, pull-up, etc. They provide the best carry-over to sports and are the most time-efficient.
Prg3LHufaa	A vitamin serves as fruits and vegatables by providing you with Vitamins and Minerals. This will not help your weightlifting because you need protiens and amino acids.

gc1qCZKMaa	whats the diet pill your taking|`|6uL6lQAcaa	Restrict calories moderately. Start by reducing your intake by 200 calories. Also begin to eat more fruit and vegetables instead of fatty or sugary foods; they contain plenty of fiber, vitamins and help keep you full. <br>  Gradually increase your calorie restriction until at the end of the 5 weeks you are eating 500 calories less per day than you used to. <br>  Eat a balanced diet every day. Include one lean source of protein, 1 serving of complex carbohydrates, and two to three servings of vegetables and fruit at each meal. It is suggested that you get your daily percentage of calories in the following portions: 40% protein, 40% carbohydrates, 20% fat. <br>  Eat five to six small meals per day, spaced about two to three hours apart. If you eat before you get hungry, you don't need to eat much. If you wait until you feel hungry, you will eat far more than you need to. Now, we know this is really inconvenient for anybody who actually goes to school or has a job so just make sure you eat small but adequate portions whenever you eat and have a healthy lifestyle. <br>  Exercise by walking 30-45 minutes every day. Do not use ankle weights as this is the leading cause of orthopedic injury. Walk up hills or on inclines as your conditioning improves. You can jog for 20-30 minutes a day for those who have less time. <br>  Resist food cravings by brushing your teeth when you feel hungry. Food cravings are often strong in the late afternoon, and if brushing your teeth fails you should eat one of your meals during this time. Remember, when you get cravings, you are burning fat so sip some water or have a light, low cal snack. Fruits and veggies are great!

op09Sh3faa	Muscle is built mostly off of a protein. Which mostly comes with meat. Increasing your intake of protein will HELP build muscle with proper exercise and it takes time. Diet control is not as big a help as some would think for getting the positive effects but its important to avoid the negative effects. For instance if you cut down to eating meats alone or just...MOSTLY meats even...it can have the reverse effect. The body dumps what it is getting more then enough of and feeds off of that source as well and will cling on to the things its NOT getting. So...if you cut FAT out all together and eat pure meat...your body will burn MUSCLE before it burns FAT. We know that is not what you are going for...so its important to eat a BALANCE in your diet. Most diets for losing weight and building protein tell you to cut out all or most of one thing and focus on another...any real dietitian can  tell you that this is a recipe for disaster and poor health.

lpgaDJEyaa	I struggle with the same problem which started around that age. I'm 26 now. Anyway you need to try to find out what triggered this. Did someone call you fat or did someone say you looked better when you ribs were sticking out? You have to look in the mirror and be happy with yourself which is a very hard thing to do. I still have a problem with this. Maybe it would help if you talked to a professional. I would hate this to progress into an eating disorder too.  <br>  <br>  As far a celebrities look at Beyonce, j-lo, or Jessica Beal they are beautiful and have meat on their bones.<br>  <br>  Try to surround yourself with positive people.

F1bcDaJIaa	Because women's breasts are made up mostly of Adipose (fatty) tissue, and contain no muscle, exercise alone will not change their size or shape directly.  However by working the largest muscle in the chest, pectoralis major, you can help support the breasts and hold them up higher. <br>  one exercises is the chest flye.

Yo tomo un el Termogen té de limón y no tengo que martirizarme haciendo esas dietas, ya he bajado de peso y me siento muy bien, lo ideal es un producto que lo puedas incluir en tu dieta, que no te sale más caro que tomarte un refresco diario y que te ayuda quemar grasa, por consiguiente la perdida de peso es constante y definitiva, y eso es lo que he encontrado con este producto.<br>  <br>  Saludos,<br>  DTB|`|0387bc235b64b10442f49ad591427edcaa	Yo conozco a dos amigas que hicieron eso mismo y parecido  y no les ha servido para nada, ni bajaban ni nada. Mira, ahi te ponen muchas pastillitas,tés y demas cosas, una pastilla no te  va a sustituir la comida, despues de cada pastilla tendras un monton de hambre. y esa comida es para todos los dias? te aburriras. Le has preguntado al distribuidor si esta comida esta controlada por nutricionistas y medicos?.El té, las chicas me dijeron que era asqueroso...xD , pero seguro que con esta dieta a lo mejor te sentiras desganada, es mejor una dieta balanceada de fruta y verdura, 2 litros diarios de agua , no solo 1 y medio. <br>  Mira, yo estoy en otro programa y si estoy bajando de peso, me han puesto una dieta balanceada y esto es, 5 comidas al dia, por lama?ana un batido soja, unas horas despues mi desayuno, a meida ma?ana una fruta o un chusco de pan, de almuerz verduras, ensaladas, carne, pescado ( todo tipo de carne a la plancha). de merienda 2 piezas de fruta y yogurt y de cena un batido simple, si me queda hambre, fruta o algo ligero. y por cierto, antes y despeus de cada comida beber agua. 2 litros al dia, esta dieta se basa en proteina, ademas para hacer efecto hago al dia 30 minutos de caminata diarios, porque si no haces ejercicio, todas las dietas no valen. Lo mejor es ir a un nutricionista o al medico... si bajas de peso, bien xD pero a ver si no te hace despues el efecto rebote....<br>  Un beso.|`|ae89d591673d9ab2bb1527d9d1a37b9daa	Conozco un caso de una conocida que perdio bastante peso pero luego engordo otra vez, ya que no vas a estar siempre con los batidos y los tes y al volver a comer despues de pasar hambre lo haces con ansiedad y engordas el doble de lo que tenias. Otro caso le dijeron que necesitaba perder cinco kilos y era un fideo y se ha quedado en una talla 36 y no le hacia falta la dieta, pero le cobraron una pasta por todo ello.<br>  Yo te recomiendo mucha agua, ejercicio como caminar, subir escaleras, bicicleta, etc comer sano y dormir ocho horas y dejate de batidos y tes que a saber cual es su composicion y si a largo plazo tendran complicaciones en tu organismo. A mi me espantan esas tiendas y aunque nunca he entrado en ellas con lo que me han contado ya me basta para no ir.|`|b7bfe78846f0edc2590687bbbd0daffdaa	no la he probado, pero conozco muchas personas que la han probado y dicen que es muy buen.<br>  <br>  suerte!!|`|hNuA3Ij1aa	Seria bueno que leas la informacion nutricional de cada producto y lo compares con lo recomendado diariamente, me parece muy poco lo que comes asi. Yo te recomendaria lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  - En la ma?ana empieza con un vaso de agua luego alguna fruta o ensalada para mejorar la digestion, la leche(uno o dos vasos max por la ma?ana) es buena opcion ya que da proteinas faciles de digerir y el contenido de grasas es bajo pero necesario, la propiedad del batido que tomas en mas que todo vitaminico y calorico. Es bueno pero es recomendable la leche para complementar la proteina y las verduras para el tracto intestinal.<br>  <br>  -A media ma?ana el agua muy bien ya que para medio dia debes haber tomado por lo menos 1 litro de agua(no todo de golpe) puedes comer un platano o una manzana que son energeticos, o si prefieres algunas frutas secas(evita las harinas)<br>  <br>  -Para la comida estoy de acuerdo come bien, respecto al postre, mientras no sean pasteles o algo con mucho azucar puedes comer(normalmente eso son los postres xD) si es posible como algo con proteinas(un huevo, queso, leche, soja, tofu, algo de carne de pescado o pollo evita carnes rojas muy amenudo)<br>  <br>  -Para el resto del dia estoy deacuerdo, claro que comiendo algo de arroz, frutas o algunas verduras para calmar el hambre iria bien, estas no engordan, aunque no se lo que lleve el Te, pero es facil de comprobar si ves la informacion nutricional.<br>  <br>  Me parece una buena dieta para la salud, pero si quieres bajar de peso vas a demorar a menos que....  TE EJERCITES ahi si bajas rapido con esa dieta.  Si quieres algo bueno debes esforzarte por ello, es una ley natural.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANTE: no excedas la dosis que el producto indica en el envase, por algo indica una cantidad al dia, mas podria ser perjudicial, no importa si los distribuidores te dicen que no hace da?o, ?no excedas!.  Algunas vitaminas suelen ser nocivas si tomas en exceso durante mucho tiempo, si tienes alergia o sufres de problemas renales o diabetis consulta un medico.|`|5f8Mb2C5aa	Hola, que yo sepa estos productos son buenos, pero...siempre hay un pero...<br>  yo los use durante un tiempo, son practicos porque te agilizan la preparación del desayuno y la cena que son basicamente el batido (muy rico si lo preparas con leche), en cuanto a que si son aburridos, no tanto, porque tu puedes comer al medio dia lo que gustes, siempre y cuando no te excedas con las grasas, al final de cuenta si tienes que seguir un régimen y no hay nada que sustituya una buena alimentación.<br>  Mi experiencia fue buena, pero ciertamente cuando los dejas de tomar vienen los kilitos poquito a poquito... y ademas no es muy recomendable mantener este régimen por mucho tiempo (dos o mas tratamientos consecutivos) Yo te recomendaría MEJOR una dieta balanceada que incluya mucha fruta, verdura y carnes blancas, atun y pescado y carne roja una vez a la semana, y por supuesto AGUA, dos litros al dia (tampoco excedas)...<br>  <br>  Recuerda que para lograr un cambio definitivo las dietas que te prometen mucho en muy poco tiempo son de desconfiar... CUIDATE y con determinación un poquito de esfuerzo y algo de tiempo podras disfrutar de un mejor cuerpo y sobre todo lograras mejorar tu salud y tu autoestima...ANIMO!|`|YQum8Snvaa	<a href="http://www.periodicotribuna.com.ar/Articulo.asp?Articulo=157" rel="nofollow">http://www.periodicotribuna.com.ar/Artic...</a><br>  <br>  INVESTIGACION SOBRE HERBALIFE.
u16ZplOiaa	lo más habitual es que la hepatitis haya sido provocada por uno de los siguientes tres virus:<br>  <br>  el virus de la hepatitis A <br>  el virus de la hepatitis B <br>  el virus de la hepatitis C <br>  En casos muy poco frecuentes, el virus Epstein Barr (que provoca la mononucleosis) también puede desencadenar una hepatitis porque puede provocar inflamación hepática. Hay otros virus y bacterias que también pueden provocar hepatitis, incluyendo los virus de las hepatitis D y E, el virus de la varicela y el citomegalovirus (CMV).<br>  <br>  ?Qué es la hepatitis A?<br>  En los ni?os, la forma de hepatitis más frecuente es la hepatitis A (también denominada hepatitis infecciosa). Este tipo de hepatitis está causado por el virus de la hepatitis A (VHA), que se encuentra en las heces de las personas infectadas. Las heces infectadas pueden estar presentes en peque?as cantidades en alimentos y objetos (desde el picaporte de una puerta hasta los pa?ales de un bebé).<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis A se contagia:<br>  <br>  Cuando alguien ingiere algo contaminado con heces infectadas por el VHA (esto facilita su transmisión en condiciones de hacinamiento e insalubridad). <br>  A través del agua, la leche y los alimentos contaminados, sobre todo el marisco. <br>  Puesto que la hepatitis A puede ser una infección leve, particularmente en la infancia, es posible que algunas personas no se den cuenta de que han contraído la enfermedad y ésta pase desapercibida y quede sin diagnosticar. De hecho, aunque las pruebas médicas indican que alrededor de un 40% de los norteamericanos que viven en medios urbanos han padecido la hepatitis A, sólo alrededor de un 5% recuerdan haber estado enfermos. A pesar de que el virus de la hepatitis puede provocar una enfermedad de larga duración (de hasta seis meses), generalmente sólo provoca enfermedades de corta duración y no es causa de enfermedad hepática crónica.<br>  <br>  ?Qué es la hepatitis B?<br>  La hepatitis B (también denominada hepatitis sérica) está causada por el virus de la hepatitis B (VHB). El VHB puede provocar un amplio abanico de síntomas, desde malestar general hasta enfermedad hepática crónica que, a la larga, puede desembocar en un cáncer de hígado.<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis B se contagia:<br>  <br>  A través de fluidos corporales infectados, como la sangre, la saliva, el semen, las secreciones vaginales, las lágrimas, la leche materna y la orina. <br>  Mediante transfusiones de sangre contaminada (lo que es muy poco frecuente en EE.UU.). <br>  Al compartir agujas o jeringuillas infectadas para inyectarse droga. <br>  Al mantener relaciones sexuales con una persona infectada por el VHB. <br>  Mediante el contagio de un recién nacido por su madre infectada. <br>  ?Qué es la hepatitis C?<br>  La hepatitis C se transmite a través del contacto directo con la sangre de una persona infectada. Los síntomas provocados por el virus de la hepatitis C pueden ser muy parecidos a los provocados por los virus de las hepatitis A y B. No obstante, la infección por el virus de la hepatitis C virus puede conducir, a la larga, a una enfermedad hepática crónica y es el principal motivo de transplante de hígado en EE.UU.<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis C se contagia:<br>  <br>  Al compartir agujas y jeringuillas para inyectarse droga. <br>  Al hacerse tatuajes o piercings con instrumental no esterilizado. <br>  Mediante transfusiones de sangre (especialmente antes de 1992; desde entonces, en EE.UU. se hacen controles sistemáticos de la sangre donada para detectar esta enfermedad). <br>  Mediante el contagio de un recién nacido por su madre infectada. <br>  A través de las relaciones sexuales (aunque se trata de una vía de contagio menos habitual). <br>  La hepatitis C es también un riesgo habitual en los centros de diálisis. Raramente las personas que conviven con un enfermo de hepatitis C se pueden contagiar al compartir artículos que pueden contener la sangre del enfermo, como maquinillas de afeitar o cepillos de dientes.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo se diagnostica la hepatitis?<br>  Todas estas formas víricas de hepatitis se pueden diagnosticar y puede hacerse un seguimiento de su tratamiento mediante análisis de sangre fiables y fácilmente accesibles.<br>  <br>  ?Cuáles son los signos y los síntomas de la hepatitis?<br>  La hepatitis, en sus primeras etapas, puede provocar síntomas parecidos a los de la gripe, como:<br>  <br>  malestar general <br>  fiebre <br>  dolores musculares <br>  pérdida del apetito <br>  náuseas <br>  vómitos <br>  diarrea <br>  ictericia -coloración amarillenta de la piel y de la esclerótica (blanco del ojo). <br>  No obstante, algunas personas no presentan ningún síntoma y ni siquiera saben que están infectadas. Por ejemplo, los ni?os con hepatitis A suelen presentar síntomas leves o ausencia total de síntomas.<br>  <br>  Si la hepatitis progresa, los síntomas comienzan a apuntar al hígado como origen de la enfermedad. Las sustancias químicas que segrega el hígado habitualmente empiezan a acumularse en la sangre, lo que provoca:<br>  <br>  ictericia <br>  mal aliento <br>  sabor amargo en la boca <br>  la orina se vuelve oscura o del color del té <br>  las heces se vuelven blancas, claras o del color de la arcilla. <br>  También puede haber dolor abdominal, concentrado bajo las costillas del lado derecho (sobre un hígado inflamado y dolorido) o bajo las costillas del lado izquierdo (sobre un bazo dolorido).<br>  <br>  ?Es contagiosa?<br>  Las hepatitis A, B y C son todas contagiosas.<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis A puede propagarse a través del agua o de alimentos contaminados, así como en escuelas o centros de preescolar con condiciones higiénicas deficientes. Los inodoros y los lavabos utilizados por una persona infectada deben limpiarse con desinfectantes. Quienes conviven con o cuidan de una persona con hepatitis deben lavarse las manos después de cada contacto que mantengan con el enfermo. Además, en caso de que su hijo vaya a emprender un viaje a un país con elevada incidencia de hepatitis A, deberá recibir por lo menos dos dosis de la vacuna contra la hepatitis A.<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis B se puede encontrar en prácticamente todos los fluidos corporales, si bien las vías principales de contagio son las relaciones sexuales, las transfusiones de sangre contaminada y las jeringuillas compartidas para administrase droga por vía intravenosa. El contacto en el medio familiar con adultos que padecen hepatitis B puede suponer un riesgo de contagio para un ni?o, riesgo que puede reducirse lavándose frecuentemente las manos y adoptando unas buenas prácticas higiénicas. En EE.UU. se vacuna sistemáticamente a todos los ni?os contra la hepatitis B al nacer, y la administración de esta vacuna permite reducir en gran medida la incidencia de esta infección. Pregunte a su pediatra sobre esta vacuna. Los adultos también se pueden vacunar si están en situación de riesgo.<br>  <br>  El virus de la hepatitis C se puede transmitir por medio de agujas compartidas, productos derivados de sangre contaminada y, menos frecuentemente, a través de las relaciones sexuales. A pesar de que la hepatitis C se puede transmitir al feto durante el embarazo, este riesgo no es muy alto (en torno al 5%). Si usted está embarazada, póngase en contacto con su médico si cree que puede haber estado expuesta al virus de la hepatitis C.<br>  <br>  Espero te sirva de algo--!!!!|`|b7bfe78846f0edc2590687bbbd0daffdaa	La palabra "hepatitis" significa, simplemente, inflamación del hígado, sin apuntar a ninguna causa específica. Una persona con hepatitis puede padecer uno o varios trastornos, incluyendo una infección vírica o bacteriana del hígado; presentar lesiones hepáticas provocadas por una toxina (una especie de veneno); presentar lesiones hepáticas provocadas por la interrupción de la irrigación sanguínea normal del hígado; padecer un trastorno autoinmunitario que afecta al hígado; haber sufrido un traumatismo abdominal en la zona del hígado. <br>  Pero lo más habitual es que la hepatitis haya sido provocada por uno de los siguientes tres virus: el virus de la hepatitis A, el virus de la hepatitis B, el virus de la hepatitis C.<br>  <br>  La hepatitis, en sus primeras etapas, puede provocar síntomas parecidos a los de la gripe, como: malestar general, fiebre, dolores musculares, pérdida del apetito, <br>  náuseas, vómitos, diarrea, ictericia -coloración amarillenta de la piel y de la esclerótica (blanco del ojo). <br>  <br>  No obstante, algunas personas no presentan ningún síntoma y ni siquiera saben que están infectadas.

It was school picture day and she had on a skirt it wasn't short but it wasn't real long. Anyway she had a skirt, heels, and a nice top on. The teacher was calling names to go to the board to correct these sentences that he had written. She got called up and was writing with the chalk when blood started running down her legs!!!!!! It was really gross and I felt so bad for her. The teacher was a male and he told her to go down to the nurses office and I went with her..

I was in the office in highschool waiting for the end of the day.  It doesn't matter why I was there.  I was sitting in some chairs by the door side by side with 4 of my girlfriends and 2 boys were near by.  My stomach started to hurt about 30 minutes before the bell.  I got up to go to the bathroom because I had a bad feeling.  I noticed when I got there that I had in fact began the hellweek...good thing I always had a pad BAD thing is I saw some blood on my pants so I pulled my shirt down.Halfway back to the office I was met by 2 of my friends one with a jacket because I had bled more than I thought.  They said my period had leaked onto the chair. I was soo embarrased...I mean "were they in there laughing" but I had to go in there and clean it up...didn't want to be gross.  So I did.  Funny thing is nobody seemed to act any different. Good thing my chair was BLACK and the rest were a very light beige!<br>  <br>  Hun that isn't even the worst story!

Frozen fruit is cheaper than fresh fruit, and with frozen fruit you get ice, which is an ingredient needed for smoothies to begin with! See here for some great recipes: <a href="http://www.smoothieweb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smoothieweb.com/</a><br>  <br>  You could always do the classic "orange juice and cereal," making sure the cereal is rich in fiber and wheat. Things like Raisin Bran, Frosted Wheats, and things with oats or muesli in them work really well.|`|WHNvnq0Jaa	Oatmeal!  Is this the same as porridge?

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	I've had that a couple of times. While you're sleeping, you're completely paralyzed. The "sinking" feeling is your muscles relaxing into that paralyzed state and feeling heavier just as you're about to fall asleep. <br>  <br>  The floating feeling is probably related to your mind starting to go into sleep mode. <br>  <br>  During this time, your mind is in hypnosis mode and very susceptible to instruction - which is great for telling your mind what you want to dream about. Your mind can plan out your schedule for tomorrow, solve a hard problem for you, or even act out your wildest fantasies while you're asleep - take advantage of being awake during this in-between state!|`|I013Wxkzaa	Uhh, no.

1wkG9rikaa	I had that- triggered by a running incident. I tried different therapies but ended up using this non-invasive cure and I have been pain free ever since. It is a method begun in Europe with a machine that sends current into the heal at different angles and breaks up the build up. In 6 - 8 months the pain was incrementally reduced and soon after totally gone. It was not cheap! It cost me $1,000 and insurance did not cover it.<br>  <br>  Lose the weight and that will help. Eat smaller meals no larger than a fist and the weight will come off. Leave the baked flour products alone and the chips and ice cream too. Be a Spartan about everything. In three months you will be proud. But get it on now and be happier and healthier.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	Well you can do isometric exercises until you feel better..squeezing muscles together even while sitting down helps build muscle tissue  Also taking chromium will help balance your blood sugar and help add muscle tissue and many people are deficient in it...<br>  <br>  This is an odd fact i learned a long time ago..they used to give people vinegar to get rid of spurs...so in case it works you can eat salads with oil an d vinegar or think of some other way to get vinegar in your body<br>  <br>  it is worth a try and that issue should be addressed first so that you can get back on your normal work out good luck<br>  <br>  here is a page also<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com/remedy/Plantar-Fascia-or-Plantar-Fasciitis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com/rem...</a>
IvoaNyN2aa	When you stand up from a sitting position slowly bend back ..this will force the muscles to let go..You might be having muscle spasms  If you lay down on the floor, you can put a small pillow in the small of your back  Get some aspercreme or myoflex..it is amazing how much this can help  Be sure to drink enough water and take calcium/magnesium as this helps stop pain and spasms<br>  <br>  If you have an infrared massager it is fantastic and if you use it today tomorrow you will feel better<br>  <br>  You can also get a sock and fill it with rice and microwave it and place this on your back where it is sore<br>  <br>  Sleep on your side with you r knees pulled up (fetal position) which will stretch your back all night<br>  <br>  Try pressing on your back and see if you feel better  If if is muscle spasms it will feel better...and you can get someone to push those areas for you , (or i sometimes use a small pencil  I put the eraser part on my back and lean into a chari)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|j7JSQVkuaa	that has happened to me as well, usually that could be caused by extra tension in the back muscles that are very tight, or you could have thrown it out of place in an awkward position. Now i know you probably don't want to schedule an appointment with your doctor, but i do recommend finding a chiropractor in your area, don't be too lazy to do this because if you want to help your back and keep it from hurting, plz go to a chiropractor i gaurantee satisfaction!|`|DpYMJT9Kaa	time to see the doctor my friend, don't mess around with the back believe me one of those things that need professional (non chiropractic) help.|`|D70hhBWUaa	see a doctor and it checked out|`|NE1iabLlaa	Well I play fastpitch/softball and a couple of weeks my center of my back starting hurting too.

Plus use icy hot pack and put a heating pad on your back. ever since ive done that my back hasnt hurt!|`|E1y0ZXvOaa	Hmm, your first option is going to a doctor. If you don't want to go through that try daily stretching. If you sit on a chair playing computures that is bad. Try getting a massage and stretch your lower back a lot. When I wake up my back hurts a lot and I stretch it until it makes a crack (don't do this often) but then it feels better. Hope that helps ;)|`|rxDEG6qyaa	do relieve the pain you should get a green cream called biofreeze. it numbs it (kinda like icy hott) but better. then go to the chiro because you probably have a unaligned bone in your spine. . .  it happends|`|934c7155e378982b71590e9eab4629e5aa	Haha well you have to be more specific like the exact location and what type of irritation but i recommend Chiropractic if you can because you do not want to risk your back|`|06hYEn3Taa	the shoes you are wearing are wearing out...they no longer are good enough to support your weight and body movements.

cnnu1IFtaa	Yes, the most common way to get rid of skin tags is to tie them off - ie. get a bit of thread and tie it round the base of the skin tag REALLY tightly (ie, it should bring tears to your eyes when you pull it tight). Over a few days this stops the blood supply getting to it - initially it will swell up, but then it will die, shrivel up and eventually fall of. It does take a little while though and can be quite painful. The other option is to go to the pharmacy and buy the new product you can get for warts to freeze them yourself at home, I can't remember what it's called, it costs about ￡10 or something around that. She can use that on the skin tags and it will work to get rid of them, although she may have to do a few applications before the tags go completely.|`|bsuZtAJIaa	If they have a thin connection to the skin, she can tie thread around the base tightly and leave it on till it drops off.

Surround him with things he loves and people who care about him to show him that if he did leave this world people will miss him.

Y0mNKg1oaa	Hello Annie! I admire your courage of letting us know your dental problem, there are better solutions for you to follow and I hope you will be able to follow them diligently. Good personal oral hygiene is a must to solve your problem.First and foremost is your brushing technique. You need to brush your teeth, tongue and gums 3X daily not just 2X a day plus rinsing or mouth gargle with a lot of water in between meals(every after taking your snacks) to wash away food stuffs when you snacked. I also recommend a "tongue scraper" to scrape your tongue coz brushing alone cannot remove food debris that lodged on the rugaes of your tongue or the rough portion of it. You can inquire from your dentist about this Scraper, Ex. a product from Discus Dental. Flosing every after brushing is also a must. Antiseptic mouthwashes 3x a day like chlorhexetidine or betadine oral gargle is also available.<br>  <br>  After doing all these and still stinks, a visit to your dentist is a must. You probably need Oral prophylaxis(cleaning) because there are stuffs in your mouth that cannot be removed by the usual brushing, we call it "calcular deposits" or the hardened tartars at the back and maybe sorrounding your teeth which causes swelling of the gum (gingivitis), it can only be removed by a special dental instrument. Pile of such deposits causes the smell too. Or perhaps you have cavities on your teeth you may not noticed because they don't bother you yet. Food debris lodged on cavities causes terrible smell so fillings is/are needed. Hopefully. you don't have dentures, retainers and other mouth appliances yet, because failure to clean them well also contribute bad smell. Stomach problems, like ulcer is also a factor but I hope you don't have this.<br>  <br>  With regards to your health eat a well  balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables,and  drink plenty of water too.You can also ask you dentist to expound on this Avoid too much spicy foods, they are good contributing factor to a breath that stinks... but in fairness to those who love spicy foods, a good personal oral hygiene is recommended as mentioned earlier. I'm glad if I enlightened you on this aspect. Don't worry you are not alone having this kind of problem others may even have the worst scenario. God Speed!!!<br>   <br>  |`|V7lrdiRKaa	Mom knows best. If she says that it stinks you can be pretty sure that it does.<br>  I have some questions for you.<br>  How old are you?<br>  When was the last time you went to the dentist?<br>  <br>  If you are a child, your parents are responsible for taking you to the dentist for routine oral health exams and tooth cleanings. This is the major way to avoid bad breath. That and regular brushing and flossing at home.<br>  <br>  If you are an adult, you are responsible for your own dental health.<br>  <br>  Brush and floss daily after every meal. If your gums are bleeding, brush those areas longer... not harder. They need better cleaning and stimulation.<br>  <br>  Mouth wash can mask the problem but not clear up the cause.<br>  <br>  Most importantly... go to the dentist and have your teeth checked. A rotten tooth can cause horrible bad breath that no amount of brushing will clear up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  |`|3T5unftOaa	I am a dentist and I can tell you what most people fail at.<br>  The tongue!<br>  Scrap your tongue at least once a day, before you to go sleep. It might cause you to gag at the beginning but once you get used to it you will feel the difference.<br>  <br>  Of course you also need to brush your teeth well for good 3-5 minutes twice a day at least, but you also need to floss between your teeth a that is where food get trapped often.<br>  But most people forget about the tongue.<br>  <br>  Also... avoid alcohol-based mouth washes.. they cause your mouth to get dry and that's where bacteria grow and cause a bad breath..<br>  <br>  If all that don't work, check with an ENT doctor.. maybe you have sinus/nose problems leading to some bad-smelling secretions at the back of your throat causing you a bad breath..<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|msTlp2Uoaa	This is easy to answer. first, think, did you eat anything that might make your breath smell. Then secondly- brush your teeth. If this doeant work, maybe buy breath sprays, tic tacs or listorine. Heres atip to check if your breath smells, it usually works. NOw- this might sound gross- but if you lick your hand and then smell it, you can usually smell if your breaths bad. Hope this info helps, catch ya l8r.|`|34RAVe9Oaa	Fist off-BRUSH YOUR TEETH!!!!!!!! and I dont mean for like 10 seconds, for two solid minutes brush, then floss every single tooth (thi stakes the longest) and then mouth wash. I would reccommend doing this 3 times a day, or atleast 2. Then get those listerine sheet packets and pop one of those whenever u fell "stinky"|`|OCk7I8JVaa	visit your dentist. could be gingivitis or something.<br>  also, brush your tongue with your toothbrush too.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Are you flossing everyday?  Because there is a certain odor to your breath when one doesn't floss...  Also, brush regularly and maybe even keep a small bottle of mouthwash with you in your purse to use every so often.  But flossing could be the key here.  Good luck!|`|hXO7xKkVaa	It can be because of several reasons.<br>  <br>  the things u can do easily is brush ur teeth twice a day.if possible sensodyne tooth paste and use mouth wash too two times.most probably it will help u.<br>  <br>  if the problem still there consult doctor..coz its may be coz of digestion reasons,throat infections, or even placks n ur teeth..etc

JeMlxa0Zaa	sometimes having soda is bad for you in the first place. If I don't need it then I don't drink it unless I want to spoil myself but it is not that often. Sodas do have a high amount of calories and sodium so it will make you retain water. And I don't know if you heard but they found out that diet sodas don't work  they actually have the opposite effect. Try replacing them for awhile (like a month) and if you loose weight then you have found your problem.<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|baAWBgXVaa	yes|`|AA11130603	I think you already know the answer.

Look for foods with alot of carbs such as bread (pizza, hawaiian sweet rolls, whole wheat, flour,) Also, noodles/pasta like spaghetti & fetachini alfredo, etc. Pretty much anything with bread and pasta will help. Also the frozen food section but those tend to make you tired because they lack nutritional value. There are also carb drinks from the local nutrition store. |`|vvP7njBgaa	McDonalds|`|sRc5MFMfaa	You need to be happy then you will start eating.....sometimes stress causes weight lose or weight gain. food is your solution. your body needs fat and only way that will happen is when you eat alot.|`|c97e4f0bb05bd60a0b9e36d01fc511dfaa	buy some protein shake powder. will make u gain weight since u wont be working out.
QcDN1Bizaa	hey honey!! the brown discharge is your period!!!! the first few times you get your period, it will just be a really dark brown discharge, and after a few months it will develop into red blood!! so you have started :) and i would say use pads for now, but once you've had a few periods of red blood start using tampons! good luck :) x|`|7tpAq9eWaa	I started cramps about year before starting my period.<br>  And I started discharge about that time, too.<br>  Discharge means you've started ovulating, but the hormones which tell you to shed the uterus lining aren't active yet.<br>  The brown discharge is old blood, meaning your periods are close - the uterus wall is shedding, but not much.<br>  You should tell your mom, it's fine, and she probably will give you "the talk", but that'll be done then. She will have it off her chest and you can both check it off the to do list.<br>  Tampons or pads - I still haven't figured out tampons, but I wish I could. The first couple of times I would go for pads, but for swimming/physical exercise tampons are better, if you can work them. Some people can use them straight away...lucky!<br>  Anyway, good luck! :)|`|bHULLaAPaa	The brown discharge IS your period.  It's older blood, and it's brown.  As you have more periods, the blood flow will be heaver and turn red.  Congrats!<br>  <br>  It might be a good time for your first visit to a gynecologist, not necessarily for an exam, but as a first visit to learn more about yoru periods, and to also get used to the idea of having a gynecologist.|`|VwnLufUAaa	Why are you scared to tell you mom? She's been through this, so she knows exactly what it's all about. I'm sure she's been expecting you to get your period soon, so it shouldn't be any kind of a surprise to her. It's nothing to be ashamed of; what you're going through is completely normal.<br>  <br>  Just say, "mom, I'm getting my period and it's really freaking me out." Or something like that.<br>  <br>  If you really, really can't talk to your mom, is there another older woman you feel comfortable talking to? Maybe an aunt or an older sister or cousin? Maybe a teacher or counselor at school?<br>  <br>  Tampons are definitely better, but when you're just starting out it might be best for you to use pads until you're more comfortable with what's going on with your body. Tampons are a bit more complicated, but pads are easy.<br>  <br>  To help with the pain, put a heating pad on your tummy and take some ibuprofen (advil, motrin) or tylenol (acetaminophen). A nice, hot bath will make you feel better too. <br>  <br>  Relax; you're going through the normal process that all women go through. I remember being terrified to tell my mom, too, as if I was the first girl in the world to get my period. My mom was not an understanding person at all, but even she understood what was going on with me. Your mom will too.|`|f4HTiv17aa	don't worry that's completely normal i didn't start that long ago (I'm 13) but I started puberty when I was about 11. All ways use pads with wings and start off with pads to but if you do use tampons use one's with aplicators. The best pads to use are bodyform. You'll proberly start soon.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  get one of those tins to put the pads in really usefull even when your not on your period|`|A6R7yg9Kaa	Personally, I don't think you should use tampons. I think you're too young for them. No offense, it's just that you shouldn't be inserting anything into your vagina at such a young age. Anyway, a pad would be the best bet for you. <br>  Also, maybe you should talk to you mom about it. You may have something going on down there that needs to be checked out by a doctor. Good luck, and remember you're not alone. All of us women have to go through it too. |`|LgNL79q1aa	Pads are the best to start out with. You poor thing I feel for you. I wish you could feel free to talk to your mum but I know sometimes that is hard to do. All this is the normal thing for us girls. Pads will keep cramping from not being so bad(if you even get those). I remember when this happened to me a million years ago. My back hurt and I felt like I had to take a poop. I could not talk to my mom but I had a Auntie who really was cool and I could run whatever I wanted by her without feeling stupid. Your body is just getting ready for a change and sometimes it takes it's time. All your hormones are changing and that makes for sore boobs, weird discharge, back aches, zits and a lot of other strange changes in the body. If you can find a older relative or friend that you can feel ok to talk with about things then that will help you to have a person to talk to just like I had with my Auntie. Maybe you can try to sit down and talk to your mum maybe she will surprise you. You are ok and this is all normal. I know that where I live a girl over the age of 14 can talk to any health care professional about this kind of thing and the pro. can not tell anyone what they talked about. This is the law here in Washington State. Maybe the law is the same for you where you live. Call a clinic and ask them. You can also talk to a nurse over the phone about any questions you have. See you are not alone dear! Good Luck! You Go Girl!
7tpAq9eWaa	You could be pregnant - pregnancy tests aren't always reliable.<br>  Get checked by your doctor, have a blood test, because it could also be an STD, but I don't know exactly. Just get checked because it's not normal. Good luck :)|`|sxqUt49xaa	go see you gyno!!!!!!!!!!|`|sCJnNeYWaa	Well I'm not a doctor but every answer helps right? Where as you took two pregnancy tests(both neg)  i would say not pregnant or maybe wait longer to see if your period doesn't actually show up before taking a test. Unfortunately all these symptoms are connected to having your period and that's when people get nervous. If you are still pretty convinced you might be pregnant go to your doctor. After all they do know best.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. your pee being dark color and stinky is usually a sign of being dehydrated.|`|r9Ztl8rfaa	yes possibly, because the home test really dont work until you miss your period, if you dont have it within a week, take another and if its neg. go to doctor to get blood test. oh and have you ate asperegus lately because it makes urine smell horrible. nipples can be sore all the time, esp when youre about to start.<br>  good luck.|`|bHULLaAPaa	It is possible.  I recommend you go see your doctor ASAP though.  Back pain sometimes indicates a troubled pregnancy.  You also want a blood test to know for sure, and you also want to rule out kidney infection of ovarian cyst or other problems.|`|ZLJN8VXOaa	I'd say no since you've taken the test twice. you may have an STD.<br>  <br>  I'd go see a doctor for a second opinion.|`|cLiIp5Qjaa	it is possible, you'll have to wait until at least the day of your missed period, sometimes longer - you could get a blood test at your dr's office - but you'll probably have to wait|`|WRBsoFSjaa	you could be pregnant.some test won't work if you arn't a week late yet.and if you drink a lot of liquids it can give you a false negitive.|`|HpkwQIGjaa	you could be but sorry, there is a greater chance that you are not. two false negatives are rare.

I then went too far and became anorexic then bulimic (in that order!).  Nowadays I'm a more than healthy weight, thanks to friends and activities that require that I keep in shape.  Oh and being a goth, if I put too much weight on, my rubber t-shirt and PVC jeans are going to look awful!|`|2zGKZB6gaa	I knew I was getting kinda heavy but then my ex started seeing a girl who was super thin compared to me and it got me thinking that maybe if I wasn't so sloppy he'd never had gone looking for someone else.
7tpAq9eWaa	Regular is when the period lasts 3-5 days, and the flow is regular and not annoyingly heavy.<br>  Heavy is when you also get little lumps (which are just pieces of uterus lining) and generally you have to change your pad...a lot.<br>  Best way to check is to wear the pads and see how many times you gotta change it. And how fast it gets full and whatnot. Coz with pads you can see it, which can be a good thing..|`|JUvVUlq8aa	<br>  <br>  <br>  heavy - when you have quite a lot of blood in your pad meaning you need to change the pad before the regular 3-4 hours.<br>  regular - you only have to change every 3-4 hours<br>  Hope i helped.|`|4n3eAwlfaa	well when your flow is enough that it goes through and u are having to wear more than one pad than that's heavy. u may have blood saks or larger amounts of blood.<br>  regular is when its not overly excessive and is just doable for i pad|`|op0PfURUaa	When you use a pad and you have to change every 3 to 4 hours then that's regular... but if you have to change every 30 minutes or 1 hour then that's heavy.
XhJL7tnwaa	You lost the water weight. Please do not continue on this diet, it is not safe for your body in the long run. After losing the water weight, your body will go burn off fat, then muscle. Eventually it will start to eat away at the rest of your organs.|`|Gslf19Uvaa	you need to eat more. in the long run, you'll end up gaining because everything that your body does that will be stored as fat..because when you do what you do, your body goes into "survival mode". <br>  water is good, but you cant use it as a total meal replacement. you still need tons of other nutrients. theres a difference in eating healthy and not eating. you're barely eating. try this:<br>  breakfast-<br>  bowl of oatmeal<br>  serving of fruit<br>  cup of low/non fat yogurt<br>  glass of milk<br>  <br>  snack-<br>  serving of fruit or cheese<br>  <br>  lunch- <br>  turkey sandwich w/ veggies on a grain bread<br>  baked lays<br>  water<br>  fruit<br>  <br>  dinner-<br>  lean meat<br>  steamed veggies<br>  cup. brown rice|`|Gem96NQyaa	Fasting like that will generally make you lose weight.

Thus, it was water weight. <br>  <br>  Try eating:<br>  <br>  Whole grain only (no white bread), cut out snacks such as chips, soda or candy bars, cut out all fast food, eat plenty of veggies and fruits.  Also, eat small portions and try to workout 3-5 times a week |`|HJh0BeQmaa	like the other person said, it could just be because you didnt eat anything fattening cuz fruit is healthy and water does like nothing and the cheer dances get your heart rate up causing you to burn calories<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081109170759AAuGlhq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|tQwytkZuaa	It was probably just water weight.

Good luck!|`|x0jbfxl3aa	I hate running too.  I just think my body was not made for it.  I do really like aerobic dance classes though, they are lost of fun.

kuaxZxataa	Ok, first of all, you're right.  The WISC-III is no longer used, it is the WISC-IV that is used for 6-16 year olds.  Right now, if your friend wanted to take an IQ test he would take the WAIS-III which is the current adult version, though they are putting out a WAIS-IV soon.  If he had poor fine motor skills at the age of 12 when he took the test, it would definitly affect his Performance IQ.  While IQ tends to be fairly stable, there are definitely things that affect the person on the specific day they are tested.  The only way to know what your friend's current IQ is, is to take the WAIS-III (or WAIS-IV depending on if you can get a new one)<br>  Tell him not to freak out or be torn up.|`|5gzyAWRHaa	Depression can impact how a person performs.

My son is now 14 and absent minded like you would not believe...sometimes you have to slow down in some parts to grow in others..its all about "growing up" and really our bodies, our chemistry, our brains absorb too much..or too little...might be a happenstance so to speak. <br>  Having a high IQ is NOT the be all and end all.

I know, but medically, there is skin hanging on either side, that's the skin that was until now closed over your vagina. If it's like down, all gross and stuff, then yeah, congrats and welcome to the club! |`|DBrNaYNyaa	Congrats, welcome to the horrible world of periods :)|`|PnHcsa47aa	Yes you did.

GV9x7UvGaa	Haha, I'm not THAT addicted, I've always been a HUGE ice fan. Although ever since we bought our new fridge that dispenses ice I just HAVE to put it in every drink I have. No beverage can be below chilled now haha!<br>  <br>  Being addicted to ice does remind me of that Jerry Springer episode where people had creepy fetishes and one guy had a fetish with ice sculptures and he tried to make love to the ice swan. Then he went on the show and groped a Jerry Springer ice sculpture - it was ridiculously hilarious.|`|Jeh9NbY7aa	To ice?  I've never heard of such a thing!  I am addicted to a few things, but not ice.  It sounds like an easy habit to break though....   Hey kid, do you know what's a really hard addiction to kick?   Chocolate is one.  Some others are:  Amputee porn, asian college girls gone wild, Nick at night and pastel leg warmers.  These require 12 step programs and such.|`|413cfb7eef158b727cd15e4e110059a4aa	I love to eat ice. in fact I asked basically the same question on here and what I was told was it indicates a lack of iron in your body.|`|7ck7boGhaa	I totaly understand but if it's big cubes it really bad for your teeth.

Pagophagia is a form of pica involving the compulsive consumption of ice or iced drinks. It has been shown to respond to iron supplementation, leading some investigators to postulate that pica is the result, not the cause, of nutritional deficiency.|`|JT6sZE6xaa	I love ice!!! I dont eat it as much as you...not 12 trays a day!!! But i do love it! It drives my mom crazy though...it ruins my teeth! haha|`|rqwXqmyTaa	My Aunt is the same way, and come to find out she is anemic, which is a sign of it.  She would just fill a glass with ice and just eat it through out the day, at least 3 or 4 glasses full.  I don't know if that is an old wives tale, about having low iron, but I have heard it a few different times, when your iron is low, you crave ice.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	it can mean an iron deficiency|`|WgomxNOOaa	only during the summer time|`|l0FPw0LVaa	oh ok well then the answer is no

4M2Yg5wlaa	Connor,<br>  <br>  This sounds like it could be a cyst.  More specifically what is called an epidermal cyst.  These growths result from the skin pocketing in on itself and forming a little sac underneath the skin.  They can fill up with dead skin and grow to pretty large sizes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, the sac will break on the inside and this will cause the area to become very red, tender and it can get even larger.  When this happens, it may drain and a cheesy like material can come out sometimes mixed with blood and even pus.  As these start to heal they can form a darker tip that may be dried blood.<br>  <br>  This is a photo of an example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_t9wh2ivze9E/Rm3LbE9HzgI/AAAAAAAABwI/ga21u61Bi_I/sebacious-cyst.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lh5.ggpht.com/_t9wh2ivze9E/Rm3LbE...</a><br>  <br>  These cysts can occasionally become infected and require further drainage.  It may be best to have the area checked by a doctor as they can assess for the infection.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Gaseous bloating may be a consequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insufflation of air. In some animals, like cats, dogs and cattle, gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.<br>  <br>  Bloating from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is of unknown origin but often results from an insult to the gut, and as such can overlap with infective diarrhea, celiac, and inflammatory bowel diseases. IBS is a brain-gut dysfunction that causes visceral hypersensitivity and results in bloating in association with recurrent diarrhea (or constipation) and abdominal pain. While there is no direct treatment for the underlying pathology of IBS, the symptom of bloating can be well managed through dietary changes that prevent the over-reaction of the gastrocolic reflex. Having soluble fiber foods and supplements, substituting dairy with soy or rice products, being careful with fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in insoluble fiber, and eating regular small amounts can all help to lessen the symptoms of IBS (Van Vorous 2000). Foods and beverages to be avoided or minimized include red meat, oily, fatty and fried products, dairy (even when there is no lactose intolerance), solid chocolate, coffee (regular and decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated beverages, especially those also containing sorbitol, and artificial sweeteners (Van Vorous 2000).|`|0QQOoBChaa	Im no woman, but I would watch your sodium and carb in-take...those 2 alone make your body crave water, not to mention sodium helps retain the water in your body and give you a "full/bloated" feeling.

e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	it depends on if the allergic rash was hives (like mosquito bites that come and go) or eczema (dry, scaly patches that get worse with itching and last several days.) Either way, the itching and rash will flare up for several days whenever they get warm and toasty, like in a hot shower, with exercise or warm and cozy in bed.    Keep cool and take an antihistamine regularly for a week or two. Over the counter Zyrtec used every single day works well.    expect the rash to improve a little each day, and hopefully be gone in a week or two.    a board-certified Allergist can help you figure out what may have caused the reaction so you don't have to go through this again.    good luck!|`|G3TEO6C7aa	Hives should go away over night.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Depends- if you are taking the combined pill, then this is fine to do, with the combined contraceptive pill you can actually miss one or two pills anywhere in the pack and still be protected against pregnancy. You just need to take the one you missed as soon as possible.    If you are taking the POP (Progestogen only pill or Mini pill) then this is not OK to do. The POP has a narrow efficacy window, you cannot take the pill more than 3-4 hours late, 12 if taking Cerazette.    If in doubt, use additional contraceptive for a full 7 days before relying on the pill again for contraceptive cover.    Also, with the combined pill, if you are a day late taking it after your 7 day break -  you are not covered. If you miss more than one pill in the week before your pill free week then you should skip the 7 day break and take the next pack immediately.|`|pD329JO2aa	yes its fine  x|`|cyr1ePdpaa	Take the one youve missed as soon as you realise!|`|17d0a45dba67f1a95da2039089ea2176aa	next time take it as soon as u remember even if it meens taking 2 pills in one day unless its almost time for your next pill in witch case just carry on as normal thats what my gp said anyway. it should say in your booklet u get with em what to do

SwXD8uCoaa	Do you have the same symptoms? Perhaps the bacteria wasn't completely killed with your last medication, thus a need for more or continuous medication.<br>  <br>  By the way, suggest a H.Pylori Determination Test just to be sure.  If the lab test would prove it positive, then it's a recurring problem and you need to be completely healed this time to be sure.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Have them do another blood test to be sure the bacteria infection is gone - it's a tough one to get rid of and takes several weeks of antibiotics - not just one.  It takes quite awhile for an ulcer to develop from H Pylori so I'm guessing it's not cleared up quite yet.  I'd also keep up with the Nexium in the meantime.|`|8xB1Kfc9aa	Sometimes the cure for H Pylori does not work first time.  A pal of mine had to repeat the treatment. Then it worked fine.

3urQfMffaa	I have a different type of anger attacks. it's mostly ppl who piss me off, but I never admitted my anger was a problem. I blamed them for "triggering" me whenever I lose my temper. I even admired my anger bc it made me look "assertive." During grade school, I got into fist fights. Since then, it's only physically assaulting objects and cursing people out. I only realized how debilitating my anger became on my life after I got fired from my job for verbally abusing a coworker and punching the pole in the fitting room. Now I'm seeking counseling and taking meds and reading anger mgt books. Maybe that would help you as well.|`|oojO4WAraa	Craziness or anger attacks is a good phrase.  You should either get some anger management counseling or go to the book store and get some books on anger management.  I had a problem with anger and got about $45.00 wworth of books and it changed my life - for the better.       I understand what you are saying about noise being irritating.  It used to bother me a lot.  The books really helped me learn new ways to deal with my anger.    Exercise helped me a lot also.  Because a lot of times people don't get enough exercise and all that excess energy gets used to be irritable.  Try walking or riding a bike 30-60 minutes a day and see if that helps.    Good luck.  I hope you find answers that will help you.|`|Z9360MMxaa	I used to get anger urges like this when I was growing up. There is probably some underlying issue you need to resolve.

My solution has been to keep a pair or two of ear plugs in my purse and use them when I need to.  We can't stop the noise around us so this is what I did and it made a world of difference for me.

FQ046dIsaa	Stop eating processed foods.  Stay away from soda. that stuff is crap.    eat natural veggies and fruit and try not to eat much red meat. fish is better. Once you get real nutrition into your body you won't feel hungary.     people overeat because processed "food" has little nutrition.    don't eat a large amount all at once. you can eat several times a day as long as it's small portions.    and exercise will help you get muscle which burns fuel. keep your body healthy and it will work better.|`|SpcYCBndaa	just be happy wtih what u have|`|2q1XI0j9aa	To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|nukcYkR9aa	* run everyday.  * DO NOT change your diet because that might lead to anorexia|`|9wGz6ySNaa	Me too. I'm 5'5 and 135. =(|`|G3TEO6C7aa	Portion control. Eat half of what you would usually eat.   Say you are having dinner, a plate of spaghetti and now you're eating a full plate or 2 plates. Eat 3/4 or half.. but make sure you're eating enough. You don't want to be hungry and that could turn into an eating disorder.  And also, the only other thing I can say is to just not go for seconds all the time and cut back on the sweets and fattie foods.    If you're looking for a calorie number, around 1200 calories a day should be sufficient if you don't participate in any physical activity. If you are active, however, you should be eating 1400-1600 per day.|`|AJeaWX8Paa	First, 135 is a pretty normal weight for a girl your height.  However, if you want to trim down, here are some tips:    1) Eat breakfast.  It is really important to get your metabolism up and running as soon as possible when you wake up.    2) Eat small meals all throughout the day.  6 meals is a popular number.  Again, you burn calories by keeping your metabolism humming along.  DO NOT go hungry.  Not only is it unhealthy but counterproductive to what you want to do.  If you skip meals your metabolism will go into 'starvation' mode and slow down, burning calories less efficiently.    3)  Add some cardio.  Start of slow at first if you're not used to exercising.  Jogging, swimming, walking briskly or bike riding are all good things to do.  Shoot for at least 20 min a day if you have the time.  Listen to your body, if you start to feel pain (muscle soreness is natural) in your joints or tendons, slow down a bit.    4)  Do some weight training if you can.  Building a bit of muscle makes you burn calories more quickly as well.  Using light weights with a lot of repetitions will tone you up and won't make you look bulky (this is hard to do anyway).  Lunges, squats, push ups, etc could be good.    5)  Cut down on the number of calories you take in.  Lean meats, fruits, vegetables and whole grain are the best things to eat.    6)  Most importantly, find ways to have fun with it.  Take part in exercises that you like.  Sports or games that get you moving are fun and can be great workouts.  Get a nice mix of music to listen to while you work out or if you have an iphone or something get some videos you can engross yourself in while you work out.

Don't have seconds, cut out sweets (artificial sweeteners, diet coke, sodas, etc) and eat as much whole foods as you can, meaning the things you eat shouldn't have been processed.     Here's a link : http://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitnes...     You can choose one of the three healthy diets proposed there, preferably choose the second one.|`|8ss15aSOaa	At your age it's very important to consult a professional because your body is still growing.     That being said losing weight has 2 components:  Diet and exercise.  One without the other isn't going to do much.  The recommended amount of exercise (from what I remember) is 30 min of activity, 4 days a week.  This can be jogging, playing basketball, or whatever gets your heart rate up.  Diet is really tricky as you need to find a mix that is both healthy and tolerable.  I suggest you consult your doctor to get specifics.|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	I would not start counting calories and such yet! 16 is not a good age to do that... no offense meant, I was 16 once too and I know how easy it is to go from "interested" in my weight to "obsessed"!     Cut out pop- and don't just switch to diet! If you drink a lot of pop/ eat a lot of candy you'd be amazed at how much you'll lose by cutting it down to 1-2 cans a week instead of 1-2 a day! Order a salad instead of french fries, use whole wheat instead of white bread- it's the little things that really make or break it!  Also, try going to exercisetv.tv,  there are tons of great videos there, and most of them are nice and short- 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and you'll feel like a million bucks! (For sure try Pilates, maybe a little yoga, Carmen Electra's stuff and the Girls Next Door vids are on there too- they're so fun!)    Good luck!|`|iQJuEtH2aa	Read this book ....

I just do the outside, if you know what I mean, so there is just a little hair in like an upside down "u" shape.  It won't hurt, but you sometimes get razor stubble, which absolutely suck... the best way to avoid that is make sure you are shaving with your hair, like you sand would with the grain- shave with your hair, if you understand that.  it won't get rid of all stubble but it does help|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	WHAT EVER YOU DO NOT SHAVE!!!

Try shaving a little section to see how you feel about it. That way you know for sure and can choose either way. If you decide it's not what you want to do then it should grow back pretty quick but at least you will know without having to shave all of it at once. I agree though with NOT using any Nair at the moment. It could be very painful although everyone is different.

fFD3cYGJaa	Here are 7 tips that can help you get rid of acne fast:      Never pop or squeeze your pimples. I know it's very tempting to pick at your spots, but if you do it the bacteria will spread all over your face causing a severe breakout and possibly permanent scarring.   Consume more fruits and vegetables. Your diet is a very important factor, if you want to cure pimples. Fruits and vegetables can help you eliminate one of the main causes of this skin condition: the buildup of toxins.   Use a gentle cleanser. Wash you face with a soap for sensitive skin and always be gentle. Don't wash your face too often or scrub it too hard, because you will make your condition worse.   Drink plenty of water every day. Drinking at least 8 glasses of water each day, will help your body to get rid of unwanted toxins and prevent blemishes.   Choose the right makeup. Don't use oil based makeup because it will clog the pores and cause more breakouts. The same thing applies to oil-based sunscreens and concealers.   Don't touch your face too much: many acne sufferers make this mistake. You should always clean your hands thoroughly before touching your face to avoid spreading any bacteria.   Apply homemade remedies: there are many effective homemade remedies that can help you fight pimples. For example applying an ice-pack over a zit can reduce the swelling and the redness. Also tea tree oil, tomato pulp, ginger and salted water can be very effective.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.

Your body is going to change so much over the next years.  You should make sure that you are consuming enough calories.  The more you work out, the more energy (calories) your body needs.  If you starve your body of that it will go into starvation mode, which means it will hold onto the fat.  <br>  <br>  However, without knowing exactly how many calories you are consuming and how many calories you are burning during your workouts, it is kind of hard to say.<br>  <br>  As for the bump, unfortunately not EVERYBODY can have the exact body that they want regardless of how much the work out and how healthy they eat.  Some things are just about genetics and having a "bump" at your lower abdomen is very common amongst healthy girls.
tMtBe1lKaa	Don't focus on it, it's okay. I've seen alot of women with that. My mom used to call it a bread pouch. she said that's what you get when you're eating mainly bread or flour products and not enough fruits and veg. It will also probably come and go with periods. Just don't worry about it though, if you feel healthy and have healthy habits, that's what counts. Don't try to be those air brushed perfectionists that you see all the time on TV and in magazines. they really aren't real. Just be happy with who you are and what you can offer the world.

Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|V4iZcrVmaa	I THINK ITS FINE|`|YaqrCqN2aa	I used everything to lose weight, and nothing worked until I used acai berry.

RofOwl2Jaa	okay, well working out isnt the only thing you have to do to get that dream body... you have to eat right as well!!! 5-6 small meals a day!!! and NEVER EVER EVER skip breakfast, it slows down ur metabolism if you do. <br>  <br>  now, i learned some crunches that could help you:<br>  <br>  oblique crunches- lay on your side and then press you back to the floor while you legs are still turned to the side, then curl you knees up about half way and put your arms behind your head. then throw your arms up and touch your toes. do as many reps as you feel comfortable with, right and left sides.<br>  <br>  running crunch- get in a position that you would be in for a normal crunch, but instead of going straight up and keeping you feet on the ground, take your left elbow and touch it to your right knee, move your right knee up while you are moving your left elbow to your knee. do the same for the other side, but only do one rep on each side at a time, so you have a somewhat running kind of thing going on.<br>  <br>  crossed legged crunch- take your right leg and cross it over your left leg so that your ankle is the point of cross. (you are in the normal crunch form to start with) then take your left elbow and touch it to your right leg, do as many reps as you feel comfrotable, do the same on the other side.<br>  <br>  toe touches- lay on your back, then put your legs in the air and flex your toes. put your arms behind your head and throw them up and touch your toes. do as many reps  as you feel comfortable...<br>  <br>  email me for more crunches|`|lmHBKBxYaa	The only way to get that well defined V shape is to have ridiculously low body fat percentage.

EQAwlKZ5aa	I completely understand, I have stretch marks and I never gained weight rapidly. I am sorry to tell you that there is no cure for stretch marks. You can only prevent stretch marks. Although some people claim that rubbing vitamin E oil will help them fade. I don't know if this is true, but I doubt it. Other people say creams with cocoa butter and/or shea butter help with stretch marks. <br>  My advice is to always moisturize your skin to prevent new stretch marks. Focus on your biceps, your thighs, your stomach and any area that you are focusing on during your training.<br>  Good luck!|`|6RdbSffIaa	Hmm I have stretch marks on my stomach from gaining too much weight too fast like a year and a bit ago, and some exactly where you have them, but that's because my shoulders broadened.

YSbCVt3Uaa	Stress and hormones are the main culprits of acne flair ups. Your hormones are probably not as stable as it had been in the past. <br>  <br>  Some home remedies that work to cleanse and heal acne: <br>  <br>  For Acne: Exfoliate your face with baking soda. Splash warm water on your face. Put a little baking soda in your palm and run it under the water until it turns into a paste then scrub your face with the paste. Rinse off with warm water. The salt does three things. It exfoliates dead skin, opens clogged pores, and heals and dries acne. You can buy baking soda from the grocery store. It is found in the baking aisle. <br>  <br>  For Acne: Use extra virgin coconut oil as a moisturizer at night. Put the coconut oil all over your face. If the coconut smell is too strong for you. Rinse your face with warm water. However, do so gently as you don't want all of the oil to come off. Then pat your face dry. Sleep with the coconut oil on your face. In the morning wash your face as normal. Coconut oil does not clog pores. It does the following to help cure acne:  Extra virgin coconut oil has many vitamins that is good for the skin, your skin will actually aborb the oil overnight, the oil also acts as a protective barrier when placed on the skin, it heals any skin condition quickly. You can find extra virgin coconut oil at a health food store or at the vitamine shoppe. Note: only buy the extra virgin coconut oil which is cold pressed and retains the vitamins from the coconut. Coconut oils that don't say extra virgin have been refined and all of the vitamins are cooked out of it. <br>  <br>  This stuff really works. The best part is that it is all natural and you can buy both for about $15. It will last at least a month if not two. <br>  <br>  I use coconut oil as a moisturizer. I appy it to my face, hands, arms, and legs while in the shower. Then rinse the top layer off and pat my skin dry. It is a great moisturizer and sunscreen as well.|`|XhwxmP7vaa	our body changes every 7 yrs..so eat healthy, drink lots of water and try to stick a fitness program.|`|GbzxnGcIaa	Obviously,stress could initiate breakouts at the first place but there are several factors that could also cause acne.For example,if you don't have enough sleep it could make your skin less healthier than it should be.Plus,do avoid oily food since this could accumulate to cause breakouts.An allergy could also cause breakouts so you should pay attention if you do have allergies.Last but not least,lack of water could make your skin dehydrated and prone to breakouts.Drink lots of water from now on to hydrate your skin and improve skin resistance.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you to get skincare products which works for your skin.However,you should cleanse,tone and moisturize twice daily to reduce your breakouts and improve your skin complexion.You could get skincare products at a local pharmacy and find what suits you.However,I would recommend you to use Clinique 3 Steps Skincare Regime since it works for my skin and I've got good results.You could also try Murad products if you want to.For now,get a skincare regime to improve your skin condition.Good luck and hope I helped(:|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	A lot of people have had this problem in their past.

It usually starts with blood because it is a little bit heavier than usual. for period there is no age to get it. it varies from person  and anther, and ti takes around 4 years to settle, so it is normal to get it every 6 months or so for the 1st time. Don't worry bcos it is your 3rd period, I would worry if i haven't had it by the age of 16,not bcos it is your 3rd. The problem is if you have unprotective sex with bf, because if you get pregnant it will take you time to know. but anyway your period will settle by itself don't worry. practice safe sex and that is it

In order to reach that goal we have the following recommendations for you:<br>  <br>  1) Consume as much as you can of the 'right nutrition'; <br>  2) Avoid as much as you can of the 'wrong nutrition'; <br>  3) Exercise moderately; <br>  4) Be happy with every small change you've been able to make permanently; <br>  5) Don't make weight loss more complicated as it is.<br>   <br>             <br>  <br>   1) Consume as much as you can of the 'right nutrition'<br>  After many research a great deal of scientists agree that: <br>  raw fruits and (cooked) vegetables are the only right nutrition for human beings.<br>  <br>  If you want to succeed in living a truly healthy life the best thing to do is to consume as much of the 'right nutrition' as possible each day. The more raw fruits and (cooked) vegetables you eat, the more your appetite for them increases and you might end up feeding your body with nothing but the right nutrition! <br>  <br>  If you don't consume five pieces of fresh fruit a day yet (raw or squeezed) and you want to lose some weight permanently in a period of, say, six weeks (this period depends on your current eating pattern) the best thing to do is eat (or squeeze) those five fruits every day. If you haven’t consumed that much healthy food for a long time, it is most likely that your body starts to detoxify. You could even get sick! <br>  <br>  More about detoxification.<br>  <br>  If you have realized a consumption of five fruits a day you are ready to take the next step by consuming even more of the 'right nutrition'. To help you with this we have put together a 'right nutrition' list and a 'wrong nutrition' list. You can print the lists and put them on your kitchen wall. Every time you eat something check if it is included in the 'right nutrition' list or the 'wrong nutrition' list. If it is from the 'wrong nutrition' list try to replace it by something from the right list. If you can't replace the 'wrong nutrition' for some kind of reason enjoy it and don’t feel guilty about it!<br>  <br>  Right Nutrition List<br>  <br>  In other words: to lose weight it is important to live a healthier life, a healthy life starts with healthy food and raw fruits and vegetables are the healthiest food. We recommend you start your weight loss program by having five fruits a day and focusing on feeling good.<br>  <br>  2) Avoid as much as you can of the 'wrong nutrition';<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight quickly just eating or squeezing five pieces of fresh fruit a day will not be enough. We have put together a list of foods to avoid if you want to speed up the burning process. In this way you'll start burning fat faster. You'll have to avoid as much food from the 'wrong nutrition' list as you can. In fact it’s a simple list to remember, only two food groups are mentioned: stimulants and animal food. Now this list might seem simple enough but it is actually quite difficult to find out which products in the supermarket do or don't contain one of the products mentioned on the list. If you check out the labels you'll notice that almost every product contains a stimulant, mostly white refined sugar or some kind of animal based product, often stock.<br>  <br>  So, the foods you have to stay away from as much as possible if you want to help your body function properly and thus lose the excess weight are stimulants and animal based food.<br>  <br>  Wrong nutrition list<br>             <br>   3) Exercise moderately<br>  <br>  Just a bit of exercise will do. It is important though to get some exercise every day especially if you are in a job where you sit down all day. A half-an-hour walk a day will do. Of course more exercise is always better but never feel bad if you can't get yourself to do it. If you just take that walk for at least half an hour each day you'll be fine. Stretching your muscles is also good, it makes you more conscious of your body.<br>             <br>   4) Be happy with every small change you've been able to make permanently.<br>  <br>  Your body reacts like an oil tanker so if you want to change course it will take some time. Every structural change in the right direction is one to be proud of as long as it is permanent. After making a change it will take about six weeks before a change becomes permanent and part of your daily life.<br>   <br>  Be smart<br>  If you want to be slim you have to be smart: change your eating pattern permanently. In this way you'll lose those pounds forever! Remember this: after eating (five to) nine pieces of fruit a day for a few months you'll notice that your appetite for fruit has increased structurally and moreover you|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  Just Fruits will not be a good Idea.

If you don't like to read, then ask more questions here.|`|AA12100607	To build muscles you need to eat    lots of stuff containing protein like egg whites (have at least eight egg whites a day);  Whey protein mixed with milk;  Fish and chicken  Soya beans are also a good source of protein.    Besides, You need to be a regular gym goer. Do lot of squats with heavy weights. Lift weights that would challenge your total body capacity. Target one part of the body per day. Chest on Monday, Shoulders on Tuesday, Lats on Wednesday and Biceps, Triceps and Squats everyday.    Stick to this routine for a month and you will notice very positive changes.

3jFm0rWdaa	Keep in mind you had a pretty serious accident before.<br>  But what happens is sometimes ribs get fixated if you tighten up, yell or jump while the chiro is trying to adjust you.  Usually it goes away after a couple extra treatments and is very easy to help.<br>  But if you don't get it treated it can stay that way for a long time.<br>  That's why she wanted to see you an extra time, it usually almost always goes away after that.  Activator technique is also a good way to help this without them having to push on you if that's what you're afraid of.<br>  There's no reason for you to panic, they know what they are doing.<br>  And you can't sue them for that - I guarantee nothings broken, it's just a muscle spasm along your ribs.<br>  Since they did a great job up until now I would give them a chance to fix this - but if you feel more comfortable with one than the other then request to only see that one.<br>  Good luck.  (And I can pretty much guarantee the x-rays will show nothing).|`|xqYrGjGVaa	Sudden pain in the sternum following a joint manipulation - when you are face down and the doctor presses on your back - is an infrequent complication.  In my experience it happens to older, stiff-jointed, osteoarthritic women.  It is likely a sprain at the connection of where your ribs meet the sternum.  It can be quite painful and take weeks to resolve.  It could also be a rib fracture.  What I don't know is: why have you been doing mostly stretching? What do you mean by stretching?  Also, if you had not made any progress after two weeks, or about six sessions, then there is a problem (in my opinion)and you and the DC should discuss it.  Getting the x-rays may be a good idea, for peace of mind if nothing else.  <br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  city_chik123|`|6nPUniYhaa	I have recently started seeing a chiro for the first time in the last couple years.  And I have to say I have tried many different chiro's to find which one works good for me.  Not every chiro may work for you. Maybe you should explain to the husband whats going on and make some kind of arrangement to only see him. Communication could get you further than a lawsuit. I do believe these chiro's work so the more lawsuits there are the more there prices go up. Continue to see the husband or find another chiro and just try different ones till you find one that suits you.  Also keep fit..don't let your belly get big because that will cause so much strain on your back. And try light back and ab exercises 2-3 a week. That will cut your chiro visit in half. Good luck!

Being as stressed as you are probably means that although you bike 5 miles a day, you are probably eating way too much, both in meal portion sizes and in little snacks throughout the day that you don't even notice you are eating, but they make you feel (temporarily) less stressed - comfort eating and calorie amnesia.<br>  <br>  You need to take accurate measurements every day of your weight and your calorie intake.

Improve your diet: lots of fiber like oatmeal, bran, whole grain bread.  Lots of fruit and vegetables(preferably not over-cooked).  Nuts and legumes.  No red meat(especially fat); some white meat, mainly fish(sardines are good as they are small and no mercury.).  If you drink milk(some advise against dairy products) get the new A2 milk...less allergy-producing.      Keep up the exercise: riding a bike is good, walk rather than drive short distances. Good luck.

Not to mention the internships when they barely go home to sleep.<br>  <br>  If they do pass the boards, and they go for residency, that's like 24/7 staying at the hospital for around 3-4years or more.

However, if you normally poop once daily and have not gone for 3 days or more, this could be a sign of constipation.

It is important to understand that any time you have difficulty evacuating or have to strain to move your bowels, you may have constipation. There are a number of options available over-the-counter at the pharmacy to treat this condition; however, the simplest approach is to try drinking more water and less coffee and soft drinks.    If you are concerned about your bowel movements, do not hesitate to ask your local pharmacist--believe me, we get a lot worse than this!|`|SslUWT0Jaa	hey I was just about to ask a simular question.

SJx9IWWtaa	You need to eat more.  Not hungry, who cares eat anyway.  Train your body to eat 6 small meals a day.   You'll slowly start learning how to eat right.  <br>  <br>  No energy, eat more fruit.  And take vitamins, or try slim fast (filled with vitamins).  The extra vitamins and sugar(good sugar) in fruit will help give you energy.<br>  <br>  As for being a night owl, exercise at night.  I have the same problem.  I'll be wide awake all night, but tell myself to exercise in the morning or during the day because its what your "supposed" to do.  Well I've given up on that, and now I go out jogging at night when I'm up and active.    It works great.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  The diet cycle sucks.   Try setting your goals lower.  People often set goals like losing 20 lbs in a month, then when they fail they give up and fall right back into old habits.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Focus on what can be added to the diet rather than on what needs to be eliminated.

Go buy some "Sea Silver" on line. It makes you lose weight and its not harmful. You can do anything you put your mind to.From what your saying I feel that the way you're doing it your body feels like its starving. Just do the exercises they taught us in gym or dance class 3 times a week with 3 repetition of 8. do this 3 times a week (not consecutively). Buy the Sea Silver. Sea Silver and the exercise will show results. After your initial weight loss from the exercise and the Sea Silver. Choose one to two days a week(this you can do consecutively, if you can) where you only drink(like soup, juices,milk, yogurt,water,preferably fresh squeezed juice.  until you are satisfied(meaning you don't feel hungry). Keep all this up for 2 months. After you lose some weight then go to a dietician to explain to you how to eat. what foods act what way. If its too confusing remember: starches: bread, doughnuts,pizza crust,chips,cannoli,anything with flour is a starch and starches turn to simple sugar in your body.  Good luck.|`|qt79ntH2aa	honestly skipping meals wont help anything but to make you gain more weight when you do eat that single meal.<br>  The lack of energy can be attributed to you depression or bi polar disorder but on average people should only get 6 to 8 hours of sleep more than that will make you very lethargic through out your day. <br>  I had generally the same problem with motivation but you need to look at it as a serious health issue, working out a couple times a week will improve your energy through out the day and will really help with the depression.<br>  <br>  it's never easy to loose weight. no pill or crash diet will be an effective way to do it.|`|yTNk4b7Raa	I also have this problem.<br>  But once i tried one, and after a week my body got used to the new foods i was trying.<br>  My mum goes to slimming world, and i get in for free so i have started that, it has a red day, and a green day and there's a book that tells you everything about it.<br>  my mum has lost 2st 10lbs by joining and the only exercise she gets is cleaning the house and walking.<br>  i only just joined last wednesday so im going to get weighed this wednesday. basically i am swapping my crisps and cakes and chocolate, for kiwi fruit, apples and bananas so dieting can be really fun!

I can't stop snacking on bad food. In regards to chocolate milk, start by finding a low fat alternative and cut down to maybe 1 small glass a week. Drink more water instead, at least 8 glasses a day. If you want flavour, maybe use diet cordial.<br>  <br>  In terms of snacking, if you snack coz your bored, try to find other things to keep you busy. THrow out all fatty food and bad snacks from your pantry and fridge and only keep healthy food. If you want to snack, snack on low fat rice crackers or sliced vegetables dipped in hommus.<br>  <br>  You will also need to exercise a lot more than you walk so you burn more calories than what you consume. Just keep trying to stick to it. Find a buddy that you can go through the journey with. Ask your friends and families to support you. <br>  <br>  Good luck

It has been used since the 18th century.<br>  <br>  Having genital warts does not mean your husband cheated on you.<br>  <br>  There are many reasone why you may have it now.<br>  <br>  If for example you had a wart on your finger and masturbated, you could transmit it that way.<br>  <br>  Of course sexual intimacy can transmit it too.<br>  <br>  However, the genitals warts virus is a naughty little thing as it can lie dormant for many years. If you had sex with someone before you met each other you could have caught it from them without knowing it.<br>  <br>  The virus lies dormant for years and can just reappear. This can happen with any kind of wart. I had a wart on my finger and got it taken off at the doctors, years later it came back and I got it removed again.<br>  The warts virus is what we call latent and if it is in your system then they can occur at any time.<br>  <br>  Do not automatically assume that your husband cheated, either of you just may have been unfortunate enough to have had a dormant virus.<br>  <br>  Also it has nothing to do with panty liners, sanitary towels, toilets or napkins.<br>  <br>  Homoeopathy is not proven to get rid of warts forever, although it has shown to be usefull in eradicating a current outbreak and working deep down in the body at a cellular level to balance out any disruption in the bodies cells that may have caused them or that may induce and outbreak.|`|B8WEoAiKaa	1) it depends only from your own immune system!<br>  2)Your husband can have the genital HPV virus for years and not have any sign of it.

Many people then worry that their partner has been unfaithful, or will think they have been unfaithful. But finding out you have HPV doesn’t necessarily mean that you or your partner have been unfaithful. There is no way of knowing how long you have had the virus.

(I've had one) The worst part to me, was when he started filing the canal out some more so he could put the gutta percha  (stuffing) in to keep it from re-infecting. The grinding was terrible! And it's not like you can plug your ears since the vibrations are going right to your ears.  A skilled endodontist will generally not cause pain, but it is still a possibility until he gets the nerves out.<br>  <br>  Here's what to sorta expect (YMMV): <br>  Novacaine to the jaw<br>  Opening the tooth with a drill most likely.<br>  Using small files the endo will clean out the infected dentin and nerves that make up the interior of the tooth & root.<br>  Using a slightly larger file, he'll rough up/hollow out the root a little more to put the 'gutta percha' in (this generally stops the infection and may have medications too)<br>  He'll end by putting a small filling over the hole until you can get to the General Dentist. (You might get a post too that's just something for the crown or other restoration to hold onto better)<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes okay for you!

Oe7SOJyDaa	the only thing that will get rid of the pouch is lots of cardio, if you want to tone up then I would suggest doing a lot of crunches and planks. The exercise that is good for the pouch is where you lay on your back, hands on the floor and you bring your legs straight up and lift your booty in the air.  Bicycle crunches help that area as well, those are good for your obliques too.  If you want good back legs you should do a lot of squats and lunges.  Those work like magic for my butt, quads and calf's. Plie lunges are good too. Those are just squats with a wider stance in your legs with your feet facing out ward instead on forward.  Remember when you do your squats to pretend you are about to sit on a chair and stick your booty out when you go down. Good form is key! Good luck!|`|zQiYKgMLaa	stop eating: Fried foods, Ice Cream, White Foods, Starchy Foods.  Those include:  Pasta, White Bread, French Fries, White Rice, Milk, Cheeses, Ice Creams, etc...

Stay away from Splenda, SweetnLow, and Equal.  if you want a zero cal sweetner that isn't bad for you go for Stevia.  you can find it at the suppliment isle of your grocery store.

Canned tuna is okay for example.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, stay away from milk, juices, pop, etc...<br>  <br>  Go to the gym and start lifting weights.

AjFA8qIxaa	I don't know how long you bled but if it was more than a two days it probably was your period.  If not that long it was probably spotting. Either way this most likely happened becaus eyou took it. Its a high dose of hormons, and your body is most likely going to react to it.  Yes there is still a slim chance that you might be pregnant ( there is always that one case in a million) but it really is slim. Although if this doesnt take your worries away take a test to be certain. Also your doctor should've told you about possible side effects of the ma pill/ You can always call him and ask him, this way you will be sure. Cuz i'm not a doctor, i can give you all the possibilities and by that i am answering your question ( yes the morning after pill canchange your period..lol)but am i helping you?|`|I40iBJdHaa	it's most likely from the pill. you're period will go back to normal within the next couple months. don't worry!|`|mhsUQzC2aa	it is a 99% chance because you took the pill. the same thing happened to me. one side affect is that your period may become irregular for a couple months. No worries =)|`|GaYLCY1Waa	when i took the morning after pill my period was all out of whack! i also bled for almost a week and a half. then the next month my period came normally! the pill is designed to throw everything off and it definitly messes with your hormones. good luck!
820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	It's quite likely that your weight is affecting your periods. You are officially underweight, so your bodies natural defense is to stop your periods - the body doesn't want to get pregnant if you are not able to give the child enough food/nutrients. <br>  <br>  I would suggest visiting your doctor, and discussing it with them. Continue to use condoms really carefully just in case.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Not having a period unless on the pill is an indication that a hormone imbalance of some sort could be going on (an example only).<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting a second opinion as well to see what they think could be going on.
tMtBe1lKaa	She may have been protecting you also. She needs to work through this, and I'm sure she knows she has your full support. Don't be hurt, recognize what a strong woman she is to still be protecting her family and facing these things herself. Mothers see how their health is affecting thier families. I bet you have been a wonderful, kind of worryful, daughter. She wants to lead her family through this with her head held high. Let her. Cherish who she is, and how she influenced who you are, I'm sure you aleady do. Plan some fun things between appointments so that you can enjoy each others company without the doctors in the middle. My prayers are with you and her.|`|slILtaEiaa	I can understand you feeling hurt, but keep this in mind. If she tells you, then she has to worry about her own feelings, and the feelings of everyone else she has just spilled to. She may just need a little bit of time to come to terms with her feelings, and then she will decide to let you know. Also, keep in mind, she may not have lied! Just make sure to make every day count, and she'll tell you in her own time! My thoughts are with you :)
UL3XOKJxaa	What are you paying your orthodontist for...these are questions that should have been answered by them way before this...you should open the lines of communication with your dentist and fast. Good Luck
WXExyAlWaa	I'm sorry.    A warm bath will relax you, yeah. If you have stuffed toys you can curl up with them too - it sounds silly, but they are really comforting! When you get anxious, also, you can try to focus on your surroundings. Try and be somewhere quiet so there's nothing that will just upset you more. Sit down against the wall and just pay attention to the ground and wall and how solid and THERE they are, if that makes sense. Have something in your pocket you can hold onto and imagine the nervous energy going out of you into it. And try to breathe slowly and deeply.|`|Gxog88I3aa	This is a very hard situation.  I have suffered for years with panic attacks and each one is very hard to work through.     One day I told myself to let it go (let the panic attack run its course) and learn that this is the worst it can get.    But no mater what you do the feelings are going to be there and you have to deal with them.    I did have a doctor give me Buspar, only to be taken when I was having a panic attack.  I did not need to take them on a regular basis.  So if you get to the point of wanting to try meds talk to your doctor about that one.    Good Luck and Remember it is just a terrible feeling and it will not kill you.
716335ab6ea56965d0cb4b7367b650edaa	There are times in life where mere words seem so trite. This is one. However I will try to help as much as I can.    Take life one day, one step at a time. Learn to reach out. The do it all by yourself mode died with the stone age. If not family then friends. A caring, supportive circle is worth more than gold or jewels.  As to what to do or say, take your cue from him. Ask what he thinks and feels, what he wants. After the initial shock and grief have worn off, you can broach the subject of end of life care, palliative care. And funeral arrangements.    I don't know where you live so I'm going to give you some links from Canada as well as the US. These will give you some guidance.|`|qiLJsLnyaa	I have a friend whose wife is dying because of cancer. They have grown distant in the past months and a little more than roommates.  I know that when she is gone, he will regret this.    Enjoy the time you have. Do things that you haven't done before.  Don't be afraid to do or say things, but follow his lead. You may also want to seek a support group to help you (and both of you) through this transition.  Find the strength to be there for him and whatever he needs these last months.    I wish you the best|`|AA12086526	My condolences,  there will be a period of grieving as he goes through the steps of denial, anger, depression and eventually to acceptance of the unknown.    Do not deny his problem, sympathize with him and offer understanding.  He must reach his conclusions alone, as do you.    I hope you realize that although cancer is spread, you do not offer enough information to estimate his future life expectancy.  The main thing is to remember that he does have time to live, and should make the most of it.      treatment may stop or slow the progress of the disease, but the treatment itself may be so debilitating that life with treatment would be torturous.  Discuss this with his physician and help guide him to reaching his own rational decision on care and how to spend his time left on earth.     Talk to your spiritual advisors, alone or together.  Admit to your own fears as well as his.  He must understand that you are suffering as well.  Take advantage of the time you face together and celebrate your lives, not your death.    He is young, and as the old saying goes, today "is the first day of the rest of your life."|`|jS5O0LaUaa	My husband was given the same but with treatment he lived another14 months and then on Christmas Eve he tragically fell down the stairs and died he was only 50 we have been together for 22years its a big chunk of my life.We enjoyed our life and did what we wanted to do after he was diagnosed with cancer so i know when he died we had did most of the things we had wanted.Speak to him he will be as frightened as you are talk to him while you can i am missing that more than any thing its so lonely but i know he is as peace.Cuddle him and try to be strong i know its hard take care i will be thinking about you|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	I guess this is one of those time that you really need to know how much compassion a person has...how much do you have.  Are you strong enough to handle the next couple of months?  I don't think that I would change anything you do or say, they may know you are trying too hard, then the wrong information comes out and you will say something wrong.  Just be yourself, take one day at a time.  Make sure to enjoy the time you have left.  I also heard my neighbor say that someone he know had cancer and was given 6 months...that person lasted 2 years, before it got bad and they passed away.  During this time it will be hard, talk about everything the future the past...he is going throught a hard time too.

Viral infections, such as the flu or common cold, will not be affected by antibiotics.  In fact, taking antibiotics for viral infections may lead to antibiotic resistance in the future.  Most of your symptoms seem indicative of the flu, except the white spots on your tonsils and the high fever.  These are symptoms often correlated with strep throat caused by strep bacteria.  If left untreated, strep throat may develop into scarlett fever which can be very dangerous.  You may want to look into the possibility of seeing a doctor at a free clinic.|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Oral thrush. Also known as candidiasis, oral thrush is a yeast infection that develops inside the mouth. The condition results in the formation of white patches that are often cottage cheese-like in consistency on the surfaces of the mouth and tongue. Oral thrush is most commonly seen in infants and the elderly, especially denture wearers, or in people with compromised immune systems. People with diabetes and people taking inhaled steroids for asthma or lung disease also can get thrush. Oral thrush is more likely to occur after the use of antibiotics, which may kill the "good" bacteria in the mouth. Eating plain yogurt with live and active cultures may help restore the proper fauna in your mouth. Additionally, medications may be used to combat the infection. http://www.medicinenet.com/tongue_proble...    If your throat continues to hurt past 2 more days, you need to check with the doctor because it could be strep throat and untreated strep throat can cause bigger problems.  Ok, so take your probiotics (yogurt)  and see how it goes in a couple more days.

nbWO3IANaa	1] the milage you cover, not the hours spent covering them, will determine how much weight you lose -   Example: 3 miles at one mile per hour will use same amount of calories as 3 miles at 3mph.  2] keep up with the weights!  Do every other day. Increase reps by 5 per week, then move up to heavier weights.  3] add 3 sets each of 10 reps of pushups, pullups, situps, and obliques to crunches  4] avoid all fried,fast, and junk foods - even diet junk foods  5] drink 1/2 gallon of water a day  6] take a good multivitamin with minerals daily  Should see a difference within 3 to 4 weeks, and a great dif by 2 months.

NOW.    if he used to do other things like golf?  throw ball?  whatever..  just start back up..  it'll force activity...   it'll stimulate  the hand.    i know it sounds stupid but all those other things they told  me to do. ... didn't work at all!    so i went back to basics.    they told me i was rushing it and it wouldn't work.. but it worked much better than doing dumb things with rubber bands and tiny balls...   little machines and other things that just upset me.    i just went back to what was once natural for me.. every day routine..   because once i  knew i worked with it.      IE:   when i tried to write, i held the pens like they were sticks or a knife..    it really was embarrassing..  and to type?   i typied with my knuckles until i got so mad i worked on stretching my fingers out and  at least hitting the keyboard...    in 3 years i got back to   40wpm!    as you can see now I TYPE!    i still mess up but the  regular, every day routine.. kept me going..   nothing special.. something that is very detailed and everyday worked better for me than some stupid program that failed me big time.      then once i loosened up..   became familiar and confident.. then i tried drinking out of a glass..

If ya don't have family love then love yourself and enjoy whatever it is you'd like to do. I'd also sugest that what ever you do try and have something to show for what you put your time into doing. Time flies, and if your not above ground then you'll be missing so so much fun.    P.S. being told the next day or the next time you see people that were at a party where you got stoned, drunk and did some serousely stupid stuff isn't something to be proud of or to be thought of as cool. Cool or Fool, it's up to you, but I'd say be the best ya can be while in school, because without a good edumacation ya ain't gonna get a job making the dollars to buy the nice things, or toys big kids like. Party sober, party nakid, but never party on dope,|`|A7Gw0HJcaa	none!!!  my dad is in prison for cocain for the third time!!!  and my best friend started weed and now he is failing in almost every class and has lost his friends and family in the process|`|5vBpKmNcaa	The best answer is find someone who truly cares about you, and ask them about what you should do. Don't ask about a bunch of strangers that at then end, will not share any of the consequences with you.
Zu7GJeU4aa	It'll be muscle not fat ya silly|`|Amkmles0aa	from eating foods that have fat|`|2q1XI0j9aa	well your body is probably going into starvation mode and holding onto all your fat because you are eating so little, you need to be eating atleast if not more than 1200 calories aday.    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|5KdXVKrJaa	get the wii fit board its fun and it helps lose weight  eat healthy too  good luck =]]|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	You need to eat a LOT more.  A person needs at least 1200 calories of 'intake' per day to lose weight successfully.  Your body is in 'starvation mode' and with you running 5 or more times a week, it's trying to 'pack on weight' so you don't DIE.  Eat more and you'll start to lose weight naturally ...|`|Y0O6971laa	you're gaining muscle.  Do your clothes fit the same?  then you're fine.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Actually you're doing exactly what your body does not want you to do and it's starting to show.  If you're 5'9" (which is what I am) and only eating 800 calories you're not eating enough.  You should never eat under 1000 - 1200 calories per day.  In essence with the low cal diet and all the exercise your body is saying "YIKES, I'M STARVING TO DEATH", and is HOLDING on to the weight to keep from dying.    You can lose weight easier by eating a proper amount of calories so that your body doesn't freak.  Try it for 2 weeks, I promise you it will help.|`|8C824cthaa	..LOL this hapened to me... dance 9 hours a week.

Weight is important to measure, but fat content is more useful means of determining whether you are obese or not.|`|Cc75nMt7aa	don't worry about the actual weight...look in the mirror.  remember that working out will help you to gain muscle, too, which actually weighs more than fat.  so if you are looking in the mirror or measuring your waist, etc...that might be a better way to tell if you really are losing weight.    also, don't forget to drink a lot of water or you could start to bloat.|`|hat60KYXaa	Less than 800 calories a day, your body may go into "starvation mode" and start storing up more fat.

A friend of mine had the same problem.  She was gaining weight (because of the muscle gain) and then when she went shopping she had dropped a whole dress size.  You should be taking in more calories though.  You don't want to starve yourself.  The best healthy diet to lose weight is to eat 5-6 small, healthy meals a day; that way your body breaks down the food faster/easier causing your metabolism to speed up, causing you to lose weight.  If you're eating 1 or 2 larger meals a day compared to what your other meals are, you're body has a hard time breaking up that food, which slows down you're metabolism.|`|zHD8tnDBaa	Less than 800 calories a day is very unhealthy.

You have to eat to trigger your metabolism into burning the body's fat stores.  By NOT eating, your body uses those fat stores for energy and doesn't burn it.    2)  You may be gaining muscle mass.  But don't get discouraged, it's the muscle that burns the fat.  Up your proteins, lower your carbs, cut out all refined sugar.  See what happens.  DRINK LOTS OF WATER & GATORADE.|`|cKgJBhDIaa	You aren't eating enough, especially if you are burning off that many calories a day. Your body is prob in starvation mode and is storing fat. Seriously eat some more food, make sure you are getting in enough vegetables and protein and you will lose.|`|AA12004844	you are not eating enough and you r body is storing everything you eat.  You need to raise your caloric consumption.    also working out may make you gain weight since muscle is heavier that fat.    Do not be so  concerned with the number on the scale as how you feel and how your clothes fit.    You may lose inches - but not necessarily weight.    eat more veggies, fruit, lean protein, and whole grains|`|ViNFT9RQaa	ok, first of all, you may be gaining muscle mass, which actually weighs more than fat... so that could be throwing you off. secondly, 800 calories/day is not a healthy caloric intake, especially for being 5'8". I know you want to lose weight quickly, so you might think less calories=lose weight. but actually by eating fewer than the recommended amount of calories/day, you are slowing down your metabolism. you should never consume less than 1200 calories/day - and make sure you spread your meals out (4-6 smaller meals rather than 3 bigger meals)    good luck :)|`|CAQL94vGaa	Stay close to fruits and salads. That running will help you out. After you run, eat some protein, whether a protien shake or what, that will help too. Just make sure your watching your intake of food. Also, if you drink soda, stop. thats 5-10 pounds right there. One mroe thing, weight loss takes time, you cant lose 20 lbs over night. just keep at her and finish hard. Good luck!!!!|`|067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	Your gaining because your not eating enough. When you don't consume enough calories/food (especially during exercise) your body goes into a fight or flight response mode.   What this means is that since its not getting enough food its going to hold onto everything it DOES get.    You say "no suggestions on starving myself" when actually your doing that pretty nicely yourself.    You should be getting about 400-600 calories less a day, and 3miles a day running is burning close to 800 calories.  Find out how much your BMR is. and that is the LEAST ammount of calories you should be eating.|`|1f0e024ec05adef569986433033bc51eaa	800 cal. is starving yourself Your not eating enough food and your body is thinking it's starving. plus, some of it maybe turning into muscle.

Never, never, never drink soda.  not even diet.|`|KipX5r0Zaa	eat more|`|TWW5DGttaa	Because you are eating less than 800 calories! You can't starve yourself that will slow down your metabolism. You need at the very least 1,200 to function properly and if you are excersizing the normal amount, 2500, to keep your energy level up too! What i would do is find out how much you were eating when you were not trying to lose weight then find out where you could cut back. You need to take away a few calories at a time or your body will go into starvation mode and you will end up storing fat as its way of taking care of you during famine season. treat your body right, listen to your body and its cravings and you will feel a lot better and hopefully see results. The most important thing is to not lose a bunch of weight but to feel and be healthier!|`|36UfSA5Eaa	That's bizarre.   Maybe running isn't the best way of loosing weight. I always thought running was more for your heart, you can loose weight by doing that, im just saying I don't.  Try going on a real diet, like one you find in a magazine. Maybe try talking to a doctor?|`|Co9I2OMSaa	You are gaining muscle by running, so you are bound to actually gain weight instead of lose the weight.  You probably want to eat a little more too, 800 calories really is not healthy at all.  You may think that it is going to help, but once you lose the 15-20 pounds and start eating more, you're just going to gain all the weight back.  So just eat healthy.  Eat about 5 small meals a day, make sure you have breakfast!  It is prov-en that eating more, but smaller, portions throughout the day helps you lose weight.  And continue your exercising, but make sure that what you are doing is something that you will be able to continue once you are satisfied with your weight.  Start a routine that you are sure you can keep up, then you can continue losing weight and staying healthy even after you are at your ideal weight.   Hope this helps|`|03bb226f38059b0635b6d5774b81925daa	You are gaining muscle.

Your body needs to get used to the changes so it will do weird things. Sometimes because your body will be used to having more food it will use your excess water weight and you will be bloated for a few days or weeks. That's probably why your gaining weight.

Only eating 800 calories will send you body into starvation mode and it will start storing everything that you eat. You need to go to this website and find out how many calories you should be consuming so that you can lose weight. What ever this calculator tells you, you should not lower it no more than 100 to 200 calories.

If the man does 500 calories of extra activity (eg running) he will need to consume 2500 calories to stay the same weight.|`|AA10827766	what the.....|`|f4A8qMl3aa	Calories are a unit of measurement...  but no you didn't really eat negative anything... you just burned more than you ate.    and only eating 300 calories in one day is NOT healthy... that's like drinking a glass of milk and eating a piece of fruit.    it doesn't make you stronger, it makes you loose weight... as you exercise you break muscle fibers, which then are repaired and replaced by more tissue, making you stronger. You aren't consuming calories, you're consuming food... the food needs to be digested, and that uses energy... then the food is broken up into chemicals that give you energy... that energy needs to be used or stored... if you use it, then you gain no weight, but if you store it, then it turns into fat.|`|0ce61e573bbdf5eb6e91c386c28d01ddaa	Yes. The simplest weight loss equation is to simply burn more calories than you take it.  Notice though, that calories from fat are much harder to burn. You burn less than 1/3 fat calories for every 1 "regular" calorie you burn.|`|8wU9D1P7aa	ofcourse there are extra calories that left from your before meals.....

(your weight in pounds x 3500) if you ate 300 then burned 600, that means you burned 300 cal.

The food calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.    How many calories ingested will translate into one pound of your body weight depends on your individual metabolism, and how much you exercise.    If you burn more calories than you take in over a period of time, your body will metabolize energy from the materials that are stored in your body fat.  You didn't eat "negative calories", there's no such thing.  You simply burned more calories than you ate.    Generally, if you burn 3,500 kcal more than you eat, you lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat, however, if you eat 3,500 kcal more than your body needs, you will put on only 0.3 pounds (0.14 kg) of fat.  This is because even without exercise, your body still needs energy to keep your heart and other organs working.
Gxog88I3aa	First I have to say I hate the way the health care system works.        I think it would be helpful to make a list regarding school, work and any other activities that you have to do.  Put them in order of importance, like assignments that are do, that type of thing.  Also your family and friends needs to know to back off and not to put pressure on you right now.      It is very important for you to have free time for doing what you want to do, relaxing time is very important.  It would also be great to write in a journal, sometimes writing things down that bother you help you put it a side.      If things get too bad at school talk to your school counselor and see if they have ideas on how to help you get what you need done with less stress.

All in all supplements only help to a point, whats really going to count is how hard you work out in the gym. Invest there, not in supplements.|`|NcBoAX6Eaa	All the doctors and food experts say targeted weight loss is unlikely, especially in the waist and belly areas, but I achieved it with acai berry.

There is a free trial happening right now at http://kinaracs.niar.tv , try it, what's the worst that could happen?
nLrbleCPaa	Some would argue this but I say any multivitamin is a good one. They aren't designed to help you get big though.     Make sure you are taking 1 gram of protein per pound you weigh for optimal results. Any extra creatine you take will be a waste so take what the product recommends.     The most important thing you can do is eat well and often. At least 6 meals a day!
SX6SOkf7aa	No...just always follow the directions on each product. The hydroycut is best used as an energy supp...it will help you energy-wise while doing cardio..but you have to work out those supplements will NOT work without the proper diet and exercise regimen...trust I 've been there. You should be getting about .65g of protein per lbs of body weight or 1-1.5 if your using heavy weights...protien will be stored as fat if not being used by the body...ie. protien is great, but too much is very bad.
RoqVeuLmaa	You will burn the same amount of calories during a work out whether you eat first or after.  But you may find you have more energy to work out if you have some calories in you (ideally eating 1-2 hours prior).  Another tip:  eat a 200-300 calorie mix of carbs and protein within 30-60 minutes after your workout and you may find you recover faster. There is a window of opportunity after exercise during which your body is primed to take in nutrients.|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	yep, no food energy, so the body burns fat energy, but its hard to start of with no food and thus no energy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Food does give a little kick to your metabolism, but a 5 minute warm-up does the same, but no food=no energy. <br>  Try this miracle food called "coffee" . its amazing, instant energy. and if coffee is rare or too costly try "chocolate". they'll give you the energy you need to start and get through the exercise, just make sure the sugar % is low, really low otherwise you might as well eat a large breakfast, and some cheesecake. <br>  <br>  you muscle work on glycogen, which is food energy from carbs(anything with carbs, will eventually be broken down to glycogen and used by the muscles or turned into fat) <br>  if your muscles do not have the glycogen they'll be forced to burn fat. (thats the simple version, you want the complicated version, search it on google) <br>  <br>  heres what i suggest you do for optimal fat loss. <br>  >warm up for 5-10 minutes<br>  >start of with HIIT(sprint or jump rope for 5-15 minutes) (i think you need at least 30 secs to rest inbetween if your doing sprints, it takes 30 secs for 60-70% of the muscles energy reserve to return, usually from fat if you dont have glycogen)<br>  >after that jog/run for 20-40 minutes, this'll burn a lot of calories and fat. make sure your running slow enough(you should be able to talk while running) <br>  do this for the best results. <br>  you can try only HIIT, only slow state cardio and this mix for 4 months each and find out which has the best effect. <br>  swimming, elipticals, rock climbing, rowing and cycling can also work. <br>  <br>  eat breakfast afterwards. also if your dieting and trying to lose weight, eat 500-1000 cals too few a day for 1-2 pounds, and overeat at least one day to keep your body from getting used to the food limitation. (e.g.  750 calories less every day, and 100 calories extra one day, youll lose 1lb a week, and also more since your running)|`|D100ixUgaa	I've heard people say they like working out before eating, but my personal experience is that I have a crappy workout if I haven't eaten. I can't push myself as hard, I get tired faster, I'm dizzy for a while afterwards, and I usually have the munchies for the rest of the day. Everybody's different, though; some people are at their best, physically, in the morning. I'm at my best in the early evening, so that's when I work out. I'd rather have an awesome workout at 7 pm than a crappy workout at 7 am, and I'm sure I'm burning just as much fat by exercising at night because I'm pushing myself harder, longer. Know what I mean? So try exercising at different times of day and see what works for you. You could also go for a quick jog before breakfast to get your blood flowing, and plan your "real" workout for later in the day, when you've got some energy. That's what a lot of pro athletes do; none of them, based on the workout schedules I've read, do any serious training on an empty stomach, but they do sometimes go for a morning run.

t2Jccuotaa	Hi - I would imagine the first month of doing this amount 5 days a week would be the starting point of building your muscles and therefore all you may experience in this time is aching muscles! - but it will be worth it and you will see visable results after this time.

Normally I reserve bold statements like that for the end of an article, but I want to say it clearly right up front. That's how much I believe in Calorie Shifting.<br>  <br>  Let's face it. If you're reading this article, it's because you need some help. No one wants to admit that, but we all need help sometimes and there's no shame in getting what you need. The difficult thing is that you've probably sought help for your weight problem before and failed. Why is it that so many diets and weight loss plans fail?<br>  <br>  Simple. Diets and weight loss plans fail because they are temporary in nature. Think about it. Almost every other plan you've ever read about, tried, or considered has been a limited time sort of thing. You go on it, lose a little weight, or maybe even a lot of weight, and then you go off it and what happens? Slowly but surely, the weight creeps back - maybe even more than before. Why does that happen?<br>  <br>  The Yo-Yo Effect - This happens because your body acclimates to your diet or exercise regimen. You get going on a particular program and your body sort of wakes up. Things have changed and the old way of doing business is over. So, your body adjusts. Some systems speed up, others slow down, some just go haywire. But it works. You lose weight and when you get to your "target weight" you stop. But your body has gotten accustomed to this new way of doing things. It doesn't like stopping or slowing down. And all your systems aren't quite ready for this change. So, everything starts to slow down, and your body wisely decides that you might try something like this again. And what does it do? It keeps you nice and hungry so you'll put on a few more pounds just in case you decide you want to try something like that again. That way it has a little more easy fat to burn the next time as it acclimates to this new crazy diet you're on. So your weight goes up and down like a yo-yo.<br>  <br>  But what's different about calorie shifting? Well, in short, everything. With calorie shifting, instead of limiting yourself to an ultra-low level of calories, or limiting certain types of foods like carbs or fats, you simply eat specific foods at specific times. You get to eat as much as you want as long as you eat things at the right time of day. By doing so, you adjust your food intake to your body's natural rhythms and speed up your metabolism. Instead of slowing down your system, you hyper-speed it. And since it's not a diet plan, once you get the hang of it, you can stay on it forever. That way you avoid the Yo-Yo effect and keep the weight off for good. It's like a miracle.|`|6026XWBgaa	i suggest jogging and ab crunches. and setting a goal and a routine every day and to stick to it, for example, i do 100 ab crunches at a time during the day, and i do that every day|`|gvpdBOs3aa	I recommend one great site.

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health. Also, by removing excess belly fat, you can undercover your hidden six pack. <br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|ZBnDQx5haa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, many people would declare impossible, nevertheless the sole diet that definitely delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

CmLDcfMfaa	You were given some good advice by all above.  I would like to add do not eat anything from a can [too many additives and sodium].  Cook fresh or frozen vegetables, eat fresh or frozen fruits.  Eat from all the whole grains, but stay away from white grains, [example white flour, white rice…].  Eat lean meat do not eat red meat more than once a week.  Eat fish at least 3x’s a week.  Eat plenty of beans and lentils.  Drink low fat dairy milk.

There are only 15 programs that are Master level in the country out of just over 200 programs.  They will be converting in the next few years.  There are 2 options, you can go to a school that offers a 3+3 program.  You go to the same school and get your BS and your DPT in 6 years.  These schools are more in the minority and many are housed in the northeast.  Or you can do the BS plus 3 program.  You go to any school of your choice and get a BS while taking the pre reqs.  Many people take exercise science, kinesiology, health science, bio, ect.  You may or may need to take the GRE and apply to a PT program.<br>  <br>  In general, you will need to take 1 year of chem, bio, physics, anatomy and physiology.

It is at least a master's degree, although almost all programs are already doctorate programs.  <br>  <br>  You'd actually be hard pressed to find anymore master's programs as the most are already in the process of the change over. However, I don't think the APTAs goal for 100% DPT was until 2016 (I think.)<br>  <br>  Yet, realize that the DPT is a focused degree and some schools it's possible to complete the DPT in 6 years.  These are mostly direct admit programs that do not require a BS for entry.  Rather, you are admitted into the preprofessional phase as a freshman, you continue three years of undergraduate work and are guaranteed a spot in the program by the time you reach your senior year.  Of course, as long as you maintain the minimum GPA required (usually 3.0).  Therefore, in some cases, you can finish the doctorate in 6 years instead of 7. Although, in my experience, this is usually at very expensive private schools (Marquette, Bradley, etc). <br>  <br>  Good lukc.|`|IKakoOfyaa	No one really knows although the trend is going that way.

NqfUPKiSaa	Menopause occurs between 45 to 55 years of age.<br>  Changes will be there in the cycle and in the amount of flow|`|cWuumdy7aa	The Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation which occurs a considerable length of time before the end of the lifespan.<br>  <br>  The word was first applied to humans, and because of this it literally means the cessation of monthly cycles or menstrual cycles, from the Greek roots meno (meaning month, referring to monthly menstruation) and pausis (a halt). However, currently the word is used in a broader sense, and menopause is the permanent stopping of female reproductive cycles of various lengths and kinds; menopause is indeed present in a number of vertebrate species other than humans.<br>  <br>  In adult human females who still have a uterus, and who are not pregnant or lactating, postmenopause is identified by a permanent (at least one year's) absence of monthly periods or menstruation. In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause is identified by a very high FSH level.<br>  <br>  In human females, menopause usually happens more or less in midlife, signaling the end of the fertile phase of a woman's life. Menopause is perhaps most easily understood as the opposite process to menarche, the start of the monthly periods. However, menopause in women cannot satisfactorily be defined simply as the permanent "stopping of the monthly periods", because in reality what is happening to the uterus is quite secondary to the process; it is what is happening to the ovaries that is the crucial factor.<br>  <br>  For medical reasons, the uterus must sometimes be surgically removed (hysterectomy) in a younger woman; her periods will cease permanently, and the woman will technically be infertile, but as long as at least one of her ovaries is still functioning, the woman will not have reached menopause; even without the uterus, ovulation and the release of the sequence of reproductive hormones will continue to cycle on until menopause is reached. But in circumstances when a woman's ovaries are removed (oophorectomy), even if the uterus were to be left intact, the woman will immediately be in "surgical menopause".<br>  <br>  Thus menopause is based on the natural or surgical cessation of hormone production by the ovaries, which are a part of the body's endocrine system of hormone production, in this case the hormones which make reproduction possible and may influence sexual behavior. The resultant decreased levels of circulating estrogen impacts the entire cascade of a woman's reproductive functioning, from brain to skin.<br>  <br>  The menopause transition, and post-menopause itself, is a natural life change, not a disease state or a disorder. The transition itself can be challenging for a number of women, but for others it is not difficult.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	You can see it coming on.|`|8bd023d619447668b8e9b545aa8635dbaa	no it does not. it will start showing its effect for nearly some 2 years or more before it occurs. some common symptoms are sudden burst of emotions and feeling insecure.|`|PDcnXgE6aa	No.......before complete cease of periods u will find irregular periods .......

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|avYLUlXnaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one thing which definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

I40iBJdHaa	sokokl is right, but i wouldn't even bother going to the doctors. i went for you when i found the exact same thing! it is your cervix.  i freaked out when i felt it! i was like, what the hell is that?! and yes, it hurts when it's hit hard. first i had asked my friend to explore herself and see if she had it and she did. then the next time i went to the gyno, i asked her as well. no worries. : )|`|OROeuP0yaa	may that is the G-spot|`|9pLdhuBnaa	That ball like lump that you noticed inside your vagina could be the cervix which is attached to the lower part of the uterus (an example only).<br>  <br>  I would recommend checking with your doctor as well (this can be done by phone as well) to see what they say.
KSUPtqCaaa	This does not sound very serious, and with some simple techniques, you should be able to overcome the problem.<br>  <br>  Let me start by saying you might still want to see your doctor, just to be on the safe side. If you follow my advice, and still have problems after a week or two, then you really do need to see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Although bladder infections can be a common cause of such problems, if you have been feeling fine and not had any fevers, chills, or foul smelling urine, it is unlikely this is the cause.<br>  <br>  A common cause is weakened pelvic floor muscles. Although more common in women who have given birth, it is still worth of consideration. A common type of exercises, called "Kegel Exercises", can help strengthen the muscles and improve bladder control. These exercises work on the pubococcygeus muscles.<br>  <br>  You can Google "Kegel" or "pelvic floor muscle training", or look at the Wikipedia entry describing it at:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exerc...</a><br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|TdROahUnaa	I think its normal...

Whenever I tell anyone this, they don't believe me, always thinking I'm 130 when they guess. If you look healthy and live a healthy life style, don't sweat it. We all carry our weight differently. However, if you're not happy with yourself, do something about it- the only opinion that really matters is your own. Just help yourself in a healthy way... meaning don't go overboard.

N4IvZmPiaa	When you burn propane with adequate air supplied to it, the only products of combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapour. It is only when you reburn those spent gases that you will begin to produce carbon monoxide. You should have a detector in that area.<br>  <br>  Any propane heater like that requires ventilation. The rule of thumb that we use is 1 square inch for every 1000 btu's. Look at the rating plate of the heater. It will probably say something like "btu input 50,000 at 11"wc. For 50,000 btu's you need 50 square inches of fresh air to supply the heater and allow spent gases to escape. So if there are windows in that pool room, you need to open at least one a few inches. Best case is to open one at each end of the room.

Em5WZlY2aa	Yes, you can. The only problem is that when you get your braces off later you'll have to readjust your embouchure because by then you'll have gotten used to playing with your braces. It takes a bit of time, but it shouldn't really be a problem|`|uv48B1Graa	It depends on your case. I play the clarinet and I have braces. The thing is, my teeth grew funny and even when I bit down, there was a hole, like a gap between my top teeth and my bottom teeth. The whole point of my braces is to close the hole.<br>  <br>  However, when you play clarinet, you're forced to press the mouth piece against your teeth. I tried every way, but my playing the clarinet everyday just reopened the whole every time my dentist closed it.<br>  <br>  I recommend you play the flute, because then you don't even have to worry about it. But if you just have a few crooked teeth, I don't think playing the clarinet should affect your teeth as much as it did mine.|`|XfaxjDyCaa	yes you can.<br>  the clarinet is about blowing, your tongue, and lips.<br>  ^^ha that sounds bad.<br>  but true.<br>  it's not about your teeth.<br>  so don't worry about your new train tracks.

If you have insurance, and are worried they won't cover it, call them or ask for your local insurance agent to come by and talk with you. Usually insurances do cover second opinions in serious cases like this.

rvBZPIv4aa	Everyone farts. I fart all day long,|`|cWuumdy7aa	asfar as farting is concerned both male and female are equal
CciXZNYraa	Don't eat late at night. <br>  Eating late at night can cause you to store more fat in your waist and stomach. Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you need a snack, eat something healthy like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts (unsalted). <br>  Eat often, but in small portions. The less your body peaks and falls on the blood sugar scale, the less likely it will be to overeat and/or store unwanted fat. Ideally, cut calories, but don’t starve yourself. If you eat the right foods and eat often enough, you won’t find yourself eating huge portions and overeating in general.<br>  Eat fats like fish oil, sunflower oil, flax seed oil. Also whole grains, legumes, and vegetables and limiting meats. Ease up on the salt and gassy foods that cause you to bloat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Get out and move. After what you put in your mouth, what you do with your body will determine if you can flatten your belly. Get at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day, along with a properly executed abdominal workout. Train your body with strength training activities. Adding muscle tone will help you perform all daily activities as well.<br>  <br>  You can also try these exercises:<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times. <br>  In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.<br>  <br>  Burn your belly fat by doing sit and reach exercise. <br>  Running and dancing early in the morning. <br>  Simple stretching and jumping when you wake up in the morning.|`|wnDPlEjDaa	Hi,<br>  Use Yoga therapy...<br>  1.

rbuBNDJbaa	Thyroid surgery is performed in a number of circumstances: <br>  <br>  When cancerous cells are found in and around the thyroid gland, all or part of the thyroid is typically surgically removed. <br>  When the thyroid enlargement - or goiter - has become so large that it is cosmetically necessary to remove it, or the size is making swallowing or breathing more difficult <br>  When thyroid nodules enlarge and make swallowing or breathing more difficult <br>  <a href="http://www.thyroid-info.com/articles/surgery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thyroid-info.com/articles/sur...</a>|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	The only reason to ever have your thyroid removed is for thyroid cancer. Anything else can be treated without ruining your life and your health. You will be left with permanent, irreversible, life-long hypothyroidism that you will have to treat every day for the rest of your life. You will fight and struggle with your doctor to get enough life sustaining replacement thyroid hormone pills.<br>  <br>  If you have a goiter and it is "strangling " you, get your thyroid problem treated, and the goiter will go down.<br>  <br>  So there's a reason that your doctor won't go over this with you. He doesn't want to allow you informed consent, because then you would never have the thyroidectomy. Your doctor is probably trying to cover up the fact that he has no idea how to thret thyroid problems. This is malpractice. Fire this docor, and find a new one who will do his job and dianose you completely, and treat your problem.|`|AA12266052	Thyroidectomy may be recommended for the following:<br>      * Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)<br>      * Thyrotoxicosis<br>      * Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) with enlargement of the gland<br>      * Cancer of the thyroid<br>      * Thyroid swelling (nontoxic goiter)<br>      * Hashimoto's disease (a type of hypothyroidism)<br>  The procedure may also be done if a patient with hyperthyroidism does not want to have radioactive iodine treatment and cannot be treated with anti-thyroid medications.<br>  When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, the outcome of thyroid surgery is usually excellent. Thyroid function tests may need to continue following thyroid surgery, and thyroid hormone replacement maybe necessary.|`|e5dd8de95a9d228f83e925125f175ae3aa	Hello - I can help with this as I had Thyroid cancer 8 years ago, and had my thyroid removed. <br>  <br>  You'll be glad to know that having your thryroid removed isn't that big of a deal - it's not like losing a kidney, liver, lung or something vital.<br>  <br>  If memory serves me correct your thyroid regulates your metabolism (sp?) - and quite simply they give you pills of thyroxine to replace what your thyroid does.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br>  <br>  Like any major operation - having the op and the immediate recovery isn't fun - your neck will swell up and they'll fit you with tubes to drain off fluid from your neck. These will be attached for a couple of days, so you'll be in bed for a bit.  <br>  <br>  I was home in 5 days though.  The scar has healed nicely - they cut along the natural folds in your neck to help hide the scar.  Straight after its a little sore, but I stopped taking the pain killers quite quickly.  But now its no problem at all.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned they give you pills to replace the chemical that your thyroid used to produce.  I take two little pills a day - and if I forget, no problem - you're not going to keel over if you forget to take them. <br>  <br>  Twice a year I go to the hospital for a blood check and check my dosage.  In the UK it also entitles me to free prescriptions - which is one bonus!<br>  <br>  So please dont worry.

wWk0kBScaa	If the colostomy was only meant to be temporary, which is often the case with diverticulitis, then it's very possible they have a loop colostomy. This means they will have two stomas - the main working stoma which leads to the upper digestive tract and a smaller (sometimes you can barely even see it) stoma called a mucous fistula which leads to the lower digestive tract and out the rectum and anus. <br>  <br>  Imagine a hose that is almost cut in half but about 1/4 is still left attached to the other so it's not entirely detached. This is how a loop ostomy is created. It makes it easier to reconnect up later. There are therefore, two openings as described above, one leading up, the other leading down.<br>  <br>  Because the two stomas are housed in the one bag, it's very possible for stool to evacuate from the 'working' stoma into the bag and then to make it's way from the bag into the mucous fistula and into the lower digestive tract. In most cases, it's simply eliminated via a normal stool (it often scares people because they're not aware it can happen, but it's completely normal and nothing to worry about). I would say that this is what has happened in the incident you describe above except that the family member has been unable to evacuate it normally for some unknown reason.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Well if he has a colostomy bag, then there shouldn't be anything getting into his rectum other than mucous-type drainage or what have you from the lining of his intestine/colon from the colostomy site and below, which is normal. Any "waste"should be routed to the bag instead, and there shouldn't be any way for it to get past that. That's the whole purpose of the bag is to give the lower area of the colon/intestines a rest so it can heal.  I would question WHY there is a connection between the two - the enema should NOT be going into the bag.  Something isn't right.... I would get a 2nd opinion if I were you.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	you go to the ER and demand an explanation!<br>  dont be shy!<br>  i think the fecal matter was left(forgotten?) when the colostomy surgery was done.<br>  this grapefruit-sized lump was in the lower area,right?past the colostomy,so the patient had a constant urge to have a bowel movement/pain/pressure.<br>  there should have been nothing left in the rectum,and the only stuff coming out would be a bit of mucus-no stools!<br>  also,when he was having those enemas:how in the world the water was coming up from the rectum,since the surgery the rectum is a blind loop?something is not good.|`|ImgouTRIaa	I am just a layman, a shopworker, but I have helped take care of older folks, and have a basic sense of anatomy, and this does not sound good. First off, does a colostomy negate the need to  empty one's bowels normally? I ask this because, as I understand it, the bag usage is in lieu of normal bowel movements. How would you get a mass that size, when the colostomy is in place, and the lower bowel is shut off below the colostomy? I always understood a C.B. was an either /or situation, the bag or normal defecation, not both. If I were you, I would demand an explanation for this mess, and if possible, another set of professional eyes to look this situation over , before you have a malfunction of a poorly done colostomy , and the bowel ruptures and kills your beloved with peritonitis, ( the bowel ruptures and fecal matter invades the abdomen , making for a hellacious infection, bringing on a miserable death) through ineptitude and stupidity. The sooner the better. God bless and good luck. Run , don't walk.

VqFRIJ44aa	As mentioned by many others above, muscle weighs more than fat. So first of all don't worry about what the scales are telling you...look at your body in the mirror..what's that telling you. Do you look fitter or fatter?<br>  <br>  Plus it looks like you are doing way too much cardio on a weekly basis...i know it may sound silly because we naturally associate cardio with weight loss, but you need to cut down on the cardio and make it much more intense than at the moment. High intense cardio will burn at least twice the amount of calories and fat than slow, boring same-paced cardio. As for your weights routine, it looks like you are actually doing muscle and strength training, rather than fat burning routines.<br>  <br>  So for your cardio, the principles you use for your running is what you need to do. Try any cardio machine where you put in all out 100% effort for a short burst and then a slower recovery period. So for example with your rowing, go all out full effort for 45 seconds and then a slower recovery pace for 90 seconds, repeat that 8-10 times and that will complete a cardio session for that day. What this does is raise your metabolism, which is what you need to do to start burning fat. The fat burning effects will happen while you are actually resting later in the day. For the treadmill, do 45 seconds at a steep incline and then 90 seconds at a flat slower recovery pace and again repeat 8-10 times.<br>  <br>  For your weights, you need to hit all the biggest muscle groups in the body to start the fat burning process. I have been trying the Daniel Craig James Bond Workout for the last few weeks (see below) and this has had great benefits. By completing a "circuit" of weights exercises, you are actually doing cardio again (your heart will be pumping and you will be sweating buckets), but also the additional benefits of a muscular workout.<br>  <br>  i note you haven't mentioned your nutrition at any point. Please be aware that any weight loss or fat burning program is actually 60% nutrition!|`|c9fd9858a55bd84164a363314546a804aa	many answers here already but try to measure your waist line sitting down after exhaling, this should be easy and more accurate as fat is usually mostly visible around the stomach, so always measure around the waist line where it seems the biggest area.<br>  <br>  Also try to reduce your carbohydrate intake so that your body uses more of the fat stores when exercising.|`|nBIiV5Svaa	even everthing out.

There is a great section on working out how much kcals you should be consuming everyday to stay at your current weight or how many if you want to lose/gain weight. There are also great menu plans and recipes in the book. Ignore that old myth about not eating later in the evening. You should you eat plenty of carbs and some protein within 2 hours post workout even if that means you finish working out later in the evening.

So, don't worry..<br>  <br>  But anyways, here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zjWPRLOyaa	Never mind the weight - as our friend says, muscle weighs more than fat. Maybe you should drop the gym and go for a good brisk walk every day; find a park or go out in the country. Fresh air and seeing nature in all her beauty will do you the world of good.<br>  Are you eating sensibly - wholemeal breads & pastas, brown rice, lots of fruit & veg?<br>  Don't bother with those awful protein shakes, have a small amount of whole milk, organic for preference, and walk off the fat. Try being veggie for a few weeks.<br>  Stop counting calories, stop weighing yourself (however much 87 Kgs are in reality) and stop worrying so much about You. Worry about someone who needs it - in fact join a voluntary group, and put your perfectionism to some real use before it turns into obsession.<br>  Sorry - I know that's rude, but it sounds like you need some fun in your life.

tMtBe1lKaa	definitley talk to your doctor. Some people start later than others, but 15 is definitely toward the end of the normal span. Your eating habits and weight do affect your hormones and period. If you aren't getting enough calories and nutrients, you will have irregular periods or an absence of periods. Google BMI to see if your weight is in the normal range for your age and height. Start to eat breakfast at least. Only eating one meal a day is really hard on your body. it's better to eat about 5-6 small meals or snacks a day than to go all day and only eat once. <br>  Take care of yourself, and talk toyour doctor. they do have tests and medications to start if they feel they need to. Also ask your mom, grandma or sisters when they started. If they were late too, it may be genetic.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Wouldn' t worry about the period not coming but you sure don't eat enough.

6ApIp7Ryaa	My mother has this condition. So far the only repercussions for her has been regular B12 injections, she was having them every 3 weeks but I think now she is down to every 12 weeks or so. The doctors check her B12 levels every six months now.<br>  <br>  She has been diagnosed for about 5 years now.<br>  <br>  Those problems are only an issue if you either can't or wont have the B12 injections. Apparently B12 helps produce red blood cells and so you are more likely to be anaemic. The nerve problems are from a very long term lack of B12.|`|CHQqhz7baa	As long as you take the B12 injections you will not have any repercussions. Spina Bifida is caused by a folic acid/folate deficiency.<br>  <br>  The name of the condition is called Pernicious Anemia.

8RCOlWdMaa	Don't worry! I suffered in exactly the same way but my GP referred me to a specialist who confirmed that the septum was bent - like you, I could hardly breathe at all. He took me in fairly quickly and straightened the septum, cauterised my nasal cavity and washed out my sinuses for good measure. <br>  <br>  It was done under general anaesthetic but I was only in hospital overnight. When you wake up you will have a bandage under your nose (to catch the draining fluid/blood) and you will find it really hard to swallow - your ears will feel like they are about to 'pop'. When you have the packing in your nose removed, after about 24 hours, it will feel a little bit better, but not alot! You will probably not be able to do much, certainly nothing strenuous, for about 2 weeks. After this you will be able to get back to normal. If you still find you are 'stuffed up', don't worry, after about 5 weeks, in my case, I started to sneeze and my nose cleared - I haven't had any breathing problems since, nor any colds at all! That was about 6 years ago.<br>  <br>  Not a pleasant experience but I would recommend it to anyone who suffers like this. It wasn't painful and I didn't get any black eyes or need a nose splint. Go and see you GP.  Good luck!|`|zD2NWrIzaa	get in touch with your doctor|`|sPapFBv1aa	My son had a similar problem. Took him to gp as he had breathing problems. we discovered he had a broken nose.

He didn't have many problems with the pain. Had to wear a nose splint for 5 days but that was about it. He was in and out of hospital in one day.<br>  Go see your gp.
Aj5f5LeNaa	All your symptoms point to an obvious case of dramatic hair growth. This occurs when your hormones are out of controle in the pubic (teenage) stage of life. It is a very rare disease and there is nothing you can ever do to get rid yourself of this contagious and ugly disease. I know this as I am an experienced doctor, I focus in the area of hair growth on the body. All you can do is wax, shave or pluck the hairs.

Taking antibiotics while on the pill stops the pill from working while you are on them.  That is usually one thing your Doc should of asked is if you are on any other prescription medications when they prescribed the antibiotic.  Wait another few days and get a pregnancy test and find out for sure.  Take care of yourself!

efa3a4f2facfb1fd057a71ddccbe4c1daa	a temporary crown is fitted to prevent adjacent teeth to drift to close the place. The temporary crown is fitted with temporary cement. When the permanent crown is fitted, it will not come out.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	Yes, it can get infected if left off too long. It's not a complete tooth so there is nothing to protect it anymore, no enamel or anything. That's why they put the temporary crown on it to begin with. It's to keep it clean till they can get it permanently fixed. And it IS temporary so it's NOT suppose to stay on forever. I don't understand yet why it's coming off so many times and so soon after getting done but it dose happen more then you would think- again, it's only a temp. Why hasn't you doctor done anything yet? If your appointment for the final crown is just a few days away and there is no sensitivity you may leave it off. However, if your appointment is not very soon, or it won't easily seat back into place, then call you dentist and get you appointment moved to a earlier date- today even.<br>  <br>  --Good Luck, CutieNiki

If you want a long-term solution, build more activities into your daily life. This could be walking further, joining a club where you are required to be active, cycling, swimming or whatever works for you. Also eating (a larger) healthy breakfast will give you more energy and discourage snacking. <br>  <br>  Making lifestyle changes is not always easy, so don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results or find it difficult to keep up a healthy routine - its normal - just do the bits you can do, and if you fall off the track, brush yourself down and try again. Trying is the first step towards succeeding and failures teach us how we can improve. <br>  <br>  Finally one point not to overlook is that we are all different shapes and sizes, and being a bit larger isn't something to be ashamed of.

Cut out soft drinks, just lots of pure fruit juices or plain water.<br>  Now your folks have to pay for your food, so why not get a paper-round or a Saturday job of some kind, so you can offer to help out?

The way to do this is plain and simple, cardio and dieting. <br>  <br>  As far as exercises, I recommend using heavy resistance on abdominal workouts as this will build mass and therefore cause the muscles to stick out more.<br>  <br>  Try it and see if it helps you, if done correctly, you will without a doubt see the results you desire.|`|nGjCDH1Xaa	i was told sit ups r really good 4 ur sixpak

Take a hot shower and then about an hour before you want to go to sleep sit in a darkened room with nothing to stimulate your mind (tv, computer , music) light a candle and just look at it and relax. Clear your mind and just concentrate on the candle. When you feel tired , go to bed and sleep. If you do not fall asleep in 20 min. get up and start the process over again. It may take a few times at first but what this does is teach your mind that when you go to bed it is time to shut down and sleep. If you are still having problems a sleep specialist is who you need to see. They really helped me.

You should seek the help of a doctor that they can feel comfortable with. Also it is important to a support group or some other form of long-term support to help you maintain your efforts. <br>  <br>  An eating disorder is not something you can "fix" by yourself. You need a very structured, on-going eating disorder program, most likely an in-patient program. You need to be hospitalized for maximum benefit from the eating disorder program; being treated as an out-patient gives you ample opportunity to not follow the instructions of the program and thereby failing to recover.|`|CrZxYK5raa	talk to your best friend ask her to go with you to talk to your mom or someone who will listen. its NOT your fault she is doing this to you. try to stop and talk to someone before it gets to late.

Shaving makes it seem thicker but its not, when you shave, the hairs are just being cut off at the stem but keeps on growing so then it will grow back blunt.<br>  <br>  waxing tears out the hair all together in stead of the hair continuously growing, it gets, for lack of a better word, re-created.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.
R7VjuCT2aa	First off your BF is, in fact, as the user above said, a moron and an inconsiderate ***.<br>  <br>  Mental illnesses are infamous for causing physical symptoms and as your contact I actually care for your well being. If these problems are affecting your life in ways that prevent you from doing things you normally do and causing preoccupation then it's time to see a professional. Be honest with your doc and tell him how you are feeling physically and are concerned it could be something to do with anxiety. Only he will be able to tell you for sure.<br>  <br>  Act sooner rather than later because as someone who has gone through depression it will be much easier to conquer if you tackle it early. What is even better is that you realize there is a problem. Good luck Lorianna!!|`|OJ59VvHzaa	Your boyfriend sounds like a moron, don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's talking about. When you're stressed your body reacts to the situation. Before going into an exam have you never needed to pee real bad, or when you're stressed doesn't your appetite change? <br>  Because you think you're "smart" does that mean you won't get cancer? No. So why would you be immune to mood disorders? It's an illness, but it's got a stigma attached to it. Go to your doctor, he can put you on pills or send you for treatment to learn how to react differently in situations that stress you.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	Your not crazy for having a panic attack. It may not even be a disorder if it just happens when you have reason for it to happen. If it happens for small reasons or for no reason at all, then it may be a disorder. In which case you shouldn't feel like you're any less intelligent for letting it happen because, guess what, you have no control of whether you get the disorder or not. But you can do something about it so you have better handle on it. Go see you doctor and make a list of all your symptoms; just don't go over bored or you'll seem like a hypochondriac.<br>  <br>  --Good Luck, CutieNiki|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.
Y4s4Om38aa	Well it sounds like the younger sister feels very ignored because of her sister getting extra attention due to being sick.  Unfortunatly, even explaining the cancer to her most likely wouldnt make her feel any better.  All she sees is her sister gets attention she doesnt, and her sister ruins her fun because they have to go home early when she is tired.  Young kids that feel ignored will become attention seeking, thoughing tantrums, and just all together difficult because it gets some attention on her.  <br>  <br>  Could maybe suggest, depending on the situation, sometimes when they go out and Jade feels tired, only one parent take her home, and the other stay with Nicole and allow her to have fun.  Or if it is with family, like Nicole is over your house having fun offer to let her stay with you.  Otherwise, her parents probably should have a "Nicole and daddy" and "Nicole and mommy" days everyonce in a while.  Give her some time just her being the focus of the parents attention.....even if just going out to a fast food resturant and to the playground for a few hours.<br>  <br>  Is often the case with a young child that has a baby introdused to the family.   Baby seems to take all the attention from them, and they cant stay places cause the baby gets fussy and so ruins the fun.   My friend has a 4 year old boy and an infant and that is the case.  Every once in a while she will take off work early and pick the 4 year old up and take him to lunch and out to a movie or something, leaving the baby in daycare til the normal time she would be picked up.  He gets so excited about his "mommy and him" days.  If he knows about it coming up before hand he looks forward to it so much.|`|Lnqj0IlYaa	I know where you are coming from. My little nephew has had Leuikemia twice now. Once when he was 3 then again at 5. He was flown from Hobart to Melbourne overnight. His little sister was 1 the first time and 3 the second. She suffered enormously. But now what you have to do is make them both feel special. If treatment is finished then you ask both the kids whats being happening. Make a big deal out of 2nd  childs activites. They love it. The cancer patient might get a bit "shitty" at 1st then they just do their own thing. Just try it. Talk to cancer patient 1st "they love it" and then make a bigger deal of the next child. It works believe me, being doing it for 2 years.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	You might enjoy reading about Terry Wallis, who came out of a 20 year Coma. Wallis had been thrown from his pickup truck, and had Diffuse Axonal Injury. The hospital did the usual tests and he was pronounced in a persistent vegetative state. Later the family would see signs that he was trying to communicate, and that he was trying to reach for things, but the hospital refused to retest. The signs are<br>  Inconsistent intelligible verbalization. Trying to reach for things. And when the patient is presented with something that smells noxious, they turn head away.   When he was finally scanned it was shown that the brain had repaired itself  by making new pathways from the left side of the brain to the right. Now it is important to remember that he was in an accident. Usually after drugs, (as in the case of Terry Schiavo) the brain shrinks,  when they did the autopsy after  Schrivo's death her brain    was not trying to make new pathways. So the brain forms new pathways to take care of functions after an accident, but does not recover after drug use.( My conclusion).

efa3a4f2facfb1fd057a71ddccbe4c1daa	it all depends on if you have space between your teeth so that teeth can be pulled in, if there is no space, you need to remove 4 teeth to create space to pull teeth in. Its an expensive treatment because it take a lot of time, 2-3 years.|`|og2zUpa4aa	Your teeth are being extracted not because for placement of your braces, but to create space so that your rest of the teeth or the teeth which has not erupted yet (if any), gets into proper alignment, hence they become straight. I am afraid, this is the best way to treat such cases. And yes, this is expensive too.|`|gvGDP5ecaa	Invisalign can straighten your teeth, but if your teeth are too crooked, Invisalign may not work very well.  However, Invisalign is also usually more expensive than braces.

HO3f9ZFoaa	I have been on Duromine 30mg for about 3 weeks, and lost 6kg. I'm not obese either - I only needed to lose about 10-12kg. There are reports of bad side effects all over the internet but what I experienced was feeling a bit restless and not sleeping well for a couple of days, slight heart palpitations for about 4 days, and nothing else. I feel normal on them now, the only side effect is a dry mouth/thirst. It seems everyone is different and some people get bad side effects while others get hardly any. One thing worth mentioning is that it seems to affect people prone to depression and anxiety differently and more severely, from what I have heard.
ANRTDInTaa	you are not fat....and one meal a day is very unhealthly for a young girl like you.u seem to be very active aswell....maybe u shud start eating healthier  foods, perhaps your "one meal a day" that are you having is too packed with calories. have atleast 3 meals a day.breakfast can be  a high fibre cereal , lunch can be a feta green salad and dinner can be proteins and veg(dont fry it).perhaps no carbs.|`|7c4ea61e236a43cc2894889b9893fee8aa	Sweetheart, you are underweight already.

You have to eat to have energy and if you want to lose more weight you have to up our activity level.  I would not want to loose much more than you have all ready.  Up your protein and you should see a difference. If you are truly over weight check with your Doctor for more advice.  Good luck.
ImgouTRIaa	You are being sucked in to a systematic means of self destruction, both mentally and physically. I notice you "feel" fat, don't buy into that, your peers and their  attitudes are degrading your self worth, and you are letting them get to you. If you were 5'3" and 185, ate at greasy spoon or fast food restaurants 5 out of 7 days a week, I'd say you had issues that were real and had to be addressed by YOU, they were actually things you had to something about.

You need to buck up, they need to go away.|`|q1KSTbqnaa	don't be worried. you sound healthy to me , all those sports you do. what you need to do is do something wher your size is a positive. soccer is good, keep it up. if you look in the real world , generally people are large and only in the media are they pushed into being skinny. you are still growing up and only 14 , therefore your body is going through a changing process and your metalbolism changes aswell. you may find that you lose wieght without trying. just keep doing what you are doing. it sounds healthy.
oMpNorCfaa	It is possible it is broken if it is a deep shade of purple.  How long ago did she injure it?  If she isn't able to move it and if it's swollen I would say it could be broken.  Would probably be a good idea do get it checked out.  Tell her she won't look stupid.  Trust me. I work at a Hospital and people come in with things that are stupid and a possibly broken finger isn't stupid.  <br>  Put ice on it and don't move the finger or hand until you get it checked out.<br>  If she doens't get it straightened out or if it doesn't straighten out on it's own she could end up with way more serious problems like loss of blood flow to part of the finger.  The worst case scenario for that would be losing part or all of the finger if blood does not flow through the whole finger it will slowly die off and then there's no choice but to remove it!|`|kmIcAySEaa	The deep shade of purple represents severe bruising, which means she busted some capilaries/veins causing blood to leak out. This is inductive of a broken bone. If she cant move it, more than likely it is broken. Yes it could grow back that way if it cant be moved into proper digit placement. I would certainly see a Dr. Let him take x-ray and be sure. This osunds broken and with the way you describe it I dont think the Dr. will think anybody is silly for coming in.

I have never gone to hospital, though, because mine were not badly broken, and if I went to the hospital, there would be nothing that they could do.<br>  I would say that your friends finger is definately broken. As it is bent, I would recomend that she goes to the hospital. It needs to be straitened out and sorted out there as if she just leaves it, it is likely that when it heals it will still be bent.<br>  Even if it's not as serious as it may seem, she won't look stupid.

There are several things that can easily classify vegetables as a wonder weight loss food. Vegetables are a good source of low calorie fiber. Apart from fiber, they also contain good amount of water and very few calories. Moreover, they are filling and do not leave you feeling hungry or deprived. When you are on a weight loss diet, supplementing your daily diet with vegetables is very important for your digestion. <br>  <br>  Fruits<br>  ----------<br>  Most of you must already be aware that fruits are extremely good for your health. Fruits are rich in various vitamins and nutrients that are essential for your body. While on a crash diet, the first thing that your body sheds is water which reflects in the form of kilos lost. For any diet it is important to make sure that the water content of your body is not hampered, it is the fat which you have to shed. Hence, we can easily say that water is an important element in any diet and can be found in almost all the fruits. <br>  <br>  Green Tea<br>  --------------<br>  You must have heard lot of people ranting about the benefits of green tea. Studies after studies have proven that green tea offers excellent health benefits. You must also have read that green tea helps in losing weight<br>  <br>  Wholegrain Food Products<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  Switching from white refined foods to whole grain foods is one of the best decisions you can make for your health. The white refined foods are stripped of their nutritional value. White refined foods include, white bead, white rice, maida and so on. White refined foods are usually high in calorific value and detrimental to health. Whereas, wholegrain foods are in their original form and are rich in nutrients and fiber.<br>  <br>  Water<br>  --------<br>  The proper working of your metabolism depends on your water intake. When you do not drink enough water, your metabolism slows down and you burn fewer calories. Experts have suggested that drinking about two liters of water everyday is essential for the normal functioning of the body|`|v1X5hIdlaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to consume less food and workout more often, the problems surface when we in reality attempt to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The only thing which clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off 30 pounds, it clearly does produce results!
i1IE4Yztaa	Yikes, might be strep throat, in which case you WILL want to go to a doctor.  <br>  <br>  To the person who posted above, take it easy.  I'd want to know as much as possible before I resolved going to the doctor, since it can be expensive, and many people have neither insurance nor the money to cover it.  I wouldn't want to go to the doctor unless body parts were falling off before my very eyes, lol.|`|AA10950857	You could have some type of infection in your throat.

You probably hurt your back or tweaked it at one time and now it's causing you problems.  What happens is that the muscles in your core (hips, thighs, buttocks, lower back) spasm and get knotted.  When this happens they pull your pelvis and spine out of alignment.  What I did to stop my problems is to start doing inversion therapy or hang upside down with gravity boots.  As you invert the muscles of your abs are stretched and the knots are broken up.  As this happens they release their grip on the muscles in your hips and thighs.  As they loosen they will release their grip on the muscles in your lower back.  As this happens they in turn release their grip on your pelvis and lower spine and allow it to go back into alignment naturally with gravity.  When your spine and pelvis are out of alignment it effects the sciatic nerve and that's what's causing your pain.  I guarantee if you try inversion therapy within a week or so your pain will be gone.  Here's a good site to read about what I'm talking about.  Hope this helps.
LOhoZ4o6aa	THAT LAST ANSWER IS NOT TRUE! KIDS DO HAVE ROOTS TO THEIR TEETH!<br>   there are a few options, and it is best to keep baby teeth as they keep the space for big teeth to grow into.<br>  a dentist may perform a vital pulpotomy which is removing the top part of the nerve, dressing it all and then the roots will resorb normally. A stainless steel crown may be placed over the top to preserve what remains of the tooth.<br>  <br>  But really important is..... why did the kid need root canal treatment at 3? all thhe teeth are only just in the mouth! if you are concerned about the aadult teeth then you need to change brushing, fluoride and sugar habits now.|`|NqfUPKiSaa	For babies root canal treatment is not done<br>  The Dentist will decide the alternative method|`|og2zUpa4aa	Primary teeth have roots which are shorter and broader as compared to the permanent ones. A child can undergo RCT without any problem depending on the case. Extraction of the primary teeth at such a tender age is not advisable as it may cause, what we call arch - length deficiency which will affect the proper alignment of the permanent dentition in future. So go for RCT if your dentist advises. And yes, the permanent dentition is definitely going to come up at its normal time.|`|p8LB7EMcaa	the best person to ask this quoestion is a dentist. consult atleat 2 dentists before going in for such a treatment. and i wonder, how does a child need a root canal treatment at 3yrs of age?|`|m4RATUW5aa	decidous teeth have no roots. the permanent ones will reupt when time right|`|htBHCNDtaa	No because there are no roots in children's baby teeth.

dxSKKSQcaa	Chico, where do you live?  Are you in the hospital right now?  From what I gather from your other questions, you were involved in an automobile accident April of 2008.  You had three different surgeries since then, had your leg casted, and told by your doctors that you were fine to go back to work.  Your were still in agonizing pain from your ankle whenever you tried to walk, so you had them do another x-ray, and they subsequently let you know that it is worse than it was before.  Now they want to amputate your leg.<br>  <br>  You state you were treated horribly at the hospital, and that some of the techniques they used were wrong.  Can you tell me what they did wrong?  Can you also tell me the reason for why they want to amputate your leg?  Do you have any other medical disorders, such as diabetes?  You stated that you have good blood flow, can move your toes, and don't have a blood disorder, which I think is why the doctors told you they want to amputate your leg.  Perhaps (and this is me guessing) they put the cast on too tight, which led to decreased blood flow in your leg, which hindered your body's ability to heal, which may have lead to an infection, which may lead to amputation.  <br>  <br>  You don't have insurance, and I know hospital care is costly, but you have the power to make the decision to be treated elsewhere.  You demand that they transfer you to another hospital.  Hospitals can transfer you at your request even before you have been stabilized and against medical advice as long as you provide informed consent.  Your medical records, tests, x-rays, and such will be transfered with you.  It might cost a lot more at another hospital, but if you are being treated so poorly there that you believe they want to amputate your leg for no medical reason, then I think it is better to be in debt.  <br>  <br>  Also, get a lawyer!  Like, right now.  Some won't charge unless they win the case, others may do it pro bono.  Some offer free consultation.  So, if I were you, I would definitely contact a lawyer as soon as possible.  Tell your doctors that you are going to get a lawyer, and they better not have caused anything that led to your amputation, because you can sue their socks off.  Tell them that if there is anything else they can do besides amputation they should do it, because if not, and if they caused the infection, they may lose their license and their money.

fk9AvB25aa	Not necessarily, but this is what many people think when it comes to herpes. All it takes is to kiss some one with and out break of cold sores (which can be caused by oral herpes HSV1). Some people who have oral herpes contracted it as a child. You could have gotten it from a relative with cold sores giving you a kiss. <br>  You have also been only with him for 16 years, he could have been a carrier which means he shows little to no symptoms of herpess. Either you contracted it from him or when you were a child.<br>  Oral herpes is also common (8 out of 10 people in the world have it) to have so there is a good chance that he could have it too.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Not necessarily, he may have....uh...you may have...um...okay, it means he cheated. Sorry.|`|fAFXkikAaa	No.  It does not mean that he cheated on you.<br>  <br>  Most adults (50% to 80%) have oral herpes (which is what it would be if you experience outbreaks on your chin).   It is usually caught in childhood from kissing relatives and it is not an STD.<br>  <br>  Also, you can have herpes for many years without any symptoms - which is how SO many people have it without knowing it.  In fact, you may have caught oral herpes when you were a child and are only now getting symtpoms.    <br>  <br>  All it means is that at some point in your life your face came in contact with someone else who had oral herpes.  Maybe your grandmother, maybe your first kiss, maybe that quick smooch from Aunt Mabel.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Doesn't mean he cheated.<br>  It depends on what strain of Herpes you have.<br>  <br>  If you are doubting his fidelity, get further tests done
93c878b05606a22f5b62decd4c13ecc9aa	From a medical perspective, there are a number of possibilities.  The simplest remedy you can try is to have her take some magnesium.  This will help the muscles relax.  You can get magnesium in various ways: tablets of magnesium oxide (250 mg), Phillip's Milk of Magnesia (ordinarily used as an antacid, but just take a smaller dose), or you can get a calcium/magnesium combination, sometimes called dolomite.<br>  <br>  If this does not improve the spasms, go the next step....which is a bit more involved.  Find out if your friend has a number of silver fillings in her teeth, or if she has had some other exposure to mercury.  Find a toxicologist, who may recommend an HMA test (hair mineral analysis) to look at the mineral balances and toxin levels in your body.  If the toxins are high, the toxicologist may recommend chelation treatment to help remove them.<br>  <br>  Mercury has been associated with muscle spasms, mostly because it has a negative charge and is attracted to the fatty tissue (myelin sheath) surrounding the nerves.  Once there, it hinders the nerve signals, and thus prevent the brain from being able to control the muscles.<br>  <br>  Here is a video about what mercury does to nerve cells, courtesy of the University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://commons.ucalgary.ca/mercury/" rel="nofollow">http://commons.ucalgary.ca/mercury/</a><br>  OR<br>  <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/538419/how_mercury_produces_brain_damage/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacafe.com/watch/538419/how...</a>

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that.

That does nothing - if anything it causes your body to break down muscle because it has no other source of fuel.

I do this in the morning before getting a shower, but at night i would put a smaller bit of benzoyl peroxide on a wet cotton pad as it does'nt dry the skin as much and therefore no need for putting moisturizer on b4 going to bed.<br>  <br>  I also use 10% sialyic acid, put that on a cotton pad and rub into my pores all over face, this will be more affective than benzoyl peroxide but you should only do it once a week as it really removes the top dead layer of skin and lets the new skin underneath breath, therefore cleaning out the pores and preventing them from being clogged up, you will also need a good moisturizer for this.|`|vPI1hVGUaa	What works for me is using a good mask to exfoliate dead skin cells and steaming your face or warm compress for few minutes.

The reason is that the sugar content varies by species of the same fruit and by the growth of the fruit, and how long since it was picked. But basically, any fruit TASTES sweet because it IS sweet -and that means is has sugar in it. And, as you may have noticed, the longer those peaches sit on the counter, the sweeter they get -as they approach fermentation stage.<br>  <br>  Let's not get into discussions about "natural" versus "manufactured" sugar.

If you cannot move your neck without pain then you may have slipped a disk in your neck (very painful by the way). Even if it is just a strain do you really want to take the chance? It isusually ok to see if it resolves itself, however if your hand has gone numb then it sounds to me like its getting worse.<br>  Only you can judge how bad the pain is but if it is bad then why risk it?

This sometimes will make a pop like any other joint when you move it. <br>  <br>  If something shifted out of whack, depending on where you put pressure and on what nerves you can get pain, pressure, and numbness in your arm and hand also.<br>  <br>  Remember, these nerves also go to muscles in that area, so you can have muscle spasm and tightness as well.<br>  <br>  I would see your doctor or chiropractor and use ice in the mean time on the left neck and shoulder.  Most likely there have probably been some shifts or misalignments of the spine for some time due to poor posture or maybe a past injury.  And rolling over to quick or in just the wrong way something shifted more, enough to put pressure on a nerve and cause pain and problems. <br>  <br>  Once you get it checked out and get it to calm down a bit try a good neck pillow when sleeping.|`|rgwNRg3xaa	yes go see a dr

But I would contact her family and friends to start a support circle for her. When someone has cancer, it's not just hard on the patient, it's hard on everybody, so with a support circle, everyone won't just be there for her, they'll be there for each other. Everyone needs to be strong for her to get her through this. You don't want her to give up hope. With her prognosis, she may not want anything to do with a support circle at first, but she'll come around and realize that it was done out of love. <br>  <br>  If you haven't done so already, get a second opinion. I lost my dad because his doctor admittedly didn't care anymore because he was retiring soon.
RNNdRHrMaa	As in Cystitis????<br>  With any urinary infection (be it bladder or kidney), you need to line the pipes to help prevent further infections.<br>  Drink LOTS of water, cranberry juice is good for the lining of the tract.<br>  <br>  There are over the counter remedies for cystitis, but keep pestering the doc, as there maybe an underlying problem, that could need strong anti-biotics. You will never completely rid yourself of infection, as it is always present, it just flairs up.<br>  If it is that bad, go back to your doctor and complain.<br>  <br>  If it is cystitis, then you can prevent it by emptying your bladder before and after sex, drinking lots of water and changing they style you have sex.

Certain Antibiotics will only work on one type of bacteria (normally anaerobic) so if the infection carries on you need a different type of bacteria. It is not uncommon to require re-treatment.<br>  <br>  GP's do NOT normally give more than one type of Antibiotics or anti-fungal at a time as the risk of side effects outweighs the inconvenience caused by having to go back.<br>  <br>  Also note it is important to always finish the course and not stop early otherwise YOU create antibiotic resistant strains that are more difficult to cure.<br>  <br>  Go Back to your GP for a second round of treatment!|`|DtG4zpM2aa	I'm a bit surprised that you'd be more inclined to trust a 'natural cure' that you can get over the internet than antibiotics, which have had numerous tests on them in terms of their safety and efficacy and are prescribed by a doctor.   Sometimes it happens that the antibiotic that is first prescribed isn't the treatment to which that particular infection is most sensitive and a different antibiotic is needed instead.  As a doctor I can testify to the fact that antibiotics do work, if it is the right antibiotic to treat that specific infection.  I think you should go back to your doctor to have your urine checked to see if this is the case and also to see if there might be any underlying problems causing you to get recurrent UTIs.|`|AA11589437	Antibiotics sometimes need more time or a different antibiotic. You can't say "they don't work". You have to get a sensitivity test, to see what antibiotic is the right one for this bacteria. Then you have to take that specific drug. Perhaps you need a more powerful one than the one you took.<br>  <br>  Cranberry juice helps with E.coli only, I think.<br>  rinking a lot of water also helps, but it won't kill the bacteria. Only antibiotics vcan cure you, but there are some persistant bacteria and you must be persistant too..|`|KL1GW0wpaa	Urgh.  You might need to go and get more antibiotics for this bout, but try to drink a glass of cranberry juice every day or so.  It is not definite, but studies suggest that cranberry can stop the infection sticking to the walls of your bladder, and is therefore a good and inexpensive preventative measure.  Plus it's so good for you in many other ways.|`|eTxG1sr2aa	You to get tablets off  the doc called diclaphenic these help with pain in the renal tract , this drug is also used for renal colic caused by kidney stones|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	It's not true that antibiotics don't work - sometimes infections are resistant to a certain antibiotic. You need to take a urine sample to your doctor and say that you have had the infection for 3 weeks and it has been treated with [name of antibiotic] and it hasn't worked. They can then send the sample away to see which specific bacteria is causing the infection, so they can use a more specific antibiotic.<br>  Most infections do clear up with one course of antibiotics, so it would be too expensive to go through all this procedure with everyone who goes to the doctor with a urinary tract infection, but it is available if you ask for it.<br>  Cranberry juice will not cure a UTI, but sometimes it relieves symptoms or helps to prevent further infection by building up the immune system. Drinking plenty of water also helps to flush out the bugs and relieve symptoms, but it still needs treating with antibiotics otherwise the infection can back up to the kidneys|`|vPI1hVGUaa	Natural cures are hit and miss, but here are a few resources for you. <br>  <br>  How To Heal A Urinary Tract Infection with Water - <a href="http://www.articlesniffer.com/Articles/27084/87/How-To-Heal-A-Urinary-Tract-Infection-With-Water.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesniffer.com/Articles/2...</a><br>  <br>  This one talks about how to heal a urinary tract infection with hydrotherapy, juice therapy, reflexology, and herbal therapy<br>  <a href="http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Bookshelf/Books/21/208.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Book...</a> - <br>  <br>  This one talks about healing with Cranberry <a href="http://www.safealternativemedicine.co.uk/UrineInfectionCranberry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safealternativemedicine.co.uk...</a><br>  <br>  Again, many natural healing methods but everyone's body is different :)|`|WdV6is3vaa	Well the fact that you have a re-occuring UTI tells me that you might possibly have something about your life style that is causing them.  I would speak to you PCP (Primary Care Physician) about what generally causes them and then correct the issues at hand.  Antibiotics do work when you haven't built up an immunity to them, and you might require a Z-Pack to get rid of a particularly nasty UTI.  The sad fact about life is, if you want a service...then you have to pay.  Even back when Nurse maids and natural healers were your neighborhood doctor you still had to give them some type of compensation for their services...be it a gift, a meal, or beads...there was still a form of payment.  If your into herbal remedies then you might also inform your PCP of this as well and they might help you find more natural ways to treat your problems.  Many forms of treatment for all sorts of ailments are getting a lot of credit and recognition from normal Doctors now.
