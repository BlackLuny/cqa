On Monday, I decided to call it off and I realized that I deserve someone better. On Tuesday, this really good looking guy came into the hardware store I work at. He asked me for help, but my male coworker who is older and clueless, decided he would help him. The good looking guy looked at me before he followed my coworker. Then when he walked by, he looked at me again. I was helping a customer and I could see him at cash, and he looked at me again. He also came in later. I think he knew I was checking him out too. The next day, I usually take my lunch at 2, but at 1230 I wasn't feeling well. I felt really weak, so I figured some food would help me. So I went for lunch at 1. When I got back at 2, the guy came in not even 2 minutes after I had just gotten back. Isn't that weird? What do you think?

Following in their footsteps, WAIT. who are they and why are we following in their footsteps. Hi iam Josephine and right now ill be discusing with you about following in their footsteps.      Our wholle assignment is called following in their footsteps but do any of you know whos footsteps where following or even what the meaning of following in their footsteps is?      Whos footsteps are we following? The person could be any one that you look up to and want to be just like because of something that person has achieved, it could even be someone like Victor Chang, because of everything he achieved, like his digrees, and all the surgeries he preformed.

What do they mean by following in their footsteps is, the person being your role model and you trying your hardest in accomplishing what they did and even trying to accomplish more.      But it doesnt always have to be someone famous it could even be someone from the community that you want to be like, maybe a teacher, or your parents, your next door neighbour.

20090227101632AAowNL2	Education & Reference;Teaching	Part 2 of I THINK MY TEACHER LIKES ME?	ok so before somethings had been happening and i asked for help here and um today some thing else happened ( if you havent read the other part read it  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    ) so today i had english last lesson and i went to my class there was some other people that said " sir can i hand out the sheets" and he said " yes" but i asked can i do it next time and he said " you can do it now so he told the other person that its my job when it really isnt i do hand out the sheets but not too much i hope that makes sense. and as i was handing them out i looked at him and he just looked at me in my eyez.      ok so after that we got our work back this girl got the highest and all he said to her is well done and it was her first time i got the second highest and it wasnt my first time and he wrote outstanding you eally made me believe your story!. and he mentioned my name in the class now i get good grades and i thought it was a bit mean of him not to really realise the other girls work and not really say anything about it. so after that we watched a movie and i kept noticing him staring @ me  1 or twice he just kept his gaze and was kinda smiling not really obvious smile but i could tell. and the rest of the time he quickly looked away.      After that this boy sits next to me and he kept saying what do you do what does this mean etc... i knew the boy knew what to do he was just winding me up. ans i just said " hush (his name) and i rolled my eyez at him as i was going to look back down i notice my teacher looking straight in my eyez and coming my direction and he was like to me "well done you always help me" and i was like " sir he's so annoying" and hes like " your like my little assistent always helping me out arent you? always straightning him ou and telling him to hush " aand it made me smile so when i looked at him he was looking at me and smiling too!      um.. yh at the end the boy was like ahh ( my name) do you smoke weed and i just told him to shut up and he did and my teacher was like " you sorted him ou?" with a smile and i was like ! yeah" and first  he looked in my eye and said "excellent" then when i looked away he said excellent. by the way im not a teachers pet and he always lookes at me when im doing my work and when i look up he either looks away or he keeps his gaze with a smile ( how cheeky) so please give me some mature answers does he really like me? ( by the way he doesnt do that to another girl its just me) no rude comments please   thankou.

OK so i'm a junior in high school and we have to turn in our next year class paper this Friday coming up. I keep thinking over and over what classes I should take, but I need some help. This is what I have so far:      1) Engish 12   2) AP Govt.   3) Intro to Art.   4) Spanish 3   5) Psychology (not sure if I should take AP)   6) (For my last class I'm not sure if I should take a fourth year of science with Oceanography or take a fourth year of math with AP Calc or AP Sats)      I'm actually really kind of scared of taking Ap calc because i'm not sure if I can pass the class. Many of my senior friends who are taking Ap cal said the teacher teaches as if she wants you to fail the class. And if I take AP stats I know I can pass that class because the teacher of Ap stats is my current Pre-calculus teacher, so I kow I can pass that class. Or should I just take a forth year of science with Oceanography (easy A). So I need some help guys. Oh and what should I do about my psych class AP or regular?

Write T or F       1 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle invented details about what the boarding party found.     2 Pemberton said that there was more than one survivor.     3 There is no record of Pemberton having been on the ship.     4 No one believed Pemberton's story.     5 There is no evidence that the crew were hallucinating when they abandoned ship     6 It is impossible for ships to contain deadly moulds.     What happened to the crew?   The end of the official enquiry into the wreck of the Mary Celeste marked the beginning of many theories about what may have happened. Why did the crew abandon the ship in such a hurry? One famous version of events was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. He describes how the boarding party found freshly cooked food on the captain's table, and important documents missing. But this was pure fiction.      The strangest twist in the story emerged almost 50 years after the Mary Celeste was found abandoned. A man named Pemberton claimed to have been on board the ship. According to Pemberton, there was a violent argument between the Captain and the rest of the crew. Only Pemberton escaped alive. However, for some reason, he kept the story to himself for the next half century. This story is almost certainly untrue. For Pemberton's name is not even on the official crew register of the voyage. Yet the fact that he was able to convince people to take him seriously shows how few sensible theories were around at the time.      Some theories have more to do with illness. One is that the crew ate mouldy bread. Eaten in quantity, it might have been possible that they experienced hallucinations. However, all the signs are that the crew were perfectly sane when they jumped off the ship. Another is that the wood of the ship contained a killer fungus. This makes a little more sense, as some ships have been known to have lethal moulds. But how the crew all came to be poisoned quickly, and at the same time, and why they then left the ship, is a mystery in itself

This was my first time filling it out, and now I see why many people say its difficult, or they just don't even want to fill it out. Do they possibly do that on purpose just to discourage some of us? Seams like the U.S government has its own ways. If you think about it, its like telling someone no you have to have this, so they go and think of a loophole out of it. Imagine if our government did not give out  aid to students who needed, it would create all sorts of controversy. So they go ahead and have it, but they know they cant pay everyone, nor do they want to pay everyone, so they think of ways to deny aid, FAFSA application is their first barrier.

20090307204344AAUe7Y9	Education & Reference;Special Education	A question about retention of my 6th grade son with autism.?	I am in a dispute with my school district over whether he is ready for junior high.  The policy states that it is a team decision so the 'team' was loaded down with people who feel he is ready for junior high - I strongly disagree.  Though my son is smart, has no signs of mental retardation, is verbal, reads well and plays piano/violin by ear - he is verbally and socially delayed, his expressive and receptive communication is at about age 7, has no friends and he is delayed in most areas of self care.  But it is a team decision.  The way I see it, it all boils down to what is appropriate for my son's continued development.  IDEA is also very vague so ... how would you go about discussing the what is appropriate and arguing for retention?  Would you argue on the basis of what is appropriate?  Do you know of any cases where parents argued for retention for their special needs child and prevailed?  Any help will be appreciated.

I regret it, and now as a 10th grader, I had to retake Algebra 1, meaning that I didn't take Geometry this year (like I was supposed to).      Anyway, I've always passed the math FCAT. I think that I got a 4 on the 9th grade one. I'm alright at math, I guess. But I'm worried because I'm taking the Math FCAT in 3 days and I know NOTHING Geometry. Well, I never actually took a Geometry class...so yeah. Is there a lot of Geometry on the 10th grade math FCAT? What does it primarily focus on? Does it have the gridded responses or is it all multiple choice? I'm really worried because if I fail this, I'll be in remedial classes and this is also a graduation requirement at my school. And although I'm good at math, I've never taken Geometry and I think that this FCAT has a lot of it.      Thank you!

I am in my 2nd semester of college(first year) and I borrowed 4500 in Stafford loans to pay for my tuition and room&board for this semester. Is there anything more I can borrow? My parents would not qualify for a Plus loan so doesnt this make me eligible to borrow more?

I am at a loss because I need a new laptop for homework and both of my parents cannot afford to get me a new one, and I feel embarassed going down to the fin aid office again.

So could the credit go towards my minor and the gen ed?

20090307220229AAnfvYI	Education & Reference;Teaching	My math teacher won't teach us anything?	What the heck my math teacher won't teach us anything . Like half the people in our class is failing and we are all advance students in advance classes.  Not just that , but the things we do understand it takes a while to do and she collects it in a few minutes so we don't even get to finish our work, and she grades our unfinished work and so we get an F .  Also when she does teaches us she only does easy questions for examples in like 2 minutes and then gives us more complicated questions then she showed us and expects us to do it in five minutes .  I probably have a D in her class or probably a C , though I'm super good in math we took this test which took everybody about 3 days to do and got a 5 out of 6 and was the only one to get a 5 out of 22 students no one got higher then that either . So I know I'm not the problem .  I have always gotten 100 % and above on math , but my new 8th grade teacher really doesn't teach us . And I really need a 3.0 and above on my gpa because I'm in this special program where they are going to pay my university if I get good grades , but seriously my math teacher sucks the whole class agrees. And all my other class are above C average mostly A's and high B's . Like I'm so stressed . What should I do? So far the first two semester I have gotten a 3.8 and a 3.5 , but if I get below a 3.0 then I'm going to be kicked out of the program and if i get a C or below in that class that brings down my gpa below a 3.0

20090307215506AA0uf1n	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please edit my essay on diversity?	I am a mixed individual. My mother is mexican and my father is black. However, I spent my life under the sole care of my mexican mother. So, this is an important part of my heritage. I grew up in Southern Texas and I enjoyed learning too speak two different languages. I also enjoyed speaking Spanish and the opportunity that I got to learn to speak Spanish fluently. I have grown up entirely comfortable with my biracial background, and I am proud to be seen as black even though even if it is not how I view myself.      Even though most of my features looked Black, people would often stereotype me because of the way I looked. My hair was curly and kinky. People would look at me and see that I was African American. But in my mind, that is not who I was, I am both Black and Mexican and I would like to be seen as both. People outside of my family would stereotype me so much. Simply because my skin complexion was darker than there was or the texture of my hair was a little thicker than there was. So, for the first time, when they heard me utter one word in Spanish, they automatically would say "You know how to speak Spanish because you learned it in school". I would respond that my ethnic background was of Spanish decent. People still assume that I am from some island or from Puerto Rica. I learned that people need to stop with all the assumptions based on stereotypes from a particular race and actually take the time to learn more about that person, where he or she is from.  From this experience alone, I learned never to stereotype anyone. I am the type of individual that I am so inquisitive to learning about people's culture and backgrounds. This can make our lives that much more enriching. We all need to open ourselves to interacting with others that are different from ourselves to learn that it can be an interesting environment to be a part of.      Diversity is more than an individuals race and ethnicity. It is about our unique personalities, ways of looking at things, viewpoints, and perspectives. Throughout our lives, we are going to meet people who we interact with either in our work environment  or where we live that are different from ourselves. We need to put aside our differences and focus on what each individual can contribute in terms of strengths and capabilites. The world would be a boring place if we all thought alike. I learned this from individuals from different cultures and backgrounds. We are all the same but different. We are the same because we all human beings that deserve to be respected for who we are. Our ideas, personalities, perspectives and ways of solving problems may be different from one individual to the next. There is nothing wrong with learning to view ideas and problems with a new, different perspective. Therefore, we need to be open to learning what individuals from different cultures are about and why they believe as they do. We are all different and can learn to embrace those differences with respect, compassion, and integrity.      I have often found myself with what race do identify myself with? Choosing to identify with one race more than the other is plain ludicrous for me. My physical appearance can look more Black than Mexican but I have chosen to honor all those components in me by embracing them in different aspects of my life in California.

20090307220522AAaFgR4	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How do I overcome regretting my college decision(s)?	I go/went to a private university pretty much in the middle of nowhere. I'm a senior and I'm about to graduate in May. Yet I can't stop regretting my choice in schools, and my decision not to transfer out (After visiting others at school, I've felt I'd have been much better off in a city). I always believed that transferring would be the equivalent of quitting, a failure in my eyes. (I am at a very good institution at the moment.) I am very lucky to have financial aid, and help from my parents, but I will also have hefty loans to answer for afterwards. But that's not the true source of my regret.      Two years after I started at my university, my brother was accepted and joined me at the same school. This past fall, he dropped out after being there for one week. (It would have been his second year.) I know he looks at it as a failure, and I do too, but that's part of the problem. He dropped out and was lucky to get into a school closer to our home for the Spring, but ultimately, he made the decision I was unable to make. Because of pride or my own internalized sensibilities I couldn't even fathom transferring, much less dropping out with no plan. Yet he's happier for it, and I can't stop being jealous of him. I can't stop regretting that I didn't make the same decision. I can't stop regretting that I wasted four years of my life being miserable and "toughing it out"... but for what? Thousands in loans, no friends, no social connections, no idea what I want from my life.       Everyone acts like college is the best time of their life, yet I look back and regret so much, so many poor decisions that I'm not even sure I learned from. How can I stop being jealous of my brother and everyone else that loved college? How can I learn to not regret the decisions that I've made and simply live with them? I know that I cannot change them now, but I feel that it's not enough to just say, "Oh well it's in the past you can't change it just live with it."

Some of us wait until the last minute or last day and ours turns out much better than anyone one else.  I think that brainstorming ideas during the day and waiting until last minute to put everything together is the best approah...and the MOST FUN   Question: Why not wait until the last minute if you can think of more ideas along the way??    Why is doing homework first a better Method?

Each had a different number of marbles.      They decided to see if they could find an interesting way to make it so each of them had the same number of marbles. Khari gave enough of his to Tesia and Breen so that each of them doubled the amount they started with.      Tesia then did the same, giving each of the others enough marbles to double the number that they each had.      Finally, Breen did the same thing, giving Khari and Tesia enough marbles to double the number they each had.      When they were finished, they found their method had not worked very well. Tesia had 8 more than twice as many marbles as Breen, and Khari had twice as many as Tesia.

Prior to declaring my major when I didn't know exactly what I wanted out of my life I was put on academic probation due to my poor academic performance. I felt lost, and I didn't know if I would ever find an area to study that would personally fit my interests. To be honest, I didn't even know what my interests were. While finishing up my general education requirements I fell in love with Philosophy. I'm graduating soon with a BA in Philosophy, and I won't be able to raise my GPA past a 2.5 thanks to my own stupidity. Since I have declared my major I've earned a 3.5+ in my core courses. Admissions departments for grad programs won't even consider accepting me with a 2.5. I can't imagine doing anything else with my life, and I know it's selfish to say, but I'd rather not live than not make Philosophy my life. Should I just give up now?

Although I don’t be master now, when I was playing this with my classmate, I would felt very happy. In fact, I haven’t done exercise for a long time, so I ‘m looked like a fat boy. Recently, I hope to keep myself fit. However, I really don’t have some free time and a stability to reach this goal.      Besides, I really like eating so much. When I was a child, a balsam pear had been a food I dislike. However, it‘s my favorite now. So, if you ask me which food I dislike, I won’t be able to answer you. I must give up this bad habit, otherwise, I will be a fat boy forever.

20090307230752AAycIke	Education & Reference;Preschool	I'm in charge of nursery, how do I get 3-year-old to stop crying in church?  HELP!!!?	So there are several problems going on at once:        I'm an American living in a Spanish-speaking country.  I speak VERY limited spanish...but I was asked to be in charge of the nursery at my church.  I have 2 kids; a 10-month-old boy and a 3-year-old girl, they are brother and sister.  Their family is very poor, so more than likely this is one of their first exposures to a "caucasian" person.        The kids speak spanish (no english) and their grandmother is their daycare during the week.  However latin culture is such that the kids are used to being passed around.  The baby rarely sits with his family at church, but the girl tends to stick closer to her mother.       The first sunday I was in charge of them the girl cried a little bit, but after about 5 minutes she was fine.  She was very trepidatious, but then she started singing and playing by herself.        3 sundays ago, the boy was sick and started crying so his grandmother came and got him during the first 10 minutes.  The girl lasted about 20 minutes, and then she started screaming.  She didn't say anything, just started crying and wouldn't stop.  I didn't know who to ask for help (I couldn't find the mom), and even though they could hear her crying, no one came to help (there are people in charge of me, who checked in on me the first couple of sundays)... I tried everything, we looked at pictures, I tried to distract her with toys, tried to get her to eat...I've been a nanny in the past, so I'm not new to kids crying, but this was something else.  She cried for about 45 minutes.  I gave up speaking in spanish and tried speaking to her in english, telling her "you are fine, it's time to stop crying, do you want to play with toys, let's look at this, telling her it was okay to cry, asking what she wanted" etc.        So I came the next sunday, and the second I walked in the room she started screaming bloody murder again.  This time the girl in charge came and got her within the first couple of minutes (thankfully).  The baby brother was fine, we played and sang songs, and he seems to be okay with me.        What do I do????? Everytime the girl sees me she screams or runs away; I've had kids with separation anxiety but never felt this fear/animosity from a kid before.  I'm at my wits end, and I feel really ashamed that I don't know how to fix this.  I feel like I'm letting down the kids.  I have no idea what suddenly made the 3-year-old start this....The person in charge of me keeps saying "they're really good kids, what happened?" but she says it in a way that somehow makes me feel like I'm a bad person, and I hit the kid or something (which of course I would never do).        PLEASE HELP!!!!!

Here's the thing, since i was a little girl i've ALWAYS wanted to be a doctor. And I still do, i love to help out people and i love do discover new things. And my passion for helping out people grew even stronger now, that my mom has breast cancer. But there's another side, i have a strong strong strong passion for fashion. I absolutely love fashion. I love it love it love it! And i've always seen people that work with fashion so happy, and full of love. And i've read stories of people who achieve their careers as doctors but regret studying for half their life to become something they regret. The dilemma is, i dont know what to choose? Fashion or Doctor? I did some research, and an average number of years to become a doctor that suits me is around 14 years. And i'm 14 years right now.. God, i dont know what to do. Could i become a doctor, and still have a passion for fashion? Could I do both? And also i'm having pressure from family. They've always known that i love becoming a doctor, and they're expecting me to get big bucks and everything, and i wouldnt want to let them down. I know this is my life and it's all about my choice...      I love these careers so much. I don't know what to do. Please help?

September 18, 2008         Ms. Linda Proaps   C.K.Mcclatchy High School   3066 Freeport Boulevard   Sacramento, CA 95818   Re: Senior project –Graphic Design in Photoshop   Dear Ms.Proaps:      In this day and age where technology is everywhere, technology is a needed item. It’s something that can help but at the same time corrupt. Because technology is everywhere, we accept it all but overuse and and addiction is not a good thing, technology nowadays can be used in many ways, but when advertising theirs an image part to consider. Everywhere you go, you can see the effects of advertising on society.      My Senior Project will be concentrated on graphic design and the use of Photoshop. I like graphic design, so I chose to do it because I want it to be part of my future career. I’m mainly interested in Photoshop because I’ve seen what can be done with it. Since most graphic design is centered on advertising, I would like to make something that is renowned later in my life when I become a graphic designer. I like the special effects part of graphic design, and I might do things like that one day.      My research paper will concentrate on how graphic design in advertising effects society. I’m interested in logos and icons for stores. I will research how logos affect people and what people think when looking at them. When buying, usually you will notice organized but flashy things are a more materialized item, but pricing comes in to account also. For example, next time you see a clown you’ll probably think of McDonalds.       There are many controversies surrounding graphic design. Some, people feel some designs influence hate, such as gun designs, big brother posters, or Middle Eastern people holding gun posters, but when not smearing things and just on graphically design shirts they can be a good commercial good. My controversial issue will be how graphic design affects people in advertising. Some people might agree depictions of holy figures with graphic design might make a religion seem more appealing then it really is. With graphic design you may see it is a source of some conflicts but I see it as just a key thing in advertising.      This Senior Project will be a stretch for me because I’m not artistically imaginative and I’ve never used Photoshop before. However, I enjoy drawing things and do it as much as possible. I will be having my mentor, Mr. Morris, help me learn Photoshop. I will have to find out how advertisements affect people. I will have to learn how to do photo manipulation, and if I want to major in graphic design in college.      For the costs, I bought Photoshop, which was expensive. I will be printing things at Kinko’s for my presentation. I am getting things for my project that will enhance what people know about what I learned. Finally, I will buy things to make my project fancier.      My presentation will be a phenomenal; it will show off the graphic design skill I will acquire. I will be showing what I found out about advertising in Photoshop. I will be presenting the tutorials I did with my own adaptations I will be presenting most of my work on posters.      Sincerely,      Austin Owensby

20090227115226AAyGdWI	Education & Reference;Teaching	Please read if you have the time! This was my essay for a teacher!?	Many years ago there was a mountain called Alcampo in the midst of the Shari forest. No one was very sure of its location but there was always a suspicion of where it could be found. Only the Natives knew the way, but they had been outnumbered by soldiers and since then the modern people only heard stories of it that had been passed down from their ancestors.    The mountain stood there alone recalling the memories that he had when the Natives were around, He longed to see someone come by but all was gone in the Shari forest. Its people, the animals and the colour and life had been drained. Generations and generations had passed, the mountain still looking as strong as ever but becoming more and more impatient as it had waited years to be accompanied. He saw a sign of promise and felt it too, that he was going to have a friend. That promise seemed as though it was going to happen in a light year, for Alcampo waited and waited long enough but impatiently.  Alcampo had eventually given birth to a long stretch of sea which was the most unique one to be seen.    Now the forest was filled with glee, for the stories the sea had to tell were most interesting. Visitors like the birds had come to listen and told these stories in their songs. The harmony accompanied by the melody which the birds sang made the forest and nearby places dance with joy. The once lifeless forest was now so lively that people had gotten close to tracking down the location of the mountain because they thought voices could be heard in the distance. The only voice that they heard was the wind, not mourning but cheerfully sharing the tales.   The deep barren trenches that had seemed to lead to nowhere, was now a river forcing out all the water from the bowels of its source. Just standing on the bank it looked like it was rushing to meet its prey before it had time to escape. Other persons said that the water was as clear as crystal that you could see all the living and those that were underneath its glassy surface. The people had considered it to be the most dangerous river and ordered that it should not be used for recreational nor transportation purposes.    The river was going about its business until it was disturbed by two mischievous boys. They had run away from their village looking for great adventure which seemed to be great danger instead. They carved a boat out of a fallen tree trunk. They used the river as transportation to lead them away from their people regardless of the dangers which lay ahead. The water became fierce halfway through their journey and the boat had now been filled with water. They were going under but their efforts to survive proved futile. They had been swallowed up like Jonah and the whale.   The river had nothing to do with the lives lost. The villagers came by in search of the boys so the river to give them hope washed upon its bank the two lifeless bodies. The whole village was filled with grief and the river reminds many of the tragedy which took place. Archaeologists followed their way to the mouth of the river and it led them to the sea; a sea with a mountain behind. Now the secret of the mountain was revealed. The sea was safe but not its rivers and they used it for tourism and as a means of getting to the Alcampo. The originality and history stored behind the mountain was all gone after its discovery but pride was what was left.   Generations and generations had more tales to tell. One of these was the tragedy of the two boys. When this story is told to children it teaches them a lesson not to play with mother nature for she will fight back and give you what she thinks you deserve.   Thank you I'm 12 and I would like your opinions.   I had to do it over..........
20090227115835AAISwcd	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Problems At School! I don't know what to do :(?	Today was a bad day for me. There are two boys in my class, lets just call them X and Y. They like me. I am not allowed to date, but I am in the 9th grade. My school is a very small private school. I no every kid in the whole school by name.      I was sitting in my desk X sits right behind me and Y sits to the left of me. They are always flirting. But then they are mean. Like they tried to put white out in my hair. X is always playing with my hair it is so annoying. They always fallow me to see where I put my back pack. I always put it in the hallway with all of the other back behind all of the other back backs before lunch. Well I came back upstairs and my backpack was gone. Me and my friends and sister were looking all over for it. But we couldn't find it. So I went to talk to my principal saying that my backpack is missing. He asked me if there are any boys that flirt or are mean to you. I hesitated to answer because I am *NOT* in any way like that. In fact this is the first time that anything like this has happened to me. I said no. He asked me again, and he said we need to no. I said well there are these two boys in my class. He asked what their names are. I said X and Y. Then he got up. And we started looking for it. I told him that I don't want anyone knowing that I told him. He said okay. The first thing he does is goes into the computer lab to and asks of X or Y is in here! I wanted to crawl under a rock. Thank goodness they weren't in there! And then the vice principal called out from the class room. Hey, I have your back pack. I walk in and Y is sitting right there. There were 30 kids in that class, I walk in. He ses, do you know why I took your backpack? I said no. Because it was in front of my door, and these doors need to be closed. All of the kids were staring at me. I was so embarrassed. And then I glance over and see Y laughing. Laughing at me!          I just don't know what to do. I think he knows that I told and I think he is going to give me grief. Uhh I am dreading Monday. Thank God theyre only in one of my classes.

I SUCK at grammar but I've read over this like 4x and i'm pretty sure i got rid of most of the mistakes but ... yea...      Taking money away from the transportation system for magnet schools won’t help any of the students anywhere. I’m a junior at (SCHOOL) and I see it affecting everyone at (SCHOOL) already. At (SCHOOL) we lost our 4:30 p.m. activity buses for this school year and it has devastated our some of our extracurricular memberships. How are we supposed to better ourselves by becoming more “well-rounded” when the school board doesn’t even give us that chance? This choice forced on us will only hurt us in the college admissions process. In L'Alliance Fran?aise ((SCHOOL)‘s French club) I’ve noticed that there are very few freshmen and sophomores this year. Most members drive, have their parents pick them up or are lucky enough to know someone who drives. We used to have a lot of freshmen and sophomores, but not anymore.  The ideal for students (who’ve been at school for over 7 hours already) of having to wait at school until after 6:00pm for this years’ activity buses to arrive turn a lot of people away from joining afterschool clubs. Extracurriculars’ aren’t just things to add to a laundry list, they help keep kids out of trouble, they benefit us in the long run, they help us explore our interests and they give us an opportunity to learn more about something that may not be covered in the classroom. But wait, there’s more; they’re considering taking away teacher’s supplement pay for the extra hours that they put in. What’s next, cutting school hours and principal’s pay?      *my school’s name has been replaced with (SCHOOL) for privacy purposes
