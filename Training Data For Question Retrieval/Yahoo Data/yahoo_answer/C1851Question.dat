It now asks me for a ton of information like copies of my license, checks, debit card, etc.  Obviously I felt it was safe enough to put money on originally but it seems kinda sketchy to me to send all those copies of stuff, or am I just being paranoid? Is this standard, and has anyone else done it? I only have 25 dollars on it so I figured whatever I'll forfeit the 25 dollars and just close my account but they won't even let me do that. I mailed them and they said I can't close my account until I send in the documents which makes absolutely no sense.

What im kind of looking for would be like an internal graphics card that would enable me to run it.

Hi all,   I have mistakenly installed Windows Vista on the D drive of my laptop( Dell Inspiron 1501 AMD Sempron) and it takes too much space and I want to remove it but evertime a window pops up and tells that I do not have the permission to do that because I was denied a certain access.

20090222162012AA1FEvc	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	My laptop is filling up it's RAM and giving me warning messages?	I have a Dell Studio and it has 4gb of Ram.

After using the internet for an hour or so, I get a warning message saying my computer is low on memory and task manager shows 3.74 out of 4gb of ram being used. This makes no sense seeing as 4gb of ram is more than adequate for Vista and this problem hasnt been happening until recently.

20090222163220AAiP4XD	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	RAM on a P5Q-E Motherboard?	When I got this board a year ago, I put in 2GB of PC2-6400 DDR2 RAM. A year has passed, and 2GB of RAM is apparently not enough for modern purposes, so I want to upgrade to 4GB by adding another 2x1GB sticks. The problem is, I heard that motherboards can have problems when all 4 DIMM slots are filled. Does anyone have any experience with this particular series of boards (the P45 DDR2 boards from ASUS)? Would filling up all 4 DIMM slots cause any trouble?      I know I have to choose the same type of RAM (PC2-6400), but do timings on the RAM matter? Do they have to be same as the new and old RAM?      Also, is there anything stopping me from plugging in 2x2GB DIMMs? Would there be any negative consequences for me having 6GB of DDR2 RAM?

20090222163529AA7i9uy	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	What are the advantages of DDR2 Dual Chanel over DDR2?	I have an XFX 750a motherboard, I already have 2 gb's (2 x 1) of DDR2 dual chanel memory at 800mhz by Corsair.  I Know that dual chanel effectively doubles the bit size and stuff by having two idenitical pairs of memory in corresponding slots.  But I wan't to increase my memory, and I have Vista 32 bit which means only 3 gb of memory.  So I was wondering would a (2 x 512) 800mhz ddr2 dual chanel work the same as one DDR2 1 gb 800mhz, or could I get two identical 512 mb of ddr2 (non dual chanel) and but them in corresponding slots and have it work just as well.

Finally I was done and I clicked the X button on my microsoft word and a window popped up. It said "Do you want to save the changes to [name of file] file?" The options were yes, no, or cancel. I clicked yes and the program was exited. Now, I am trying to look for it    but i can't find it now. I've tried the searches but still nothing came up.       Please help!

20090222171818AAAsXxf	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	New Dell Laptop USB port problem?	A new dell Inspiron 15 has  strange problem. It thinks there is something "unknown device" plugged into the USB ports. It cannot be shut down using "task master" so this message pops up every few seconds saying the "unknown or malfunctioning device" is connected. When it does this the card reader doesn't work, either.   By putting an USB device in all three USB ports it stops the error message.      It is new so it is under warranty and Best Buy will fix it. But I took it there once and the error message wouldn't pop up.       Do any of you have any advice?

Ok I have a Dell XPS laptop and my son was using it for one of his toys (Fisher Price Cool School....its a keyboard that plugs into the computer and then a program opens up that he can play on) Anyways he has used this probably 2 dozen times and there has been no problem.  Well this time when he was done I ended the program and unplugged the toy and the screen on my regular desktop is really messed up! There is a black bar on each side making the screen smaller but then everything on the screen is really big! I don't know how to fix it! I tried plugging the game back in and then ending the program again but it didn't work. I also tried restarting the computer AND turning it off...waiting a few minutes then turning it back on but nothing has worked! How do i fix this?? Its terribly annoying!!

20090222180539AAzg7li	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Lenovo ThinkPad - "Fan error" and display problem?	I have a IBM Lenovo ThinkPad T61. My laptop had been having problems with its fan (makes loud noises, overheats, then shuts off).      Whenever I reboot (or turn On from Off state), it says "Fan error" on a black screen with 2 beeps, then pause for about 3 seconds, then shuts off with 1 beep (doesn't even load Windows). This is why I usually just put the laptop to sleep rather than turn it off.      So, I restarted my laptop because Windows Update required me to, and the fan error problem showed up. I tried pressing random keys like F2, F12, "ThinkVantage", etc, but then somehow my display went totally black.      I opened up the laptop, but I'm pretty sure I didn't screw anything up (an experienced friend of mine was with me when I opened it up, but unfortunately he couldn't figure out the problem). I tried to looking up the fan problem, and found out it's a common "BIOS" problem, and you can bypass it by pressing Esc; now I realize why I was pressing all those random keys--I forgot it was the Esc key that did the trick.      I'm not even gonna bother to solve the BIOS problem as long as my laptop can run its basic features. But, my display is not showing at all. Any idea what could be wrong with my display? Possibly a loose connection/wiring inside the laptop? Maybe I accidentally disabled the laptop's display by hitting random keys?

For now, I really want to stick with Firefox because it has what I need, but Opera just seems faster...so I guess I want to know some ways to make Opera look and behave a bit more like Firefox...I can't possibly get rid of Firefox because I definitely need my StumbleUpon and DownThemAll, so are there any ways to get add-ons like that on Opera? My perfect web browser would be like Firefox, but faster and with a little thing telling me the objects loaded on a page. (But mainly for the speed.) Anyone have any good suggestions?

I called them and they advised me on my Utorrent settings. Is there a way for me just to download and not upload/share while maintaining the same download speed?

20090222185155AAHP6qm	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Making printer wireless with AT&T 2 wire modem.?	I have AT&T. I have everything, internet, TV, and phone. And i have a question about the modem. There is an AUX input in my modem. WHat does it do? If you plug something into it, will the modem make it wireless? I have a printer that is not wireless. :-( But it has an ethernet cable output. And I'm wondering if i get an ethernet cord, then i plug one end into the printer, then the other end into the AUX input in the modem. Then will it make my printer wireless. If i go to MS Word. Then I make a document, then when I'm done, I do File Print, then i do Find Printer, Then I click find now without putting anything in the fields, will my printer show up there? Because i remember in my college, i remember they had printers that they got access to it using the ethernet thing. But if you go on a computer then you go to word, then to File, Print, Find Printer, then if you click find now, EVERY printer in the school will show up on the list. They didn't have a network. They had an ethernet cord from the computer going into the wall. And if you unplug the ethernet cord, then you will not see any printers. But the way I want to do it at my house, I want to pick the printer up from a network, not an ethernet cord. So if i get an ethernet cord, plug one side into my printer, then the other side into the AUX input in the modem, then I go to MS word and do File, Print, Find Printer, then I click find now, will my printer show up? I am not using an ethernet cord. Is the printer showing up as a network? I want it to show up as a network. Or if that way won't success, then is there a way i can plug my printer into the iMac. Then make my iMac wireless, then it can send a message to the iMac and then the mac with print it.   But we have 5 windows computers and 1 mac. I know macs can send a message to another mac and then the mac that the printer is plugged into will print the document. All i want is a laptop printing for my printer wirelessly. I don't want them plugging in a wire, i want them to print wirelessly. I'll do anything but setting up and ethernet cord do print. And is the AUX input in the modem for making something wireless or is it just another output for ethernet?   10 points for Best Answer.

Okay, so on my laptop I recently got the "blue screen of death" thankfully i got it to someone who knows what he's doing with computers and is fixing it as i type. He believes that this virus came from myspace, which is understandable. I do have McAfee on my laptop, but it did not catch the virus. However, my laptop had been slowing down before the blue screen. With that said, I have a few questions.   1. I also logged on to that same myspace account on my desktop. Will the same virus infect my desktop? (It has been slowing down lately)   If so...   Will I lose all of the information on my desktop? (pictures, music, etc.)   And how will I be able to tell before it's too late if I have the virus on my desktop?      Thank you so much!
