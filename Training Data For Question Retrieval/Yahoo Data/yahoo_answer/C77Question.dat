20090308092936AAdGkQR	Politics & Government;Elections	Does the Federal Government manage anything better than the Private Sector?	Before you start.. government policies and politicians were a Major contributor to our current financial mess and the U.S. Military is [somewhat] immune.      Here's the latest example of a power grab. It's estimated that this will 'create' 1,000 New Government Jobs. (we all know how accurate gov. estimates are). How many 'private sector jobs' will be destroyed by Fedzilla in the process? To me this is just one of a multitude of deceptions lately. Much like the president's statement "There are No Earmarks in this stimulus package" ( that depends on what the meaning of the word is..is)      3/7/2009, 5:45 p.m. EST   By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER    The Associated Press          WASHINGTON (AP) — So much for privatizing the federal government.      The Internal Revenue Service's decision this week to quit using debt collectors to dun delinquent taxpayers was celebrated by public employee unions as a pendulum shift after watching the Bush administration often opt for private contractors over federal workers to deliver government services.      The IRS program was a small one, bringing in a little more than $80 million since its inception in 2006. But it represented an ideological toehold for conservatives who believe that private companies are more efficient than government agencies.      It was an ideology embraced by former President George W. Bush, who famously — and unsuccessfully — toyed with the idea of partially privatizing Social Security.      Privatization won't disappear. It's too widespread in a federal government that relies on private contractors for work as diverse as computer programming and providing security in Iraq. But with a new Democratic administration in charge, experts don't expect to hear much about privatizing government functions from President Barack Obama.      "I think we're going to see a reversal of privatization," said Harvey B. Feigenbaum, a political science professor at George Washington University. "When contracts come up for renewal, they will see if it would be better for the public sector to do the work."      IRS contracts with private debt collection agencies to go after delinquent taxpayers expired Friday. In deciding not to renew them, IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said he concluded after a monthlong review that tax collection could best be done by government workers.   **************************************...

20090308101223AARqK0x	Politics & Government;Politics	What can we count on if Democrats get their way on health-care?	My wife and I recently took her aunt to the county hospital because she broke her leg. The county hospital is a good example of what you can look forward to if Democrats get their way on Health-care.      First, at the door you go through a metal detector and they search women's purses. Inside are more armed guards. At the exit alcove both doors are not to be opened at the same time and if you leave one door open to long the armed guard will tell you about it. Just outside the exit are heavy cement planters and walls to prevent a car ramming through it. Need help getting your loved one out of the car with a wheelchair? Tough, you do it yourself.      Inside there were probably 40-50 seats, all full. So you stand, for hours. It's noisy and smelly. In fact while I was standing next to the wall a young black woman came in and stood next to me. After a minute she looked at me and said "Oooo, it stink in here." then she went out into the hallway to stand.      The treatment was sub-standard. The doctors looked like they were just out of medical school and it took four tries to set her leg. She screamed and cried every time they set it.      The whole thing was a day long ordeal. I have experience with hospitals because my wife has been sick and this was a real eye opener.      Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

Abortion is legal in the USA BUT President Obama has taken it and to a whole new level. The POTUS currently is sending our Tax Dollars over seas for Abortions which ties all of us to be for it regardless of our own Position on it.      The POTUS will seek to reinstate FOCA which is the following:      In its last incarnation, FOCA defined abortion as a "fundamental right" that no government can "deny" or "interfere with." That language, FOCA's opponents warn, would help overturn abortion restrictions such as parental notification, laws banning certain procedures and constraints on federal funding.         DO YOU AGREE or DISAGREE with President Obama forcing us to pay for Abortions. Roe Vs Wade is alive and well so it's not about making Abortion Legal it's making everyone who pays taxes to pay for it.    That would include Catholic Hospital too.                http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/st...       Could St. Louis lose its Catholic hospitals under new federal abortion legislation?

Then he said his plan would save the world and goes on to slip and say he  has saved the world. funny it looks to me like we are all in deep shite. he or his darling dinnae know when it wull end. neither of these defective ladds have an effective plan.      so ladds and lassies      what should we do with them?  it is obvious their communist ..errr sorry.. i meant Labour approach is nae working

20090308101344AAkfPkl	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do neocons think that the solution to the economic disaster they've created is tax breaks to the rich?	Republicans have proven that they are not fiscally responsible.   Reagan proved that voodoo/trickle down economics does not work, and Bush confirmed that it doesn't work.    The wealthy will only take their tax breaks and pocket it or send deposit it in offshore accounts.   Clinton proved that investing in the middle class and taxing the filthy rich is our best bet as a nation.   So why is it that the right wingers get their panties in a wad when the wealthy are taxed a bit more in the interest of a much better economy?   Why don't you just let the Democrats, who have a proven track record, handle the economy?

My parents and I were born in Canada, while my younger brother was born here. I have lived almost my entire whole life in America. Even though I have a Canadian passport, I consider myself to be both American and Canadian. My whole life is in America.    Recently, my dad was laid off from his job in San Francisco. A week ago he went on a trip to Vancouver, Canada, but when he tried to return to the U.S., customs wouldn't allow him. He has talked to lawyers, and has tried many times to come back to America...but he continues to be denied. My mom's and my visas end in October. I was wondering if I would be able to gain a dual citizenship that quickly. I don't want to move back to Canada. I don't want my whole life to be uprooted. Can anybody help?
20090308101833AA6coPQ	Politics & Government;Elections	Why doesn't Obama admit he can't handle it and go home?	The Daily Telegraph is reporting that Barack Obama is amazed at the amount of paper that flows across his desk and that the economic crisis has so sapped his energy, he is not even paying attention to foreign affairs:          Allies of Mr Obama say his weary appearance in the Oval Office with Mr Brown illustrates the strain he is now under, and the president's surprise at the sheer volume of business that crosses his desk.          A well-connected Washington figure, who is close to members of Mr Obama's inner circle, expressed concern that Mr Obama had failed so far to "even fake an interest in foreign policy".          A British official conceded that the furore surrounding the apparent snub to Mr Brown had come as a shock to the White House. "I think it's right to say that their focus is elsewhere, on domestic affairs. A number of our US interlocutors said they couldn't quite understand the British concerns and didn't get what that was all about."          The American source said: "Obama is overwhelmed. There is a zero sum tension between his ability to attend to the economic issues and his ability to be a proactive sculptor of the national security agenda.          "That was the gamble these guys made at the front end of this presidency and I think they're finding it a hard thing to do everything."

20090308104952AAKYiON	Politics & Government;Military	Know any WWII True and Unusual Urban Legends?	I want to know any weird but still true World War 2 legends. Something like the following:       The first German serviceman killed in the war was killed by the Japanese (China, 1937), the first American serviceman killed was killed by the Russians (Finland 1940), the highest ranking American killed was Lt. Gen. Lesley McNair, killed by the US Army Air Corps.   The youngest US serviceman was 12 year old Calvin Graham, USN. He was wounded and given a Dishonorable Discharge for lying about his age. (His benefits were later restored by act of Congress)   At the time of Pearl Harbor the top US Navy command was Called CINCUS (pronounced "sink us"), the shoulder patch of the US Army's 45th. Infantry division was the Swastika, and Hitler's private train was named "Amerika". All three were soon changed for PR purposes.   Generally speaking there was no such thing as an average fighter pilot. You were either an ace or a target. For instance Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa shot down over 80 planes. He died while a passenger on a cargo plane.   It was a common practice on fighter planes to load every 5th round with a tracer round to aid in aiming. This was a mistake. Tracers had different ballistics so (at long range) if your tracers were hitting the target 80% of your rounds were missing. Worse yet tracers instantly told your enemy he was under fire and from which direction. Worst of all was the practice of loading a string of tracers at the end of the belt to tell you that you were out of ammo. This was definitely not something you wanted to tell the enemy. Units that stopped using tracers saw their success rate nearly double and their loss rate go down.   When allied armies reached the Rhine the first thing men did was pee in it. This was pretty universal from the lowest private to Winston Churchill (who made a big show of it) and Gen. Patton (who had himself photographed in the act).   German Me-264 bombers were capable of bombing New York City but it wasn't worth the effort.   German submarine U-120 was sunk by a malfunctioning toilet.   More US servicemen died in the Air Corps than the Marine Corps. While completing the required 30 missions your chance of being killed was 71%.   Among the first "Germans" captured at Normandy were several Koreans. They had been forced to fight for the Japanese Army until they were captured by the Russians and forced to fight for the Russian Army until they were captured by the Germans and forced to fight for the German Army until they were captured by the US Army.   Following a massive naval bombardment 35,000 US and Canadian troops stormed ashore at Kiska. 21 troops were killed in the firefight. It would have been worse if there had been any Japanese on the island.   Two U.S. Air Force F-15s shoot down two U.S. Army helicopters on a diplomatic mission over Iraq, mistaking them for hostile aircraft in the "no-fly zone," killing 26 people. No one was found criminally responsible.   While covering convoy PQ13, HMS Trinidad, a Royal Navy Cruiser had engaged German destroyers, hitting Z26, but had the very bad luck to be hit by one of her own torpedoes which had circled, she received temporary repairs in Murmansk, and sailed for home on 13th May 1942, carrying many survivors from the HMS Edinburgh which had been sunk in another epic battle.   A "siesta" ordered by Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to his troops during a conflict between the Mexicans and Texans caused the infantry to be overtaken in just 18 minutes.   Fort Douaumont at Verdun in France was captured in 1916 by a single German soldier after French General Chretien forgot to pass on orders to defend the fort to the last man to his successor.   The Russians tried to wreak havoc on German Panzer divisions during the WWII by strapping bombs to the backs of dogs and teaching them to associate food with the underneath of their enemies' tanks. Unfortunately, the dogs only associated food with their own tanks and forced an entire Soviet division to retreat.   Probably the most famous mistake in U.S. military history occurred in the Civil War, when Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson was mistakenly shot by one of his own troops after the Confederate triumph at Chancellorsville.      Thanks

20090306215233AAWiAbZ	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think of these rumors happening with America in the near future?	This is what I heard President Obama was doing. All of those illegal immigrants who came to America illegally, he's sending them back to Mexico because they came in the country working for cheap labor, but it was so many of them a lot of Americans lost jobs because of the immigrants who aren't even American citizens taking over our jobs. This was another reason for rise in unemployment for Americans, so anyway he's sending them back. The situation with the Mexican drug war is kind of ironic because more of them that wanted to make an honest living have to go back to the environment of that drug war that's going on in Mexico. Which I believe was what a lot of them were actually trying to get away from in the first place and make a decent honest living. The downside of that though, it's hurt our American economy and raised the unemployment rate. What do you feel about this overall situation?

20090306223907AATROqT	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think would jump start a struggling economy?	Tax cuts or raising taxes?      Myself personally I believe that cutting taxes across the board puts more money into the hands of the consumer, who then in turn would put that money into the economy, by buying things like at stores, like clothing, food, cars, homes.      I believe that raising taxes takes money away from those consumers who would use it towards clothing, and other personal items, cars, food & homes.  I believe that raising taxes is not the answer, and raising taxes on those who make over $250,000 a year isn't the answer either, because most of those who make over $250,000 a year are the ones who are providing jobs.

I hear people say that police offciers are getting cut from their jobs due to the economy. I also know that education and any jobs in the medical field are not as badly affected because there will always be a high demand for health and education. But at the same time, there will always be a high demand for law enforcmeent. If there are no law enforcement or it is limited, then every single state in the u.s. will become corrupt.

20090227102413AAMqksd	Politics & Government;Military	I need help from air force wives!!?	My younger sister is 19. She's been with this guy on and off for a couple years. Our family doesn't like him, and his family doesn't like her. She has basically been spoiled. Never had to pay a bill in her life. Went to college an hour and a half away for one year, but got so homesick, came home almost every weekend(and brought her laundry with her since she wouldn't do it herself) Her boyfriend has had a job...once, for about a week and quit.(no car no money no job and addicted to online fantasy games) He uses her, and she's only a part time hostess, but answers to his beck and call even when he wants a sandwhich from half an hour away and shes got the flu. Heres the hard part. He gets out of AF basic training in april. He'll be stationed in Florida afterwards (we live in ohio). He's already complaining and wants a discharge, but they decided that after graduation, shes going to move to florida, and get married to him. She seems to think that it's going to be fun to "play house" with him, like a grown up. Even though shes 19 and can make her own decisions, she's never really had a chance to hit "the real world" with keeping up her own place, cooking, doing laundry...etc...AND shes always attached to this guy like bees on honey. She acts as if being an air force wife, she's hit the lottery and will live the good life of never having to work again, and he's going to be super rich. I think that she's completely oblivious to this situation, and making a huge mistake by getting married to this user, and throwing her life away by sitting around not working, collecting his money. She's not a strong independent person and just always does enough to get by (somewhat lazy)   Sorry about the novel, and on to my question(s): Do you think she'll make it? How hard is it being an air force wife? What things should she know that she needs to be prepared for? What's your situation like? She also mentioned that he signed up in E3, is that possible to start out on?

I thought mccain was going to elevate this race to one on the issues and stay away from the smear tactics and negativities.  This is what he promised early on.  As a republican I am severely dissappointed that he has reverted to appealing to the more base human nature of ugliness and character assassination.

20090308084438AAEuqnE	Politics & Government;Politics	Something is going to go down in America....Anyone agree?	First, we elect an air head for a president. He doubled our deficit, and plans to cut it in half by the end of his first term, but if he is cutting taxes, how does he plan to do this? Also, he wants to create jobs and expand the economy, but at the same time he wants to tax small businesses, hurting their ability to expand and CREATE JOBS and GROW THE ECONOMY. This is not about race, but 52% of blacks are unemployed, and Obama promised all the lazy people in America who don't want to make a living themselves and want to live off of the hard working Americans. This is Socialism at its finest and is destroying the Capitalist ideals that our nation was built on. He is taking away our right to bear arms, which is in the constitution so that Americans can rise up against a tyrannical leader. He wants to negotiate with terrorists which is a policy of appeasement, and didn't that lead to World War II? He is the worst interpreter of the constitution. It states that every one has the right to equal opportunity, not equal results. When I stood up to my teacher throwing her liberal policies in my face by me saying that I don't want to take care of the poor because they made the decisions that got them in their own mess and she said "Think about the man without a job who can't support his own family" and I said "That's not my problem" so she sent me to the office and now I can't speak my ideas in class but she can. He wants to negotiate with terrorists and that makes me sick to my stomach, he is enabling them. He is taking away our rights and is implementing socialist ideas which is not what America was built on.      Where do you think the nation, and in that case the world headed. Do you think we could see civil war in America, or do you think that with the situation in the Middle East, Iran on the verge of Nuclear weapons capabilities and North Korea not backing down from their nuclear weapons program, do you think a global military conflict is near?

20090227112029AAJwhpH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does she legally have anything to keep him away?	My fiance is trying to see his 3 year old daughter. He has been cut out of her life since she was born for no valid reason. His ex says that he threatened to kidnap his daughter, he physically hurt her when they were together, that he never wanted to be around, and she also has been raising drama about myspace pictures and messaging.   1. He never threatened to kidnap his daughter. It isn't true, but furthermore she has no proof so it shouldn't matter.   2. He never hurt his ex. They got in a fight one day and he grabbed her arm to try to ask her to stay. He is a gentle giant and he meant no harm, but he is bigger than her so he accidentally hurt her. As soon as he realized he had hurt her he let go and apologized immediately. She took it one step further though and punched herself in the arm to make a bruise. Then she went to the school office to tell them that he did it. She says there is a record at their old school of his "abuse" but she has yet to produce one. Either way, he isn't an abuser and she is obviously immature and vengeful.   3. Obviously he wanted to be around because he sent her so many letters and emails that she threatened to get a restraining order for harassment. All the emails or letters contained only pleas to work things out and see his daughter. I read many of them so I know he's telling the truth. She also quit answering his number because he called so many times. He also stopped by the house several times with gifts for his daughter, but was never allowed to see the girl and was told his gifts were thrown away.   4. As for the myspace drama, admittedly we did take pictures of his daughter off of his ex's page and in his excitement to see what she looked like he posted them to show his friends too. Of course she got angry and so he deleted them. Other than that the only pictures that were posted were the pictures that I myself took of his daughter. (He and I broke up for a short while and for some reason his ex wanted to be my friend, so when I was taking pictures his daughter was in some of them. I never posted them until she decided she couldn't be my friend anymore and after that I didn't care about what she thought so I posted them.) The pictures are not hers, they are mine, so legally she has no rights to them. The messages are never threatening, they only have to do with him seeing his daughter and what is happening with the court proceedings and the child support agency, but she claims he is harassing her.   5. The only other thing that she might bring up is a fake profile that someone made on facebook. It had some of her old pictures but the information was all derogatory and she blamed us. Obviously we wouldn't have had access to those old pictures so we couldn't have done it, and wouldn't have anyway. But she still blames us so she might bring that up.

Ok, my first ticket was for going 54 in a 40, while i was decelerating since I was approaching a speed limit change from 50 to 40 to 25 (a town was coming up).  Im still a little shocked I even got a ticket for something like that.  Anyways, just my luck a few miles down on that same highway I got another ticket (about 4 weeks later).  This time I was driving aggressive, but the officer was very nice and told me she would write me up for a ticket as Speed Greater Than Reasonable and not even identify how fast I was going, so the judge would not know.  My court date for the first ticket is in a week and im trying to schedule it so I can take care of both tickets in this one court date.  Assuming they can do that, what should I do/expect?  Im 17 years old by the way, so still technically a minor.  We have a family insurance plan, so im mainly concerned with trying to avoid points.      Thanks in advance!

20061013134950AAr7ejF	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Should multiple family members be able to receive government housing assistance?	I work for a company that manages a few properties that accept Housing assistance (ie...a low-income family pays only a portion of their rent, and the city housing program pays the rest).  We have a tenant (A woman with an on-and-off boyfriend, an adult daughter, and a few more children that are still under 18) who has been living there for a 3+ years.  She pays about $400 of the $1500/rent.  She recently asked if we had any other rental homes because her oldest daughter just qualified to receive housing assistance as well.  Personally, I feel that this is almost abusing the system.  I feel that if someone is getting government assistance, isn't that supposed to help them get out of financial burden?  If the tenant's housing aid helped, shouldn't her daughter also be (at least a little) financially stable?      Any thoughts?

When you are arrested, and another person pays your bail expenses without the assistance of a bondsman, does that person get that money back when you appear for court?      It was my understanding that bail is simply a promise made in cash that you will appear for your court date; however, I heard that your bond is only returned if you are found not guilty.       My sister was arrested for failure to appear in court for simple worthless check charges. I paid her bail in full, and she took care of her charges, including paying court costs ... but by paying off the checks, she automatically pleaded guilty to the charges. I was under the impression that I would receive the bail money back when I made sure she appeared in court. Can anyone tell me which situation is correct?

20070307174615AAdfYWZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can my neighbors arrest me?	They wouldn't let me use their new lawnmower so I didn't poo for a week then went and pooed 6 huge piles of poo all over their lawn. I then proceeded to write insulting remarks on their house in my poo. I then enetered their house (they keep their doors unlocked) and used every item of value in their living room for toilet paper. They say they'll put my butt in jail for years. Can they? I'm scared. The cops are coming!!!
20070307184209AAJ69ma	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How can I collect on an out-of-state NSF check?	I live in southern Calif.  Someone from Dallas County Texas wrote me a bad check to pay for an online auction (she has received the merchandise).  Question #1: Do I file the claim in Calif. where I live or in Dallas County where she lives?  Question #2: Do I have to appear in court.  The check was only $35.  I want my $35 -- but not enough to take a day off from work to appear in court.  Any suggestions?
