3Twg9Uuuaa	This time of year spots are hard to find as most are closed for winter. Many are in the Angeles National forest, Los padres National forest. that are in the mountains. Malibu state park is one that would be open but spots get taken early. Refugio beach is a favorite of mine. good luck!

Eli is kind of gay acting too, but probably not in reality. TO is flamboyantly gay. Deion Sanders had to have been gay in his day - all that flashy clothes and afraid to hit anyone.

RFM7mRWpaa	Well if you want to get a golf scholarship at a good school. First you should be playing for your high school team, and then be playing competitve tournaments. Then the best way you can get a scholarship is to attend the IJGA, the International Junior Golf Academy, where Hank Haney, Tiger's coach is the head instructor. Students that go to the IJGA, are all aspiring golfers who want to get a schoalarship, play college golf, and hopefully become pro from all around the world. Students attend the IJGA, for a full semester or school year, so you can try to apply there next semester, or next year for your junior year, or for your senior year. It's a full academy with academics, where you can finish your high school there, and you live in house dorms with other students as roomates, and house parents. In the academy, you work and improve your game by getting coached by Hank Haney and his instructors. Then you play competitve tournaments in the IJGT, the International Junior Golf Tour with other students, and from there, colleges see you for recruiting and scholarships. Not everyone that goes to the IJGA, gets scholarshops, so if you don't, you can stay there for their post graduate program, which is the same thing, and it will give you a chance to transfer out, and play college golf. There was a show in the Golf Channel called School of Golf: Hilton Head Island starring Hank Haney which shows lives of students in the IJGA. I recommend watching videos from this show before considering going to the IJGA, since this show is not in season, it's not on TV currently. If you consider going to the IJGA, you also need the will, since you will be away from home for a school year or semester, and most importantly, the money. It's really expensive going to the IJGA, it's around $40,000 for tuition, for a full school year, just for the golf, then another $10,000 for academics, it's really expensive. If you can't afford it, you can still probaly afford their summer, weekend, and holiday programs, where you go there like for a week for their summer, and holiday programs, and a weekend, for their weekend programs, and you get the same instruction, and experience as the full time students, but don't work with you for scholarships, and they run around $1,500 for each class. They have two campuses, they have a campus in Hilton Head, SC, and one in Arroyo Grande, CA in the central coast of California, south of San Luis Obispo, so if you want to go, choose the one you want to go to, or the one closest. If you have the money, and the will, you should consider going to the IJGA, you shouldn't miss out on this opportunity, if you want to get a scholarship, it's the best way, and you will have a better chance in getting one if you go to the IJGA, then if you don't. Also for what scores you have to shoot to get in the IJGA, you at least have to shoot in the 90s I think, and they will work with you so you can break 80 competitvely, because that's the main score to get competively, and colleges want you to break 70 at one point. For more information about the IJGA, and the show School of Golf: Hilton Head Island, the websites are below in the sources.|`|5q2pp09Uaa	what is it you want ....a college scholarship ???    write to me...i played college golf and am now a teaching professional    write to me and i can guide you..mail me|`|cXxyRqXvaa	Well if you want to become a pro, or even make a career of a sport, you must practice, then practice more, get your game 100% comfortable people say get your technic perfect but if your not comfortable it doesn't matter at all, but practice every day not just in summer. Then go to your local golf pro and he'll be able to steer you in the right direction, then don't forget about your schooling, you have to be the best at that first.|`|HB4E2rI6aa	Just keep focusing on golf and when the time comes to cross the bridge, you'll find a way. But it's very hard to stick with golf especially with ur handicap. that's my handicap and i'm grade 8...

wKnjGSU1aa	Yeah, I'm wit' you on that. I just posted a question about that earlier. It's kind of childish, I think we should just stick to asking football questions, after all, this is what this sectio is for, it's for us to speak about Mexican Football. Forget all that nonsense about going to other sections and bugging, that's just plain ignorant, from both sides, them and some people here. Then some people on here complain about people from other sections coming in here and talking trash, and some people from here are doing the same thing, so it's really inviting them to do the same thing. It's stupid to me. It's not just reflecting on them, it's really reflecting on all of us in this section.|`|8zgFyfibaa	I agree with pepe man I come from work too and, hoping to see what's new on yahoo answers.

Now we have people from nascar,basketball and other sections coming here because some peole from this sections made fake accounts and went to other section to talk shet.

Nzqt4Qu7aa	Meeeeee, definitely. CM Punk needs to finally get recognized for his awesome ability to wrestle. He is amazing in the ring, & hopefully will be a main event wrestler soon. Just hopefully he doesn't end up like John Cena. No offense to any Cena fans.|`|E6RNcXxeaa	i like CM Punk but i think he should have 2 more years in the mid and upper mid card just to really get used to the WWE type of wrestling and just to gain credibility with the fans. A lot of people felt he was rushed into the world title and some fans turned on him.|`|EA7oEQwMaa	i wuld|`|VENyKvgaaa	he was but now he's intercontinental champion so maybe in 2-3 years|`|cE8SQUEbaa	count me in...|`|76d426195a341fc16c57e6100bd0ef8caa	CM Punk sholud have better storylines,for real they need to put him in the big stuff like ppvs or championship matches more often|`|Q1MI6L96aa	I get the feeling he will have co-main event status on house show tours and never get a huge storyline push on TV. The company - for some reason - has not a clue on how to use him.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	I dont care for CM Punk much so no|`|KH9bbeCNaa	i actually really like CM Punk but i dont know why he gets bad storylines, him and Carlito are quite good in my opinion|`|Jy7t6grDaa	uhmm idk really, he doesn't fit the Main Even Wrestler status|`|4tvI9WYjaa	i think he deserve main event status give raw something new all so kane should be brought back up to the main event|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I agree CM Punk has great potential and is a great wrestler in my opinion. It's just in this point of his career he can't just go up against the best in this business like HBK undertaker chris jericho etc. I see him as the future of wwe one day and like i said the dude really got some potential. I rather liked his reign as champion because he took on all comers and did fine against main eventers.|`|mBDIniTxaa	He is a main event wrestler. Not really on pay per views yet.    Probably when guys like HBK and Taker leave he will be one that steps up to main event Mania and other big ppvs.

oMjVp4zGaa	I wouldn't waste the time. Do you have access to Toluca lake? you would do better at the city lake parks. As far as the L A River goes though, in long beach where the river comes out is right at the Queen Mary and is a prolific halibut area.

kGRkjw6Qaa	I was about the same in highschool, I played OLB, TE and LS though. You are good and can play anywhere, just ask the coach.|`|2scuBnf3aa	It depends, can you REALLY run a 4.7? That's very fast for high school and I have my doubts.. but if so then I think you could be a good corner back. You're probably a fine MLB too, since the speed has to help a lot, but you may be a little small unless you bulk up some if you're thinking of the next level. You sound strong enough though, so you're probably fine.

VghVdPfsaa	1. He shouldn't for his own good. Although, unfortunately for everyone, I think he will pull the same antics again.  2. If he does, prob with the Jets.  3. I doubt he'd do that. The Packers and Favre's relationship has coldened. I think both are beyond that.   4. I used to love him, but after last year's off season antics, I've lost a lot of respect for him. Granted, I will still consider him one of the best and liveliest players to play the great game of football. Although what happened isn't entirely his fault, some should lay on the Packers, I still hate the way he kept the Packers waiting to make other decisions because they needed his first. The retiring and unretiring got old and annoying. And poor Aaron Rodgers!     I'm in no way a Packers fan (Chargers  1), but I feel for them...|`|7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	I actually felt sorry for him this season. He was a great player, and a deserving Hall of Famer, but he hung on for one season too many. He should have stayed retired, and I hope he has the sense to retire for good this time and get on with his post-NFL life. I remember thinking he was wrong for just collapsing and giving Strahan the sack record, but I also remember watching a number of come from behind drives with wonder and awe at his skill and determination. I'm not a Packers or Jets fan either, but I can appreciate great players, whatever jersey they wear, and Favre was one. The key word there is WAS. He should hang em up.    Cheers|`|5jIdcbyYaa	Favre is an idiot. He wants to sign with the vikings, if he does get release or traded. I sure don't want him with the vikings because he only wants revenge against the packers.

I used to see a guy that was excited, enthusiastic and wanted to get out there and play. In New York, it was there, but it faded halfway through the season. He didn't even look like he was having fun anymore. Maybe the age hit him. Maybe he just missed the feeling of Green Bay. He was a legend and a leader there. He'll always be remembered as a Packer. When you think of Joe Montana, do you think about the 49ers or the Chiefs?    Not a Packers fan|`|NdTy3twjaa	I hope he doesn't come back.

EDIT:  amerika was in last place in the whole 2008, i think that is a little funnier than losing to tecos. and may i remind you america also lost to two primera division team during pre season and to cruz azul last pre season so dont say cruz azul hasnt won in 5 years. and atleast we are reaching finals, america doesnt even reach liguilla|`|athSKc9uaa	I knew Alejandro Vela would miss.... that is all.

Honestly if you end up taking the sport pretty seriously and start riding a lot you'll notice the things holding you back pretty quickly.So it Really does depend on how much you plan on boarding me personally I don't even like recommending them to new riders, just a couple weeks ago I had my dad out learning to ride and he was on my brothers lamar than I had him ride one of my quality boards and he himself was pretty amazed at how much easier it was to ride, a quality board really does help quite a lot in the development of a riders skills.|`|5V6jEg9saa	Ha!

AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|AUjTaLvwaa	30-27 Cardinals in OT|`|rNUyV1EYaa	If the Cardinals win as you say, I think the score will be something like 27-24.|`|qo0kKtvpaa	Cardinals will win by -9|`|gDKIxwRSaa	Cardinals won't win.|`|xPXUzZiJaa	if the cardinals do win they will win by 6 points it will definitely be a close game|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Steelers 24-17

TdcZM4Iqaa	i think you should get a 12 inch it will work well for both infield and outfield and you can definitely use the same size glove for a long time.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	You really need to just go to a sporting goods store and try some on and see what's comfortable.  Don't get anything smaller than an 11, and even that's way too small.  I have a 12.5 and I play infield for my school and my glove is not too big.  Make sure you get one with soft leather and a big pocket, too.|`|xPXUzZiJaa	u should get the one that fits u right good luck!|`|VghVdPfsaa	Well, it depends how old you are. If you're in your teenage years and pretty much done growing, I'd get a 11 inch to 12 inch glove.     Here's Sports Authority's suggestions:  http://www.sportsauthority.com/sm-baseba...|`|GBtet3Jsaa	great question|`|s4VzPulYaa	you should get a size 12 1/2, fielders glove.  get a 12 1/2 because it is a 1/2 inch bigger than the ball, which will work for either infield or outfield.  When you get older, get a smaller glove if you are infield, and a bigger mitt if you are outfield.
ZBcqZG2Saa	Without a mid card there can be not main event.  I hate the tri branded shows all the time.  I haven't watched one in many monthes.  I find the creative team gets lazy with the main event guys thinking all they need to do is have two big names go at it.  I would much rather watch the Khali Kiss cam, Cryme Tyme, Festus, Hornswaggle then another HHH love fest.|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	Lol, this thread looks familiar...    Just saying. As logical as it seems for WWE to be in the need of pushing younger guys so they wouldn't have to do tri-branded PPVs, the idea looks even better on paper. What if WWE didn't have these PPVs. Are we expected to believe that they would push mid card guys? It's a possibility. However, I'd be screwed if I were to order a Smackdown exclusive PPV with Great Khali squashing Jimmy Wang Yang. But perhaps WWE's decision to do tri-branded shows came after their failure to make stars. So they had to go with what they know what would work. I'd rather have a plethera of main event and top tier mid card guys available before WWE jumps into the deep end and eliminates tri-branded PPVs all together.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	I can see where you are coming from.  But the truth of the matter is that their aren't enough titles, especially ECW, and there isn't enough time on each show to develop so many different storylines.  Which is why, I believe, single branded PPV's are defunct!  So I vote to keep it they way they are...but I do understand what you are saying and I respect your opinion.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I have to disagree with you sorry.But the Smackdown and ECW PPV's kept bombing like crazy.You are right they have improved but they are slowing going back down again.Really I think it is best for them to keep all three shows on one PPV.Actually I enjoy them more seeing all three brands opposed to just one Brand on each.Personally I think there should just be less PPV's in general so that there is time to build longer feuds and more hype.I would like to see more of the mid carders in the show.I think the wwe should add them into the main event instead of having all three tittles on the line every time. You do bring up great points though but I think they should just change the matches on the show instead of the same old all three titles on the line and the women's title and another match.|`|NCPJGOlIaa	There should be a PPV every other month and they should have more quality matches.  The amount of PPVs has gotten out of hand.  Who even wants to pay to see some of them.  They should keep the main 4 and have 2 others.  They start hyping WM in January so you can remove No Way Out.|`|MBTxmuNpaa	Dude i read this ? On the wrestlezone forums today are u the guy who made it or did u copy and paste it here|`|AtJXqxN2aa	When I too first saw Backlash 2007 being tri-band I freaked out. Funny WWE major downhill was from 2007. Anyway I think the reason why they had Smackdown and RAW exclusive PPV was bcause at the time they were trying to prove who the dominate PPV was. But that is now long and gone.    This has resulsted in rushed storylines because RAW champ has to defend every 3 weeks when he  defended every two months. Same with Smackdown. The real problem here is ECW. 1 belt. Obviously they can't have a PPV for 1 match.     One Night Stand is not an option anymore because no one cares anymore about ECW vs WWE. Mainly because Vince left most of us puzzled when he made ECW part of WWE. I mean I am seeing ECW taking over RAW and fans saying the F word and flipping the finger at WWE wrestlers. Then I saw out of no whre DX performing on ECW and the fans cheering.    Back to the topic. The tri-band PPV also saw the end of PPV such as New Year's Reolution. Then again it also lead to No Way Out where there were two elimination chamber matches. There is some good and bad to this decision.     But if it weren't tri-band Wrestlemania, Summerslam, Royal Rumble and Survivor Series would have been a better treat. We see the Survivor Series elmination tag match and see RAW and Smackdown as one team. Before it was RAW vs Smackdown    Were just going to have to live with it. But at the end of the day always remember this is not a sport, it's an occupation. Smackdown vs Raw brought in millions, ECW vs WWE brought in trillions. At the end of the day Vince is smiling making his money.    To answer the ast part of your question yes it is going to increase ratings, in fact rating shas increased. But still increased ratings for rushed and poorly delivered storylines. Are they worth it.........    It's not worth it in case of the fans.    But for the business it's more than worth it.

In  my opinion, it is best to builld up endurance first before your speed.  So, start running 3 miles 5-6 days of the week (if you can handle that) and then every week add another mile.  So the next week run 4miles, 5miles etc.  Once your endurance is decent, then put in speed workouts.  Then you can run a .5 mile or one mile really fast several times in a row.

2zHw7Lnjaa	They're a few years old but I'm a big fan of the Titleist 804 OS irons.  They are oversized and have a larger sweet spot (for the weekend players).  But they are forged instead of cast which makes them more consistent with respect to distance and improves workability of the ball.    Nice clubs for a average to better than average player,. and you can save a few bucks.    I generally like Mizuno irons but I haven't hit the new MX's.  In the past they have made a great set of players irons (the muscle backs) but I'm not sure about CB's.   King Cobra also makes a nice CB iron, the S9.|`|ayLYuIvOaa	its your experience mostly  mizunos are great for people who usually hit the ball consistantly well because a lot of them a blades and if you are not that good you might find more chunk shots|`|2fJLXXmqaa	I would say Mizuno or Adams. They are very underrated clubs. I have Adams and Im glad the pro introduced me to them because I never would have picked them because they dont stand out in the store the way Cobras, Nikes, Callaways or Taylormades do, but they are without a doubt the best irons I have ever hit. They are idea A3s and they come with some nice hybrids also. The only thing I didnt really like was that the hybrids were from 5 to 3 and Im a little better than that now. Mizuno has some of the best feeling blades and cavity back irons I have ever hit. The Mp-32s and Mp-57s feel a lot like my Adams when I hit them. Although they are more of a players club and you feel it a little more with the Mizunos when you hit them off center. Im not saying that Cobra, Nike, and Taylormade make bad clubs, but I am saying that there are other brands that make good clubs and you kind of have to go and find them. Here are some others. Ben Hogans look great at set up and feel like no other club. Nickent has good feeling cubs similar to Taylormade. Remember that new clubs are always coming out so be sure to go and look for clubs on your own without the salesman trying to get you and but the most expensive set, just look around on your own and pick what you want.|`|VTxQmJq1aa	i have hit a lot of different sets of irons and mizuno is definitely the best...i have the mp 57s. the only reason they aren't as popular as taylormade irons is because they don't spend the money to advertise...and i don't believe they pay any pros to play them either. best irons out in my opinion.|`|UKg4KhLqaa	Mizunos are good but I like Callaways,exp Callaway FT i-Brid Iron Set

8bTder08aa	He stepped on his front heel with his hind foot as he was breaking from the gate.  This isn't that uncommon, and in the universe of injuries that racehorses can have, it's relatively minor.      As Kimnmiamisax says, they'll take some time to evaluate the extent of the injury.  Fortunately, jockey Edgar Prado realized that all was not well and didn't persevere with Nicanor, pretty much just let him gallop out.      If they determine that Nicanor didn't sustain a more serious injury, such as a torn ligament or tendon, didn't chip anything, and doesn't come up sore anywhere else, they'll give him time for the leg to heal.  How long that takes depends on how badly he grabbed himself:  the severity of a grabbed quarter can range from a chunk sliced out to "contusions and abrasions" (cuts/scrapes and bruises).    They'll hand-walk him for a few days, and as soon as he's deemed sound for under-saddle work, they'll start working him again:  first jogging around the shedrow or ponied out on the track, and then they'll start working him up to another race.    I'd say that any chance he'll make the Derby is out at this point.  He needs graded stakes earnings to get into the Derby, unless by a miracle fewer than 20 horses enter (not likely).  It would be tough to let the grabbed quarter heal, get him cranked up to race again, and then get him into the races he needs to get graded earnings.  Matz and the Jacksons aren't going to rush him.    The jury is still out on how much of a racehorse Nicanor turns out to be.  No way to get a handle on him when he grabs a quarter right out of the gate.|`|RyZHhI6aaa	No, his career is not in jeopardy.  What it means is that he stepped on himself.  His hind foot went too far forward when his front foot was still on the ground and the toe of his hind foot stepped on the back of his front foot and cut it.  It's sort of like if you've ever been walking right in front of someone and they step on the back of your shoe... except that Nicanor doesn't have the benefit of the leather and rubber... it would be like someone stepping on the back of your foot while you're barefoot and they're wearing shoes.  It would hurt and might even break the skin.  Nicanor will need a week or two depending on how bad it is, then he will resume training.  So look for him to race again in March is my guess.
gvMr9lMbaa	Do not drop him if u don't want him try trade him he is a good player.
xWApXu8Aaa	Your M1 Garand uses a peep sight that has a knob on either side of the rear peep.  One controls elevation and the other windage.    As you look through the rear aperture, you want to focus on the FRONT sight blade and your eye will automatically center it in the sight picture.    The link below shows proper sight alignment when using a battle peep sight.  http://www.tpub.com/content/advancement/...    This link explains the proper technique for sighting in your rifle.  http://www.fulton-armory.com/sighting_in...    Good luck -|`|TvARYVRJaa	it is a peep sight that most likley ,,, flips to a differant size hole  try to move  by pushing or pulling stright back or forward  ok thanks  um garand  diagram  may help . com mi1|`|oZj6DfpKaa	The M1 uses an aperture sight which is a pinhole sight at the rear and a straight pin at the muzzle end.  The pin hole usually has a flip tipe that allows you to use a larger or smaller pinhole.  The larger is for close objects and the smaller if for farther shots.  You just shoulder the weapon and alight the front pin in the center of the pin hole and place the tip of the pin on the target you wish to shoot.  One you have it sighted in like that, you are good to go!

After winning the Aussie Open, she has moved from No.2 to the top rank.|`|by7BQ2npaa	I'm starting to believe what some tennis fans and insiders have been saying recently. I thought it was silly before, but not anymore! That the Williams have been buying their titles or paying off top players to lose, tank or retire mysteriously from a match. I don't know, it's either the Williams buying/paying their way or the USTA paying off players so that an American girl can win. Some say to look at recent Wimbledons, US Opens and Ericsson Opens, and now Aussie Open 2009 for proof of this and similar outcomes. Remember, the Williamses are the only Americans in the top 30 now, yet at the same time the level of talent and professionalism from players has surpassed them and are too much in number on the tour. They actually play week-in week-out on the tour as well!

bB5d5YVeaa	That's a tricky question and I will explain why.    For the most part, you can just use a silicone based lubricant and rust inhibitor to keep it from rusting.  Some good choices are often made for firearms.  The best rust inhibitor seems to be Birchwood-Casey Sheath product.  Another decent lube is Ballistol.    Bear this in mind though.  Some folks use exotic chemicals to protect their knives, then one day, they decide to cut a piece of salami with their knives while they are camping.  BIG MISTAKE!  I've known a few gunsmiths that got leukemia and they always wondered what they did to contract that horrible disease (cancer of the blood cells).  My guess is that they were using exotic chemicals for cleaning and preserving the guns they were working-on, and failed to adequately wash their hands afterward.  They then contaminated their food with small amounts of those chemical products.    In summary.  Decide exactly how you will be using your knife.  If you want to play John Rambo and use your knife for everything from cutting down trees to make shelters to cleaning and dressing wild boars to cook over and open fire, then be mindful of the types of products you use to clean and lubricate your knives!  Hunters take note!|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Keep it clean and sharp for safety.  And if it gets wet, wipe it off.  Also, if it is a field knife and not used on food, you can wipe it down with a little penetrating oil or gun oil every now and again.  You could also heat it up real good and treat it with Militec which will bond with the steel and make it pre-lubed and water repellent, but don't use it on any food.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Lubricate it with a thin film of White Lithium Grease.*|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	I like to wipe down my knives with vegetable oil after every use, if possible.  It prevents them from rusting; and since vegetable oil is a food product, you can safely use the knife to cut up food.  As has been mentioned, you don't want to put anything on your knife that you don't want to ingest; unless you never use your knife for kitchen purposes.|`|Cwex6straa	The best to do is to wipe it down after it gets wet ASAP

Hopkins left Pavlik with a very heavy emotional letdown. He beat him so soundly. I think it took away a lot of Pavliks confidence.

NC8Vb36Daa	The steelers look to be the fave. But the public love an underdog story so that's prob why they've picked the cardinals. Personally I think the Steelers will win even though I'd hate them to win (boring team to watch, not to keen on the QB etc.) But then again you only have to look at last years superbowl to see the "underdog" story (well the Giants were underdogs compared to NE), It just goes to show anything can happen in a superbowl. My heart says Cardinals but my brain says Steelers, NEVER bet/risk money with your heart! Ha Ha! Hope that helps.|`|j7ZIK7imaa	that is a really tough call I would limit the betting this year if the spread is that small. The Cardinals have a fantastic offense with Warner and Fitzgerald, plus Highthower and James have been killing latley.    Steelers, Roethlisbergur has been very great in the postseason especially with his number one reciever, and if their saftey and Polamanu on Fitzgerald Warner doesn't have a lot of options without Boldin.    SO TAKE IT EASY THIS YEAR DON'Y]T BET YOUR ENTIRE PAYCHECK|`|zCSBVAbyaa	The Cardinals should win this game handily. Warner is unstoppable and Tomlin is too inexperienced as an NFL coach to get a world championship. Arizona 27 Pittsburgh 17|`|OeGnRJedaa	I'm probably not going to place a bet on the game either, but if I did, it would be on the Steelers -6.5.  If the Steelers were to have played the Cardinals a month ago the Steelers would have been double digit favorites.  To get into this Superbowl, the Cardinals caught the Panthers at the right time, then they beat the Eagles, who really weren't that good this season, and probably didn't deserve to be in the playoffs.  I think the Steelers defense will do enough to hold Warner and his offense to less than 20 points, while Big Ben will put up more than 30 points.  Take the Steelers and give the 6.5, bet the house, then sell your house and buy a bigger one with your winnings.|`|a6EndAPiaa	At -6.5 I love the Steelers.  AT -7 I still like the Steelers but I do not think it is quite as good of a play.|`|WP5dSiCmaa	Whisenhunt knows how to stop Ben. Cards by 14.|`|hMkb7H31aa	Only if your house is in foreclosure.|`|FPmSgMsNaa	bet on the steelers -6.5 if you know whats good for you|`|rrjr3jrKaa	VOTE STEELERS!  IT IZ THE BEST THING U WILL DO IN UR LIFE    best answer lady- thx 2 u!|`|c90TJKe4aa	lol the publics favoring the cards i would say more people lose thier house on that bet than forclousure|`|prATe7iqaa	Go with the Steelers.  I am a fan of the Steelers, but it all comes down to certain things.  For example, Superbowl experience.  Only 5 Cardinals have ever seen the Superbowl, 20 Steelers have.  Also, think of the pressure the Cardinals will be under to win their first.  It is just another game for the Steelers, with a little more on the line, but that's just my opinion.
e5c347190016113ac012b8aa79ed41aeaa	A better gear ratio will make it go faster but with slower acceleration.    Big Bore Kit I believe is a way of increasing the bore and piston of the engine giving more power.    A larger less restrictive muffler will improve performance.    You could use a nitrous booster.|`|2110658ab4d8cd2dd3e14a6c5bf46098aa	If you have a Sport model the quickest and cheapest way to modify you Goped is to swap out the drive spindle. A lower ratio .650 will give more bottom end torque and a higher ratio like .850 will give a few more MPH..approximately 4mph faster      As for the Big Bore Kit...that's an engine rebuild...not recommended for the beginner or even a novice in my opinion.

g4Dxlklxaa	Where'd you find it in stock?!?!? Email me and let me know!    Sportsman's guide is out. Cheaperthandirt is definitely NOT cheaper than dirt. Where'd you buy?|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	There are non corrosive berdan primers.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Berdan are what commie countries use. New production is not corrosive, military surplus is. They use the same primer type. Now what your buying is corrosive. Just get some really hot water and blast it down the bore with a turkey baster as soon as you can and wash the bolt face and your good. You don't need to use anything but water, windex is pretty much water anyway and ammonia can hurt the bore. You just need to dissolve the salts.|`|AA11729094	Just because it's Berdan doesn't automatically mean it's corrosive. While there is a lot of berdan primed ammo that is in fact corrosive, later production stuff, like the 80's production you mention may very well be non corrosive. A safe rule of thumb is to treat any berdan primed ammo as if it were corrosive and take the appropriate cleaning steps after shooting, Better to be safe, than sorry with a rusted barrel and bolt.
a6EndAPiaa	it is not -6.5% it is -6.5 points    That means that when you bet on the game you are taking the Steelers to win by 7 or more points.  If the Steelers win by less than 7 you loose the bet.    So if the final score was Steelers 17 Cardinals 10    the score for you would be Steelers 10.5 Cardinals 10.    You take the final score and subtract the - points or add the + points.|`|ae5b94582952d6bd5e0f06acc5f5bf04aa	It's how many points one team spots another .|`|xt4vcVIiaa	^ However as you can't have a half point in football, the .5 is there so there can't be a tie known as a no-action or push in betting.

They don't want you to know what they are saying.|`|51oZWvKPaa	so people dont read their lips or hear wat they r saying|`|49GrnCOMaa	Yes.  They do this so their opponent won't hear them either.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	That is exactly the reason. The player at the net typically will instruct his partner who is serving, to serve in a particular area, so that he could accordingly anticipate a return that would enable him to hit it for a winner.    So, you dont want your opponents to know what the strategy is. Hence they cover their mouths while discussing.|`|sptrtwxlaa	Mhhm.

6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	The answer to this question has always been in dispute.  Because the first person on the field prior to game time was an umpire. But, he was a baseball player before he retired and then became an umpire.   So I guess that question could be "the first umpire and ball player" were the same person. And then it depends on which Record Book you believe. One says Billy 'Big Boy' Phillips, and another says, Robert 'Bullet Bob' Pendergrass.  Take your choice.    Here are a few 'firsts' from by 'Book of Firsts':  1st homerun NL - Ross Barnes, Chicago, May 2, 1876 and Charlie Jones, Cincinnati, May 2, 1876  AL - Erve Beck, Cleveland, April 25, 1901    1st pinch-hit grandslam NL - Mike O'Neill, St. Louis, June 3, 1902  AL - Marty Kavanagh, Cleveland, Sept. 24, 1916    1st lefthanded catcher - Bill Harbidge, Hartford, May 6, 1876  1st lefdthanded pitcher - Bobby Mitchell, Cincinnati, 1878  1st pitcher to wear glasses - Will White, Boston, 1877  .|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Who else?

ntFW13AUaa	If you need green and yellow for school, I would get a custom Rawlings Glove. Pro Preffereds and HOHs will last a long time, personally i like the HOH better. You can find them online, I'm not exactly what the sites are. Just go to google or yahoo and search custom rawlings catchers mitt. As far as gear, All Star offers custom chest protector and shin guard sets at www.all-starsports.com, i think thats the website. again, if that doesn't work, just google it. Im not sure on the price of the gear, but for the gloves the PP is 400, the HOH 300.

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	It actually may be hard to find a place with decent action in August. The water levels on this side of the continental divide are low at that time of year ( August) and not all sections of rivers are still navigable. The best time is often late spring or early summer when there's still a bit of meltwater runoff, it's a little warmer than early spring but there's a trade off in that early spring also has the highest, wildest rides. I'm afraid you can't have warm water and crazy action. It's one or the other.   The major rivers that are run in that area are the Kennebec, the Penobscot or the Dead rivers. Lots of rafting outfits to choose from so just google white water on either of those rivers and you should get quite a few hits.|`|AA11045576	Many options: Commercial trip or private trip, personal equipment or rented gear, solo trip or with friends or strangers. Big water or little water. August is also a good time to go tubing.  Being in an innertube and in the water is a tradeoff with a raft in bigger water. Rafting is a social sport and no skill is required. You do need a PFD and snug shoes.

EGe0k8P6aa	I'm a firm believer that the first firearm a beginning shooter should use is a rifle chambered in .22 LR. You'll get a lot of argument about which specific gun, but most folks agree that a .22 rifle is the gun you learn to shoot with because the gun is usually inexpensive (unless you buy a really high-end rifle), the ammunition is cheap, the round has negligible recoil and a mild report.Those virtues mean that it won't intimidate a beginning shooter and won't cause him/her to develop bad habits.     As far as a specific gun, I'm a firm believer in a single-shot being the best choice for beginners. I've been roundly criticized for that in the past. However its my belief that single shots are safer and help drum good shooting habits into the beginner. The safety factor comes from the fact that there is no magazine. This reduces the odds that a person will "accidentally" chamber a round and fire an "unloaded" gun. The good shooting habits comes from the fact that since you only have one shot, it forces you to learn to make your first shot count.    So what would be a good beginners gun... In my opinion, if you want a new rifle, then look at a gun like the Savage Mk. 1, Marlin 15YN, Henry Acu-bolt, or H&R Sportster. They're simple, reliable, and accurate. If you don't mind a pre-owned rifle, look at the used rack at your local gun store. Chances are you'll find a number of great bolt-action single shots made anywhere from 1930-1980 which are good quality and still have decades of service left in them.    If you insist on a magazine rifle, then look at a manual repeating rifle like the Savage Mk II, the Marlin 39AS Golden, or Marlin 980S. Any one of those rifles should deliver good to very good accuracy, reliability, and years of service, new or used.    If you insist on a semi-automatic rifle (which I consider to be the worst choice for a beginner), look at the Savage model 64 or the Marlin model 60. Both are reliable, accurate and inexpensive rifles out of the box.|`|iDVJi9alaa	A .458 Winchester Magnum.

GFHzhnnTaa	If it comes down to 1, & only 1 gun, I'd go with the 12 ga. shotgun. You can use all types of shot/size on the birds & small game, and slugs etc for the bigger stuff. If it were me, I'd get an extra "rifled" barrel & add a scope & shoot the modern slugs for the hogs & deer. (Can't help ya with the kangaroos. We don't have many here in the good old US of A, & last time I showed up @ the local zoo with my weapon, they weren't very helpful in helping me locate the wily kangaroo ! ) Anyway, my 2-cents worth.    Good Luck !|`|h2KkiKK3aa	I would go with the .30-06 or the .303 british, which shouldn't be hard to find in your country.  the 30-06, about 300-400 meters max  the .303 british, about 300 meters max  always go for shot placement and you'll never fail.  edit* a 12 gauge shotgun would be good too, but respect your laws and don't get a semi auto.|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	An interesting tidbit of information here.  The Eskimos generally use a 22 Hornet rifle for the vast majority of their hunting.  Some have even killed polar bears with a 22 Hornet.  They are usually lightweight guns, easy to handle, very accurate out to 150 yards, and the casings are easy to reload using simple hand tools.  If you ever went to Alaska or the Yukon, Northwest Territories of Nunavet regions of Canada, and met-up with some Eskimos...chances are, they will be armed with 22 Hornet rifles.|`|FhHIAbmLaa	A 12 gauge shotgun.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Reno's right.  There is no rifle cartridge that is a 'do all' for all game.

THyCWTMAaa	The first thing you want to do is the basics. Stand still, and practice pushing your skate to the side, making "snow". make sure you push OUT and not IN!  Once you have that down, try it moving. When you do this, it is important to bend your knees!! That's where all the control is.  This kind of stop is called a Snowplow Stop.    Once you can do that, you can try to do a Hockey Stop. This is a lot like the Snowplow Stop, but you turn to the side as you do it, forcing you to stop quicker.    To skate a lot faster, again it's important to bend your knees to allow you to exert the most power as you can.|`|ttbho89Vaa	learn the T stop or the hockey stop. they are wayyy better and faster than the snowplow stop. haha

I'd say go for something like a GILERA SMT 50CC, nice looking, that till be appreciated for years! Or maybe an 85CC    Then once 16/17 move up to something bigger maybe like a 2005 yamaha tt-r 125cc or similar.  This will give some more off road fun and it can be used at track days or on the road.    Good Luck  I hope this has helped.    x
ag4WG3wQaa	I would say if i had to pick from what you have i would say tennis. The best exercise you can do is swimming.|`|hecLfcedaa	I don't know how much lbs are. I'm from Australia but a good sport is Tae Kwon Do. But.. since you want to do either tennis or soccer I suppose I can't suggest that. Well, tennis and soccer are two very active sports. Soccer, is a more aerobic, endurance sport seeing as it lasts 90mins a game. Doing lots of soccer should improve your endurance so you don't get winded as much. Tennis, however is also an endurance sport. You have to sprint from one side of the court to another for a long time and I'm sure if you did tennis it would improve your stamina and agility. Plus, hitting the ball back and forward along the court as hard as you can will probably after a while tone your arms.|`|4wTbdsJgaa	Definitely do soccer, because it takes a lot more energy to play it.  You have to run for an hour and a half nonstop, while in tennis you get breaks.  Soccer will work your legs, and core, and even your arms some too.  Definitely go with soccer.  Some advice on getting up your endurance is to run a lot, but run a certain routine.  If you are running around your block then jog the first 3 driveways, and then sprint the fourth one.  Then go jog 3 and sprint the fourth.  Do this the whole time you are runnng.  Trust me this will work wonders.|`|Ai8H5N8paa	just running and some sit ups. but if u can get somewhere to swim thats the best, it uses every muscle. but idk how tall u r but either way 120 aint big, just letting you know. your prolly a sweetheart|`|QdVyo8EYaa	Honestly, if working out isn't your thing or your creative I would buy a Wii, wii spots is great fun and is an exercise.|`|U60L7qNEaa	swimming actually...it works 75% of the muscles in your body if performed rite + it promotes cardiovascular + respiratory health besides also helping you to lose weight|`|0ltY2WjOaa	Out of those two options, I would think that tennis would be the best overall workout because it would work your arms, as with your legs and buns.  However, the BEST workout for your body is swimming because it works your whole body.  But since you only have those two options, I would go with tennis.|`|r2o6Tpp1aa	I would say soccer if u want to be healthy and fit. U will learn to get used to running if ur in soccer. But instead of those 2 I would pick Gymnastics. You learn strength, get fit, and be healthy. But soccer might ware u out in my opinion.

So I would say man thongs.|`|e961fc4be7c3b789224a99d158baad9caa	ahhh i think he would have to keep everything tight so boxer briefs|`|7ZUOPfmFaa	Most likely he wears briefs or boxer briefs for support.

n2O0NwR6aa	Well, a layout is a more advanced skill.  Layouts rotate slower than tucks or pikes, so you need to have a more powerful takeoff, and get higher in the air, to make it around with a straight body.  And when you're first learning a layout, it can take some time to figure out how to flip while holding a good, hollow body position.  A lot of gymnasts arch or pike until they get the hang of it.    People who can do a good layout, though, often find a pike more difficult.  They tend to over rotate, because they're used to doing the layout.  And it can be harder to land a pike, because you have to open your hip angle but keep your knees straight at the same time - and then bend your knees on the landing - all at the right time.    So yeah - I guess they're both hard in their own way!|`|XmhYNlumaa	the back pike to me it is hard because i landed on my neck a few time and stoped doin them.. idk|`|dmrP4fH9aa	pikes scare me cause i feel that i am not rotating fast enough in the air. layouts should be harder for me but i have more confidence while doing them. also layouts are always worth more in the code of points|`|fCKFqXN8aa	The back layout is harder.  Judges see it the process tuck, pike, layout.  Also the layout makes you look better and you know what you are doing.|`|1MOqg0yzaa	i can do both, but it took me longer to learn the layout|`|eLDjiAcQaa	I say that a back pike is harder...idk maybe its justt me.....|`|1fGBLJvVaa	layout    in my opinion :)

LjqoMHMJaa	The stronger your legs are the faster you will be. You must also run in the correct form. (You want to extend your legs far and out, run on your toes, and when you lift your legs from the ground to run you want to basically do high knees.
igvu3ifUaa	every thing from your butt down. and your arms. ....ok you use just about every thing but the big ones are in your legs.     remeber when you sprint to relax your face ans hands. save the energy you would be using for those muscles for your legs. if you watch olympic runners sprint you notice that their hands and face kinda jiggle when they run.|`|2dke6ChJaa	leg and neck|`|htMOl3c4aa	Calves, Quads, Hamstrings, Hip Flexors, Biceps, Triceps, Forearms, sprinting involves many different muscle groups that work in unison.|`|Wy7oZGvZaa	hamstrings and quads and calfs anything with the legs|`|DcEBhY02aa	everything from your neck down.|`|EDseak6Paa	Pretty much all your upper arm muscles.

yTTGssXRaa	Less humid air is better because of how the body utilizes sweat to cool itself. The production of sweat does not actually cool your body its the evaporation of sweat from the skin that cools your body. The evaporation of sweat is more efficient in less humid weather. Your body will naturally try to adjust in hot / humid weather by slowing down your muscles. You typically will feel like you a applying the same level of effort but will have slower times.

GO CARDINALS!!!!!!!!!|`|CHZaXrOZaa	Steelers|`|AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|YeNp4m8haa	I hate both, but Cardinals don't stand a chance.
bB5d5YVeaa	I don't live in Missouri, but I have to believe it has some pretty decent guns laws.  There are a number of firearms related companies located in Missouri...like MidwayUSA.    Check the state laws on hunting.  In my native Pennsylvania, I was allowed to hunt with a handgun at age 18.  So, I could obviously own a gun at that age.  Carrying a handgun concealed was another story.  I had to wait till age 21 to apply for a permit to carry a concealed firearm.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	Missouri - state firearms law  http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/MOSL....

WnQ3fhVhaa	I personally have done the Elite hockey camp. It was great . I have also heard that Can/Am are pretty good as well.   Well Bob I have seen some hockey camps for adults that are in Canada. Even while I played in Canada they had several advertised at the rink I was at. Some of us never had a chance to learn hockey as kids . Since I was a girl and in South Florida I was not allowed according to the rink here at the time . But The adult camps are usually for all levels and they are a good thing as who doesn't want to improve. Besides a weekend camp or a week long one with pretty much nothing but hockey is a great thing .|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Are adult hockey camps an American thing because I have never heard of such a thing but I keep seeing them referenced here?

Including this year's game, three of the four times such a matchup has occurred, the Pittsburgh Steelers were involved.

ak5A435maa	obviously the Mets will have the best pen. Putz, K-Rod in the back of the bullpen = win    and bonus:    1. Johan Santana  2. Roy Halladay  3. CC Sabathia  4. Jake Peavy  5.

The Mets are a joke they b*tch about everything. They tried to argue the crawford boxes in Houston because its too easy to hit home runs over. They hold on to the 86 world series because it's the only thing they have that could be considered a sufficient history. Also after the whole Piazza getting hit in the head they carried on forever and when they finally had their chance to even the score and hit Roger Clemens in the head their pitcher missed. Sorry but I have my reasons why i dislike them.|`|heytv3Awaa	everyone hates the Mets because they dont have alot of homerun hitters
utTFiz3gaa	I agree it is a bit unfair but it seems like you need someone to blame and when you are in that kind of leadership role its kind of expected. When a specific player or two or three aren't doing their jobs then its not like a new manager will suddenly give them their mojo back (i love that word.. mojo lol!) Maybe if the underachievement had something to do with the manager let's say being a total jerk then that's understandable... its like the whole Joe Girardi deal with people saying "is joe gonna be fired if the yankees don't make the playoffs?" for me if yankees don't make the playoffs i wouldn't be blaming joe girardi (well.. i guess it does depend on how they don't make the playoffs lol) i would most likely point my finger to the guy who produced jack all season long or the guy who just sucked when the team needed him the most or Derek Jeter! lol i'm just kidding i put derek jeter because i feel like he is so respected by people that no one would even blame him even if he did have a terrible season... but then again that is a horribly unfair thing to do!  >.    But if a team has had a certain manager for a loong time and has been horrible for a long time then maybe a different person with a different approach will be like a new beginning for them... something new, or as mike scioscia always says it would be turning the page and putting all the rest of it aside in the back :)|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	Well its the coach who makes the decisions that result in the outcome of the ballgames. Even though the coach may not have the best players he still is at fault for the team losing. There like the leader of a group, if the team loses the leader usually takes the blame.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	It depends on how long you have to wait for the successes to come. What about the Florida Marlins? They have talent year in and year out, they don't have many key players that are going to make a huge difference, granted they do have them. A manager has to be able to motivate the players day in and day out and he also has to get his message across.     If a manager can't get his message across is it his fault? Could be, but if the message isn't getting through than its time for someone new. Baseball isn't as bad about firing managers as the NBA and the NFL though.     And lets not forget about the sports motto here when it comes to ownership. "What about you done for me lately?" If the manager isn't doing anything than the boot will be there shortly.|`|L77OlY1naa	You make a great point on patience that's the key to success in the MLB.Explain how a team can get rid of a coach when the people up in the skybox are hiding.The only managers that should get the shaft are the ones that make guarantees.But hell Im a Met fan an I can say that Torre should still be across town.But randolph needed the boot but they did it SOOOO wrong.After the 1st collapse not at Mid. after a game.Its not always the Manager it's the people they surround themselves with.Like Rick Peterson did real good in Oakland in NY he blew.Hes the reason Pelfery is struggling and Wagner was so inconsistent he tried to change the way they all threw and stuff they are professionals they have earned there position from what they KNOW don F*CK with it.So Yes the Managers get the *** end of everything when it come to losing

CBVlu3Gvaa	Nike has always been a solid company.  In terms of years in the "Golf Industry"  they are relative newcomers.  Like any company...they have their followers and of course those that hate them.....|`|AYkEwqRXaa	I love Nike products.  I've used them since '03.  I've always played well with them.  My game has improved every year.  The Sumo driver and One Platinum ball was the winningest driver golf ball combo on tour last year and Tiger only played half the year.  Everybody has a brand they're loyal to.  I don't knock any other brands(with the exception of Callaway irons; don't like the look) and will recommend other brands that I've played(Mizuno irons and Ping woods).  I like other Nike products outside of golf equipment so it was just a natural fit for me.  I play:<br>  <br>  Driver- Nike SQ Sumo 5000 10.5*<br>  3 Wood- Nike SQ2 13*<br>  Nike CPR- 18* Hybrid<br>  Nike CPR3- 21* Hybrid<br>  Nike Sasquatch Hybrid 24*<br>  Nike Pro Combo irons- 5-PW<br>  Nike Forged 53* wedge<br>  Nike TW 56* wedge<br>  <br>  I may get a set of VR Split Cavities this weekend(definitely want a set) and a VR wedge 52*.|`|syzMIfLLaa	I have the split cavities, and I like them a lot.  As I was walking to the counter to pay for them I saw the nike sq fairways on sale and grabbed the three wood with out hitting it and turned out to be the best thing I ever did.  I'm really pleased with all nike products.  I haven't needed their customer service yet but as I said, their products are great.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I have the SuMo 5000 and a SQ fairway wood (from 2006).  I also played the original SuMo driver.  I really liked all of them.  The 5000 just looks awesome, and it feels so sweet when you catch it on the screws (which, sadly, isn't as often as I'd like).  Some people don't like the dual crown look.  It didn't bother me with the older version, and it certainly doesn't bother me now, especially since they improved it.  BTW, the only reason I ditched the old SQ was because I dented the sole.  It was a poor choice to set up next to the tee marker, looking back.  I've learned a LOT since then.  Ever seen a grown man cry?  If you'd been there- you just might have.  <br>  <br>  They make their drivers with a 45.75" stock shaft.  You might want to look into seeing if you need it that long.  I know I didn't.  The fairway woods are longer, as well.  Make sure to get fit.<br>  <br>  I can't speak about the Vr irons- though I really wanna see what they're like.  If they're as good as my woods, I might have to save up for them.... and convince the wife it's a good idea LOL.|`|l4pVsxoraa	Nike is up there in the golf equipment world.  Maybe they haven't quite caught TaylorMade or Callaway but they produce a quality product just the same.   <br>  <br>  Have you tried these new Victory Reds?  At the very least you should hit some demos before making up your mind.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	i use wilson a friend has nike blades and like them. he even plays better. but it's also psychological.|`|AA11648664	nike is a pretty good club. My dad was on nike staff and i use to play the cci forged blades. however there new line i'm not to sure about the new victory's look cheap and k martish... they are overall a good golf company but if you go to golf retail stores (Edwin watts) they will tell you they hold no value..There woods are very solid and i play with the sumo2 3 wood and love it... but just like any golf club you have to like it and feel comfortable with it...and if it feels good in your hands then don't worry about anything else..
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	It's a funky rule added about 4 years ago.    The linesman cannot call a penalty, but they can advise the referee of certain penalties at the next stoppage of play.    In this case, the stoppage of play happened because of a goal.    At that time, the linesman can inform the referee of the penalty, and the penalty gets enforced, and the goal gets taken away.    Chicago was the benificiary of this rule 2 weeks ago against the Rangers when Wade Redden high-sticked Patrick Sharp, play went on for two minutes after that before that penalty was called.    There has been a lot of consternation around the league about the time issue too - but I don't see it being solved soon.    So, the short explanation - linesmen can't call penalties, but they can tell the referee about a penalty he missed at the next stoppage in play.  The penalty overrules the goal.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Rule 78.5 Disallowed Goals    viii)  When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed    Cheechoo was high sticked and it drew blood.  It was reported to the referee by one of the linesmen in the next stoppage, so the goal was disallowed and the penalty was assessed.|`|U8HSSSswaa	Yes since the linesman cannot call the penalty and the official (the guy with the orange band on his arm) may not have seen it and there was no other stoppage of play, so the linesman doesn't have the opportunity to inform the official of the infraction until that stoppage. And they really can't add time to the clock, because they can't really be sure of when the play would have stopped.|`|AA12089021	LITY has the correct answer already but I think this is something the NHL needs to address.  USA Hockey and the NCAA address the issue of clock time in situations like this.  If the same thing happens in either, the clock is reset to the time the infraction happened.      I have no problem with the referees assessing the penalty after the fact since the linesmen cannot stop the play, but if they are going to take away a goal, they need to put the time back on the clock.

fLpnC8qtaa	Keep them. They are integral to some teams financially. Gate takings alone can be a huge asset and they play the matches like they are the be all and end all, with commitment and passion as we have seen many times. Bigger teams should not treat the competition with disrespect even though it can get mighty congested fixture wise.|`|ymdelC6Yaa	The small teams (Havant and Waterlooville for example) love them and they can keep them in business for a long time.  The big teams can do without them.  We have enough games to get through already when you take into account the number of games in the Champions League on top of league commitments.    I would say keep them.

dBMWPDRxaa	I don't think he is over hyped. Sven called him up to play against Sweden because there wasn't any good forwards playing in Mexico right now. Yeah he missed a clear opportunity to score, I got pissed, but then again, he really did get pressured by the fans of Monterrey. Maybe that is why he missed. I still think he is going to play good with Chivas, but if he keeps missing and keeps on not scoring goals he will eventually get benched and get sold. Vamos C.

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.

cR7Sf4cjaa	Ever since the 'Saturday Night Special' gun ban in the early 1970's nearly every gun made and sold in the US is a high quality firearm.  Glocks didn't show up until the 1980's    Right now allot of folks are starting to learn reloading - rather than spend $40 for two quality reloading manuals they are pulling bad info off the internet and blowing their pistols up.    Pistol owners love to slam and talk trash about other gun manufacturer's - especially in front of some newbie who is willing to eat it up.     1.  Have the guy test fire the Glock and bring an empty back.  If the empty will insert in another pistol of the same caliber - send him home.  If it does not insert - it doesn't mean there is a problem - but check for ballooning.  This is caused by a bad chamber.  It will be both visible and obvious.  If the guy is still worried - send it to the nearest factory authorized repair facility........ and if he is going to do this, then look up what the repair facility offers in after market modifications.  If he's gonna go to the trouble of sending it off - might as well get a trigger job, maybe better sights, or a match barrel?  That way he gets some bang for the buck.    2.  Laws of physics.  The energy of the bullet is equal to the free recoil of the pistol.  For pistol A to have 10x less recoil than pistol B, Pistol A must weight 10x more.  Springs, recoil arresters etc only spread the recoil out over time.  Rather than 400 pounds of recoil per 4 milliseconds of time a spring arrester system will spread that 400 pounds out over 6 to 10 milliseconds making it feel about 2x to 3x lighter recoil.  But it will never be 10X.    3.  Slam fires usually never happen with pistols because pistols have a spring that retains the firing pin in a safe positon during the chambering process.  Slam fires are common in semi-auto rifles - they do not have a spring to retain the firing pin - and almost always happen when somone removes the magazine, inserts a single round, and then sends the bolt home.  Bang!  This happens because the resistance of the bolt traveling over the magazine is taken into consideration when designing the recoil spring.  With no magazine the bolt locks too fast and too hard, the firing pin jumps forward with enough kenetic energy to dimple the primer - sometime it will go off, sometime not.  Uusually when it does go off the bolt is not completely locked into the receiver and it damages the rifle.    Hope this helps!  Kevin|`|WBGnXsr7aa	As for  1 he was probably been shooting HOT reloads. Check for barrel bulge.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I'll answer number 3.  A slamfire occurs when the gun is improperly assembled, rarely.  Basically the firing pin does not rebound, thus it is stuck out of the bolt face.  As the bolt picks up the next shell and closes, it automatically fires, and the whole process repeats.  What happens is ususally, you pull the trigger once, and it empties an entire magazine.  It is very dangerous, and likely to end you up in jail.  I heard of one guy that was arrested at a gun range because his gun slamfired.  He had just assembled it improperly after cleaning.  For question 1, any gun will explode if it is subjected to too much pressure, either from using the wrong shells, or using bad ammunition, usually reloads.  Glock has a heck of a reputation.  It will not explode, ever, if you use high quality factory ammo.  EVER.  If you want to start feeding it the reloads the kid down the street gave you, well, you're on your own.  For question number 2, yes plus p loads have more recoil than standard loads, if that's what you're asking.

UFEF3LzCaa	this is a hard question to answer... it depends on how much you are swimming and how hard you train.  I am 16 and my 50 free is 23.15, 100 is 50.08, and 200 is 1:45.69.  You are a pretty good sprinter for a 17 year old, but you should work on trying harder longer throughout practice so that you can get your longer events like the 200 down.  And don't save anything up in practice... what is the point of practicing if you aren't trying ur hardest?|`|hDUVkbJ4aa	go to usaswimming.org  they have standards for everyones age group  essentially it will tell you where you stand in percentile (top 90%,50%, etc.|`|Qhfw5fGpaa	Wow, your fast.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Those times are really really good.

Swim that stroke on a super fast, nearly impossible interval. Do this 10 times.

Well since they play basketball his right knee is vital to make all of the necessary jumps and runs and stuff, so I say to get it back to how it should be and to go through all of the necessary physical therapy possibly it should take a while to heal. Last season he injured his knee and was out for forty six games last season starting from the Memphis game. i'd say he has something wrong with his knees, he shouldn't get injured this much, or he hates basketball so much he faked an injury last year to get out of 46 games and faked a new injury now to get out of more games. Doesn't that sound like fun? I mean seriously think ppl, who would do that. who would throw away their bball career on a knee injury on purpose. Is there any reason other than the hate of basketball to fake an injury. i don't think so. for your question, I'd say a lot less than last time because its a sprain and depending on how eager he is to get back in the game, so he'd miss around 5 games so I guess less than a month like two or three weeks possibly?  would be accurate. but who trusts me cuz I'm a girl! haha. so peace.love..happiness... hope I helped    |`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	If its not to serious maybe a month .....bynum was really stepping his gm up on both sides of the floor I just hope he can come back strong.......|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Yo man, just ignore it.

ScbEzhKiaa	Why is it Super? It's the last two teams out of 32 playing each other for the Lombardi Trophy. It was named after the coach( Vince Lombardi) of the first team to ever win the Super Bowl-the Green Bay Packers. These players in the National Football League are some of the best athletes in the world. You have specialists that kick the ball-punters, place kickers; Players who run and receive the ball-who have world-class speed and endure punishing blows from defensive players trying to stop them, and you have the quaterback who is the focal point of the teams-he gets the ball to the offensive players to score. This is a 43 year old game and the history of the NFL goes well beyond that. It's difficult to explain the entire history. Basically, the Super Bowl is the best of the best from each conference (AFC vs. NFC) vying for the championship of both conferences. Hence the name Super-Supreme. This year the Arizona Cardinals(who've never been to it before) vs. The Pittsbugh Steelers (who've won 5).|`|7qfny0zZaa	Football is a waste its all about basketball.

xWApXu8Aaa	You'll have a very tough road ahead of you to get a shooting team for your high school.      I tried doing the same thing back when I was in high school and the big road block I ran into was the school districts insurance carrier that killed the idea and threatened to cancel the policy if the school allowed a group of students to use firearms in a school sanctioned event.    They said a shooting accident could easily cost the district several million dollars in a lawsuit and wouldn't allow it.    Many if not most colleges carry their own insurance so are not hampered in that reguard.  The students in college are also older and considered more mature.    Good luck -|`|6pUzzsuhaa	check out your local 4H- there should be a shooting team thru that. 4H has a S.A.F.E shooting program where we can compete with bows, bb guns, shotguns and 22 rifles.      i really suggest checking with the 4H because that's how i got involved in modified trap shooting.. 4H sponsors it and there are coaches and high school and 8th and 7th graders can shoot (junior and senior 4Hers)   i live in georgia, and we begin practice around middle Feb and regional comp. is around April 22 and state comp. is every Mother's Day weekend- leave on a Friday and come home a Sunday (we go up to the 4H camp- Rock Eagle for us)|`|AA11694178	Your first step is to find out how many people in your school are actually interested in trap shooting.  Then go to your local trap range and talk to them about forming a trap team.  They will be very helpful in getting the team formed and may help you with your discussions with school officials.  Once you have your team organized, go to your Principal and ask him/her about the possibility of getting support from your school.  By doing this, you will have everything in place and all the school has to do is to make it official and appoint someone from the school as a Sponsor.  I must warn you, though, to be prepared for disappointment.  You may have to continue your trap shooting on your own.  School support for any of the shooting sports is rare.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	That is an excellent idea.  I suppose you will have to approach the school board to get permission.  You may need to find a volunteer teacher to oversee the whole team.  That shouldn't be too hard to find.  You may also need to find an appropriate range to use.  I'd imagine that all of this could be done fairly easily.  I know if I had a range, I'd let the high school team use it.  If I was a teacher, I'd volunteer my time to help.  Just start asking.|`|btVNM1Djaa	talk to your principal and ask him what you would need to do to get one started. He's the one who would be best able to give you all the answers you need.

With all of the school shootings and gun related violence that has occurred in the past 10-12 years, schools (and school Boards) tend to want nothing to do with guns and the shooting sports! I am a nationally ranked rifleman, and when I tried to get a rifle team at the school, my future employment with the district was put into jeopardy!    If you are in a school that is open-minded, you need to see how much interest exists in the school, and whether you can find a teacher willing to sponsor the team (which would have to start out as a club, first). Even if you do not have a teacher willing to be a sponsor, that is not a problem, since most teacher contracts allow the Board to appoint a teacher to sponsor or chaperone, whether they want to or not (the unstated question is, do you want your job next year?). If you can get over this obstacle, you need to identify what schools you could compete against, and how much it will cost the district!    You may actually find it to be more successful and more productive to contact either the NRA or the ATA (or the 4H or the Boy Scouts) to see if there are any Junior Clubs in the area that you could join ... sometimes it is better to "go with the flow" than re-invent the wheel from scratch!    Good luck and good shooting!
AUjTaLvwaa	this year the afc was 130-125-1 and the nfc was 125-130-1 so by records you can say the afc. but i see the afc as really good defenses like the steelers, ravens, titans, patriots and then the nfc is high-powered offenses like the cardinals, panthers, saints, cowboys, giants. i'll have to go with afc though.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I like KFC myself.

wmhwBhv8aa	The rods for baitcaster are called casting rods, and the other are spinning rods.  That is the way they will be labeled in bass pro and such.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	A baitcasting or spincasting rod is called "casting" rod. A spinning rod is called a "spinning" rod.    Hope i helped ya out.|`|TE4W3k8Xaa	it's called a baitcasting rod used with a baitcasting reel,and a spincasting rod is used with spincasting reel and a spinning rod is used with a spinning reel,the difference between these is the thumb grip found on the baitcasting and spincasting versions isn't found on a spinning,which is straight the whole length of the rod.The open bail is a spinning reel,or called an open faced reel,a spincast has a closed face such as a zebco reel,a baitcast reel  is also known as a levelwind reel and most often is used in bass fishing or in heavier models for salt water offshore use on sportfishing boats,some call a boat reel.There isn't a thumbgrip on these heavy salt versions of the baitcasting rods.|`|TeNIStN1aa	"The" rod for baitcasting reel AND spinning reel? There is no such thing.    I am not certain but I think I might know what you are talking about. Are you talking about reels that function similar to a spincasting reel but mount onto the rod differently? If the link provided below showed something similar to what you have in mind, then the reel is called an underspin reel. The rod itself is a spinning reel. Underspin reels were designed to work with spinning rods.    http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0037060120...|`|qXQa06bAaa	The one for use with a bait casting reel = "Baitcaster" or "Trigger-grip" rod  Spincasting reel rod = "Spincasting rod"  See also the tackle manufacturer's websites (in particular the technical blurb accompanying the rods) + big online tackle stores such as "Cabelas" & "Bass Pro".|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	A rod.

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	It is a Federal law that all purchases of firearms made through an FFL dealer must go through a background check.  This is generally done at the state level and most states have a telephone service and a computer service to run the "instant background check" on a potential buyer.    Note.  If the state agency is down for whatever reason (computer issues), you will have to wait until the gunshop is able to run the background check and pick-up the firearm afterward.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	I thought that everybody had in the us had to go through a backround check!|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	If you're buying from a dealer, yes.

TRHcAY2Saa	mechanical disc brakes use cables to pull on a small arm mounted on the caliper that pushes the brake pad on the disc and stops the wheel.    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_h45LtH99JbI/SK...    Hydraulic disc brakes use oil.  when the lever is pulled, it forces oil through the line and into the caliper. this then applies pressure on the brake pad and squeezes the rotor and stops the wheel.     http://www.wiggle.co.uk/images/avid%20ju...    hydraulic disc brakes have more stopping power and are much smoother.  the only downside to hydraulic are they are a bit more expensive. If i had the choice, i would go with hydraulics because of their power and reliability.|`|uXdx9vuBaa	big difference. disc brakes rock! They are faster and so smooth.

Go Knicks!|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Keep this in mind fellow Knicks fans because of the Miami Heat's free falling and slumping as of late and based on the very fact that our Knicks completely owns Miami we can move up all the way to 6th in the East playoff picture. We have won the last 10 consecutive meetings against Miami and have won the season series for the past 5 years, including their championship year. Not to mention in the playoffs were we tore that franchise a new a$$hole on countless of occasions. Lunatic the Knicks have one of the greatest reasons to win it is the largest most marketable franchise in the entire NBA and we have not had a winning record since 2001, not won a series since 2000, and not even made the playoffs since 2004. I would say that's plenty of motivation.    Go! Knicks!|`|13XU8cCKaa	Knicks are playing now like they did before the trades.  It took a while but they finaly got it.

fLpnC8qtaa	As a United fan Ive wondered that myself. I think a lot, not all but a lot of players go through periods of selfishness. Carlos doesn't seem to want to pass to anyone right now. He has been playing much better but I even noticed V Everton that he kept trying to go through 2 and 3 defenders in and around the box (who were a good foot taller btw) rather than pass to anyone in a better position which makes all the good surging runs forward worth nowt in the end. Ronaldo was like that with Rooney at times last year. It's because the competition for positions is so tight.|`|HEEXkiihaa	its possible they hate each other...its a shame the way tevez is treated as compared with ronaldo...for god sake's he's an argentinian striker (a good one too) and he's considered a sub...whereas ronaldo is treated by alex as if he could do no wrong...sad|`|DmF0TerTaa	Looking at previous game. Tevez rather to shot on the goal rather than pass it to Ronaldo|`|Lr75hENEaa	no, i don't think they hate each other|`|5YKMYcxWaa	Im sure they get on fine.  but i was curious about that yesterday too, i remember several times in the everton match where ronaldo was in great position, and tevez went on and took a sh*t shot on goal.|`|NC8Vb36Daa	Yeah I think they do. The real question is Rafa cracking up? answer - Yes, already has! But yeah they are mates I've seen them have a joke at training.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	are you kidding me??    with the way things are going for them they're probably giving each other     BJ's before the game, half time, and after the game    edit: yea u right    but still they gotta enjoy it ; )
6e9wMh6yaa	1) They have the ultimate clutch man in Texeira. They have a dominating 1-2-3 if and only if Wang is healthy.  2) A-rod is the ultimate choker come playoff time. And also Sabathia tends to surrender many runs in big-time games.  3) The core which includes Jeter, Posada, and Rivera are all 34 or older. And Jeter has been declining steadily since 06-07.|`|ak5A435maa	1. wont. you cant buy a championship    2. yes. i think they'll go out in the ALDS.    3. they probably will, but wont win the WS|`|3sxK2xQKaa	1) The whole AL had no major signings except for the Yankees  2) If A-Rod or Texiera are sidelined for the playoffs  3) If all the players di in a plane crash|`|AA11805785	The Yankees will win the WS this year because they really need to prove something this year.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	1) they overspend and steal all the best free agents.  2) A-Fraud chokes like he did since day one.  3) the Red Sox and Rays are too good for them.|`|36zm5zK8aa	1. Because they've been able to hit most of the time, and Teixeira will add hugely to that, plus a healthy Matsui and Posada is key, along with a rebound from Cano.  And Melky will hit .312.  And their rotation is incredible on paper, plus they've got some nice depth in AAA with Hughes, Kennedy, Aceves, etc.  2. Well, I think they will win the World Series, but if they don't its probably because a starter can't handle the pressure or they just aren't hot at the right time.  3. Injuries.|`|RW7qVMk5aa	1. Alex Rodriguez and Mark texiera(a rod isnt alone)  2. Yankee's ride arm of sabathia(similar to the brewers) and it falls off in the playoffs, Burnett reverts back to mediocrety and Jeter's age catches up to him.  3. I dont see any reason they wont unless theyr hit with a huge injury(last year wasn't bad just overblown), im talking like a rod being out 3 months~ and teixera also out a month coinciding at the time of a rod missing. The rays way overachieved last year and won't be anywhere near that this year.      Who are you saying that wasnt leaving him alone? Jeter? the ultimate overrated defensive player and offensive player?? GIambi?? ok maybe giambi, but thats more like A-Rod and a pack of steroids|`|XxG9SqYoaa	1) The Yankees wil win the world series because they have added (IMO) good players and I think they will be more focused this year.    2) Well, I think they will make the series but if they don't it will be because of bad post season pitching.    3) Again, they will. But if they don't it will be because of a rapid downward spiral towards the end of the season due to injury's.|`|W7BZcdynaa	1) too much talent   2) No proven post season pitchers. Pettite is old. Wang and Sabathia have terrible post season resumes. Burnett is the only guy that's proven he can pitch in the playoffs.   3) Boston and Tampa Beat them out.    2) is the most likely scenario. The Yankees have a lot of question marks    Jeter, Damon, Matsui are all 35 and older. Will they hold up?  How will Burnett and Sabathia pitch in New York?  Will Cano and Posada rebound after terrible seasons?  Who is going to Bridge the gap from the starters to Mo?    Way too many question marks fro the Yankees to be a sure thing.|`|3QELIOU7aa	They are going down.

cOPCNP7Laa	It felt bad but tbh we didn't deserve fourth place and when you're a fan you learn to accept a bad season or two in the middle of years of success.    Despite being in UEFA Cup and this being rubbed in my nose over and over all season we still signed good players who wanted to come to Milan, we kept good players who might have left and San Siro has near 50,000 season ticket holders, nvm the others who pay and watch every week.    I even joined a group called "Better a year in UEFA than 100 years as an Inter fan". To me this means I am proud of being a Milan fan even if it means a year in UEFA:    Btw, we were in UEFA in 2002 and in 2003 we won the CL. In 2004 the Serie A and Coppa Italia and went on to be in another 2 CL finals one of which we one. So one year of 5th placed and UEFA is not the end of the world.    It happened to ManU, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Liverpool, Inter Milan, AC Milan, etc. Just bc it's happening now to Arsenal (maybe) doesn't mean anything, it just happens and you move on.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	Marco is right on, on this.  Milan didn't deserve it, so there was no use in making excuses, even big teams have to earn their place.  It's easy to be a loyal fan when your team is doing great but the real test comes in times like these and you just have to support them no matter what.  Don't get yourself worked up about this, it's not the end of the world.|`|p1kmZziVaa	Well, I'm not an Arsenal fan but I def. think that if you guys spent some money on a new player then it would be better. You need more.. how do I say this..creativity, possibly Arshavin is the one to help you there. Also, your team isnt much a team right now. Contract extenions are being put off, Gallas is a baby 50% of the time and possibly more people leaving? Adebayor isn't really looking like hes worth what they're paying him right now. And maybe putting Fabianski (is that his name?) instead of Alumina can be better. But then again, I don't really watch arsenal much so just general ideas from what I can point out already.|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Man it felt freaking great, I laughed and laughed!    Oh you said AC Milan fans....|`|7VwcvLTxaa	LOL @ Freshy!|`|7Xridrxaaa	wtf marky no offense your crying like a lil girl right now. Nobody gives a damn.

N0kAvAbTaa	Not sure about their rationale (anyone want to ask Bettman?  ;-), but the list of past goalie captains is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:NH...|`|YBpjA72faa	A goalie wore the C in the past. It didn't work out too well, because the goalie had to leave his crease every time he wanted to talk with the ref. Since the goalie had to go so far, as opposed to being right in the middle of the action, the games were taking a longer time. So, the NHL said that goalies can't be the captains.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	It has to do with the last (and as far as I know,  only other) goalie captain,   Montreals George Hainsworth.    He would (allegedly)  constantly leave his crease to argue calls and situations with referees at strategic moments,   and take his time returning to the crease,   giving his team extra time outs.    This led to the rule that the goalie could not wear the C.|`|U8HSSSswaa	In USA hockey, goalies may wear the "C" on their jerseys, but cannot have captain privileges, which are speaking to the ref to clarify a call, because he would have to leave his crease. So my thought is that in the NHL, they just don't want the goalies to be captains at all, and the rule must state the cannot have a "C" on their jerseys, so their loophole is to put it on his helmet.

His strengths are his explosive-ness as a tackler- he flys around and can make very good tackles. He is also very agile and smart. However he is inconsistent as he can make a huge tackle or sack, then miss a tackle or an assignment the next play. And his coverage skills are somewhat over-rated. Many of his INTs are deflected to him or thrown right at him. I rarely see him make a great move on a ball.    If i compare him to my benchmark for safeties- Sean Taylor- he is not an elite safety. In another defense he would struggle.|`|TS55G97faa	Yes he is a good player  Yes he would most likely do good tomorrow.|`|dc982f1f53c6c1010565c80bc2871bb9aa	Yes i think he is a excellent safety...

xhPKkkELaa	Bob,     Read some of the resolved questions, you'll see that this is pretty commonly asked by new surfers.Surfing is a sport that should only be practiced by persons who are already confident and competent ocean swimmers. There are way too many dangerous people in the water today, who THINK they can surf.     Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends.    Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult.    Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners should even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.    Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size (wieght is very important, but how tall you are is virtually irrelevnat) and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. You should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.    And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment.    Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.    http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:  http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...  http://360guide.info/surfing/surfboard-t...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...|`|Op1WIwyPaa	Longboards are better for learning. You will want to take some lessons to get started. If you are riding small waves then get a longboard. I would not buy a surface shortboard. If anything buy a surface longboard if you are set on buying a softtop.    The Surfboard Man  http://www.thesurfboardman.com/|`|F6tMSEyGaa	hey bob i depends if you are young, agile and muscular and athletic, if you are than the short board is fou you if you just want to ride and do less tricks use the long board, in hawaii we call long board, the tanker and the short board the gun    -----Aloha|`|eFYaJN57aa	long board|`|tmduRTpBaa	i have been surfing for almost 4 years. if ur just beginning i recommend a long board. when u ride a short board u have to b able to rip. but on a long board u just cruise and learn how the wave works. so after a while on a long board, go ahead and try a short board. i think a long board to start off with.|`|3mMg3ETCaa	i have been surfing for seven years. i have a short board of course because i surf big waves. 5 to 12 feet. i surf in costa rica and Peru.     long boards are for beginners or small waves my board is 5' 4" because i am small i am 5' and i am 13 years old. but i would start u off with a long board for now. HAHA hope this helps. board are usually in the $350 to $1,500 price range.|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZItov1B...|`|VM3iCO1uaa	long board probably|`|cwZ6CJ5Jaa	Mate just start on soft top mini-mal but make sure you understand how the tides,rips and currents work before you throw yourself out there. Surf schools can help but you need to observe things at the beaches where you intend to surf and try not to get out of your comfort zone. It takes time but you  will know when you need a shorter thinner board because the board you are riding will feel too big and clunky.
AA12251404	Gaining hand and wrist strength is the best way to gain bat speed.  It is your hands/wrists that bring the bat through the hitting zone.  You do not need to bulk up with huge biceps.    Get a rubber ball about the size of a tennis ball.  Squeeze that ball HUNDREDS of times each day.  Squeeze it with your fingers against the heel of your hand.  If you do not make a big scene about this, you should be able to do this in class as well---it is a quiet task.    Do this exercise with each hand and it will increase your bat speed and your throwing ability with a better "snap" on the release.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Swing faster.|`|RW7qVMk5aa	http://www.baseballrox.com/training/trai...|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT|`|CKP98samaa	Build muscle in your forearms and wrists.  Most of your power and bat speed should come from your hands coming through the zone.  If you look at the big hitters in the major league level, you can see how huge their forearms are.      Do wrist curls every other day to build muscles in your forearms.    Also, try swinging a bat underwater.  I would recommend using a crappy bat that you won't be using often.  Even a tough, plastic bat would do.      Take thick plastic and create what looks like an arrow on your bat.  What I mean is, take 4 slabs of about 1 in thick plastic and stick it on 4 sides of the barrel of the bat.  Have them sticking out about 6-8 inches.  When you swing the bat, you'll feel a lot of resistance due to the plastic slabs catching all the air.      If that doesn't make much sense...just use weighted donuts and take quite a bit of swings a day for practice.  Make sure to use your forearms to get your hands through the zone first.|`|NsYIUu3caa	watch the videos Alex suggested on that link    also, Butterlover has good offseason advice about building forearms, but he forgot about core development. you'll get as much bat speed from a fast hip rotation as you will strong arms.|`|ak5A435maa	put a sign on your bat that says "100mph" so then your bat is faster    hope i helped|`|tvy8qFKCaa	Hold the bat like this, then do this.

gAKUFk1Qaa	nah u can get a pretty decent gun for under 200 sure as the smart parts ion, tippmann A5, or Smart parts Vibe those are pretty decent cheap guns...  and the thing about a hopper is that you can only shoot as fast as its being fed u cant shoot 15 balls per sec on a hopper feeding 8 balls per sec. (that's roughly a standard hopper) and a hooper that feeds 15 Balls per sec. is roughly $50-$60 and about $30-$40 for 10 balls per sec...    Vibe roughly $140 11 balls per sec. (so ud need a better hopper to shoot that many) can run on CO2 or air & has 3 rates of fire full auto, 3 shot burst, and semi    Ion roughly $165 17 balls per sec. (same here ud need an even batter hopper than the vibe) double trigger... it cannot run on CO2!! it needs HPA/ Compressed air/Nitrous(don't matter all same stuff and they're about $50-$200) because CO2 temperature is hard on the internal components and will negatively affect your gun... lol it also has 3 firing modes semi, full auto, burst, and rebounding fire mode (idk what it is)    A5 about $150-$200 comes with a special hopper that feeds 15 balls per sec. standard can run on CO2 made by tippmann (so reliable) but since it ain't got no special trigger your stuck shooting as fast as ur 1 little trigger finger can shoot...    lol sorry is so long dude hope it helped|`|RX5t6x6Haa	the best gun that you can gun under 200 is probably the spyder VS2 or the VS3, as far as the ROF goes, it doesnt really matter most fields cap the paint to around 15BPS, gun has nothing to do with how good you are, if your good the more experienced players wont say much about your gun, but if you suck they will usally bust your as* about your gun... as for hopper type, its mostly just preference
1li4vbVoaa	Yes, i think that was his best gimmick he had in WCW.    I miss the good old days of wrestling. Sting not talking and repelling from the rafters with his bat, theme music etc was just amazing battling the nWo.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	do you mean just hanging around the rafters and coming down on some kind of zip line? Not really. But i think it would be cool to seem him the way he used to be, different face paints and gear on. Not just the black and white like now|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I liked the way he looke in MidSouth Wrestling, the Universal Wrestling Federation, the National Wrestling Alliance and world Championship Wrestling prior to 1994. But I read an interview with him several years ago where he said he got tired of dying his hair blond and kepping it cut like that all the time|`|FJO5wqsvaa	i agree with jessica, and no one wants an owen hart incident|`|rRIYB9WNaa	It was pretty cool.  But him coming from the ceiling was pretty old =\  And the zip line stunts were pretty cool too.|`|Uh06bF1daa	yeah but no more zip lines, weve got suicide doing that for us already|`|cE8SQUEbaa	not anymore... he's getting older and he should only stick on being "present-him"...|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Yes, except the dropping from the ceiling. To be honest that got a little bit old.|`|IlIyXgptaa	i hate sting|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	No.    I thought this was the dumbest gimmick ever. Seriously, The Crow was a second rate movie and yet WCW jumped all over it and gave it to their best performer. They even referred to him as "The Crow Sting." If he had done this at any other time in his career, he would have been laughed at, but because it was associated with the NWO, it went over like crazy. Sting needs to have his current gimmick updated. He can't run around with blond hair and neon pants, but watching him walk around in black and white all of the time is boring. I would actually like to see him get rid of the paint  current ring gear. He should keep his trench coat, minus the ridiculous scorpion on the back, and wear some kind of wrestling pants with matching boots.

v0MlomPoaa	I haven't been to as many of the parks in Arizona as I have in Florida, but I've been to a couple.  The facility in Suprise is fantastic, and the practice areas are fairly open to the viewing public.  I've also hear that HoHoKam is a great place.  Scottsdale is supposed to ge great too, in the best part of town.  If you prefer the old school feel of spring training without the big fancy parks most play in now, then Phoenix Muni or Maryvale is the place.  There are two brand new parks beginning this spring, so there's a lot of great choices.    Tickets are usualy fairly easy to get, escpecially if you buy early, and for weekday games.  It also depends on the site.  games do sell out in HoHoKam quite frequently, where as tickets are pretty easy to come by in Surprise.    I recommend you plan you trip well ahead of time and buy your tickets.  Go early.  Hang out and watch batting practice or walk the facility where you can. Have fun!!

jKOB7n35aa	I'm having the same dilemma. The only reason I can think of getting it would be because I miss baseball and can't wait for The Show to come out in March. If it were cheaper I'd get it now, but I don't think it's worth it since The Show's Franchise Mode is going to be very similar, and you can play it. If you have a 360 you might want to consider it though since 2k9 isn't much better.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Wait until 2k9. That's coming out next month, but I bet it'll be worth it!|`|dcgDJgU2aa	I bought it today. It's OK. I will have to play it more to really get to know it.

If it is, then be more picky|`|2c6e6cd9b5b5a01b8b5dce3b7354987aaa	I don't have it because I don't have a 360 or PS3, and don't play PC games. I would wait for either MLB 09: The Show (the game which I prefer) if you have a Sony Platform or get MLB 2K9 with Tim Lincecum. The game from sound is probably like NFL Head Coach. Probably just tedious and time consuming.
EtWIJrR2aa	yup bikinis are owk, but you wont want to wear one because if you go to a gym pool ur there to train    pool cap is also optional but helps soooo much    and waist length hair is not owk at a pool unless in a cap|`|NCSKeRXTaa	if you are swimming laps it is not good because if you dive in your pants will fall off|`|HTZMJOSXaa	A 2 piece swim suit can be OK for swimming, although 1piece suits may be easier.  If you don't have a 1 piece or choose to go with a 2 piece, make sure it is a sporty style, and does not have parts that tie up.  There are 2 piece styles that will still support you while swimming and you won't have to worry about anything falling out.  And with bottoms that fit right, you shouldn't even have to worry about jumping or diving in.    Advice for your hair:  I used to have really long hair and my hair is also thick, but I was still able to get it into a swim cap.  Braiding your hair or twisting it into a bun will help.  If you cannot stretch a latex cap over your hair, try a silicone one or a cloth one.  They are more expensive, but stretchier and last longer.  You should also get some shampoo designed to get the chlorine out of your hair, because it chlorine can make long hair pretty unmanageable.  Another thing that helps keep chlorine out of your hair is to wet it before hand or even put some leave in conditioner in, though this will make it harder to get a swim cap on, it will saturate your hair so chlorine can't be absorbed as easily.
im8xN545aa	1) Make sure they have a proper fitness and dietary regime to keep them fit and healthy and free from injury.    2) Lots of fielding and batting practice to make sure their skills remained at the top level.    3) Lots of match practice. I would make sure that the team utilized their skills in proper match settings (either in regulation games, warm ups or in practice matches etc) to keep their performance levels up and to keep the team competitive.    4) Bring in the best coaches and backroom staff to prepare the team properly. But I would keep the support staff to a minimum, having loads of people hanging round the team isn't good (just look at the amount of people the England team has).    5) Ensure team unity to make sure everyone was getting along as unity allows for better performances (both indevidually and as a whole team). I suppose you could bring in a sports psychologist or something to work with the players here.    I'm sure there are more things but those things would probably help my team get their hands on that trophy!|`|e4roTumKaa	OUT. Hauritz,Warner,Haddin.

SA apparently had contracts signed with their top 6 batters agreeing to score at least 300 (I think )runs between them. And their bowlers signed a similar one to get 20 wickets. Simple thinking but it look how well SA did last year.    2. Tone the fielding skills. Ensure everyone on the team can catch and knows how to throw the stumps down.    3. Make sure your tail enders know how to bat well enough to guide the team home if needed to. In the current game it''s essential for everyone to bat right down to number 11.    4.As captain I would make sure to be positive in the field and set the example for the others on the team.
f9hiPMDxaa	I don't know if it was unpopular with the team but it was certainly unpopular with the fans when Bill Lawry declared leaving Rod Marsh on 96 not out. The fans really got stuck into Lawry over that. That was the 1970/71 Ashes tour to Australia.    Jardine was unpopular with a number of his team mates. Pataudi, even after scoring a hundres was dropped because he was anti bodyline. Gubby Allen was another who was anti bodyline but because of his upper class upbringing, could not be dropped. The professional batsmen in the team were not in favour of it in case it was reciprocated and they were injured.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Dravid's declaration when Sachin was on 194 in a test against Pakistan (2004?).At least a few players may have resented.But quite a few fans were upset.|`|nwZD5mzRaa	I'm sure most of the unpopular decisions made by the captain may have gone unnoticed coz the players would be wary of openly criticising or going against their captain. The team selection(which involves the captain) and dressing room tiffs are examples of some of the incidents we'll never know of.    Out of the few incidents that do come out in the open, I remember the one with Rahul Dravid, the stand in captain for Ganguly during an Indo-Pak series, he declared the innings when Sachin was on 194*. Sachin was clearly upset with this decision and had and also mentioned at the press conference that he wasn't expecting this decision.    2) Brett Lee was not being given to bowl for the test match vs India and instead the part timers were being used by Ricky Ponting. This decision did not go down too well with Brett Lee and there was difference of opinion between the two players.|`|378GRzrnaa	nope|`|mkxGX2Rcaa	Harbijane smacking his sissy sister Sree.

tYRIurqsaa	Biggest Surprise, I know you are going to say I'm crazy but I just have a feeling about the surprise of 2009!!    Scott Speed    I predict that Speed will win once and barely miss the chase in 13th place.  In the Chase the biggest surprise will be the 33 of Mears    Childress is on top of their game and this year will be no different, I predict that Mears makes the Chase along with his three teammates.    I oredict that Mears will come just short of the title in 2nd or 3rd place  in the points with 2 wins, showing that the move from Hendrick to Childress was a great decision!    Biggest disappointment-Hendrick Motorsports    18 wins in 2007  7 wins in 2008, this team is on the decline    my prediction is    Jimmie Johnson-2  Jeff Gordon-1  Mark Martin-2  Dale Jr.-0    for a team total of 5 wins the worst season for Hendrick in many years!!    Also despite making the chase with Gordon, Johnson, and Martin all three will fail to finish in the top half.    Gordon-10th, Johnson-9th, Martin-7th|`|xOfBiolZaa	I'm expecting Juan Pablo Montoya to put on a display of force for the 2009 season. I know he has a clean conscience and new found respect from the 2008 season. There's no stopping him now.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	You know what people said the same thing in 2007. Just because Gordon had finished 2nd in the standings with 6 wins, they thought he'd be amazing last year. It's the same with Carl and Kyle. HOW DO WE KNOW THEY WILL DOMINATE? HMMM?|`|S2y701wEaa	Robby Gordon  And dont laugh... but i think that joe nemechek could make some noise at daytona driving for his own team.|`|7B3TwoaSaa	Good to see every one again. Hope you all enjoyed the break.    I don't think Joey will do very well in Cup, I personally think he should have stayed in NNS for another yr or two.   But then again, I am not Coach Gibbs.   Dale Jr's only win was handed to him by NASCAR. You can fight it all you want, but if that was any other driver, they would have been penalized. He is not that good of a driver.  I also see Kasey Kaine stumbling again.    As for the season's Cinderella story... I would go with David Regain. He did very well on the super Speed ways, R-F-R did an excellent job on the intermediate track.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Scott Speed, not Joey Logano, will be ROTY. Ragan will make the Chase, Stewart will not. Mark Martin will win the Championship, Johnson finished 4th. As for the Daytona 500, it would be nice to see James Hylton make the race; he almost did a few years ago before his clutch problems.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Hopefully Elliott Sadler will shock the world and I think Mark Martin and Tony Stewart will disappoint.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	Methinks that Stewart-Haas Racing is going to surprise everyone.  Carl and Jimmie will probably do very well, but I don't know about Kyle Petty.  Does he even have a ride this season?  : P  Welcome back, Rowdy's  1 Fan.  Missed ya - mean it.  :  )    EDIT:  Most disappointing?  JGR.  Not disappointing for me, but for you.  lol|`|c3tADklmaa	Casey Mears, watch him.|`|iT8CNh6paa	david ragan and scott speed|`|88uIjItaaa	Paul Menard|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Ragan and Montoya.     Good to have ya back..|`|eTaK695Faa	I think the big news is going to be the champion. It's gonna be a first time champ, that most though he would get one, and a lot of people were hoping he would not get.  what team is going to catch people off guard, HOF  96 Bobby Labonte  what team will have the most disappointing year...I say EGR will have a bad year, but expectations aren't that high to begin with. Saying that I think Roush will be the one most disappointed. He is expecting all his cars to make the Chase, but I feel only two will. Add to that he has to get rid of one team at the end of the year.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Most disappointing driver: Joey Logano (he's gonna be stale bread)  Biggest Surprise.  David Ragan will win a race or two and makes the chase.  Most disapointing team:  RCR will struggle but Burton will still make the chase.  and I'm sure Jeff Gordon will win a race, or my best friend who is a die hard fan, is gonna need more than prozac to survive.  and yes I also think the Blue Deuce  2 will have a pretty good yr and make the chase. But Kyle will still out shine his older brother.  Welcome back Rowdys  1 fan..    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Tony Stewart will be a surprise to some because having the new team and all.  I think he will maybe struggle a bit at first but I do think he will make the chase.   Joey logano will also do very well but maybe not make the chase.   Though I hope he does very very well and make the chase I fear that MArtin Truex Jr. will struggle.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	My goodness how winter can change things..  Montoya will surprise,and may even fight his way into The Chase..  Allmendinger won't make the Chase but will set tongues wagging, with top tens, and even a top five or two...  And Mark Martin will finish second in points... Again.. Not a disappointment.. After all, how can you be disappointed when you beat 41 other guys?? Unless you're Mark, and your time in the sport is growing short, and you were hoping to beat 42 other guys....   The Gibbs organization will not be the same at all (others catch up),  and Joey Lagano won't even be worth watching... Where's the beef??  Gibbs may even have sponsor problems with Home Depot, and if Tony wins with his new team, we may see some back stabbing, if contracts permit.. Home Depot is having a hard enough time sponsoring a Toyota.. A losing Toyota with a rookie driver that crashes will not keep them handing out checks for 16 mil..  Kyle Busch will make The Chase, but it will be a letdown from 08..  Kurt Busch will remain in purgatory, working for the greatest racer in  the last half century, but without the kind of factory backing needed  to avoid being an also ran..|`|Qz80EA45aa	I think that the driver that might turn heads will be Juan Pablo Montoya. Now that he has a decent car with Chevy power, he might make a run at being consistent. I know that sounds a little off, but, how can anyone expect a driver to shine when they start the year in a brand that is already behind the 8-ball?    Hey Rowdyfan, it's good to see you come back around. Nice to see you are still on the green side of the grass.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Welcome back Rowdy! Good to see your avatar on here again.    I am wishing and hoping that Reed Sorenson and ALL of the RPM gang will the surprise of 2009....with some or all getting into victory lane....and at least one making the chase.    Just an opinion as always.|`|1p1Jj7LDaa	I think the Yates stable will be more solid this year, only if the 28 gets a sponsorship because Kvapil has a bright future.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Mark Martin - most surprising  Joey Logano - most disappointing (I just don't think he's ready)    Oh yea. Ryan Newman will be surprising.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Jimmy Johnson will fall apart and not make the chase.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Casey Mears will be a surprise. I know he had criticism for not being in the chase with Hendrick, but I think he didn't do real good in '08 just because of Alan Gustafson. Chemistry is big in racing. If Hendrick kept him in the  25 in '08, I think he could have made the chase. Childress is a smart owner and I think he will make sure Casey does well. Clint Bowyer might be a surprise, too. The switch to the  33 will be tough, but he has done well the last two years. He could be a factor if he has a fast start.                                                               It seems like almost everyone thinks Carl Edwards will win the championship. I'm not counting on it. You don't always win under high expectations. The Patriots were the favorite to win last year's Super Bowl and go 19-0, but the Giants proved them wrong. The competition will be tough, and I don't think Carl will do as great as everyone thinks he will.|`|uouq4KCvaa	Hey you welcome back! I think Tony Stewart and Ryan will surprise everyone this year!|`|CO2o0YYMaa	I think it will be either Mark Martin or Reed Sorenson. Mark has proven himself in the Cup Series, and Reed is has a bright future, especially now that he is with RPM.|`|i8soZLfRaa	I imported race-for race info comparing Jimmie J. to Mark M.    Race for race (eliminating races MM skipped), MM was only 467 points behind, that's well within the comeback range going into the chase. See this years stats, 'nuf said.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Im sure hoping that Penske & Kurt get better too. As far as catching everyone off guard I really think Petty Motorsports are going to rise up and shine.    I know this will not be popular but neither am I, I think RCR is going to struggle with all the changes in the  07 and  33. I don't think Clint is too happy with being moved around and shuffled around for Casey Mears. That's just my opinion for what its worth.    BTW, Good to see ya!

The usual suspects will have disappointing seasons,  No names need being mentioned.  I'm not falling for all the Martin Hype either. He was never solid at many tracks hence never winning championships.

8bTder08aa	Well, first you have to at least 18 years old.  In order to own a racehorse, you have to be licensed.  To be licensed, in most jurisdictions, you need to be a legal adult:  at least 18 years old.    Then, as others have indicated, you need to have money.  It does take money to own a racehorse and race it, although how much depends on where you want to race it.    At most of the large racetracks like Santa Anita and Churchill Downs, the ones you see on TV, it will cost you on the order of $25,000-50,000/year to keep a horse in training.  That's over and above the cost of the horse, which can run into the millions of dollars, although most racehorses sell for far less than that.    If you wanted to race your horse at smaller racetracks, the costs would be much lower.  There are "mom and pop" operations at a lot of the smaller tracks and on the fair circuit where racing is a family activity, with one family member training the horses, other family members pitching in to do things like groom them, muck out stalls, ride the horse at exercise, and so forth.  These people are usually not doing this to get rich, they are doing it because it's something they enjoy doing.  Done on a small scale like that, racing doesn't have to cost much more than showing a horse does.  The horses that race at these tracks are usually in the $1000-5000 range.  Anyone who can afford a show horse could afford a racehorse at this level.    As for having your own racetrack-- well, unless you've a trust fund with a few million dollars in it, that isn't a likely propsect, although if you seriously wanted to become part-owner of a racetrack, many of the corporations that own racetracks are traded on the stock market, and you can buy shares.  Magna Entertainment Corporation, for example, owns a number of racetracks and shares in Magna are currently trading on the NASDAQ for 74 cents per share.  Not a good investment, but the stock certificate is pretty. ;-))|`|8lsBBK62aa	There's a racetrack for sale in Essex. It's called Great Leighs. You could pop along there, put in a bid and take it over.|`|zywy6vOGaa	Lots and lots and lots of money!!!    How about looking for a job within the industry, such as a manager of some sort, or a trainer. A race horse owner isn't really a job. But a Racehorse manager, bloodstock agent something like that is similar.|`|WWpIS28oaa	In general, you need LOTS AND LOTS of money. So I suggest getting some. Then, maybe even move to a better area for racehorses. Where they would be more popular and perhaps better enviornment. Like for example, Kentucky would be an awesome place to start out. Or somewhere where horses are somewhat to super popular. Also, I would find a horse breeder and not a wild horse. For starters of course. If you have any other questions.

NsYIUu3caa	it's leverage based mostly. if you get a good push off and time  your release you'll factor your forward momentum with that of your arm speed.  that's why someone like Barry Zito can throw in the 90's one year and mid/low 80's last year. it's his timing combined w/ a mechanical malfunction.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Well, it gives you more power.  If you don't get good drive off your legs, then your pitch won't have as much velocity.|`|RW7qVMk5aa	it doesnt. everyone uses different strides it is all depended on the velocity you can get on the ball with wrist/grips (the firmer the grip the more control but less velocity you will have)|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	I don't stride with a pitch I do it with my leg.     But anyways, your push-off shows how far off you can stride. The more legs you use the faster the ball will travel, its not all about the arm and the wrist.|`|s4VzPulYaa	Because you are really launching your body, it's weight, and it's muscle at closer to the batter, so not only do you have a closer distance to the batter, but you got more behind your pitch.

AA10212317	STEELERS, They have had the toughest season!! The Cardinals are good but not THat GOOD!

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.

Don't forget that this is the NFL and not college football....these are professional players that know how to win when they have to.  I am sure everyone remembers last year when the mighty Patriots came into the game undefeated and was supposedly a lock to go all the way....until they hit a GIANT brick wall along the way.  Saying that a team is a lock to win a game takes away the beauty of the contest because then people lose interest in watching if they think it is just one-sided.  I think that Arizona proved over and over again throughout the playoffs that they deserve to be where they are and it will be an excellent contest.  I am not discrediting the Steelers at all because obviously they deserve to be there too.  But to say that they are automatically going to win is unfair to those who are actually rooting for Arizona.  My team just so happens to be the Falcons, whom Arizona beat in the first round of the playoff and they did it because they are a legit team.      I am going to go with Arizona in this game because I think the hype for Pittsburgh will go to the Steelers' heads and they will choke under the pressure.....but it will definitely be a close one!!
y4lCDAZOaa	Yes  Steelers-27  Cardinals-14|`|jLnXuam7aa	no|`|8d03fcb2a7fe3a4e9c78ebd702581c44aa	yes unfortunately they will get their sixth before the niners do|`|utaxvtZZaa	Geez I don't know Scotty. Why don't you check back tomorrow.|`|cXxyRqXvaa	They should, they are a better team (this season), then they will become the most successful franchise in modern history.|`|4fifI4QFaa	Yaaaaaaaaaaaa Steelers     The Steelers are going to win the Superbowl with out a doubt.    We Steeler fans like to call it the Steelerbowl
BbZn25J4aa	the chances are very small and tickets under 1000$ makes it even smaller and i belive the game is sold out but i am not sure        but anyways good luck on getting those tickets|`|12cYuQ5haa	zero. especially for 1000 dollars|`|a6EndAPiaa	Of course the game is sold out!    Since face value of the cheapest ticket is $800 I would say your chances are slim to none.|`|Ga5QdZoXaa	Not Good at all  should have tried earlyer to get them

Taping by a trainer may help you get through a meet with less pain, too.|`|QNqtthJ0aa	steroids|`|aRUc49iFaa	like GV said-RICE  a massage would also help alot
SWkOC7rhaa	I just don't understand Spurs this season. They have a very tough squad and I thought they'd be fighting the big four all season but instead they're fighting to stay out of the relegation spot. I'm sure they'll make it through this year.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	harry can save spurs|`|mK06dus9aa	Harry looked a worried bunny yesterday.

IP8vzLuBaa	It's the size of the school - how many students attend there.  4 A has more students than a 3A school.  Hope that helps.|`|K1xNKSYxaa	The size of the school will determine the number.  5A is the largest, I believe.  My school was a 5A and we had a total student population of 4000 kids.|`|96HaY6l4aa	4A means the school is bigger/has more people than 3A.  It usually means that the school has a better team because they are in a tougher league.|`|erTDzxD8aa	I'm assuming it stands for the division they belong to. They would decide what division you are in by historic success of that program or maybe the school population.|`|CYKAGJMyaa	The lower the division, example Division 1, the bigger the school.  the farther down the ladder you go, the smaller the school. ladder looks kind of like this:    Division   1  1A  1AA  2  2A  2AA  3  3A  3AA  etc, getting increasingly smaller|`|HDIx6rcvaa	each one means that the school has a certain amount of students so if it is bigger it goes in 4A or 5A

DOVbF4Piaa	You have a lot of ideas but I would stay away from a shaft drive, they are not as efficient as a chain drive.  There is no need for a mechanical torque sensor you can control it electronically.  The multi speed hub and mechanical torque set up will just add weight.  I would go with the front motor/generator hub idea, that will be the cleanest and most efficient idea.|`|CttL3LmBaa	You have a lot of engineering going on in your head.      Pursue your idea and make it a reality.  You will probably have a lot of buyers out there.  This could make you rich!    For me, though, it would be a lot of creative weight.  I will go faster and further without the hybrid drive, thank you.
g4Dxlklxaa	I have a G22 in 40, and I actually prefer the recoil on it more than a 9mm. With the 9mm, it can be very snappy... The .40 is more like a strong push... If that makes sense.     Anyhow, the Glock has a relatively low sitting barrel, that's why it feels that way compared to another 40, like a Sig 229.|`|9bUxbTJAaa	the first handgun i ever shot was an xd40 and i though it was not that bad. it still has more then a 9mm, but you should be fine.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	It is not bad on the shooter, but it is real bad on the shootee.|`|dpSr0icwaa	listen to your Dad    stick with a 22LR for now.

2IdpvI2Vaa	We have had 3 Lee Presses for over 15 years and have reloaded, literally, thousands of rounds on each one with no problems at all. So many people always say that Lee is "okay" but you should spend lots of money on a Dillon or whatever. Get the Lee, you won't be sorry and you'll some money too.|`|Q03FuAvQaa	A lee press will do pretty much anything you ever need it to.  They're not super high quality, but for basic reloading they're fine.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Just a quick note.  Most brass for the 7.62 isn't brass, it's actually steel and not reloadable.  Most surplus ammo is berdan primed and non reloadable as well.  There is a lot of good quality brass for the 7.62x39, just make sure you don't try to use the wrong cases.  The lee press will get the job done for a here and there reloader that's just getting started.  There are much better presses on the market, and I really recommend getting good equipment.  No point spending $75 this year on something you will replace next year.  Spend a $200 and it will last a lifetime.  I recommend RCBS reloading equipment.

It comes with an additional slide and is red gas compatible.
RyZHhI6aaa	Go do it.  It's not like it's something illegal.  It's not like you're a recovering alcoholic and you have to stay away from all drinks at all costs.  Betting on the horses is the way that the horse racing fan can support the industry.  If no one placed any bets, then there would be no money in the sport and horse racing would cease to exist.  Go spend the day at the racetrack and place some bets.  It's a lot of fun, the horses are beautiful, and you might even win a few dollars.      I can't tell you why you're torn on betting the horses.  You're probably worried about losing the money, maybe you're one of those people who are concerned that racing may not be in the best interest of the horse, maybe you want to be absolutely sure that a horse is going to win before you bet, etc.  There's many reasons that might make you think twice before you place a bet.  But if you want to and you have the means, don't feel bad.  There's plenty of people who bet on the horses every day.  Good luck.|`|8lsBBK62aa	Go and have a bet, life's too short.|`|b40414584ffd6fcad32915fbaebb4120aa	Go bet and have fun that is what it is about and if you when money great if not aleast you had fun.|`|YdcPTglqaa	My goodness, if you want to, by all means do it (unless you're on welfare, I suppose...). Betting is about enjoying yourself and enjoying the races, and perhaps making a buck or two along the way. You don't need to put in a lot, a toonie I believe is the minimum. Chances are, you won't become addicted.|`|e4roTumKaa	Louis, get stuck in brother, just bet within your means, if you start punting with the rent money then you need to pull the pin , the punt can be a dangerous thing, it will eat you up and spit you out if you let it, punt small is my tip, I used to be a huge, huge punter, I would bet in $1000's every day and had an annual punting turnover in excess of a million dollars, but it all came tumbling down as it always does, but I was lucky I only lost what i had won and could afford to lose, so in effect no damage was done, I still have a bet but these days it is a couple of bucks each way on a roughie,, I still get the same kick when I back a winner, but without the huge pressure of placing $5000 on a horse.good luck|`|B9r7DUpqaa	Bet within your means nothing gets the blood rushing more than seeing the horse you have just backed get up in the last stride and win.It can be a lucrative hobby as long as you don,t get greedy and let it go to your head.
ttbho89Vaa	all four!!! flexibility cuz well its obvious. muscular because you need to be strong to be able to do the jumps and stuff, strength because well you need to be able to do jumps and stuff, cardio cuz your skating and jumping and spinning and it works out ur heart i guess. :]|`|OFQoL7H9aa	ALL OF THEM!! i ice skate and have been for 6 years and i've gotten a 6 pack.. I can do splits. and can lean back and almost touch the floor!!!  And it makes your thighs as hard as rocks!!And for all the jumps and spins you need to use sooooo much muscles..|`|IWvJk4gCaa	Its all really. It's cardio, beacuse you have to push yourself across the ice, much like running. It's flexibiltiy bc of things like spirals and spins. It's muscular strenght beacuse how else are you going to push yourself in the air and get two or three full rotations. It's endurence bacuse for programs you have to constantly be preforming the next move.|`|1dh5xbQ6aa	it can be all four. it is flexibility and muscle no matter what but if you are doing it competitively then it is defiantly endurance too.  also it depends on the coach but some coaches will make you run a lot everyday.
ll2y4YIGaa	in my opinion    bauer vapor xxxx  bauer supreme one95  reebok 10k(comming soon)  easton stealth s17  easton synergy se16          the first two are interchangeable depending on your style of play.|`|rvE7gyuUaa	You need specifics here:    IF you are going to spend all of that money, you want something to last:  1/2 Pick em- Nike Bauer One95 or Easton Stealth S17  A little less durable, but better for shooting:  3/4 Pick em - Nike Bauer Vapor XXXX or Easton Synergy S16    5 Anything by Warrior    I am not a fan of the CCM sticks.|`|DbfG5Cpraa	Warrior: Dolomite Spyne, Kronik, Mac Daddy  Nike Bauer: XXXX, One95  Easton: S17, SE16  RBK: 9k O-Stick  CCM: V10.0, U+/U+ Anatomy  Farrell: Signature Series  Ballistik: 55 cal.    you said one that would match your style of play, but you never wrote how you play|`|9tMDxwHeaa	I have yet to find a better stick than the Easton Synergy series. I've been using them since they came out., and never used another stick since|`|rAVWzcoEaa	My top 5 brands would be:  1. Louisville  2. Warrior  3. Easton  4. Reebok  5. Nike Bauer   Note: I have had a Louisville stick for 6 years and it is still working like it did 6 years ago I would strongly suggest one if your looking for quality that will last you a long time so buy a Louisville if you want to not have to buy one for a long time.|`|BhWmbg6gaa	Nike Bauer one95- to take heavy slapshots  Nike Bauer vapor xxxx- for the snipers  Easton Stealth S17- for the danglers  CCM U+- any all around player  Warrior Kronik- for heavy shooters    The nike bauer one95 have a higher kick point ( where the stick flexes) than the vapor XXXX. the vapor XXXX has a lower kick point for harder more accurate shots. The Easton S17 is wicked light witch is good for somone who likes to deke and do all those moves. The CCM U+ is a great all around stick. It's light a good kick point for any kind of shot. The warrior Kronik is like the One95 except it has a thing at the blade called the spyne witch keeps the blade straight when you take slapshots    hope this helped|`|KWkPHxyVaa	Well there are lots of choices. There is Nike Bauer with the Supreme one 95 which is meant for power and the Vapor XXXX which is meant for control and accuracy. I use a RBK gold 7k sick kick which is the stick Crosby uses. So just look on websites like nikebauer.com and RBK or Easton and you will find what kind of stick fits your style.|`|SJtFR4DLaa	It certainly depends on your height, style of play, position, etc.  It stinks that composites are so expensive, otherwise I'd say purchase several and try them out.  www.wickedshot.com has a couple sticks marked way down for $49.  Try there.
XUUDRM7yaa	the best thing to do would be to buy a dedicated singlespeed rear hub that's made for some abuse.  You can remove your cassette and use a cog/spacer kit but a good rear hub is a much better choice if you don't mind spending the extra money.  You can lace it to your old rim...you may be able to use the old spokes, but it just depends on the dimensions of the new hub.  Once you take into account the labor charges to rebuild the wheel, you might find it cheaper to just buy a whole new rear wheel that has the hub you want.     As for the front, it would be best to get a chainguide of some type rather than using a tensioner in the rear.  You can do it either way but chainguides are more reliable.  They can be a pain to fit and set up sometimes, however.   You'll also want to get a new singlespeed chain when your old one is worn out.....you can use either one but singlespeed chains are a bit stronger and less likely to ride up on the teeth and derail if your chainline is off a bit.   You can use your old chainrings if you want, or spring for a new singlespeed/downhill chainring.....they tend to be thicker and don't have the shifting ramps/pins.      This can be expensive to convert, but you can save a lot of money if you shop for closeouts or used parts.  Bare bones minimum with a cog/spacer kit and a tensioner will run you around $40-$70....if you want to set it up differently you may be looking at $200-$300 depending on what you get.     You can save a couple pounds by ditching the cassette and derailleurs and cables/shifters but unless you're positive you want to go singlespeed, you might be able to change some items like the wheels, handlebars, and seatpost/seat and save a lot of weight that way.  A really light 26" jump bike will be in the 26-28  range.  30-34  is more common.   And remember that lighter weight doesn't necessarily make a bike jump any better.  If you throw some style in the air, less weight will definitely make that a bit easier to handle.    Nice bike....go shred it.    :o)
y5TTkgFYaa	It actually depends on what rules you are playing by.  Most bar rules will say it is a win.  If you play by BCA/World Standardized rules, it is the breakers choice to either spot the 8 ball and keep his turn at an open table or rerack and break again.  It makes zero sence for an 8 ball break to be a win IMO.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Win|`|zFTSg47waa	Brew's right. Here's a link if you need more proof.    3.3 Break Shot   (e) Pocketing the eight ball on a legal break shot is not a foul. If the eight ball is pocketed, the breaker has the option of        (1) re-spotting the eight ball and accepting the balls in position, or      (2) re-breaking.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	You spelled "of" wrong. And that is an automatic win for you.|`|ze1g2Cyaaa	Your uncle wins as long as he did not scratch (sink the cue ball) on the break. Making other balls on the break does not change anything.

LpR9sLSlaa	your knee?    if you are in bounds,   they don't care if you're laying on the ground,  as long as you are in bounds, and the ball doesn't hit the ground.....    it's a catch    the question is "incomplete" however|`|8wmjYlfaaa	yep.  well im like 90% positive.  ive seen replays, and the announcers say-"okay, lets see where the ball landed.....yep, his knee was down right there..."  so im guessing its the same for the out-of-bounds rule.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	if your knee is down when you catch the ball the catch doesn't count|`|1fTsJSR2aa	no you must have two knees down.|`|xt4vcVIiaa	If you have possession of the football before your knee hits yes.  Like you can't catch the ball kneeling, but if you catch the ball and then your knee hits the ground you got it.|`|qB2WiEi4aa	no but 2 knees do|`|6IZdPeZfaa	John Madden has a book out called "One Knee Equals Two Feet".  He titled that because when it first came to his attention he couldn't believe it.  "The rule says two feet!", he said.  "How can one knee equal two feet?  It's one knee not two feet!"      But the short answer is yes, if the one knee is in bounds and the player has control of the ball before any body parts touch out of bounds then it is unquestionably a catch.    By the way, I can only say this for NFL.  I don't know about other levels of play.

jLTDqVHsaa	Actually, the reason behind the rule is to avoid having the goalie waste time because he's gone halfway down the ice to discuss a call with an official.  Goalies used to do that as captains, so they put that rule in place to avoid those situations.  Look up "Bill Durnan;" he's often cited as the reason for this rule.  He was a captain goaltender in the 1940s who often left his crease to protest calls.    Luongo does not wear the C on his jersey.  He wears it on his mask.  There's no rule against that.    He technically by NHL rules cannot serve as captain.  However, they do have alternate captains.    A team can have either:  -1 C and 2 A's  -3 A's    So, the Canucks named three alternate captains.  When there is no captain on the ice, an alternate captain is allowed to serve.  For the purposes of this rule, the Vancouver Canucks have no captain, so the duties of captain are shifted to the alternates.  Therefore, no disadvantage.  Captain or no captain, a team can always have up to three players who may perform the duties of captain.  The Canucks do have three as well.    According to the rule, Luongo isn't really, truly, captain.  However, by official statements and the painting of the "C" on the mask, the Vancouver Canucks have symbolically named Luongo their captain, and have made it clear that he is seen as the captain.  He just can't perform the duties of captain as described in the rules, that's all.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	A goalie CAN be captain, they just can't wear the "C" on their jersey.    It's funny you asked this because I just asked a question as to why goalies can't wear the "C" on their jersey.|`|64LZW2y8aa	A goalie can be a captain, just can't act as one, meaning he can't leave his crease to discuss things with the referees.|`|Fn2emLisaa	Goalies can be captains. I don't know if it's just me but i love Luongo's name it's so cool. sorry i went ADHD on this question.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	I would yank the C from him, since he is not leading this team in a winning direction. All it was, was a gimmick to get the Canucks some attention, and some press. They are a joke.|`|N0kAvAbTaa	Just on the technicality:  a goalie can "be" a captain, but can't "act as" captain.  That is why another player intercedes with the ref when required, etc., but Luongo is still the captain.    As to whether it's affected their stats - .... I think they have bigger problems, and I doubt the choice of captain would remain if it weren't a good thing for the team.|`|G33E41IBaa	Luongo is only captain by name, but he's not allowed to do any captainly jobs on the ice, such as talking to the referees.

3qVNoNudaa	Start rituals are a very personal thing, you will develop these as you race more. Presuming you don't have a team of technicians working for you, most of your pre-start stuff will be physical and mental preparation. Your race is a cross between mental confidence and physical competence. If you are as physically fit as you can be, and you are confident that your skis are tuned, and edged well, and you've checked over the course, and studied your line, and approaches to the turns, you are basically prepared. The attitude part comes in when you are in the start gate. Focus on the first gate; get that right and your confidence will instantly grow. Attack every gate as hard as possible, and give it 100% for the whole race. It is a minute and a half of 100% concentration and adrenaline. If you have someone videoing your training/racing, make best use of this as a learning aid. It will show you where you can make those vital hundredths and tenths  of seconds up that will make the difference.   Watch the ski racing on tv, but not with a view to copying the racers' style. You will have your own. Look at the racers' line, and the way they attack the gates.  Listen to your coach, he/she knows their stuff!

a6EndAPiaa	Do you have an HD tv?    Do you live relatively near to a major city?    Go out and buy a descent TV antenna and watch the game over the air in HD.  I just have my antenna near a window on the first floor of my house on a fairly heavily wooded lot -- it cost me about $50.00 at rippio shack (aka radio shack).  I did that for about 18 months until I took the plunge for FIOS HD about 5 months ago.  I am able to get stations in HD which I can not get in standard def.  Just remember that if the normal station is say 4 the HD channel will be 4.1  Some channels have up to 4 different HD channels.    Good luck!
00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	If the old masters had actually done some of the feats ascribed to them, I would say that they would win easily.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	First of all - if you're Asian... I am guessing you are by your user name, then you should not be asking this question here - you should know the history of your ancestors- or at least research it yourself...     If you did, you would know that "strength" in the application of martial arts does not have anything to do with "muscles".     It is not even about "strength" but about energy.    Martial arts power comes from your art's ability to teach your body to release internal power.     This is why you have to learn the mechanics of your art - alignment, footwork, koshi - you know... words you never associated with martial arts training.     The "kung fu" master of long ago knew these things.     The new school of thought "discards" all the most important things. This is why they have to pick from here and there.     If they truly understood their art, they would not need to find techniques elsewhere.    Edit:    Bujinkan - stick to your "ninja knowledge" and don't make any assumptions based on what you think you know or what you've heard.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Considering that "historical" Kung Fu has become more or less extinct since the Shaolin Temple was destroyed and that most modern styles of Kung Fu are more about fancy tricks and flash than their lethal ancestor arts. I'd say that "historic" Kung Fu would teach modern Kung Fu a lesson... old school style. This is just as far as teaching styles and techniques go.    As for the individual Kung Fu practitioners, strength is not important in any decent martial art. The better fighter will win.|`|c5menwRwaa	Hi there,    In my opinion, although sports science has come along way, I'm am yet to find a martial artist who enirely applies such science into their training, the modern world also is allowing less and less for complete martial artists to exist, they are certainly hard to find in the western world where people are far too distracted for such pursuits.    The masters from the days of battlefied war were not necessarily trying to be the strongest, but the most effecient warriors, their systems were applied in war and either succeeded or failed, they either lived or they died. This was the process whereby combat systems were refined to become what they were before the end of the warring periods.     I think the answer to your question is that, the knowledge is here today for martial artists to become stronger than ever through science.    But, at the same time, I believe that the strongest fighter will always be the one who gains their strength through fighting, not spending hours upon hours in the gym. There is more to powering the muscles than just physically moving them, there is far greater strength available to those aho need it in order to survive.

n2O0NwR6aa	There are lots of things you can start working on to prepare yourself for tryouts.  But don't wait!  Cheerleading skills take time and practice to master - so the sooner you begin, and the harder you work at it, the better off you'll be!  Here are some things to work on:    Jumps: There are three main jumps in cheerleading - the toe touch, pike jump, and front hurdler. You can search the web to see what they look like, but it's important to learn them correctly. The judges will be looking at your form, not just how high you can jump. Sign up for a cheer class or clinic, or take a couple private lessons, so you can learn the proper technique from an expert. Then go home and practice, practice, practice!    Tumbling: Most schools don't require tumbling skills, but the girls who can tumble will score higher. So start RIGHT NOW with some tumbling classes (not gymnastics), and keep them up until tryouts. You may be able to learn a back handspring by tryout time - and that will help your score a lot. The more often you go, the faster you'll progress... so go more than once a week if you can! You can also get some extra practice by attending open gyms, and taking private lessons.    Motions: You'll probably be taught a cheer to perform at tryouts, and you'll be judged on how sharp and tight your motions are. See if you can learn a cheer ahead of time - any cheer, it doesn't matter - and practice at home in front of a mirror. Watch to make sure you're hitting each position precisely, with straight arms and quick, sharp motions. Taking a dance class can also help a lot!    Voice Projection: Cheerleaders need to be loud - but not screechy. When you shout your cheer, yell from your diaphram and make your voice deep, sharp and clear. This sounds easy, but it takes some practice to get it right. And when you're jumping around in a cheer and yelling at the same time, it's easy to become breathless and lose your voice! So start "training" your voice by yelling a chant or cheer while you're doing something active - jumping jacks, jogging in place, etc.     Spiriting: You'll probably be expected to do some spiriting when you try out. That's when you jump around and yell things like "Alright! Let's go Eagles! Fire it up!" while doing some simple arm motions. If you're not used to doing that, it can feel pretty weird... and you might not know exactly what to do or say. So go to a game, watch the cheerleaders, and see what they do. Make a note of some of the things they say, and what they do with their arms. Then go home and practice in front of your mirror. Make up a little "spiriting routine" that you can practice, so it will become more natural for you.    Smile: The number one tip people give for cheer tryouts is to SMILE! Sounds simple enough, but it's easy to forget when you're out there concentrating on your jumps or cheer. So start working on it now. Whenever you practice anything - jumps, cheers, etc - do it with a smile. That way it will become a habit, and you won't have to concentrate on smiling when you're out there in front of the judges.     To get an idea of what the judges are looking for, here's a typical score sheet that many schools use:    Entrance/Smile - 5 pts  Crowd appeal (neat, pleasant appearance) - 5 pts  Spirit (being peppy) - 5 pts  Voice Projection (being loud but not screechy) - 5 pts  Motions (being sharp) - 10 pts  Memory/Recall (ability to learn the cheer) - 10 pts  Jumps (height and technique) - 15 pts  Tumbling (difficulty and form) - 10-15 pts  Dance ability - 5-10 pts  Grades - 10 pts  Citizenship - 20 pts  Total Possible points - 100 pts    I hope this helps some! Good luck!|`|IT1DAz1Oaa	Okay so i have actually cheered for 5 years and recently got approached with volunteer coaching and what the look for is your arms being stiff you need to make sure that your try out cheer is perfect and your smile and attitude is extremely important. Never make it look like you don't know what your doing. Also a tip for getting your jumps a bit higher is do sit ups but when you come up stretch your legs as far as possible and go through ur legs. i hope you get on the team!!

355532df94e51c374162e8452be608daaa	its because MOST americans are ignorant....they don't pay attention to football and think its a boring, scoreless sport. and they also dont realize its popularity in the world. they think american football is the masculine sport and football is for p ssies. thats just pure ignorance. football is a game of strength, stamina and strategy. but american football requires very little skills except being strong,etc. they jump on top of each other and call us G@Y.      and its not popular also because of the media. you never see soccer commercials here on TV, but u see lots of american football ads and nba, mlb, etc. but in 90% of the countries in the world they play football and they always have football commercials.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	for several reasons  im from the US and like soccer and from what i see  -americans are not brought up watching soccer(main reason)  -advertiserss dont invest since their is no commercial space (except for halftime), media  -we have many major sports to pick from. (another big reason)  -it appears boring, since the game is back and forth with little scoring  -a game that u can watch for 2 hrs can finish 0-0|`|o7gV56ngaa	It seems to me that Americans like sports with lots of stops so that they can have advertising on TV. I also think that Americans like instant gratification by seeing lots of points scored frequently. It's easy to say that the winners of the super bowl or the world series or the NBA are the world champions, but they're not really, they are only American champions. America will never be world champions of the biggest sport in the world until they win the world cup.|`|AA11503798	US did not 'grow up' on soccer.  We grew up on other sports, some invented here....football, baseball, basketball, etc.    Soccer is growing in popularity, but I don't think it will ever have the following it does in some other countries.  One of the reasons is 'less action'.  You can go whole game with 0, 1, 2 points scored!    It is excellent exercse for kids...glad to see so many recreational leaques starting with 5-year olds.  We do have teams at all levels now, but there is a way to go.  Many of the pro teams have lots of players from other countries, so until we start getting media publicity around the games/players it will grow slowly.|`|46oOn3yeaa	It is too popular! i love soccer and so do many of my friends. i do understand what you are saying, and it may not be as popular as it is in the UK but i think its growing, and the USWNT is getting more and more attention each year, and every now and then i will even see some of the USWNT players in magazines, the news paper and even on television. So i think that many of us here in america do love soccer, just as many of us do love football, and i think this sport has grown in popularity a lot over the years and i think it will continue to grow, and soon it wll be just as popular as it is in the UK if not close.|`|LH1nR8OXaa	I love soccer. I think it's mostly because people think "anyone" can play it. Which isn't true.. at all. If everyone could play it, then why isn't everyone on the USA team?

You really don't get above 3 goals in a good match.|`|zCwUyEz9aa	well US naturally rejected england and since that's where soccer came from they invented new sports to replace it and most except for basketball have hardly influenced other countries for example American Football

4Jtdqo12aa	Well, I've been told (by a jockey) that Merlano is a good quality racing saddle.  Prestwick is an excellent but hard-to-find English saddle.  I have an A/P Prestwick I got from chubbypony.com and absolutely love it!  My horses and I find it very comfortable.  For synthetic English saddles, there's always Wintec, but I prefer a Thoroughgood.  It is not as well known but is just as good or better than Wintec.  It's comfortable too.  Billy Cook, Tucker, and Circle Y are reputable Western saddles.  Tucker is known for it's soft, padded seats.    Down Under Saddlery makes quality Australian saddles.  They tend to be a good fit for horse and rider.        It really depends on what you are looking for.|`|d2Obe0aJaa	Depends on if your riding english or western. For western Circle Y is the best brand to get, its pricey but its worth it. They make a great line of saddles from trail to show saddles.
xlSJeA19aa	YES I DO!!!|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Deleted answer for the good of the players.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	i think chris judd might have one, also billy slater has one it think? :)|`|mblS6feBaa	just search for them and see if they have friends that are in the same team as them....  im friends with heaps of the brissy lions players on facebook.  and they are the real ones.|`|cVIDZiZmaa	I can do.

8xQDRRZfaa	LOL who uses a 60 yard sprint as a test for soccer??  And 1 mile? geez players should be able to run 9 miles.    Any way since you need it fast... the Best single exercise for you is interval running.     Basically its like this:  Jog for 10 minutes as a warmup. Then increase your pace to %60 of max speed and run for 3 minutes. Then sprint for 30 seconds. Then run (%60) for 3 minutes. Then sprint for 20 seconds. Then run for 3 minutes. Then sprint for 10 seconds. Then run for 3 minutes. Then sprint for 5 seconds. Then run for 3 minutes.    So basically like this:  - J 10 mins  - R 3 mins  - S 30 secs  - R 3 m  - S 20 s  - R 3 m  - S 10 s  - R 3 m  - S 5 s  - R 3 m    Do that 3 times a week and you will be good to go.|`|5X0p45Zbaa	Push Ups  Sit ups  Jumping jacks  Play with ball    Outside:  Run Laps!!!!  Dribbling  Passing  Shooting    Diet: Eat more veggies and fruits and drink milk! in 1 week u will get in shape and be faster then anybody if u wanna be fast why not go for like 30 min run outside when your free or 60 yard sprint   Jog walk and run|`|qWTkkXAlaa	obviously running will help. i find it much easier to run outside and it would be better for you if you are playing outdoor soccer. you don't have to do hard sprints for long periods of time - changing between jogging and fast walking is actually very helpful with your endurance and building up your speed.  if you're female, or a secure male, yoga and pilates is really helpful and a cheap way to exercise in front of your tv. all you need is a video from a used dvd store and it really builds up your leg muscles :)|`|zanfEbhTaa	there are soccer camps and stuff. make a running schedule and STICK to it. maybe doing it with someone else will help.|`|ofmDgp31aa	You need to run, dribble, Lift weights, do push-ups and sit-ups. And you can ask the coach for the team you'll be trying out for

XxG9SqYoaa	I don't know about the Cards but the Yankee bleacher seats are supposed to be even better than the expensive seats (as far as atmosphere goes). The bleachers tend to have the real fans, the fans who just want to watch the game and don't care about their seats. I would for for it.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Bleacher seats are normally the most inexpensive tickets you can buy. At the old Busch, they weren't bad. However, I've not been to the new Busch but I would assume it wouldn't be any different.|`|o9VwzG0qaa	If you are looking for a great bleacher experience go to Wrigley. If you want to have a blast at busch get seats in Homer's Landing. They cost a little more but they have a great view and include food and beverage. If you plan on drinking at the game these tickets are the only way to fly.|`|hBzm8i5Naa	Bleacher seats are alright...but ill tell you that a differnt group of people are in the cheap seats ( bleachers) . i cant bring my kids when i go there, ive had bad expirences with drunk loud guys there before. but if you are 2 adults that dont mind they are fun seats. cheap seats = more $ for beer and dogs. i use ifootballtickets.com for my tickets they usually have the cheapest price, if not them then cheapticketsite.com. hope this helps.....
e81cb58413964229d6af24dd65970eadaa	you should specify american football or the rest of the world football.  In america, we call football soccer for some reason.

Cp5dSNzqaa	dont think of it as a race, just think of it as practice, and that should help|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Just think more of a practice rather then a race. That can help from having a sprinter.|`|rYdEVC0xaa	focus at the ground at first before you take off. start to take deep breaths. when you look up to run, focus just past the finish line. focusing on something farther than what you are reaching for, makes you get there with that much more confidence. also try to listen to some pump up fast tempo songs before you get ready to get on the blocks.
w2zlb5r0aa	Yeah, I have heard of that rule.  I usually swim in basketball shorts too.    I have only been told once that it was forbidden, but I was still able to swim.  I was with other friends too, and almost all of us had on basketball shorts so my guess is they didn't want to kick all of us out.    I asked a similar question about 9 months ago, and people told me that the real reason is because a lot of people find basketball shorts unseemly when they get wet.  They do cling, and you can see your junk if you don't readjust right when you get out.    I still do it though; I wouldn't worry too much about it IMO; in my experience, most pools don't enforce that rule.|`|AA11610448	It's kind of a stretch, but the thought is that shorts shed fabric and the fabric clogs the water filters.  I can see that if they're cotton, but otherwise they are no worse than trunks.  But, I have seen that rule before.|`|hyLnJibTaa	The reason why is that they do not have mesh pants inside of them. It is unsanitary to swim without mesh pants. They just want the pool to be as clean as possible.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	No, but I have definitely seen this rule.
wmhwBhv8aa	If you contact remington they will give you an exact answer.  But i know it cant be newer than 65 or 66 with the metal butt plate.  That is kind of odd because your gun has checkering.  But contact them and they will tell exactly when it was made.|`|xWApXu8Aaa	Your rifle was manufactured in June of 1974 according to the markings that you indicated.    The charts in the link I have below are used to identify the manufacture date codes stamped on the barrel.  Y = 1974  P = June    http://www.remingtonsociety.com/rsa/ques...    Good luck -      In 1976, I bought a brand new Remington Model 700 in .30-06 that only had a flat steel buttplate on it which I later had a gunsmith remove and a recoil pad installed in it's place, so I know at that time they still sold that model without a recoil pad in most of the non-magnum calibers available for that particular rifle.|`|Q03FuAvQaa	1944
4gZYucHMaa	When I first started running I had the same problems. I was so busy concentrating on my stance and my breathing, I forgot about my feet.<br>  <br>  I wriggle my toes every now and then. If you're running, your feet just sit there in the shoe and they go to sleep, so make sure you give them a wiggle every now and then --I have to do the same thing with my arms at times, they get stiff while out.<br>  <br>  Also make sure your laces are tied too tightly.|`|hwbkyNhZaa	I would mention this to a doctor. It could be a nerve or circulation problem.<br>  <br>  I know someone with a spine disease and his hand goes numb every now and then.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Reasons I could think of might include:<br>  <br>  Shoes tied too tightly<br>  Poor Circulation<br>  A sock wrinkling in the shoe and applying focused pressure on a specific area of the foot, thus cutting off circulation (This actually happened to a friend of mine, I thought he was joking until he showedme the line from the sock.) its a combination of shoe and sock in this case.<br>  Shoes with too narrow a last, thus constricting foot movement (perhaps you need an E width instead of D)<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are other reasons, but that's just a couple guesses on my part. Good luck solving it.

As for Blake, trade him while his value is still high for that first round. I'd laugh if he gets traded back to the Island...lol|`|f1FRCSdTaa	Blake and Kaberle will be gone during the off season.

BTW, in regards to "the Blake of old", he had one season with more than 28 goals....40 in his contract year. Go figure. He'll be 36 next year and make 4.5 Million, I'll pass, as would every team I would think.

I don't blame Copeland for trying to get an easy 2 points. It's very reasonabIe for him to do that. He is a senior and has dealt with injuries. Of course, he deserves even more than what he gets (playing time/points).    But I also don't blame McCauley for giving the hard foul. Do you expect teams to bend over for you even at the last seconds of the game? Do you expect someone to just surrender the game was still going on? I know some teams do that, but they are not necessarily at fault for sticking with the game; especially if the opposing team also stuck with their play even up 15 or so.    It's a hard choice. But you kind of have to come to expect it from rival teams, no? And it is basketball after all.|`|XrCc85kNaa	You like to write a lot....dont you??|`|BIyJUmM9aa	a player tried to choke someone!?!?

Tony, Jr. doesn't understand this new car.|`|AA11234673	I have to agree with Winter on this one.

I think he's a good chief although I will never understand his move at Watkins Glen I think he's just fine.   Every chief made questionable calls including the almighty Chad Knaus so if Jr is happy then yes he is the right man for the job.  Why not question the driver sometimes?  OOps thats a sin to go there.  lol|`|4l0yGuE9aa	The sports announcers seem to think that Tony Eury Jr doesn't keep up with the track changes. It was announced all season last year on TV and  I agree. Tony couldn't keep up with the track with the old car and the new car is even more difficult to get precise. All of the successful crew chiefs have stated that there is a fine window to work in that makes the car perform well. Tony Jr. just hasn't got what it takes to anticipate the changes that takes place in a race.     Dale Jr's most successful years were when his uncle Tony Eury Sr was a crew chief. Dale Jr does make some dumb mistakes sometimes. Example when he turned too early in front of Carl Edwards and wrecked himself and destroyed his chances of winning a championship a few years back.     Any successful crew chief in the past was always because he made small changes unless there was something way off on the car. Chad is way better at making those guesses ... Tony Eury Jr. is not. I think the world of Tony Eury Sr and Tony Eury Jr but if Dale is going to compete with the top runners for a championship then he's going to have to find another job for Tony Jr. He should have used Alan Gustafson as a crew chief. Tony will hit on some races but he just can't keep up with the track changes. He never has been.    There are some races Dale Jr should have won last season. Some was lost because of bad luck, bad sportsmanship from some other drivers, and some were Eury Jr's fault. I'm not just using last year as a basis for my opinion. I'm using Tony Eury Jr's entire career as Dale Jr's crew chief as a basis for my opinion. He can't keep up with the track. He's good at setting a car up but not as a crew chief and keeping a car up.|`|P3f94TJbaa	Hes a good crew chief, because a couple of years ago Jr and Michael Waltrip switched crew chiefs and Michael did great with Tony Jr. But i definitely think Dale Jr should get a new crew chief, him and Tony Jr just argue cause Dale Jr gets aggrivated when the car doesn't drive right, and they start to argue.|`|CWTRdrQaaa	naaaaw i dont think hese ready.....

QtdQjnc7aa	Good idea,     I agree with most here that they are doing there job well when not noticed.     The big advantage IMO will they will have a chance to rest, its amazing the amount of running they have to do.     Wont be as physically and mentally draining if they can go off for a rest, nearly all the players do.     Only drama would be if they get coached while resting and get told by the revue panel player X is holding player Y  around the ruck they may go out on an agenda and be overly critical      If there not coached while resting Im all for it|`|O3VzJW4faa	It's an alright thing. It would certainly help the game because the Umpires would tend to be less fatigued and less likely to stuff up. I'm all for it. Anyway, they are only trialing it in the NAB. I like all the experiments from the NAB Cup.|`|mXFOru11aa	it is a great idea they will be able to see front on and a behind view of what is happening espeacially  with the marking contest|`|2s244jGgaa	Its not a bad idea, at least umpires get rests so they dont tire out and can focus on the game more, to try and make the correct decisions.    They arent as energetic/fit as the AFL players that are always running around out there, so they deserve a good one quater break. Its also good if they need an emergency umpire incase something happens.|`|hshNAN4waa	Couldn't give a toss if there were a hundred umpires. just as long as I dont notice them in the game and they do thier job!|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	if they had a video umpire like rugby league wouldnt that make more sense?    to the guy that posted the NFL link, do you really think aussie rules and yank gayball is the same thing?? idiot.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	I'm not fussed either way as long as they make the correct decisions, my belief is umpires are like annoying kids, they should be seen but not heard.  They need to remember the game is about the players, not the umpires.
VghVdPfsaa	Haha, absolutely love that jersey. Good to have some humor over the season.    I don't know if Beckham can help, maybe Ronaldinho could though...    I think they'll get 3-4 wins, but I doubt much more than that. And Barry Sanders playing at 40 is probably better than any of their RB choices at the moment, haha.

Snowboarding boots are made to properly allow you to pressure the board quickly and efficiently so you can carve and keep full control over the board, so to put it simply could it be done? yes, but is it smart to do? no.|`|5V6jEg9saa	Could you? Yeah. Should you? No. Snowboard boots are designed to be stiff so you can control the board, whereas regular boots are designed to be more flexible to be comfortable.

erTDzxD8aa	Yes. They outplayed the Mets in the Regular Season, they were much better than the Brewers, an overall better team than the Dodgers, and a better team than the Rays.

YYqrT4jBaa	Tippmann's require high pressure NO2 tanks. So do Dangerous Power G3's. You will probably want a 68cu/4500psi tank. They are carbon fiber and you can use them without using a remote line. It will last a long time and carbon fiber tanks are very light. I linked an example of a 68cu/4500psi tank. They are expensive tanks ($100+) but will last a long time in the long run. It's a great choice if you have the money. Good luck.|`|e5c347190016113ac012b8aa79ed41aeaa	The difference between High pressure and Low pressure is simply the output pressure on the regulator.  The A5 will need a High pressure output as well as most other paintball guns.  Guns that operate on lower pressures have their own internal regulator to fine tune the pressure.      It is best to get a HPA tank with a high pressure output regulator.    In terms of getting a high pressure tank, a 4500PSI tank will be lighter and give you 50% more shots than a 3000PSI tank.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	All markers use HP. only a Angel needs LP. so unless you own a Angel buy HP
fm8mnTlkaa	Single wicket cricket was a contest between two people. The laws in the wikipedia entry are good, but relate to teams of up to 5 a side. They do show the principles. The rules for any given game would often be amended depending on the agreement of the players on that day.    i) Only runs scored by hitting the ball count - no extras, so you could bowl as fast as you could.  ii) Runs can only be scored in front of the wicket - no dabs or late cuts, less fielders needed...  iii) Runs scored with one foot inside the crease - no charging down the wicket, so you could bowl as slow as you liked.    The intention was to keep the contest even, a fast bowler could have a fair game against a slow bowler.    Often the same fielders and keeper would do the job for both players, and may have to be paid.    hope this helps|`|H7AcXAyaaa	The first four laws cover the players, the umpires and the scorers.        * Law 1: The players. A cricket team consists of eleven players, including a captain. Outside of official competitions, teams can agree to play more than eleven-a-side, though no more than eleven players may field.        * Law 2: Substitutes. In cricket, a substitute may be brought on for an injured fielder. However, a substitute may not bat, bowl, keep wicket or act as captain. The original player may return if he has recovered. A batsman who becomes unable to run may have a runner, who completes the runs while the batsman continues batting. Alternatively, a batsman may retire hurt or ill, and may return later to resume his innings if he recovers.        * Law 3: The umpires. There are two umpires, who apply the Laws, make all necessary decisions, and relay the decisions to the scorers. While not required under the laws of cricket, in higher level cricket a third umpire (located off the ground and available to assist the on-field umpires) may be used under the specific playing conditions of a particular match or tournament. [1]        * Law 4: The scorers. There are two scorers who respond to the umpires' signals and keep the score.    After dealing with the players, the laws move on to discuss equipment and pitch specifications, except for specifications about the wicket-keeper's gloves, which are dealt with in Law 40. These laws are supplemented by Appendices A and B (see below).        * Law 5: The ball. A cricket ball is between 8 13/16 and 9 inches (22.4cm and 22.9cm) in circumference, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9g and 163g). Only one ball is used at a time, unless it is lost, when it is replaced with a ball of similar wear. It is also replaced at the start of each innings, and may, at the request of the fielding side, be replaced with a new ball, after a certain number of overs have been bowled (80 in Test matches, 34 in ODIs). The gradual degradation of the ball through the innings is an important aspect of the game.        * Law 6: The bat. The bat is no more than 38 inches (96.5cm) in length, and no more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide. The hand or glove holding the bat is considered part of the bat. Ever since the Heavy Metal incident, a highly publicized marketing attempt by Dennis Lillee, who brought out an aluminium bat during an international game, the laws have provided that the blade of the bat must be made of wood (and in practice, they are made from White Willow wood).        * Law 7: The pitch. The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards (20.12 m) long and 10ft (3.05 m) wide. The Ground Authority selects and prepares the pitch, but once the game has started, the umpires control what happens to the pitch. The umpires are also the arbiters of whether the pitch is fit for play, and if they deem it unfit, with the consent of both captains can change the pitch. Professional cricket is almost always played on a grass surface. However, in the event a non-turf pitch is used, the artificial surface must have a minimum length of 58ft (17.68 m) and a minimum width of 6ft (1.83 m).        * Law 8: The wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are 9 inches (22.86 cm) wide. Two wooden bails are placed on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) above the stumps, and must, for men's cricket, be 4 5/16 inches (10.95 cm) long. There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (ie it is windy so they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix A to the laws.        * Law 9: Bowling, popping, and return creases. This law sets out the dimensions and locations of the creases. The bowling crease, which is the line the stumps are in the middle of, is drawn at each end of the pitch so that the three stumps in the set of stumps at that end of the pitch fall on it (and consequently it is perpendicular to the imaginary line joining the centres of both middle stumps). Each bowling crease should be 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m) in length, centred on the middle stump at each end, and each bowling crease terminates at one of the return creases. The popping crease, which determines whether a batsman is in his ground or not, and which is used in determining front-foot no balls (see law 24), is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each of the two sets of stumps. The popping crease must be 4 feet (1.22 m) in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length, the popping crease must be marked to at least 6 feet (1.83 metres) on either side of the imagi|`|AA11088802	rulES CAN CHANGE...

WiIUEObTaa	have had great improvement by using rifle hi bird shaft steel. the steel shafts from manufacture have a very low kick point. this does cause a hook . with higher kick point given by the rifle or true temper. hi birds are much much more controllable. i would try to find true temper gold or similar shaft hi bird. the low kick point works for many. but the higher kick point better for advanced players. not sure if rifle hi bird shaft is available. try hitting steel first. graphite will hook. try steel if goes straight no hook. better club. if it hooks steel shaft. ask for high kick point. then you will understand how good these clubs are.|`|EWhPNsnKaa	stick with the steel if that is what you are used to...graphite will flex quite a bit more and if you have a fast swing it could change the position of the club head compared to what you are accustom to.<br>  <br>  If you have a good golf shop any where near you many times you can go to them and they can help you decide what is going to be best for your swing type<br>  <br>  EDIT...I prefer steel shafts on all my clubs and had my driver switched to a steel shaft...a little unconventional...yes...but it works for me.|`|2nmFFFQ4aa	You can get graphite shafts that are stiffer than some steel shafts. Your best bet is to get fitted for your swing and they will be able to tell you what flex, swing weight, loft, and lie would be best for you. Graphite is more common in hybrids because of the flex point allowing you to get the ball in the air easier.

cXVslImpaa	Before I start, actually, I just have some tips. Most likely you're making your own music, and cause you want alot of songs, hopefully tou're mixing songs. That's good, and use a lot of sound effects too. However, sound effects that don't match what you're doing don't look that great. If you full / double right on some kind of sound effect however, it looks amazing, and if you hit a toe touch basket or something right on a snap it looks really clean and also helps to keep you on time. Also, always speed up music. Slow songs can be used in cheer music as long as they are sped up, and fast songs can always be faster (to a certain extent). Also, try to use unusual music!!!!!!!! This is super important! Popular songs like disturbia, just dance, etc. sound good, but not when the judges have already heard them fifty times. There's alot of music out there!!! Find unusual things that sound good!!! However, it's good to have a mix. Throw in a few popular songs, just not for your entire routine. Okay, so here's some I recommend:    Toy Soldier = Britney Spears (This one might be pretty common, but the chorus sounds good as long as you speed it up)    I'd Do Anything = Simple Plan (Use a part of the chorus, its actually a really good song for a cheer stunt, and its uncommon, but mostly keep it at the speed it already is)    Bananza / Belly Dancer OR Smack That = Akon (This one could be common, but if you speed them up they sound good and they're very different music from Britney Spears etc)    Wait a Minute = Pussycat Dolls (This is a REEEAAALLLLYYY good ending. Have the chorus play a little, then when they say, "wait a minute" stop the music there hit your ending and yell your team name. Just listen to it, we used to have it and it sounded really good.)    Mamma Mia = ABBA (This depends on your style, but if you can make this song work it would be pretty funny, and that could hel you - I like it :)    Piece of Me / Hips Don't Lie = Britney Spears / Shakira (These two songs are both really good dance music, speed up piece of me alot though, it sounds good. I'm not sure though, is your music for stunt comp.? cause in that case you won't need this, but consider it anyway - I like it for dances)    We've Got it Goin' On = Backstreet Boys (This could be a good song. Search backstreet boys because I think you might want to use some of their music - I just picked this song  but alot of their songs could work - listen to some of them)    Ain't No Other Man = Christina Anguilera (I reeeealllly like this song for cheer music. Speed it up and cut it, whatever, but I think it's a good idea)    Stronger = Kanye West (Use those first little words whatever as the opening words to your routine:)    Okaym how many is that, eight?? So you need like, three more?? Okay, I'm just gonna list some songs that would work. Listen to them and decide for yourself. remember don't immediately dismiss a song. Almost any song can work. If it's too slow, speed it up. If you want the beginning and the end, cut out the middle. These songs are just starting points- edit them whaterver. Or maybe you knew that already :).    Car Wash = Christina Anguilera  Soldier = Destinys Child  London Bridge = Fergie  Like Me = Girlicious  Holla Back Girl = Gwen Stefani  4 minutes = Madonna  Beat it = Michael Jackson (lol)  Shake Your Pom Pom = Missy Elliot (i dont think ive heard this song but it mentions pom poms so lol you could use it for cheer)  Wait For You = Nelly Furtado  So What = Pink  Lonely No More = Rob Thomas (i like this one, its good cause your a team)    And ya thats all i got.    Hope it helps and tell me what you chose!!|`|0PpwXf4Qaa	well im a cheerleader and i will give you some songs from our homecoming routine football season! we used..   -when i grow up- pussy cat dolls  -see you again - miley cyrus  - disturbia - rihannah  -womanizer- britney spears  - in the ayyerr   and i forgett the restt but what songs do you have alreadyy?   i hope this helped! :)|`|8DePDw68aa	Go by Mario (w/ instrumental if you want)  Party 4u (Silent Nite Remix)  Rock with U (preferably the instrumental) by Janet Jackson   License to Chill     (An important note about If You Seek Amy: May not be appropiate.

uFWe1Rd0aa	you can start out with drylands, a few times a week to build up your muscles.  leg lifts, sit ups, that sort of thing.    usually, coaches arent looking for a professional swimmer, as everyone needs to start somewhere, but they look for athleticism, and endurance.  if you tire out quickly, chances are you wont make it.  if you can do a good freestyle stroke correctly, you should be good.|`|geMMyHfpaa	Swimming is a sport combing aerobic excerise with enderence, meaning you need to have good breathing while still keeping a good pace.

That being said, they could use a shake up, they could use some extra draft picks - Montreal is offering an incredible deal to Tampa Bay (as far as the rumours go) which includes some pretty consistent players, a few prospects and a few draft picks.    Montreal could really use Vincent Lecavalier right now, in fact, he's probably the missing piece in their already stacked team.     I know Lecavalier is franchise player in Tampa Bay, but he's costing a lot salary cap room and he's just not backing up the money with his play in Tampa Bay.

ZCNEm9hTaa	NO it is not too late -     Make friends with someone on the team - you guys can go to the cages together.  Some Batting Cages have lessons on the mechanics of hitting.    Next - join a local rec team,   Little League Juniors is for 13-14 years old they start playing in April , Babe Ruth is for 13-15 years old. (they usually start when HS is over about the 1st of May)   sign up now - if you wait till March it will be too late.      I hope this helps|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Way too late, I was already playing baseball by 4 minutes old.|`|AA10025824	Never too late.  Just practice.  Grab a bat and practice swinging first so you get a good feel for it.  50 swings a day with a heavy bat and you'll build up bat speed quickly.  And while you're doing that keep your head straight, focus on something in front of you, step forward, keep your back elbow up and swing even and fast.    That's a start, but a really good way to put some power in your swing.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	I think you're over the hill, time to retire|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	It is never too late.

If you like playing, then I think you should totally keep playing. During the season, it may be tough to find a team, but you can still work out in the gym, and take your ground balls and swings. You will need to put in some extra work, but if you are willing to do it, then there is no reason to think it is too late to start playing.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	No!!

cb7d8d8e1066301d27e5cac9944cfbfcaa	I'm going to give you an honest answer, and maybe one you don't want to hear..........but.......    I would not even pay $25 for that rod. Why ? Two reasons:    1) The claim that it is made from "24 ton graphite cloth, same as IM-6"  is erroneous. IM-6 graphite is at least 38 million modulus, standard graphite is 33 million modulus, you've bought yourself a heavy, non-responsive rod, probably OK for live bait and crank-baits, but you could forget about it being a good jig or spinner-bait rod.  2) The handle is solid wood, again , this adds (IMO) unnecessary weight and to be truthful, wil deaden the action and will make it less sensitive.         Granted, it seems like a novelty and all the bells and whistles are there, I just wouldn't buy it, though.     I really hope you do like it and I am proven wrong, just giving you an honest  answer and I mean no hard feelings by it.    THe reel (in my VERY limited knowledge of bait-casters) seems like a good deal.|`|Y43nptlvaa	I used to have one and i loved it till my nephew accidentally dropped it in our local lake.. I didnt get mad at him but still miss it..

I would love to have one! Doug Hannon is the only guy to catch 800 10 lb. bass, you know! (I don't know if those statistics are accurate, did he like track everyone he caught or something? To catch that many big bass, he must have been using that there Banjo Minnow!) For $70, that's a great deal.   The reel looks very good, and looks like something i could afford! (lol) That's actually a very good looking baitcaster, and has an overall rating of 4.6, not bad, not bad at all.  You want to have a baitcaster that has accurate, good ratings. I mean, the banjo minnow has a rating of 1, then 5, then 1, then 2, i mean you don't know if it's good or not (I wouldn't waste my hard earned $20 for something I'm unsure of!)  So, good picks on the rod & reel.|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	It seems what ya have just got your self there is a "sweet" rod lol, I've heard a lot about blaze rods and all of it seems to be good! finally if somethings on sale, what more do you want as an excuse to buy it! for $70 that rod seems to be a steal!  Enjoy your rod and tight lines!    *FSH- that is one mighty fine reel, with a mighty fine price tag to go with it, that price is entering fly reel territory lol*|`|lECmz3SEaa	One Good price and choices, but I believe your reel was a bit pricy.

a6EndAPiaa	Black:    Black Sambuca  Black Rum  Kaluha    Yellow  Gallanio (sp?)

That is all I can think of if I think of anything else I will edit and add on.    -- Edit oh you want to do a single drink that is yellow and black?    Hmmm a pousse cafe of some sort maybe (a Pousse cafe is a drink where you float different alcohols on top of each other so they are layered).    Lemon and rum go pretty well together you could try to float some dark rum on top of Lemoncillo.  Pour the Lemoncillo first and the very slowly pour the dark rum over the back of a spoon on top of the Lemoncillo.  (It might be the other way around but I am thinking the Lemoncillo will be more dense).|`|OYgtlTEfaa	Start with a yellow drink like a screwdriver, or anything with orange juice.

fkqPs9QRaa	Yes, it defenitley will get rid of the fat on your stomach.  I've been running for like 3 years now, and I can eat like 5 pounds a day and not gain a pound from it.  Your metabolism skyrockets from running, and i don't see why not you shouldn't lose the fat if u do run.  Also, you have a good plan for starting out with it.  Slowly increase your mileage to about like 4 or 5 miles 5 times a week.  Also, if you want to get ur mile quicker, you have to do a couple of sprints here and there.  Go to a local track like twice a week and run consistent 200's (half laps on an averaged size track) and 400's too.|`|yOmxDFJOaa	The best way to train for running is to run until you are out of breath-run as fast as you can until it hurts so much you cannot stand it-then walk until your breathing has subsided.  Day by day your endurance will increase until you can run the whole time and you do not have to slow to a walk or jog to recover.    The real key is not to limit yourself to one mile for training-at a good walking pace that is only about 10-12 minutes or at full speed that is only 4.5 minutes or a little more.  It is recommendable that your workout last at least twenty minutes to increase endurance-however that is a MINIMUM-30-45 minutes is sufficient with this method to increase endurance and burn excess fat.|`|GChSvLtIaa	Running is great but start slow and build to longer distances then you wont get hurt or burn ur self out

I dont know if Kevin Curtis is overrated but, I know he's over payed...    we need TJ!!!!|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I hate to say it because I like the guy, but Kerry Rhodes (Jets) hasn't quite played up to his hype. He's fast and can cover a lot of ground, and is great at blitzing, but he's still making a lot of mental mistakes in coverage.    Maybe an easier choice for me would be Laveranues Coles, who talks a good game and has the skills to back it up, but doesn't. I think people are starting to realize he isn't a  1 receiver though, so Rhodes is probably more overrated.|`|exOOXAkBaa	Almost everybody, most notably Cromartie, Merriman, L.T, Rivers, but they're good, so I wouldn't call out my own team.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	I hate to say this but eli manning...he has talent, but is inconsistent [as he proved in the playoffs this year]
4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Me. I Love Fed!!!!  GO FED!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	federer for sure|`|7dVtO1gtaa	i hate federer because he stripped king Roddick of his crown.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	i support nadal, he wil win obviously.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I adore Fed and always support him *at least* until he gets to any final. If his opponent then is anyone other than Rafa, then I'll want Roger to win with all my heart, but against the Spaniard is a whole other story...VAMOS RAFA!!!!!|`|iD3XXaMOaa	I for one will forever be a fan of Federer. As always, I would be rooting for Federer all the way to pull off the win. Its gonna be a great acheivement if he wins the AO for the 4th time & in the process he will equal the great Pete Sampras.|`|h8G1x2ioaa	me even though i really dont like tennis|`|oPyrfd0Uaa	me!  I hope he gives nadal a ticket off the court in 3 sets!|`|lmk8w14saa	i would like to see Fed to equal Pete's record but at the same time I'm expecting battle of 5 sets....|`|c7go9FI4aa	I have to admit that I am not really supporting any more favorably.     Federer is awesome and has been playing some incredible tennis at the Australian Open. If he wins, he will match Pete Sampras at having the most Singles Grand Slams ever. Talk about awesome!    Nadal has also been playing one heck of a game and his semi final win was just incredible. If he is to win it, this will definitely be a well deserved 5th grand slam singles title for him.    Anyway, no matter what happens, Federer/Nadal will continue to dominate at the later tournaments and Federer will reach the 14th and probably go on to win more single grand slam titles than anyone else. Nadal might make it to 10?    Oh and don't forget: No matter who wins or loses, both players will still make more money in that one match than most people will make in a whole year (if not more :P)!

Then again, I don't watch for the halftime show, anyway.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	yeah, i don't mind. it could be worse...like the jona s s brothers playing or something.  they played it safe though...no janet jacksons for sure LOL
a6EndAPiaa	Cardinals are the home team.    It rotates from the NFC to the AFC.  It is the NFC's turn this year.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Tampa.|`|srIvu5PWaa	The cardinals are home and the steelers are away. The even numbers are AFC and odd numbers are NFC. The steelers decided to wear their white jerseys in super bowl XL.
3nnjNUOjaa	Michael Therrien needs to go. I have said this from the begining of the slump. The systems he has installed into the are not working. The powerplay is not very good. He needs to find a right combination with the lines. He also needs to keep Alex Goligoski in the lineup. Alex Goligoski is the leading defencive scorer, and he is not playing all the games. But in his defence the defence has not been healthy the whole year.|`|8mAm5LWmaa	they suck and don't deserve a playoff sport! Go Wings!|`|9GzkVwfGaa	I can't believe that they are in 10th place.

You win some, you lose some - the penguins just seem to be losing more.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	The answer as my old friend Holmes used to say is elementary.     There are sixty minutes in a game. When your two best players can't play with anyone else and you can't play them more than thirty minutes a game you must do something with the other thirty minutes.   Icing the puck 50 or 60 times a game won't work besides you can't change your players when you do. So another plan must be devised. Staal isn't living up to his own headlines, the other kids aren't that good and the defense is atrocious with Gonchar injured. The Penquins are living proof that you can't get better with number one draft picks. You are too rotten within the organization to get better with one or two or three or four high picks. You need depth.    The Penquins don't have any.|`|ko2Iskl0aa	They just have something wrong with their Rosters. They are trying to get back up with Garon. They might make the playoffs but not win the cup. and will loose the first playoff game. They will be back up soon as they get better on D but O is okay.|`|Uathep5Yaa	Cup Hangover and they lost too many pieces|`|U8HSSSswaa	The answer is simple    Crosby and Malkin can't do everything by themselves!!!!!!!!!!|`|Mqurv3LXaa	Call it OSS (Ottawa Senator Syndrome)  They have two star players, however they do not have comparable parts to play on other lines. Crosby and Malkin are stars. Yet in spite of that, Miro Satan and Matt Cooke are hardly answers.  They need to get Gonchar back. It will make that much of a difference. Just look at Tampa. They rid themselves of Dan Boyle and now learn of how hard it can be to move the puck.  And lets not forget Malone, Laraque,Ruttu,Hossa are all playing in other destinations.|`|JsnBTipMaa	Fans are focusing on the Super Bowl. It's about priorities.|`|Fn2emLisaa	Crosby turned them into make-up wearing whiny little girls.  Everyone says Sidney Crosby is a baby because:  -He takes a penalty and starts crying in the box  -He barely gets touched and falls down just to be able to cry to the ref   -He can't defend himself  -He gets touched and goes crying to the ref saying it should be a penalty    Sorry I'm an Ovechkin fan that hates Crosby if you couldnt tell.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	All of the above. Coach is clueless.. They have turnedinto a one line team. Your team should not crumble with a single defensman being out. They lost a lot of heart in the off season, mainly because I think the guys that left, saw the writing on the wall.|`|rMOQ9xe9aa	i think they need to step up their offence. they need to take more shot at the goal. i think that would help tremendously. and they need to get up some team spirit, mojo, whatever you want to call it. you just don't see much fierce play from them.    and we need to get off the crosby kick. he's not the answer to all problems. sure he's a good player but there's no I in TEAM. the fans always expect a goal from crosby and malkin and that's unrealistic. i can't stand the fans that only pay attention when crosby or malkin come on|`|C0q5CvjYaa	The Maple Leafs, no defence nor a puck moving defencemen and lousy goaltending!|`|l6ngwDX3aa	their fans are fake.  they only chose to root for the team when they acquired Sissy Boo-Boo Crosby.  fake fans equals crappy team.

8Sw8rJgtaa	Yes Ali was overrated,just watch his fights and not just the highlights.Ali's popularity is due to the boxing jounalists sports writers and other media.He talked with them and gave them every thing they wanted,he made for great story.Liston was hated and didn't like the press so in turn they couldn't wait for him to lose.Nobody could make money off Liston as champ especialy the mob so they got rid of him.Ali was media friendly and that goes a long way in boxing.Most of the people that talk about how great he was only know Ali or don't have as good of knowledge of boxing as they think.The guys he fought were not that impressive as people think,mostly flashy head hunters who were made for t.v. at least in the second part of his career.He fights Doug Jones and he was clearly beaten but he gets the gift decision.He needed Angelo Dundee to cheat to get by Henry Cooper.Liston obviously threw his fights.Ali should thank the mob for those wins and the title.He beats Cleveland Williams who had been shot a few months earlier and was basically still recovering,Williams was a shell of him self and had lost weight.Ali went the distance and came close to losing to George Chuvalo,who is tough but nothing special.Zora Folley was old,Quarry was undersized for the division,Bonavena was nothing special and took him 15.Floyd Patterson hurt his back so bad he could barely move and it still took Ali 12rds.Ali said he was trying to punish Patterson but truth is he couldn't finish him.Foreman was just a puncher and didn't know how to pace himself,Ali took advantage of that,it was easy.Frazer was much smaller but Eddie Futch knew how to beat him and did.The next two fight were very close.Ken Norton beat him in their first fight but was robbed bad in the next two.This doesn't sound like the greatest to me,sounds more like he had a lot of help along the way.People just see what they want to see,say something enough times and people will start believing it.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Believe it or not ALI is a bit over rated.  However, if you bring everything into prospective and down to reality, it's still difficult to envision ANY of the champions beating him at his best in ONE fight.  <br>  <br>  Both ALI and Rocky Marciano are probably the two most over rated champions in the sense that fans of both tend to think it's impossible for either to lose against any other champion.  That is not the case.  However, their respective greatness can't be questioned.  <br>  <br>  What I mean by this is simple.  NONE of the champions in ANYONE's Top 10 would go undefeated in a series of fights.  If there is any accurate way to judge how the champions rate against each other, you'd have to consider more than one fight between any two champions you might compare.<br>  <br>  A good example:  George Forman would beat Joe Frazier 5 out of 5 times.  However, I have always maintained that Frazier would have performed better against Forman had he never fought ALI first.  He was NOT the same fighter after the first ALI fight, even though he won.<br>  <br>  Larry Holmes' claim DOES bare some validity.  In a series of fights with the TOP 10,  ALI would lose less frequently than any other champion on the list but he DOES stand a chance of taking a loss.  <br>  <br>  Holmes firmly believes he would beat every champion, each fighter being at Prime.  Know what?  That's not far from the truth.  While I place him Third, behind ALI and Joe Louis,  it's very possible that Holmes would win 1 of 3 against ALI.  It's also possible that he would win 1 of 3 against Louis.<br>  <br>  I rank Lennox Lewis 4th, behind Holmes.  However, it's possible that he would have a good chance to beat one of those ranked above him on my list.   In fact,  I don't see Louis having an easy night against Lennox.  <br>  <br>  ALI is a bit over rate in that he is not THAT far above the rest.  However, he's Still above the rest.  He's still The GREATEST|`|vEczORE3aa	Ali is a little bit overated, it's because what he did outside the ring that made him overated.<br>  He didnt stay undefeated....<br>  Rocky Marcianio is the most overated boxer ever!!<br>  He fought a bunch of nobodies and an old Joe walcott and an old Joe louis, still both of these guys, esspecially Walcot almost destroyed marciano.<br>  If Marciano had 1 loss, people would say: Who the hell is Marciano?<br>  He also didnt fight much, if he just kept boxing for a few years, he would have met Liston, and then it's game over for Rocky.|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	well, Ali's opponents list was quite impressive to me as compared to Holmes's. Liston, Frazier, and Foreman plus any other tough guys  are very attactive on any W in anyones career.<br>  military draft aint the issue...<br>  religion aint definitely the issue...<br>  these has nothing to do in boxing.<br>  <br>  i say Holmes is a great player and he has a point, every analyst supposed that if Holmes shared the same era with Ali and in their prime, Ali wouldnt be in his place right now. but thats a big IF, rightfully i have to disagree about Ali being overrated.|`|mUD24W2Baa	He was overrated in that people nowadays talk about him like he could never lose a fight.  Usually in the hypothetical realm:<br>  <br>  Q:  Could "such and such" boxer beat Ali? <br>  A:  No! No way!  Ali was the greatest.<br>  <br>  He MAY have been the greatest heavyweight of all time.  It's a valid opinion.  But he was not unbeatable.|`|acaAycEXaa	Yes. He was a media creation that lost a lot of fights that he officially won. Ali had many flaws. His jab was very soft because he didn't set his feet and was jabbing moving backwards. He had no defense to his body, etc.<br>  Holmes knew about all of it because he was his sparring partner.<br>  <br>  I still can't understand why so many people get all weepy about Ali. Dude was a coward who wouldn't fight for his country!|`|LYmKPP5Oaa	ask any expert they'll tell u the best heavy's ever are<br>  <br>  mohamed ali                       and<br>  joe louis|`|KMk4nuFeaa	if u really think about it, everyones a little overrated. just some are more overrated than others|`|M6uIbKXRaa	know what ali was the best cause he could fool u with his mind he is the best always will be|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I think so. Half the time when people are talking about how great he is they mention how he didn't go to the war... BUT what does that have to do with boxing? I mean as person you have to respect the guy for standing up for what he believed in but how does that make him a great fighter??<br>  <br>    I always hear about the "rope a dope" but how can that make anybody great? The guy cheated and had some of his guys loosen up the ropes so he could pull it off effectively yet somehow he is worshiped for cheating?<br>  <br>     The guy was the greatest at hyping himself up thats for sure! He screamed it outloud like a crazy person to the point that everyone with a small brain just fell for it.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	he is the most accomplished heavyweight champion, but won't say the greatest. he kinda has that MJ option, where no one will ever be as good as you, no matter how good they are, because they didn;t accomplish what MJ accomplished.  I think that the problem is that people feel that the greatness is equal to greatest. he was a little bit overrated.|`|DFshzoJkaa	Ali is HIGHLY overrated.  I have more respect for Larry holmes than I do Ali, and consider him a better fighter than Ali.   Ali is a friggin' draft dodger who was disloyal to his friends and people who helped him.  He turned on his best friend Malcolm X, and bit the generous and gracious hand of Joe Frazier (and calling him an Uncle Tom, when Frazier was NOT). Supposedly a strict Muslim, Ali cheated on all his wives (with white women too). He was married 4 TIMES and his daughter Laila said,  "My father was never there for me."  THAT should tell you something about his TRUE character.  And, just because Ali CLAIMED himself to be the greatest, doesnt make it so.  But when the press and fans hear him constantly say that, they start to think its true.  Running around the ring, laying on the ropes til your opponent gets tired, and mouthing off the entire time, doesnt make for a GREAT fighter.  In the ring, Ali's fighting style was to be a slickster and a con artist..... just like his FRIEND Don King.  But look at Ali now.  He can't speak a word. How prophetic!!!|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	He was early in his career the fastest heavyweight of all time.  A noted athlete and physical specimen.  I often remember announcers saying what a great wide receiver in football he would have made.  As far as religious issues and not going into service Ali gave up his job for over 3 years.  It took away his movement and as other answerer's on this forum have said in the past he spent more time showing how much punishment he could take instead of trying to avoid it when he returned.  That was his choice to avoid service and he was cleared by the U.S. Supreme Court.  He didn't go to Canada he faced an issue and it's over with and it's 42 years old.  He will never be forgiven by some no matter how long it goes.  Is he overrated as a boxer?  Ray Robinson is the greatest boxer of all time.  Ali is about 7th all time on my best boxer list he isn't number one but is in the top 10.  That isn't the greatest but is pretty good.  He beat Liston, Foreman.  Two of the baddest boxers of all times.  They were like puppets.  No one ever made them look so bad.  Ali was a special performer much greater than boxing.|`|AA10092510	As a boxer he may have been over rated, but that's only because of his popularity. If your not popular you don't have a chance to be over rated.<br>  As a man he was not over rated because he single handily did more for sports than anyone.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Larry Holmes is probably the only boxer that says what he thinks and believes.

vSxhLvMVaa	I think if the Cards manage a win three things will happen. He will retire and hand over the reigns to Leinart, which means the Cards will suck again. Thirdly, Warner will then get into the Hall of Fame, especially if he does win the MVP again. That means he would have two season MVPs and two Super Bowl MVPs. I am not saying he would be a first ballot, but would probably get in during his second or third attempt. Otherwise, he would be the only player in history to win so many awards and not get in.    And on top of his accomplishments is just his story and the way he lives his life. He is the classiest guy in the NFL and one of the classiest ever. That never hurts ones chances.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	warner is probably in the "pro football hall of fame" regardless of this win or loss.|`|kikLXP4saa	they will not win but   yes i think he alredy will be a hall of famer and i think hes going to retire win or lose|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	even without this SB and its MVP is almost guaranteed  a HOF spot|`|Uwad1Irmaa	no that just makes him a longshot fringe candidate, a 3rd super bowl trophy is what he'd need to assure that, with how long he was a backup|`|8Kn3vbwDaa	He is already in. No worries. It might take a while to get in but I think he will eventually get in.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I do not even consider him a really good QB.  He is an above average QB who had 3 really good season.  He has spent the majority of 4 season (in total) on the bench in the middle of his career.  Sorry but those are not attributes of a really good NFL QB.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	If Warner wins he's in. If he doesn't win they'll probably let him in but make him wait a couple of years.    Gotta Love the guys that say Warner only had 3 - 4 'good' seasons, and for that he should be excluded from the HoF. A "good" season is, for example, what Eli Manning had this year. Kurt Warner's best seasons were great seasons (record breaking).     Before someone excludes Warner from Hall of Fame consideration I'd like to see them justify some of the other QB's, which are already in the HoF i.e. Fouts, Moon, Namath, and Steve Young...    Warner's previous 2 SB appearances are the 2 most yards thrown by a QB in SB's. Win or lose he'll probably put up decent yards in SB  43.    Warner achieved 25K yards in only 1 more game than Marino.    Warner is 2nd or 3rd in career passer rating. Young & Manning make up the balance of the top 3. How 'bad' could Warner have been to maintain that.    Warner has led 2 previously moribund teams to the SB. I think people need to take a step back and look at that accomplishment. No one else has done that. Before someone says, "what about Craig Morten and Earl Morrall," The Cowboys, Colts, Dolphins, and even Denver weren't down in the doldrums like The Rams and the Cards were before Warner showed up.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	he's HOF either way    he has great  's    In the NFL playoffs, Warner led the Rams to a Super Bowl XXXIV victory against the Tennessee Titans. He threw for two touchdowns and a Super Bowl record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play.     Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception.  Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP, becoming one of only six players to win both the league MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards in the same year.    Second Highest Completion Percentage, Career (Min. 1500 attempts) - 65.75%    Highest Average Passing Yards Per Game, Career (Min. 100 games) - 261.2 yards/game    Most Yards Passing, Super Bowl - 414 yards vs. Tennessee Titans (only QB to pass for 400+ yards in the Super Bowl; also owns 2nd highest yardage total in Super Bowl with 365 against the New England Patriots)    Highest Rate of Games w/300+ Yards Passing (Min. 100 games played) - 45.2% (47/104)    Most Consecutive Games w/300+ Yards Passing - 6 (tied w/Steve Young and Rich Gannon    Most Games with a Perfect Passer Rating, Career (regular season only) - 3 (tied w/Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger)    Only NFL quarterback to throw 40 touchdowns and win a Super Bowl in the same season (1999).|`|xPXUzZiJaa	he probably go to the hall of fame but I consider him as a great QB

gzRZlfpLaa	It probably will be a blowout.    BTW friendly stranger, actually there have been quite a few boring superbowls in the last 10 years. The Steelers last SB was boring,gay and BS.The Raiders-TB Sb was afully boring as well. The other one that comes to mind would be the Ravens win over NYG. I found it awsome, thats just cause I like the ravens. Other ppl find it one of the most boring|`|bTXDb5YIaa	Steelers to me haven't been playing their game of football like they used to me because they scores have been really close lately except for the bengals they just beated them|`|tWUQU4Juaa	It's going to be a lot closer than some people think . I think that the Cardinals will at least get a field goal .|`|ZA6A2adbaa	o shut up!!!!!! then dont watch it!!! this game is gonna be amazing!! 1st time in the superbowl baby!! ya!!!! if u lived in arizona u would be going crazy!!!! i kno i am!!!!    GO CARDINALS!!!|`|5jIdcbyYaa	It will just be like the bears vs colts. BORING....|`|xt4vcVIiaa	It could be because of your said reasons.    But it shouldn't be a blowout, two touchdown win is the maximum I'd give to either team.|`|AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 49-Steelers 9. , MVP: Warner|`|XLXncQu9aa	I highly doubt the super bowl will be boring.  Its the super bowl.  Has a super bowl ever been boring?  I don't think it will be a blow out by any means, and even if it were I would enjoy every moment of it because its the super bowl and we get to watch two of the greatest teams in the NFL this season duke it out. I doubt it will be a blow out.  What you do say about their offense and defense is correct.  However, both teams want to win but only one can win.  This is for the title.  It will be a close one.  The Arizona offense may be potent, but some how the Steeler defense will slow them down some.  The only way it would be a blow out on the Cardinals side is if Fitzgerald gets loose and I don't see that happening so quickly.  I think it will be a close game.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No, it will be close.|`|Y43nptlvaa	Never assume a game is done like the Patriots did.. Enough said

aDNdND6oaa	Bushmaster or Colt|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I have a RR lower with LMT upper. Perfection is all I have to say.|`|g4Dxlklxaa	If you have a couple thousand lying around... Ge a Noveske. If not, get a Bushmaster, Colt or a Rock River Arms (RRA). Double Star is a good company, never heard of Smoke Ent,  DPMS is decent, but their parts' metallurgy doesn't hold up to certain tolerances, especially in the cold.    Like the other guy said, all these parts ar Mil-spec (miltary specifications), so if you buy a Bushmaster, then decide to get a fancy new part made by DPMS, yes, it will fit.     The only recommendation I would make is to get an A3 upper. It is more flexible for whatever you want. FYI, the upper is top half of the rifle, barrel, where the bolt goes, the handle, etc. The LOWER is where the serial number is, the handle, trigger, buttstock, etc. An A1 upper is the old Vietnam era kind. They're not common, so don't worry about it. The A2 upper has the handle permanently attached, so if you want a scope, you have to mount it to the handle. An A3 upper has a removable handle, so if you want, you can unscrew the handle and put whatever you want on.     If you are looking for a SHTF gun, less is definitely more... All that tactical crap costs money, makes your gun heavy, and isn't all that useful if you know what you're doing. Flashlights and lasers give up your position, plus extra batteries adds extra weight. If you think you'll save money buying cheapo stuff made in China, it's like buying a Mercedes and putting plastic spinners on it... You messed up quality with junk.    You'd be much better off saving that money and getting a good quality scope, which can cost as much (if not MORE) than you paid for the gun in the first place. Trijicon ACOGs, Eotechs and Aimpoints are all standard fare and run no less than $400.     Right now, EVERYTHING will be expensive. Black rifles like ARs and AKs are evil and scary looking to Liberals, and right now we have the biggest liberal alive in the White House. Good luck!!!!|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Pretty much any of them except Olympic Arms as I have heard horror stories from such loose tolerances that the gun would never function properly.  Some of the better and more recognizable names are: BushMaster, DPMS, Colt, Rock River, Remington and Double Star.  Any one of them is pretty much identical to the others because they are all required to meet the same mil-spec.  You can take parts from one AR-15 and put them on another.  They all use the same design parameters, pin placements, screw threads, hole pattern, etc, etc, etc.  You can take a Bushmaster Upper and mate it to a DPMS lower and have the same gun as a Colt Upper on a Rock River Lower.    Just go with the one you like, at the right price for you when it becomes available at the right time.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	I am a long time military competition shooter - I have been building match AR's and using them since 1973.    Be sure you buy it from a gun shop - and you get the box and warranty card.  All the major name brands also sell stripped lower receivers for about $105 and 20 months ago people started to stock pile them.  Some of these people are cashing in on the recent AR demands by adding cheap $300 parts and selling the finished kit guns as $1500 to $1800 factory guns.  They do not fit right, shoot right, and most gun shops will not take one of them in for trade or even sell on consignment.    You need to stick with a name brand to make any money from it in the future.  Olympia, Bushmaster, or Colt - these are the rifles that will be in demand when a ban happens.  All the other 18 companies guns won't appreciate like the top 3.    Lasers and flashlights will only give away your positon and get you killed.  They look cool - but are totally useless.    You want an A2 upper with a carbine M4 contour barrel.  The A2 sight is much better than the A1 and it works great for NRA Highpower Rifle competition.  The carbine barrel is easy to handle, compact, and does not get in the way. You can sight and fire quick and shoot straight. This is the upper you want for doomsday.    If you really want to prepare for doomsday - after you buy an AR with A2 upper - invest in the 22 long rifle conversion kit and some Black Dog Manufacturing aftermarket 29 round mags for it. Next - get a 223 cal suppressor - you will be truly amaized firing your AR with the 22 conversion, subsonic ammo, and suppressor - this is real doomsday killing gun.  (223 suppresor also does 22lr, 22 Hornet, 17HMR, 221 Bee, 222 Rem and the new FN 5.7x28mm)      The only guys who like a scope on the AR are varmint shooters and hunters.  Take a peek at the BSA "Sweet 223" scope - this is a nice scope if you want to go this route.  It is no Leupold, but, it is a lot more functional than a Leupold.  I have several nice Leupold scopes in my safe that are spares - yet I still put a Sweet 223 on one of my uppers.    Get the A2 upper first and be happy with it.  Later on if you want to invest in a scope - get a new upper with an A3 flat top and put a 20" match barrel or similar lengh.  You will find that a scope on a 16" carbine barrel isn't much fun or use beyond 250 yards.  Frustrating is a better word.    Feel free to email me any AR-15 questions.  I own every tool they ever made to assemble this rifle and all the manuals and pubs.

He was averaging double double and tonight he was getting into the rhythm again but unfortunately he was hurt on the Kobe Bryant play, damn it. But after Bynum is hurt, the Lakers should put L.

g4Dxlklxaa	Two things... Easy way number one is to look it up on youtube. They have schematic animation of guns firing. Not super great, but decent. Secondly, you can call up almost any gun manufacturer and ask them for an owner's manual. It will list every part, what it's called, the works.     HOWEVER... The best way is to take a safety course and go shooting for yourself. It's one thing to read , "The Ejector projects the spent casing out of the firing chamber" but when you fire a gun and see empty shells poppong out the gun, you'll know for dam sure what and ejector does.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Go to www.midwayusa.com and take a gander at the different reference books they have.

1jPiAkP4aa	Well, the worst case is that a severely loose bearing will cause the front wheel to wobble around and could make you crash. Generally speaking though, the thing you need to worry about is that the bearings will wear out to the point where they will actually disintegrate, and cause to front wheel would seize up, again, this could cause you to crash.<br>  <br>  In order to tighten them you need a couple of special flat wrenches called 'cone' wrenches, available at any bike shop. You'll need to take the wheel with you to make sure you get the right size.<br>  <br>  When you tighten the bearing, it should be snug enough so that the wheel spins smoothly but there is no 'play' or looseness. If you feel or hear grinding when you spin the wheel, it's too tight.  This can be tricky, and should really be checked by someone with experience

I have never seen a team that good an im 32 and have been watching the NFL for over 20 years.  It was like that Pats team were playing against a high school team each week.  People forget that the Pats were one dropped Asante Samuel interception away from winning that Super Bowl.  If they played the Giants 10 times, New England would have won 8 out of 10 of those times.  The best team doesnt always win.  The Rams were a much better team then the Pats team they lost to in the Super Bowl years back.  You want another example.................................... the Cardinals win tomorrow, they still wont get credit as being the best team in the NFL. They wont. Pittsbugh fans will still be in here saying they are the best team.  If my life was on the line an I had to pick a team to win to stay alive, without even blinking an eye its that 07 Pats team.  If we are talking one team overall, its the Cowboys.  They have more wins since 1960 (when they became a team) then Pittsburgh or the Niners.  Been to more Super Bowls and much more. I wont get into the stats. Its all right online|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	This isn't the BCS. In the NFL if you want to be the best, you have to beat the best, and the Patriots didn't do that.    Doesn't matter how many regular season games you won, if you don't have the ring, you weren't the best team that year.

AsU4lK0Baa	To get faster you have to practice a lot, you have to do hard work even when you don't want too. Let's See i live in West Virginia, and Last Week, We Had A SNOW STORM! As you could have seen on the News or Yahoo News, and I was Off School For ONE FULL WEEK. Meaning Sat. - Sun. - Mon. - Tues. - Wed. - Thurs. - Fri. - Sat. - and Today. No school, and there was Snow and Ice Everywhere. And It has been FREEZING COLD! But did that stop me from working hard? Running outside?? No it didn't. Most Athletes I know, Stayed inside and kept cosin and warm while i was out there busting my butt. This is when it counts. Whenever you don't feel like running you put on your shoes and go run.    You Work hard but Is What your doing for your events Smart??  Do you think running 3 miles will help your 300m sprint time? Prob. not maybe a little. It depends on How good of Shape your in..To get faster you have to do speedwork & Weightlifting. That is one way to get faster, but there is another way, more effective than the way i just said, you can Train Slower to Race Faster. When you run the 400m how many runners do you see that are 1st place at the start and then last place at the finish?? A-lot. The reason for is because, Most 400m runners, run that backstretch without a Reserve. Meaning No energy, why?? because they used all of it already in the beginning of the race. You have to build a reserve. Start out with the 200m Workout. Do 200m slow maybe around a 32-34 second pace, but do 12 of them with only 1 minute and 30 seconds rest in between each one, and it's a different story. When your down with those 12, it will feel like you just ran a 400m all out. Then the next time you do it. do 200m in 27-28 seconds for 7-8 of them with 2-3 minutes rest in between. because if your body is in good enough shape to run the same pace at 27 seconds easily then you should be running 55-58 in the 400m. You see you have to workout smart. Im going to run right now, message me later and i will send you more. ok.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	If your coach says that you did a good job, then you did a good job, but it also takes practice until you get good.|`|oidfmtnYaa	How long have you been doing track? Even if you train your *** off, it will take time to develop and get faster. But if you are determined, it will take year round commitment.     I started my freshman year with cross country and track year round and didn't get good enough to be competitive until now (my junior year). Ever since then I have only been increasing my miles, intensity, and strength training. I run all summer long. I workout everyday of the week during the season except for the days I have a meet. After runs I go and lift weights at my school. Between the end of last year and the beginning of this one I have gotten very serious about being competitive and it has really gotten to me at times. I would go out and do insane workouts and wear myself out to feel satisfied.     This year I hadn't run one time that I was satisfied with. I got sick and was so depressed that I just stopped training for a week straight. The day before my next race I went out and did three miles with my team, that was it. At the meet I didn't even care anymore. I just went out and ran like I would when I was out on runs by myself pushing the pace, determined to get faster. And I wound up running 22 seconds better (in the two mile). I placed third in the second heat of the county meet. Some of the kids I beat were real legit runners.     After that I realized that all it is is just racing. It means nothing. It just about who's faster. Why do we do it? Because of the competition. But that's all. You can't let it get to you. Were not all gonna break records and get college scholarships. If you do, fine. If you don't, whatever. Try your best, but don't come up with all these goals that are gonna drive you crazy. Just let things happen. You should still train hard, but don't think much about it when you are not.     My goal when I train is to get as fast as I can.    When I race: To go as fast as I can.    When I am doing neither: To not worry and just have fun.
YPQTXOQ5aa	I think it is good, but I would have 16 teams in the playoff. Every major conference winner (11) and then use the BCS for the five at-large teams. I think that you need to get rid of the pre-season rankings.|`|wxXguyK3aa	After watching bowl season last season, I realized that I actually like it.  I think a playoff system would ruin college football, but I don't totally agree with the BCS.<br>  I heard of a solution where both sides would be satisfied:<br>  Have FIVE (not four) major BCS bowl games, and teams get in them the usual way, but then the BCS takes the best two teams out of the five winners and send them to the National Championship.  I like this because there would be less questioning whether a team deserved the NC or not.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Easiest solution:<br>  <br>  -- As soon as the regular season ends, take the top 8 ranked teams and have two rounds of playoffs. This can all be wrapped up by the end of November.<br>  <br>  -- The six teams that lost in the playoff round get automatic bids to three of the BCS bowls.<br>  <br>  -- The two remaining teams go to the fourth BCS bowl to play for the national championship. <br>  <br>  -- The title game gets rotated among one of the four BCS bowls in a four-year cycle. That way, nobody loses any bowl games, and the "BCS National Championship Game" is history, as the title game goes back to an actual bowl.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I like a lot of these answers!  To add my $.02, The BCS uses "tradition" as leverage.  If that's true, why has teams other than the Big 10 and Pac-10 allowed to play in the Rose Bowl (Texas)?  Why are they in talks to allow ANY team to play in it?  <br>  <br>  The Big 10 is the main reason for no playoff in college football.  They want to remain relevant, even though times are pretty tough for them.  That's why I don't understand wanting to open up the Rose Bowl for other teams.  Why run the risk of losing out on their best bowl game (other than going to another BCS bowl or BCS Title Game)?  If a team can't qualify for the Rose Bowl, what else is there?  <br>  <br>  The best they can do, especially if they want to go this route- is ditch "tradition" and make a playoff- I like the 11 conferences plus 5 wild cards (great idea!).  If ND is in the top 16, they should get an automatic invite... if not- screw 'em... join a conference already.|`|sBrYcT5daa	the BCS ranking is biased. Playoffs would be great, but I think there would have to be a total change regarding the team schedules. BCS will always rank big schools over small ones. In my opinion, the whole system should be changed. Why not having 8 conferences and each team will play twice against the other conference teams. No games against other conferences. Then pick the top 2 teams of each conf and start a playoffs.|`|J6grdba3aa	the elimination of the pre-season rankings is a great idea. unless something drastic happens the top teams don't change that much. im not a huge fan of a college playoff idea, but something needs to change.|`|acaAycEXaa	I agree that pre-season rankings are B.S. The media darling teams are always overranked.<br>  That said, there won't be a playoff.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	BCS is great I have no Issue with the BCS but Utah should got the NC  they went 13-0! The Gators lost to Ole miss at Home I'm a Alabama fan all the way!|`|KNTofuxMaa	They should wait until the completion of week 3 to issue rankings, IMO. Having said that, There will be no "playoff" in college. Maybe a plus one.

AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|3oUSroiZaa	I think I have amnesia.|`|RtQaCYUuaa	Steelers are going to win you, their defense is ranked number 1 on pass and rush and most points allowed in one game.|`|8MmtBYlLaa	Steelers! |`|NS2Cz6Vmaa	steelers, i hope|`|UNLrYNeUaa	cardinals, whisenhunt was on the last steelers superbowl team and he'll know what to expect from them, the cards defense will be all over rothlisberger,I think the steelers are going to have their hands full, the cardinals will win by at least 10|`|7Sk7c4IAaa	CARDINALS!!!!!|`|YwdrvGfnaa	Steelers... by 6 points|`|haP5zj8Aaa	steelers all the way

The barrel wont warp from the heat, making it last longer and it keeps its accuracy. They are held at a temp of -300 degrees for about 24 hours. It changes the structure of a barrel ( the molecules) so it becomes very smooth and reduces friction.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	The science behind it is that the extreme cold temperatures chance the molecular structure of the metal, causing the fibers to line up; thus eliminating the barrel whip harmonics between  cold barrel and a warm one that has had a few rounds sent down range.  There has not really been any substantial scientific testing done to prove the validity of it but there are those that swear by it and others that swear at it.....only you can choose if it is right for you.

He seems to lose that awesome serve that is so fearsome and effective against his opponents.|`|2SRIv128aa	Top athletes can be at their best forever, most reach their peak in low to mid twentys, after that their body weakens.|`|NdTy3twjaa	Well he is getting older, he is going to be 27 this year so it's all downhill from here.  Unless your Andre Agassi of course.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Well you cant expect him to serve at over 250 kmph forever. He is getting older (in tennis years) and is bound to slow down. Still he regualarly serves around 220-230 kmph range. That is quite a mean feat in itself. Not many players even in their youth doesnt serve that fast.|`|2ZroO3Xxaa	Andy is still serving huge, maybe his average is 2 or 3 mph slower, this may be due to the fact that his new coach requested that he lose 10-15 pounds to help his footwork and stamina for long matches, which is why he made a decent run in the aussie open.  The tiny change may be because he has a few less pounds behind the ball but with his technique it doesnt make any difference really|`|nKWK8sKsaa	nooo..he is still getting to 210kmph regularly

4gZYucHMaa	Pain in the knees is quite normal -really--<br>  <br>  it's your body building up it's muscle and bc it's not used to getting used so much of course they're going to be sore. Plus running is high impact and hard on the knees as it is.<br>  <br>  When I first started I had knee problems too, I thought I had leg muscles and was in shape however I am using different muscles so there's more strain on them.<br>  <br>  I went to my fam doc and he told me to take a pain relief (which I didnt) but I also used a knee brace until my knees built up strength and so far I'm now 3 months without needing it and in the middle of winter when my knees don''t get to warm up as much as I'd like<br>  <br>  Give it time. It's just your knees needing to be built up, most of us get that.|`|5XnSNPRraa	Hi there.  I had pain in my knees when I started also.  I actually went and bought knee supports and now I dont use them.  My knees just got used to the pounding and im fine now.  It took a few weeks but my knees and shins do not bother me a bit anymore.  Maybe you should give it some time.|`|zNnW2TxHaa	Most importantly, be aware of your form. Run on your tip toes, that way, your knee is never in front of your toes on impact. Also, taking a liquid glucosamine for joint/cartilage health is always good. But form is everything.|`|6f45797c9517e54511512714a28d3760aa	Usually best to go see your regular doctor first. They can then refer you to a physio if necessary.
LIKkt8djaa	You should be fine with a normal in the 25 waist width region.|`|Z42d3oW9aa	i have 12's too and ride a regular width 156 at +15 and -15, but realistically any angle bigger than 10 degrees on a normal width board and you won't be dragging as long as your boots/bindings are centered in relation to your toe and heel edge.
GFHzhnnTaa	Piece of cake, as far as power/penetration is concerned.  As stated previously by others, it's a matter of  shot-placement. Any animal can be easy to kill if it's hit right, & can be pretty tough if it's hit wrong. I've shot dozens of deer, (up to 220 lbs/100 kilos), completely through, as well as a similar   of wild/feral boar, (500 lbs/200 kilos),with a 60-70 lbs setup with no problem. (& pigs are big boned & fairly stout.)  Any modern compound bow, say 50 's or more, (with sharp broad-heads), will do the trick. Try to avoid the shoulder bones for example. A shot thru the ribs, tight BEHIND the shoulder, (if he's on all 4's) should make for a short tracking job.  Good luck !|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	They've killed elephants and kodiak bears with a bow.  I don't think that a kangaroo is quite as big or dangerous.  I've seen huge bull elk drop within 10 - 15 steps after being hit.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	Yes.  with good shot placement, not too far, because your effectively cutting the roos breath, so it's about as long as a roo can hold it's breath, but a heart shot will really hurt, maybe 50 meters, if it goes farther, you did something wrong.|`|WKrQCrUiaa	I don't know about the legality of it but practicality is absolutely you could kill a kangaroo with a bow. As far as how far it would run depends on your shot placement. A good double lung shot and it won't go more then a hundred yards.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	Yep, and It would depend on the shot placement .|`|wxL5MRz7aa	yup can take a roo with a compound bow.  if you do a crit hit (heart, lungs) then hey may not run to far 100 yards or so.  otherwise, be prepaired for a track.

pzw00XOhaa	biking.. you can do a lot of different types of riding, like BMX mt biking, racing bmx, and road racing.  Then there are even more sub categories like dirt jumping, freeride, XC, downhill, bmx racing, etc.  It's also much safer than skateboarding because you are less likely to wipe-out as a novice.  But when you get good and get to tricks its probably just as dangerous as skateboarding.  And cops hate you if you skateboard.  I'd mountain bike if i were you... its a lot of fun. watch some videos on youtube.  The only downside to biking is that it costs much more once you get into the high quality bikes (into the thousands but you dont have to worry about that now, I, personally, ride a $500 gt Avalanche mt bike.|`|PXkvDyYwaa	I skateboard and ride BMX and MTB bikes.

So if I get bored or can't land a trick right, I hop on the other to clear my mind. Then, I try it again later.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Bicycling.  This is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned.    i can ride for fun, exercise, running errands, and commuting.   I have ridden on bicycle tours in Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, Ontario Canada, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I did a three week tour from Seattle to San Francisco.  Rode along the coast.  Try that on a skateboard.  I have watched a kid trying to do tricks on his skateboard for two years.  Still can't do anything.  What a waste of time.|`|kMPWEI61aa	I personally like skateboarding better, but bicycling can be equally fun.|`|q5fZFJGtaa	First off,  if you need to get somewhere relatively fast a bicycle is better than a skateboard.

bvnzv923aa	You are not going to be in a freestyle level yet. But you are not learn to skate either... I'm not quite sure what type of rink yours is (ISI or USFSA) so it might help if we knew one or two of the levels. I think it's ISI, (freestyle is ISI and I think that learn to skate is too) but I'm not quite sure. I would get a hold of a coach or someone at the rink, come up during a public session and show them what you can do. They could then tell you what level to enroll in.   Best of luck :)|`|ttbho89Vaa	if ur rink is ISI you will be entering at the pre-alpha level. here is a link that has all the levels and stuff for ISI...:http://www.paradefsc.org/basic/levels.ht...    if ur rink is USFSA you will be entering at basic 1. it starts with basic 1 and stops at basic 8 and goes into diferent levels which are here:  http://www.cifsc.net/files/USFSA.htm|`|1dh5xbQ6aa	out of those options it would probably be learn to skate. because in learn to skate at least at my rink they rap basic 1-8 in to it. you learn things such as lunges, shoot the ducts, basic foot work and basic spins(one foot, two foot)|`|THyCWTMAaa	Assuming you are doing figure skating, I would enroll at Basic 4 or 5 (Learn to Skate). Since you're 17, you will most likely be able to get to freestyle soon!  That is only if you want to do group lessons!    I would think about getting a coach, they can detect where you are, and help you get to where you want to be.    Good luck!|`|AA10059877	I would suggest learn to skate.     Before I entered our figure skating club, 5 years ago, they had a requirement that you have to have previous lessons. At that time I could stop, stand, go backwards kinda, etc. & they put me in learn to skate for about a week and taught me the very basics that I would need before I joined the club. Then they moved me up and I was in basic 1. I'm not sure how your club works, so you may want to ask someone whos in that club, but I think you should go to learn to skate. It's not all about learning to stand up and just skate recreationally, but they have different groups and stuff.|`|R2MMXVtvaa	Since you are 17 you can probably enroll in an adult class for isi. They teach you the same things as in pre-alpha, alpha, and beta, but you are with people around your age or older. To be in freestyle you have to be able to do forward and backward crossovers,edges, three turns, mohawks, stuff like that.

They both are funny.|`|OnXX13yCaa	kenny schrader is someone i think would do a great job. he shows his humor when he gets put in the right situation and he is a true racers racer. he can show you the hilarious or the serious side of racing. add mikey waltrip and they seem like a comedy team with a serious agenda.|`|osN2GFY9aa	Yeah - I'd enjoy seeing Kenny Wallace have his own talk show.  He'd be great!    I'd also like to see Jeff Gordon in one.  He does great when he's on Regis and Kelli.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	Kyle Petty|`|2BRZy8Mfaa	Scott Speed for sure! He could top the Ellen Degeneres show in terms of funniness!|`|qQq23yziaa	Jeff gordon if it was not strictly a nascar show. He is bright and smart. I love Kenny Wallace though.

He is a hoot.  lol  Mikey too,  I like watching him on Monday nights.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i think Elliot Sadler. He could laugh at himself and make people feel at home. He has a very warm and like able personality and could do a cooking segment on Bologna Burgers! He is good at impressions and i think he could get people to open up to him.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I would watch a show with Kenny Wallace too. Jeff Burton would be good to. He is a no nonsense kinda guy and would tell it like it is.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Kenny Wallace... I agree 100%..  I'd love to see Kyle Petty share that show with him..  Both of them are hilarious, and are so honest that they give   away more "private" NASCAR secrets than everyone else put together..|`|AA11234673	Kenny, and Smoke would be great!  That would be Some show.  huh?

The Legends Golf Club - This is a 27 hole course. It was fascinating because every hole is a replication of a famous hole. Some of the notable ones: 1st and 9th at St. Andrews, 17th at TPC at Sawgrass, the 18th at Winged Foot, and my favorite, Amen Corner (11th, 12th, 13th) at Augusta National.<br>  <br>  These two courses are must plays.

oLq6og6Aaa	For one, it has the Zamboni logo, so it's definitely a Zamboni ice resurfacer (there are other manufacturers who make ice resurfacers).    Here are all the current Zamboni models, and the closest one looks like the Zamboni Model 552.  In your link, the logo is slightly higher and there are stripes on the white area - so not sure exactly what model that is.    http://www.zamboni.com/machines/machines...

1jPiAkP4aa	wow...."check the solder"? "loose handlebars"? "little spikey things"? <br>  <br>  What are you people smoking?<br>  <br>  You have a broken/frozen freewheel or free hub. The mechanism that connects the gears on the wheel to the hub is a ratchet system with spring loaded pawls. The pawls inside the ratchet have either broken off or are stuck so they don't engage. It's possible that , if it's a freehub, the retainer nut has come loose and the freehub body has slipped out of the wheel hub, but it isn't likely. <br>  <br>  If it's a freehub, You need a new wheel. If the pawls are broken, they can't be fixed. If they are frozen, you need special tools to disassemble the freehub body, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to get them clean of rust and crap so that it doesn't happen again. If the retaining nut has come loose, it's likely that the pawls and springs have fallen out.<br>  <br>  If it's a freewheel, you may be able to get away with replacing it. but it's possible that the freewheel is frozen to the hub as well, and you'll never get it off. So you'll need a new wheel then as well.<br>  <br>  Even if it's just a broken freewheel, you need special tools to get it off, and just hope it isn't a suntour two prong style - those _never_ come off.<br>  <br>  Take it to a bike shop. Someone needs to actually see this to diagnose it properly. Or you could just change the handlebars and hope for the best (wow.....)|`|Vs2rihU6aa	There's a ratchet in your rear wheel; something along the lines of this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sperrklinke_Schema.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sperrk...</a><br>  <br>  That's what allows your bike to coast when you stop pedaling; otherwise your pedals would turn any time your bike was moving.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your ratchet mechanism is either broken or seized.  Try spraying some oil into the center of the gear cluster to see if you can get the pawls (part B in the diagram) to start moving again.  Try from a few different angles, and try tapping the gears with a mallet or piece of wood.  If that doesn't work, you'll need to replace something:<br>  <br>  There are two main types of rear wheels; one type that has the ratchet attached to the gears and one type that has the ratchet attached to the wheel.  Take your bike to a bike shop, and depending on which type you have, they can either replace the gears or the wheel.|`|OmMVZsrMaa	The chain might be locked. Try taking it out (it might be a little oily) and put it back in.|`|bPYS077Raa	hmmm...your drive catch on the spindle is bust maybe?...your gears cant engage the wheel ...either that or your gears arnt attached to the wheel!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You have a broken freewheel and it needs replaced.   It takes a special tool to remove.  You will be better off taking the wheel to the bike shop and let them replace it for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/replace-freewheel/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/replace-freewhee...</a>|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	Listen to Madmonkey or Scott, as for the other answers, check the solder on your little spikey things because your handlebars are really loose.
AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|fawhiGtsaa	Steelers, because Steelers won the five Super Bowl titles. They played very good.|`|gDKIxwRSaa	Steelers.   They're Defense is beast. And it doesn't matter how good Fitzgerald is, because the Defense is gonna kill Warner and make him throw pick after pick. And, I have a good feeling about Big Ben and the Steelers offense.|`|vSxhLvMVaa	Cardinals.      Coach Whisenhunt  and Coach Grimm know everything about Rothlisberger. His strengths, weaknesses, tendencies. Plus their 3rd string QB backed up Big Ben. So he has been able to mimic him in practice. There is nothing he can or will do that they haven't seen.    Plus he knows the Defensive Coordinator for the Steelers, Dick Lebeau. Grimm and the Whiz went all out against him every week in practice for three years. Again, they know him like a book. And nothing ever changes with Lebeau. He has been running basically the same plays for 30 years.    Plus the Steelers strength offensively is the running game. If the Cards can get out to a quick lead like they have done throughout the Playoffs, the Steelers will have a hard time catching up. Their line gives up an average of 3 sacks per game. And the Cards D-Line has been leading the league in forced turnovers. Not a good combination.    The only chance the Steelers have is to get to Warner early and often.     Cards 21-18.|`|cc2a9fa95b895badd94cab1b2f6a808baa	Steelers - cardinals were having a lucky yr that's all and tomorrow will prove it    GO STEELERS|`|qouUjd7Raa	I have to go with the cardinals.   As long as i have been watching football the cardinals have always been on the loosing end.  They are the first real cinderella team and after all their misfortune of victory they really deserve this victory|`|h1OSKOLsaa	Don't care, not watching anyway.|`|kikLXP4saa	offense wins games defense wins championships    so the steelers will win all the have to do is cover fitzjerald and they will win because cardinals defense isnt that good    plus kurt warner cant move too much in the pocket so hell be getting sacked a couple of times    willi parker will have a good day with at least 120 yards    i dont think the cardinals will score too much (if they do score)  if the steelers defense plays like it has been playing they should win with no problems|`|M3uOu0giaa	I belive the steelers will win. I will think they will be a sure lock if the refs can call holding on the cardnials watch the eagles game. And Harrison,Woodley,Farrior and Larry Foote will destroy warner. Also people are saying about Wissenhunt and Grimm. They are leving out 1 key detail EVERY ONE ON THE STEELERS HAVE SEEN HIS OFFENCE AND LINE. Also about Fitzgerald well he didn't play dick labos defence or against troy polamalu and ryan clark and we have film of him from pittsburgh. need I go on?

ThdM0dNXaa	You mentioned a gym?  Do they have ellipticals?  They are great for an all around workout and you can pace yourself.  They also have numerous pre-programmed workouts.  I wouldn't worry too much about getting winded easily, it'll pass if you stick to the workouts quicker than you would think.  You will build stamina and endurance but sticking to a workout is obviously the key.  If your only available choices are the ones you listed I would have to say rotate to prevent monotony.  All of the exercises/activities you listed are good for cardio but jumping rope and running are constant and tennis and soccer involve stopping and going a lot.  On the other hand, soccer and tennis are more fun.  Good luck with everything.  You can do it!
Fl1MqgJRaa	there is [plenty] you can do to get ready. Stretch Stretch Stretch, you've got to be as flexible as you can. Also practice you facials in the mirror [yes you will look kind of funny, but that means your doing it  right] *~ number one NOT to do facial~* don't stick out your tongue, it comes across as snotty. Practice simple cheers as easy as "Let's go ______, Let's go!" Also jumps are key in cheerleading. Make sure you have a solid toe-touch and herkie. Also tumbling is also very good to have on your side. Make sure everything is solid! A tight round-off is worth more than a sloppy back-handspring.Finally sharp motions. Everything needs to be tight and sharp, this makes for a clean routine.                                                                                                          During Try-outs:  What to wear: solid color shorts, and solid color shirt.(avoid words and characters as much as you possibly can, turn a shirt inside out if you have to)    Hair: make sure your hair is up and pinned back. People like to see your bright and smiling faces, not your hair.    and MOST importantly, smile.. have fun. Cheerleading is one of those things you can't do unless you really want to do it and have fun.Use these tips and i know you will do great|`|7436ab316a7ba60a693bc4ea2b5cd373aa	do stretching umm practice any things they ask u 2 n have a lil cheer just in case they want u 2 do one on the spot.|`|1fGBLJvVaa	ok go to youtube it has lots of things like flipping tutorials      and strech learn the splits      mabey see if ur parents can put u in  a cheer camp over summer      hope it helps      :)

Ocala has numerous primitive spots that you can pitch a tent, its not Alaskan wilderness but you wont see anyone, you wont hear any traffic.  You can also hike in a pretty good distance to get a good hike out of it.  I wouldn't see a need to travel to Georgia or even SC for a good trip, unless you are in the very north of Florida.

DGIUaDLYaa	hey good question.  i personally play and i love the position  i'm only a sophmore starting jv i'm 5'8 180   and as a linebacker you need that balance of strength and speed.  first your size and strength seems to be really good  but the 40 time is little off  try getting faster like.. a 4.9 to 5 flat  yes its alot of time to cut off but hey you'll improve by trying hard.  and expect to get your time dropped in couple months when you try. also its hard to maintain the weight/strength as you get faster.so do everything you do right now, but try to watch what you eat, and also try to run more than you do in normal workouts. and its great to hear that you are the leader on the field, which is a great trait you need to play linebacker. also you need that FIRE in you to get the team pumped and make a great play. and you need that desire to make sure you lay some one out and make sure that the guy you tackled is scared to run the ball again on your side. be aggressive, and be smart. thats the key to playing a linebacker|`|gWleYSuIaa	do not fo?  apparently you have already had the prerequisite lobotomy|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	Just keep exercising and working on explosiveness. Do some squats, keep running, work on your hand technique for taking on blocks and basically playing from a 2 point stance. At D-line you are used to firing off from a 3 point, but you just have to be quick on your feet and have good balance at LB.|`|39mxsxvCaa	Join a football team|`|FPmSgMsNaa	did you get some sort of brain damage when you played football?|`|i81cQUyhaa	250 is good weight for Linebacker|`|hisgqFeIaa	Run 2-3 track laps a day. Eat only at three times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner(small). Before you go to sleep do 100 pushups, 100 crunches, and 40 dumbell curls. Stick to it and watch the results.|`|F6tMSEyGaa	If you are on a football team run more lift weights and lose weight.   important to rember heavy weights less reps= big muscles  light weights lots of reps= endurance  also dont lift the same every day   lifting rips your muscles to get big they grow back and heal so if you lift every day it wont heal giving you no muscle  repitition for definition,   hey check out my fave highschool linebacker Manti Teo look at the link  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNfwqYR6v...    good luck|`|CJjSGXepaa	all you need 2 is increase your speed don't eat as much lift weights and exercise that's it. i was a line backer nose tackle left guard tight end and punter.|`|qNf0A4V4aa	I played linebacker at 6 0 240. i wasnt fast, but i had a knack for being where the ball was and i LOVED to hit.
XZTwrn2Qaa	Butterfly kick on your back!|`|XCyvQl8maa	The Magic words DRY LAND!|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	dry land|`|YHtpB3wBaa	Get your self into a gym.  Doing various body weight (pull ups, dips) and free weight exercises (bench press, leg press) can really build some power.  The biggest areas to work on are your quads, calfs,  glutes, triceps, biceps, lats, pecs, shoulders, and most importantly core. Your local gym should have people to help you come up with a plan and the best exercises to start with.  If they don't, or you are using your school's weight room, talk to your coach, they should have plenty of good, swim specific, exercises.  You should be doing 6-8 reps of each exercise and if you get over 10, then you need more weight. This range of reps will give you the biggest strength and size gains.

3271d55c05b22f144699a128e1626d80aa	I just asked my wife your question....She was a college softball pitcher, and she said the same exact thing as "Utley for President" above....first your coach is dumb..and alternate heat / Ice for 15 mins each and take an advil....and dont do it again, at least not 2 hours.|`|GBtet3Jsaa	good question|`|gVYfFSpRaa	PITCHING FOR 2 HOURS STRAIGHT WILL KILL YOUR ARM.  Your coach is an idiot.  A lot of people think that girls can't throw their arm out because they pitch underhand, but it's not true.  If your coach ever makes you do that again, you need to talk to him and tell him that you're hurting your arm when you pitch that long.      But as for your soreness, ice is the best thing you can do for it.  You can try alternating heat and ice (use a heating pad for 15 minutes, then ice for 15 minutes, then repeat), and maybe take an Advil or Alleve.  You can try to stretch it out a little bit, but don't do too much- just maybe some arm circles and neck circles to ease out the pain.  It will take a while for the soreness to ease out, but good luck!  Hope I helped.
RjQLB9s1aa	There are numerous courts in Perth - many of which welcome people turning up & looking for a game. I guess it depends which part of Perth that you will be staying in to be able to answer the question completely. However, the favoured complex would be the State Tennis Centre at Burswood. Have a look on the internet & see what's on at the centre. There will be a contact number on the website, so that would be a great start point.    Alternately, you can look for a partner on Tennis Australia choosing Perth as a venue, & see what comes up.    If I was there on those dates, I would willingly have a "hit". Anyway. the best of luck with your search.

It will take time for you to get used to the pitching style, like instead of watching the shoulder for the ball, you'll watch the hips, and there are smaller dimensions, and it is a MUCH quicker game, baseball is all power, as to where softball is all speed.  Alltogether, I think you have a really good chance, it's not like you aren't going to be changing to like soccer or something, baseball and softball are a lot alike, so I think you will do fantastic!

But somewhere in there I started to get into working with people, first our church youth, then Boy Scouts.  Now I find  myself going back and teaching what I learned before.  I still pick up new skills, but I find less need to do that, because I am still using the old skills and learning new things about the old skills, because of questions or interests that some of my Scouts have raised.  Granted, its not the adrenalin rush that some of my adventures have been, but it is a different kind of a challenge.  Christ willing, this latest passion will take me 40 or 50 years, through the rest of my life.|`|2esGKO2Caa	maybe try something else besides walking the and fishing. Everyone gets bored with things sometimes. I know there's days when i hunt by myself and there are days i like to hunt with friends. Just happens; maybe your walking to much burning yourself out so bad that's it's not fun it's work.

WiIUEObTaa	there is a great instruction book. the very best ever written about any sport. please do not take offence, book available at library, or very cheap new. the title is lacrosse for dummies. it is simple to learn the fundamentals from this book. for a stick ask a player on team if they have a used one. to start lacrosse with a brand new stick, very very hard. your coach should be able to adjust strings. try this website. usalacrosse.org they will have listings of every club in your area. drop in for a few practises. work on quick feet. lateral speed is more important than forward speed. you will not be making a fool of yourself. there are 87 division one schools offering full ride scholarships. coached the current head coach syracuse woman's program. the world under 19 championship was held close to home. 12 countries sent women's teams. sport exploding in asia. you must try this great sport. i played indoor for many years. Canada's field team. i am not the only person who knows that the woman's game is the better sport compared to the mens field game. team canada sideline many retired players. many rings . many awards . all agreed your choice is the better game. it deserves network coverage. the bigots have to put this on t v . please play your teammates friends for life. happened to me and many others.|`|Fl1MqgJRaa	Well, it depends. Lacrosse can come really easy to some people, but others have to work for it. Lacrosse can also cost a ton of money from your stick, to uniform, to equipment and such. You should see if your parents will let you go to a camp. There are clinics all year around. these clinics will teach you the basics, and this will give a feel for the sport, and see how you do. Running isn't everything. Being able to handle the ball and control the game is a big part too. You will need at least a basic cradle and catching techniques to make any team.
axxQzOCHaa	An all-composite stick will wear out as fast as a pure wood blade,  possibly faster, so I'd get a descent shaft (Easton Octane, for instance, not too heavy or light, and an 80 flex is about all you really need for roller hockey unless you weight over 180 lbs.), and use ABS replacement blades, they play like wood, but are quite durable on rough surfaces.     (I would go with the RBK 1K) look for even wear throughout the blade - if there is more "wear and tear" in some areas than others, you're probably using the wrong lie / curve.|`|BMConIedaa	What ever stick you're most comfortable with.

g7hmhEUBaa	It's the biggest national sporting event of the year. So many advertisers put all their big money in advertisements for that game. It's probably the most watched event on television. They put in millions of 30-second airtime during the super bowl. People still tune in even if their team isn't playing. People put in the most money on this game, and throw the biggest parties ever. Stores advertise massive sales of junk food and beer, because consumers go crazy during this time.|`|haP5zj8Aaa	umm.. maybe since this is the 43rd superbowl...its brought different teams and cities together in the past 43 years. and it's one thing that practically the whole counrty watches..and roots for someone. pretty much when the superbowl comes around and your city is in it you just go crazy. like im from pittsburgh and for the past week all we've worn in black and gold and you just forget about all the other things going on that one day and you sit down with other fans and just scream at the tv. haha. so hopefully that maybe helped? ha..sorry thats all i could come up with

FfvzqmgNaa	Okay I can tell you a little bit about them, but let me start by saying i work at best buy in the digital imaging department so i know a little bit about them.  first off, the zoom isnt great, and picture quality is decent, and they only hold a certain amount of time. But that being said with what you're looking for it will do you just fine.  The best ones I know of  (and no I'm not just saying this because Insignia is best buy's brand) is the Insignia flash camcorder. The western digital "flip" is nice, but the zoom on it isn't so hot.  This one's got an 8x zoom, and it 5 megapixels. definitely my vote.  heres a link!

However, it is weird how this whole process has taken so long.  I believe that there are things going on that we don't know about, and that many teams are discussing a contract with Manny and his agent.    I still see him staying with the Dodgers either way though.  Some other teams that may try and offer Manny something are the Mets, Yankees, and recently the Cardinals have been talked about in trying to acquire the slugger.  Pujols has been pushing the front office at offering something, and he would be a pretty good fit in the St. Louis line up.|`|pW55qClKaa	He will probably go to the Dodgers, who are the only team confirmed to make an offer.  I can maybe see him as a Giant, but those are the only two realistic teams.  The Yankees are still trying to get rid of one outfielder, and I think they are at the limit for Type A free agents.  On top of that, they want to keep their payroll below last years, and Manny will surely put them over that.|`|2k5Sqvm2aa	He will play with the Giants|`|vj6YpJn8aa	I'd be surprised if NY Yankees Lites don't try to add him to their roster in their attempt to buy the NL East.|`|KHSt6KNVaa	Yeah the Giants will get him at a cheaper amount because no one may no want to pay near the price he wants.

You could try but something tells me it doesn't have the proper chemical compounds to be heated properly without smoking.|`|HutMUThraa	No, chemically the wax is different.

The Vikes are now heavily pursuing him and the asking price is perfect (4th round pick).<br>  <br>  The time is NOW for this team. They dont have time to mess around with guys like Sage Rosenfels or T. Jackson. The window for this team to win is NOW. <br>  <br>  Matt Cassle? I wish. The Vikes aren't going to give up (2) 1st round draft picks for him. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think they should pursue Donovan F. McNabb. Or.....yes... Micheal Vick.

The trade for Rosenfels has already been agreed on.  Rosenfels will compete with Jackson and most likely Rosenfels will win the starting job.  If both do not look good in early camp, look for them to make a trade or sign a veteran free agent.  I think Cassel will cost too much both in salary and trade value.  Garcia will most likely already be gone.  Anderson will probably be with the Browns since new management is not too high on Brady.   That leaves Brady a possible choice for some team.  I do not see the Vikings making another QB trade tho.  If there isn't a viable alternative on the free agent market, they will make do with what they have.|`|AA12162503	Im not too sure about them trying to get Rosenfels, but if we do end up getting him he'll start.

AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|KPLDOfxxaa	yes, definitely|`|LuYvKaXPaa	Well, Larry Fitzgerald is a freak of nature when it comes to catching the bombs that Warner throws his way. I think that Pittsburgh may keep it restrained early, but in my opinion, they weaken late and let it slip away. I'd take the bet, so long as you make it clear that you're only validating the bet through the first half. And if you're betting on a score prediction: 27-29 Cardinals.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	nah, go with the cardinals.|`|4KTe107Yaa	i hope they do.

l3ZUVqB7aa	Yah I just bought it yesterday and have been playing it. I agree with you the graphics are crappy but the game is pretty fun. After playing it Im not so mad at my Giants GM for not getting the giants a power hitter. Its so hard to get a player you want on the team. I was lucky and Mark Teixiera signed with my team the Giants but everybody else declined my offers.    Billy Beane is a genoius though, he sure knows how to get a team to win.

jHJ0W9QNaa	1) Kobe Bryant... most overrated player in NBA history. without Shaquille O'Neal, he is nothing. comparing him to Michael Jordan is like comparing the Special Olympics to the real Olympics.  2) Tracy McGrady... was a fantastic player several years ago, but is now too injury-prone. he also can't carry his team in the playoffs.  3) Steve Francis... received way too much hype throughout his career.  4) Allen Iverson... a Hall-of-Famer for sure, but is past his prime.  5) Jason Kidd... (see above)  6) Vince Carter... lacks leadership skills and killer instinct|`|4yiH5TiQaa	Tony Parker,Chauncey Billups,Brandon Roy, KG,Paul PEirce|`|WZvny7mMaa	Gilbert Arenas and Stephon Marbury|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	Kobe Bryant probably  I haven't payed attention to  espn much lately  i gotta  start watching it more  to see whats going on and what nba teams are  good .|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Gilbert Arenas, Greg Oden.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	tracy Mcgrady   Baron Davis  Gilbert Arenas|`|nuLF8SqBaa	david lee|`|m5vdVLwPaa	Lebron James|`|vbAu5SY3aa	Well, since the NBA has no real officiating and have eliminated most of the rules that would make the game a real sport...they are all overrated.|`|Tq7rABv5aa	Matt Barnes, Shawn Marion,|`|AA11490975	Right now...Shaq (he made the All-Star game?????)

All these people just randomly say stuff and probably dont know what they are talking about. For example, Lebron James - ????? how is he overrated, hes 24 and killing everyone in the league and leads one of the best teams in the league. Kobe-??????? you guys probably don't know how much he has done in his career and hes onlly about 30. Kidd-  ?????????? Are you serious, one of the best TRUE point guards of all time. There is a bunch more as well. Now you may think they are overrated at the moment but thats another thing i don't get.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Since neither player has played Chicago all that much<br>  <br>  Against one another.....Crosby has 24 points in 14 games (1.79).  Ovechkin has 20 points in 15 games (1.33).<br>  <br>  <br>  Ovechkin has 4 points in 3 games against Chicago<br>  Crosby has 2 points in 2 games, and plays his 3rd game tomorrow night.  I'll be sure to make sure that Huet lets in 3 late goals from Sid.....once Chicago has put the game away.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Moose<br>  Holland and Babcock both felt that Crosby was the best player in the finals last year.  He had more points in the 6 games than anybody else (7, tied with Marian Hossa and 1 more than Zetterberg led Detroit with) and he also came within 2 votes of winning the Conn Smythe<br>  <br>  Zetterberg had 96 votes<br>  Crosby had 94<br>  Osgood had 21<br>  Lidstrom had 18<br>  Hossa had 16<br>  Datsyuk had 11<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bob<br>  Roger Crozier of Detroit won the Conn Smythe in 1965<br>  Reggie Leach won the Conn Smythe in a losing effort in 1976<br>  Ron Hextall won the Conn Smythe in 1987 in a losing effort|`|naZQqrNeaa	My head hurts too bad to do the research.....I know that Ovechkin has better stats against the Bolts....just because I have seen it happen a bunch.  Not only that, we play them way more being in the same division and all.  I am going to guess that Ovechkin has probably had like 10 points against the Lightning this year alone.  From memory, I don't believe Crosby has scored a goal against them. <br>  <br>  As much as I hate hearing both of their names.....I have always felt Crosby was a better player.|`|UoUaO52taa	Ovechkin. We can't keep him scoreless. Not to mention he actually hurt Briere|`|lYnkvRASaa	Habs fan- you knew that.<br>  <br>  Crosby 7-12-19 in 13 GP<br>  <br>  Ovechkin  10-10 20 in 16 GP<br>  <br>  Both are 2-4-6 in Mtl, they do more damage at home.<br>  <br>  Not a lot of difference, Crosby's points per game is better. Ovechkin's goals per game is better.<br>  <br>  Ovechkin scares me more but is probably easier to contain.  crosby is more consistent and will get his 2 points against you.  Ovechkin will get none or 4.  I remember last year we held him pointless in the first game of a home and home here in Mtl.  The second game in DC we hit him, break his nose and then he scores 4 goals.  Explosive.  Overall ovechkin scares me more because of the goal scoring threat.<br>  <br>  Bob, Still being the operative word.  Ovechkin will catch up.  Actually we keep hearing that Crosby has Malkin to play with etc but I think this year Ovechkin has had the better and more stable linemates plus he has had Green on D.  This trade may help Crosby a bit.<br>  <br>  Crosby seems to own your Flyers.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	Well Crosby didn't do that much in the Finals while Ovechkin beat us this season and wouldn't let the Wings two points lol, so Ovechkin :)<br>  <br>  Oh Bob I hope your not serious about Crosby being the best for either team.  Hossa killed the Wings more than Crosby did.  The Wings did a good job of shutting him down.  A point per game isn't the best on the ice out of 40 players.  I didn't know he had 6 points in the Finals, thought he had less, but he wasnt the best on the ice.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Lol, since they are in the same division, it's Crosby that usually destroys the Isles.   I remember talking about this with Erica one time.<br>  <br>  Crosby has 11G and 31A in 24 games against NYI, including 17 PP points.<br>  <br>  Ovechkin has 11G and 5 A in 16 games with 6PP points.|`|9TlKNVhcaa	I feel as a Sens fan that Ovechkin hurts us more. Although we have never played him in the playoffs he constantly scores against us and in our last meeting rcorded a hat-trick. Crosbymeanwhile, has met us twice in the playoffs an many time in the regular season but has never put up many points.|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	idk what the deal is with crosby. everyone worships him. he's a little *****. just because he's decent doesnt mean he's great. it's like being the smartest retard in your class.|`|WPCATkoYaa	My team is the penguins so Crosby. but they have different styles. Crosby makes his team look better more often but Ovechkin is still fun to watch cuz he has some pretty sick moves.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Without looking up the stats on either said player, I would have to say Ovie has scored more big goals vs the Bruins than Crosby. If I had to take a guess I would also say he has hurt them more with points, toughness, hitting, and just being a bigger presence on the Ice.<br>  <br>  What always seems to be the Achilles heal for the B's though, is the dreaded back-up goalie or the goalie call up. I've been watching the B's for over 25 yrs now and it seems every time they play a team that plays their back-up or just called up a kid from the minors, he shuts them down or out.<br>  <br>  <br>  **Bob- Thanks for the info. Just goes to show, what you see is not always what you get!!!|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Also being a Flyers fan, I saw this stat the other night during the Washington game. Yet everytime I see Ovechkin with the puck, I get nervous. He's stronger and more physical then Crosby. I'd rather see Crosby one versus one with Kimmo Timmonen for example, then Ovechkin. Ovechkin is scary...|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Honestly, as a Leafs fan, I tend to get that reach-for-the-Maalox feeling about Ovechkin more than Crosby.<br>  <br>  Plus, Ovechkin has scored at least 2 or 3 GWG against the Leafs (I know...someone has to).  Putting one in to turn a 5-1 lead into a 6-1 lead isn't as relevant as scoring the game-winner (or game-tying goal); I know you're going for overall points per game (perfectly reasonable) and my comments are more subjective, but it just seems like Ovechkin is the burr in Toronto's collective saddle (as opposed to Crosby).
8FUAMccRaa	it never gets boring as they are so unpredictable!|`|gP7IB2XCaa	i get sooo nervous. i'm like freaking out now, and i'm really scared that federer will lose. it is entertaining though.   i didnt wake up early last year for the mens final,, but i'm waking up for this one.|`|wFzV0T22aa	nadal vs federer are the best matches in ANY sports|`|e7zRqsIyaa	no, there rivalry is the greatest ever.  i cant wait for the AO final|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Astoundingly, no. I'm never sick of those matches. Even if its repetitive, to the point where everyone in the world has lost interest, i still find it one of the greatest rivalry's in the history of tennis. The most epic one's as well. I'd like this tradition to continue.|`|SIqFa1mzaa	No way!  It definitely continues to entertain me and keep me on the edge of my seat.  I'm so glad Rafa became  1 and he's so entertaining to watch.  He just has so much energy.  Federer is so good and he's great to watch too, but it got kind of boring when he would win everything.      I love to watch Federer vs. Nadal matches.  They are the best ever in my opinion except for that French Open final.  When they played that last Wimbledon where Nadal won, that was the best tennis match I've ever seen even though the coverage lasted practically all day with the long match and rain delay in the middle.  They both have the shots, the serve, and the physical conditioning it takes to win grand slams.  Now when you watch them either can win even though the momentum seems to be with Rafa.  I personally think Rafa is going to win since he has been playing spectacularly in this tournament and has been doing well on the hard courts.    I think maybe they will end up becoming the best men's tennis rivalry in history.|`|ASbdsqFSaa	Each match is a new ball game. I love watching these two play agains't each other! I'm a Federer supporter though, I'm hoping he can go one better this year though and win the French Open though, he's alot better healthwise than he was last year. He's playing very well atm in the Australian Open too :)|`|U7BkuEU9aa	How can I ever get tired of watching the two best players on the planet, specially when they're not simply better than anyone else, they're in a whole other dimension? Every match between them is different, and almost always an amazing treat for all tennis lovers (well, maybe the last Roland Garros final doesn't count hehehehe)!!! Besides, they're not only unbelievable players, they're also awesome people, and I always want them *both* to win as much as possible - and when they meet in the finals, it's not like I ever want Fed to lose per se, I just want Rafa to win more than I want the Swiss to.    VAMOS!!!!!!!!!|`|z9d0iFH1aa	its so boring ...|`|75ZMWlnnaa	never ever have i got sick of watching these 2 champions play against each other.    the wimbledon final had me watching from 11.30pm until 6.16am the next morning, that was so worth it, even though my eyes were like a zombie's eyes the next say LOL.    it is not roger and rafa's fault that they keep meeting in finals, the other players just are not consistent enough to beat them on a regular basis (djokovic is NOT on their level, neither are any of the young players these days...)    lets hope it is a great match tonight, and may the better player win, but i am hoping roger wins in 4 sets, but i respect rafa heaps as well, and i wish them BOTH good luck.|`|uWYlumvsaa	Absolutely not. Sure some people might be tired of watching them play in a final, but Roger and Rafa can't help if they played better than everyone else. Until other players show they can consistently beat both of them, you almost have no choice but to except the fact that they're going to meet in most of the major finals that are contested. I don't mind at all, simply because Roger and Rafa have developed perhaps the greatest rivalry in sports and never fail to give us their best. These are two of the most gracious and mature athletes in sports, and they deserve to be rewarded for their hard work and efforts. All tennis fans should be proud of what both men are accomplishing and acknowledge the fact that it is a privilege to watch them play, no matter how often it happens. I can't wait for tonight's final. It will be fun!!!|`|AA12034105	Nope I love Rafa vs Roger matches :)  Can't wait till tomorrow !!!  Vamos Rafa !! xx|`|gWLhIoIiaa	i understand what you are saying. but i would say no because their matches are usually exciting. lots of good rallies. unlike last night's women's final!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|06TvcksDaa	Watching the clear 1 vs. 2 in the world is always entertaining to me personally, because it is a totally different match everytime!|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Yup it gets boring, I like a variety of people getting slams..I hate domination..  :(  Edit- LOL I got 5 thumbs downs..and counting!  :(  you people are mean hahaha!  ooo it went to 8, have a heart you guys!  :(
13XU8cCKaa	You can't look at the amount of championship rings they have.  Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Hardaway, Steve Nash are some of the greatest players of all time that don't have a ring.  Robert Horry would be the best player of all time next to Bill Russel.  Stats are not that important.  If you elavate your teams play than a player that averages 13 ppg, 5 rpg, and 7 apg is better than a player than averages 34 ppg, 9 rpg, and 10 apg if the non stat player elevates his teams game with leadership and get them to a championship.  Just look at Chanuncey Billups, one of the most underrated point guards in NBA history.  He is the elevates the play of the team he plays on by playing great defense and being a leader on the court.  He lead Detroit to an NBA title.  And look at the Nuggets team before and now.  He doesn't put up great stats but his leadership makes him better than Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Devin Harris, Kevin Durant, and Danny Granger.  They put up better numbers but Billups elevates his team to a whole new level by being the leader on the court which makes him better than all those player.  Thats what I look for top determine the good players from the great players.|`|Lppal9NXaa	i think its stats, how aggressive they are, and how much effort and heart they put into playing, as well as how much confidence they have|`|AA12276356	The posters on here judge the best player ever by how many commercials he made.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	-Stats (including records held)  -Awards (MVPS, Final MVP, DPOY, ROY, Scoring Titles etc..)  -championships   -playoff success  -time spent in the league  -competition played against  -if his roster, was packed with talent, or not    Its a long process|`|6Efhd6lNaa	You cant really. The only thing I think you can truly compare is players at the same position. It is pointless to try and compare Wilt to Magic because they obviously played different positions and had different roles.    Rings are the number 1 criteria imo, but you cant judge soley on rings because then people would go around saying Robert Horry was a better big man then Shaq because he had more rings...    All in all i think it is an exercise in futility because there are just so many variables.|`|3teWTOPqaa	it's a combination of skills and accomplishments, no one thing can determine a player's place in history.|`|CAgxexWkaa	potential|`|AAWmhiuoaa	All of the following.|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	I don't look at championships that much because anyone can win titles.

W6HDqS5Yaa	William's performance today wasn't shocking, nor sensational as numerous have claimed but rather should be redefined by one question: "What happened to Dinara?" So Williams was playing her normal grand slam quality tennis but on the same note, one has to wonder whether Dinara was possessed, failing to hold her serve, her serve, her willpower to liberate herself from that service game drought. At the end of the day, it is not quite remarkable how Serena won, just how on earth Dinara managed to extinguish that scorching fire of glory within herself- because we all know the best of Dinara would contest that of Serena's. Dinara and her warrior willpower had reinvented and redefined this year's Australian Open, the highlight and essence and let's leave at that. Australia salutes you and your luminosity and we are certain it will eclipse over this match with the championship in 2010. We know the World NO.2 will be advancing towards a debut championship win in Garros, Wimbledon and US Open.     This is the technical overview. Basically, Safina's serve was her enemy, a catalyst being the extremely high ball toss and her head falling back in such an angle and hence resulting in absent first serves and hence the opportunities for her signature solid and monstrous fore/back hand base line winners which had been the ultimate enhancement of her game. Her return of serve was adequate, but not sufficient to set up the opportunities to execute those winners. Hence, today her ability and capacity to execute her trademark shots were not impaired for she only made one unforced error during the process. She was too far back behind the baseline and despite maximum court coverage she could not take advantage of the Serena's numerous half-volleys and short balls. Before she could recuperate, Serena had taken advantage of the lost opportunities of signature winners and comprehensive amount of second serves that were either clean winners or double faults at crucial game points. Poor Dinara could not recover and shockingly it was all over, as justified by the lacklustre crowd reaction.     As for Serena, though she was explosive and hence conducted the pace and controlled the speed of return with her excellent movement and optimal weapons- serve, forehand but most importantly her return of serve for which she had practised for the majority of her practise session earlier today. She capitalised on Dinara's faltered second serve and executed her shots. Congratulations though, her normal grand slam quality tennis, notice normal and not spectacular handed her the memorial trophy on a silver platter.     She states: "Now I just have to go back, take a little time and get everything back in the place. I mean, I had three weeks in a row   four weeks with a Grand Slam. Of course, by playing every day matches from Hopman Cup, it's tough to practice, you know.  Once you play match, everything goes a little bit, you know, the technique just goes back. Now I want to go back and I'll have few days and just put everything together and I'll get ready for Dubai."    She is precisely right, after having spectated all of her prior matches to the AO, one can be certain that her service motion and effectuality did regress because at the beginning of the year, though it was not a feminine equivalent of Roddick's serve, it was still one of her core game assets. She admitted it later on: "my serve was letting me down, so... After I hold it for two times, but just during the match I was not giving her any trouble with my serve. Normally my serve is my weapon. So playing without all my weapons, it's tough against her."    Don't worry, she ensures it will never recur: "Well, I hope it's not the last one, you know. I still have time. And just, you know, I'll go on the court now and practice. Those mistakes that I've been doing, just will try to work as hard as I can that they will never happen again. After every lose, I try to take what was good and what was wrong, and to work on my weaknesses, to get them better, that my opponents will not have that easy next time.    But did admit the extent to which her game faltered due to Serena's dominance: "You know, she played exactly the way she had to play and she was much more aggressive and she just was taking time out of me, so I didn't have that much time to put back myself onto the court. She didn't even let me to come into the match. "    In essence, Dinara's game was marred by absent first serves and lost opportunities to set up her signature winners, not the unforced errors nor motivation or mentality. To Serena's credit, she wasted no time in capitalising on that and hence dictated the pace and winners- she did not allow any possibility of 'chasing down the balls'. Poor Dinara; however her journey justifies the fact that the dawn of Dinara Dominance has just begun!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	she chocked|`|NdTy3twjaa	Serena happened to her, and got the better end of it.|`|njLlLWSBaa	well u know what. she may just be building up and getting ready for that final stage then she blows it. i am a huge safina fan but mayb its just nerves. she is a great player but i think her time will come when shes in a finals and she kicks her opponets butt :-)|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Safina had to play the real No 1 in the world, so what happened had to happen.|`|vFX2DPdIaa	Sure, Dinara has made it to several finals and failed.  But look who she was playing at the time and look at the way she got there.  Only determination.   Each time she was about to be blown away; but came back with fierce determination.  That alone took some of her stamina away.  And then to take on the reigning; well, the best at the time. Maria Sharapova, Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic, Elena Dementieva.  Each one of these had been there before and will be there again.  And this time, to take on Serena.  She ame along to take on someone who plays just as hard and who wanted the Barbie, well the Trophy just as much.|`|by7BQ2npaa	I'm starting to believe what some tennis fans and insiders have been saying recently. I thought it was silly before, but not anymore!  That the Williams have been buying their titles or paying off top players to lose, tank or retire mysteriously from a match. I don't know, it's either the Williams buying/paying their way or the USTA paying off players so that an American girl can win. Some say to look at recent Wimbledons, US Opens and Ericsson Opens, and now Aussie Open 2009 for proof of this and similar outcomes. Remember, the Williamses are the only Americans in the top 30 now, yet at the same time the level of talent and professionalism from players has surpassed them. I don't buy the results.

But I couldn't help myself. :D|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	i would much rather have them get their slump out of the way. Would you rather have them loose 5 straight in the playoffs or right now?

AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|rzkFHAEJaa	idk, cards?|`|LuYvKaXPaa	Personally, I think Kurt Warner is going to be just good enough against the blitz to put the Cardinals over the top.

Like Evolution, fighting against Vladimir, DX reunion, etc. But I think he's just trying to have a fun time for the moment, feuding with Vickie and such. I have respect for her because she is the wife of the late La Viva Rasa "Eddie Gue.....rro" She makes a really good heel and general manager. Too bad Chavo isnt using his full potential. But anyways, you're right...but Triple is maybe taking a breather.|`|H7p09fL2aa	well i like his storyline  making fun of vickie and edge  and always getting punished in hard matches  that's a good storyline to pump him up for his next title reign|`|eDaty5gHaa	who the hell cares|`|az5NtgN6aa	I DON'T KNOW|`|WCX6kYITaa	Maybe he and Steph are having problems.

Then you got Black Snow BOOka T - "Booker's settin' up for a Big Kick , He's gonna Kick him in the face , There it is - I Just Kicked Him."      Give some Props to Chet Lemon though Too.  "Oh My God! , It's Booker T! , He Just came outta Nowhere for the Very first Time Tonight!"    Steiner's Not bad as a Commentator Either.  "Hand or Foot , It's gonna be a Hand or a Foot , He's Gonna Punch him or Kick Him - Ohw - It's a Foot , He Kicked Him."    All 3 are better than West & Tenay.

The nWo did the exact same thing in WCW and all of this Main Event Mafia stuff just seems like a big copy of the nWo.     But it was still funny, especially when Booker (Black Snow) was beating down Consequences Creed and Eric Young while calling play-by-play on himself. "AND BOOKER T IS SETTING HIM UP FOR THE THRUST KICK......OHHHHH!!!!"    The line where they were talking about Matt Morgan was pretty funny as well. I probably have the exact quote all jumbled up, but this is just roughly what they said in case you missed it.    Black Snow- "You know, this Matt Morgan, he's a big guy. Look at him in the ring. He's biiigggg. You know, I heard from this man that he was a big guy.    Chet Lemon- "So what you're saying is he's a big guy."    Black Snow- "Yeah."      That was pretty funny.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	scot steiner  booker i mean black snow was hard to under stand somtimes but lemon and snow was pretty damn funny and when booker commentated while he was beating ppl that was  funny

Here's a more likely scenario:    1. Chicago Cubs (with closer to 100 wins instead of 90)  2. St. Louis Cardinals (they have the most established management team in the division, and their surrounding competition (minus the Reds) have made zero improvements)  3.

What is the point behind asking a question which was just asked in the exactly the same way in the last 10 minutes?    What you think that you will get a different answer than the person who just asked it?  If so why?    It is very annoying; and, more to the point it is pointless.    I would understand if the question got asked say once every 30 minutes or so because at least then the previous question would not be on the first page of questions in the football (American) section.  But when it is on the first page 3 or 4 times and then a person asks again it is just silly.|`|gW2PJRONaa	cause there favorite team isnt in it|`|bxBdh1feaa	well im just saying i think the cardinals are gonna win!!!|`|TevQwLN3aa	some people just don't try to control their irritation at a question like that being asked so much.  they might think it's pointless to spend time thinking about it when they think you just need to wait and find out.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	well there's not much else to answer...those are the majority of questions on here right now, which is why it gets so annoying...|`|4KTe107Yaa	I didn't even notice.

I wanna see edgerrin James get his ring|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Steelers|`|AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner

When was the last time an NBA player played 2 games in one day??     Usually if there is a trade about to go down the players involved sit out the upcoming game and then they have to travel to the new team so they usually don't go straight in to a game with the new team anyway.    I agree with the other people that said it will only happen if they are traded to a team that hasn't played as many games as the team they're leaving.     Correct me if I'm wrong ...

WzzzVk7Baa	Any Kimber Ultra or Colt Defender.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	None.    1911 is old technology.  I used to build them and carried one concealed in Boston Mass, Portland Maine, and Alaska for 20+ years.    Carrying a pistol with a 7 round mag when everyone else has 14 to 20 round mags is not very smart at all.    Carrying a 1911 is only good if you take it to a knife fight.    Right now - the totally best high tech pistol available for concealed carry is the FN 5.7x28mm.  It is not a cheap date - $1100 - if you can find one.  Very light weight, no recoil, spews a 40gr round out at 2200 fps - with the official FN ammo it will defeat Kevlar vests and helmets.  Comes standard with three 20 round mags.  For $15 you can buy an adapter that will turn them into 30rd mags.  The 5.7x28mm round was designed by FN to bridge the gap from the awful 9mm NATO and the 5.56mm rifle.      If you cannot afford this - take a good long look at the Springfield Armory XD in 45 acp.  It has 13rd mags, you can tell if it has a round chambered by touch and sight, you can tell if it is ready by touch and sight too - and it uses a both a grip safety and trigger safety - there is no side safety to mess up your draw.    There are many better options than the 1911.      Hope this helps|`|48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	None, but for a very different reason.  It's just too much gun for most concealed carry purposes.    Hey, if you really think you are going to be finding yourself in a bad neighborhood where your life is going to be threatened, then I guess it's fine.  But, just be aware, if you shoot someone in self-defense with a 45 ACP handgun, the prosecuting district attorney is going to take a real hard look at your motives and decide if you are a vigilante or the kind of person that is looking for trouble.    Better to pack along a small frame 38 special for protection while out and about.|`|HoYpU86Gaa	I fully agree with the nay-sayers on this one.     I would never carry a 1911 short or long as a ccw. Its just a dumb thing to do. There are just toooooooo many better choices.    If you think you must carry a gun with a hammer---at least get one with a da/sa trigger. That way you can carry with a round "in the chamber", and put the hammer on half cock, then go with or without safety on. Then you can draw the weapon, sweep the safety, and fire.    Better still...one of the newer versions with poly frame and alloy slide in a 9mm. You can get them with or without a safety.    Even a dressed up 1911 is too far behind the times.    Nothing wrong with a 1911, I have one, they are just not good for carry.|`|gnsCsM69aa	Kimber Ultra Carry.|`|wmhwBhv8aa	I love the kimbers, however, you should really check out the springfield micro pistols and their compacts are awesome too.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	I work for a company that offers PSD -personal security detail. I would never roll with a piece that I couldn't control in a fire fight. A 3" barrel is just to short for a fast ,furious and accurate gun fight.

I think you should buy a Springfield Armory 9mm EMP.    http://www.springfield-armory.com/armory...|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Colt Stainless Officers' ACP.

r5AMG8g7aa	There is nothing else Japanese that is like the ninja. The Samurai and Ninja were not even close to being the same. The Samurai used sword techniques developed in Japan over hundreds of wears. The ninja Sword techniques originally descended from Chinese sword techniques long ago. That is why the way they use the sword is different from the way the Samurai used it. The Samurai were basically like police. Th Ninja were the scum of the earth. They were born ninja and were taught spying, and Assassination skills. There is no comparison between the two.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Ninja skivies... even closer than ninja clothes:P<br>  <br>  Ninjas would be closer to a cross of black ops and guerrillas. There is so much said about them that it's difficult to discern what the truth really is. Take every ninja story with a grain of salt. <br>  <br>  Also remember that no group is entirely good or bad; there are always individuals that represent both ends of the spectrum and even these people can operate across it. So it really isn't fair to generalize that all ninjas were scum unless you can back it up with evidence. <br>  <br>  Just to complicate things a bit more, remember that when there is confrontation there are two sides and one has to lose. The winner writes the history books and sets policy so his opponent's actions are deemed evil even when the tactics on both sides were identical.<br>  <br>  Humans are interesting critters when you really watch and think about what's happening.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in ninjutsu look for a Bujinkan dojo in your area. This style is your best bet for not being scammed when taking ninjutsu. The instructor in this style that I've spoken with is a great wealth of ninja and Japanese history as well as their fighting methods. He incorporated this into his classes so it was quite interesting to learn something cerebral while learning to fight.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	military special forces are the modern day ninjas by means of stealth, combat, weapons and tactics, although they don't have swords they use the same prospect of using the element of surprise to achieve their mission|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	You mean, in the modern world?

Tu9S1WaNaa	The main thing is that The 5 car teams are housed in the same shop. They use the same management.  Rousch and Hendrick oversee the day to day operations of all 5 teams in their shops.<br>  <br>  Basically, Rousch will move his 5th team to the Yates shop.  Yates will be the owner on paper.  They use the same engines already.<br>  <br>  Hendrick may move his 5th team to Stewart Haas or another Chevy team.  He may just drop it all together.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	To get by some of the 4 car limits, Hendrick has two shops. 24 and 48 in one.  5 and 88 in another.|`|e5c0f1654720d1b5e418ff7499467608aa	Jack Roush still owns the 6, 17, and 26.  The team name is RoushFenway Racing.  The other guys are probably part of the ownership of Fenway Park.  Jeff Gordon is a part owner of Jimmie's car.  Rick and Jack will end up going to a four-car team before next year.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	Can you imagine if there was no limit??? Jack might have 8 cars and Rick might have 7 or 8 and Childress  who knows. This leaves little room to get good finishes if your on a smaller team. This might drive them out. I like the 4 car limit.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	....as with certain cautions there are "phantom teams" also.An owner registers the team in a different name, and the owner supplies it.But since the owner does not have it listed as his team he is clear.|`|XQiH90x2aa	its complicated|`|IrGapExUaa	Nascar has a rule that only 3 teams can be listed in any owners name. so like roush 2 of his teams have to be listend under some one else name. #17 John Herny i believe what its listed under is a owner of the Redsox's #17 in the past was listed under Mark Martin's name.|`|GCOrku95aa	They may be listed as ony owning 2 or 3 cars, but they are still Hendrick Motorsports and Roush Fenway Racing. Also, Roush had 5 pre-existing teams with sponsorship obligations, so the rule doesn't affect him until this season is over then he has to cut one loose, and the only car I can see him shifting to another affiliated team is the 26 car. He won't give up the 6 car, that was his flagship for so many years, he won't give up the 99, better to have Carl with you than against you, the 17 and 16 both signed extensions on their contracts.<br>  <br>   I am somewhat a fan of Roush Fenway Racing, and when that rule came out, I was furious, due to the fact that ONLY Jack Roush had to lose a car, but since Hendrick has four cars, he doesn't have to lose one. I thought it should have gone down to a 3 car limit, affecting BOTH premier teams, not just the Ford team.
ZyQFd6NVaa	Crunches - Are very important. They help in more than one way. Crunches build your stomach muscles. Your stomach muscles can either hinder or enhance your ability to cheerlead. I think you should do these every other day. IT IS A MISTAKE TO DO CRUNCHES MORE THAN EVERY OTHER DAY.( This doesn't make your muscles any better actually you won't tone very much because your muscles will be exhasted.)  *Here's a variation: Lay on your back, one knee up. The other leg should be straight out, about three inches off the floor. With your hands behind your head, bring the elbow that is opposite your bent knee up, creating a kind of twist-crunch. Do as many of these as you physically can, then repeat on the other side.     Straddle leg lifts - Sit in a comfortable straddle on the floor. (If your straddle is really wide, bring it in a little for this exercise) Lift one leg up about six inches, or as high as you can lift it. slowly move it up and down, but don't let your foot touch the floor. Repeat on other side, then do both legs at the same time.   * Variation - lift one leg up and do little circles with your foot. It will burn but you can handle it.     Squat jumps - Squat down, placing your hands on the floor. Then jump upwards, with hands stretched towards the sky. Point your toes and jump high! Land back down in beginning position. As soon as your hands touch the floor, jump back up. 15 of these is a good starting place, but be sure to increase the amount by a few every week.     Pushups - Okay, We ALL know how to do these. These don't do too much for your stomach but they will build your arms. Believe it or not you need strong arms so you will be able to do better stunts.   Variation* Get in a push-up position then drop onto your elbows. Your body should be in a straight line. Hold this position. It will work you abs!!     Toe Touch/Pike Sit-ups:   This is a great exercise to help with your toe touches! Begin by lying down with your legs straight and your arms above your head. In one quick and sharp motion bring your legs and body up into a toe touch position. Quickly snap your legs back together and return to the lying position on the floor. You may also want to increase the difficulty level by doing the same exercise only in a piked position. A good amount of these sit-ups is about three sets of 10.     Leg Lifts:   Lay on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Try to lay in front of something you can grab onto, for instance, a bed post. Lift your legs to a 90 degree angle and then lower them down until they almost touch the ground, and then repeat. Begin with 20 and work your way up.     Partner Leg Lifts:   Have one person lay straight on the ground with their legs out in front of them. The other person will stand just above the head of their partner. The person on the ground will grab onto the ankles of their partner and lift his/her legs to a 90 degree angle. The partner standing up will push their partners legs down as hard as they can. You want to try to push their legs all the way to the ground. The person on the ground will resist and try to stop their legs before they hit the ground.   Running stairs is a very effective exercise to condition your body for cheerleading.     LEG STRENGTHENING     Strong legs are also very important. Strong legs can help you build better in stunts.    Lunges: Step forward, keeping your back straight, and bend your knees at a right angle. Go down until your back knee is almost touching the ground. Return your feet together and step out with the opposite leg repeating the process. To increase difficulty, use free weights while doing the exercise.     Squats: With you feet a little more than shoulder width apart, bend your legs to a 90 degree angle. Keep your back straight and your chest up.       THINGS TO REMEMBER!!!  When it comes to your muscles you must "Use It or Lose It" Also another saying - "Over Time, Not Overnight" - No matter how uch you stretch in one day. You will not become flexible over night. In order to get more flexible you should keep at it. Try to stretch every chance you get.Here are some tips to keep in mind while stretching:   ~Warm-up before you stretch. Never stretch a cold muscle. ~Stretch every day, more if possible.   ~Stretch only to the point that you feel a tug. You should not feel pain and should never bounce|`|r9FlMY4paa	i dont know how the cheerleading squad at your school is but at my school you were required to be able to do a back-handspring in order to be on the varsity/competition squad. so if you haven't already i would suggest joining gymnastics. you'll also need to be flexible as well and you'll need to know and be able to do the jumps. (right herkie, left herkie, russian, spike.. etc) but most importantly you'll need to have a very good attitude at tryouts and try and stay as happy and jolly as you can and be friendly to everyone.     again, im not sure how much you know about cheerleading but my advice would be to find someone who is a cheerleader that can help you learn some of the cheers and who can make sure you do everything correctly. and make sure your movements are sharp.     help this helps and good luck! =]

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either.

WUuO6wbAaa	It's a good question. I've been following this thoroughly throughout the off-season. What may be on Opening Day may not exactly the same thing I'd like, which like many other's, would include Manny Ramirez. You never know with that, but it's a long shot. While recognizing reality though, here's what I expect their 2009 Opening Day roster to be on April 6th vs the Cincinnati Reds.    1. (S) SS Jose Reyes  2. (L) LF Daniel Murphy  3. (R) 3B David Wright  4. (L) 1B Carlos Delgado  5. (S) CF Carlos Beltran  6. (L) RF Ryan Church  7. (S) 2B Luis Castillo  8.  (L) C  Brian Schneider    Note: There's an outside chance Fernando Martinez makes a call up during the year. Also, if the Mets are aggressive and wise, they may move Murphy to 2B. They may try this if Martinez is ready or if they sign an OF. Also, the reason why I listed Delgado 4th and Beltran 5th is to keep a healthy balance throughout the line-up, with no back-to-back left-handed or right-handed hitters. The reason why I listed Murphy second is because he can be a great two hitter, because he's shown great plate discipline. I've never seen someone work the count to 5+ pithces like he did last season. Beltran wouldn't be a bad two hitter if the Mets had a more reliable 5 hitter than Church, but I don't see that happening. If Abreu's a Met, and Johan's said he'd like for him to be one, he may bat 2nd, because he can get on and steal some. Honestly, I don't know where Castillo will fit and I eventually see him losing his starting role to Cora, but it'd be nice to see them sign Nomar to a low-risk deal and give him a chance at 2B. He's right-handed, experienced, has played in big markets and has shown verstaility around the IF. Ray Durham and Damion Easley are out there too, and the truth is, they look like better platoon options with Cora than Castillo, so they may sign one of them.    Bench:  C  Ramon Castro  2B/SS Alex Cora  LF/RF/3B/1B Fernando Tatis  OF Jeremy Reed  OF Angel Pagan    Starting Rotation:  Ace - Johan Santana  2 - Mike Pelfrey  3 - Oliver Perez (will sign 3 year/36 million)  4 - John Maine  5 - Tim Redding    Bullpen:  Brian Stokes (Long Reliever)  Sean Green (Middle Reliever)  Pedro Feliciano (Lefty Specialist/Middle Reliever)  Duaner Sanchez (Middle Reliever)  Dennys Reyes (Set-Up)  J.J. Putz (8th Inning Set-Up)  Francisco Rodriguez (Closer)    Notes: Although Marlon Anderson is due 1.15 million, he'll be released after Spring Training, similar to how Ruben Gotay was last Spring. He's coming off a terrible year and Pagan can serve as a left-handed bat off the bench, since he's a switch hitter. Freddy Garcia will also be considered. They won't place him on the 40 man roster until they need him because he gets 1.5 million for just being there a day. They want to see that he'll stay healthy and productive in Spring Training & AAA before testing him.    Other player's who will be considered if there's injuries:    OF - Cory Sullivan  OF - Rob Mackowiak  OF/1B - Nick Evans  SP - Freddy Garcia  SP - Jon Niese  SP/RP - Nelson Figueroa  SP/RP - Bobby Parnell  SP/RP - Brandon Knight  RP - Eddie Kunz  RP - Casey Fossum  RP - Darren O'Day  RP - Carlos Muniz  RP - Rocky Cherry  C - Robinson Cancel    Although signing Manny seems a long shot, singing a good bat like Abreu or Dunn is still possible if they're around come March and there prices are as low as 6 million per year. By that point, all they'd be able to get is one year. Maybe there's a chance the Mets would look at Ben Sheets, even if they have Oliver Perez too, if he's around in March. Wolf doesn't figure around to be there that long. Overall, the roster will look very similar to the end of last season, with the exclusion of the bullpen overhaul. The Mets line-up and starting rotation, even through loads of injuries, put them in position to win well over 100 games by the 8th in. Actually over 110 games. I don't know if there's another team that can say that. That's why it's important the Mets re-sign Oliver Perez, so they keep their team chemistry together. Their bullpen blew 29 games last season, which left the rest of their team's talent to go unnoticed. They should have ran away with the NL East, but they didn't. This year though, they will.    The obvious move left this off-season is to sign a SP. You may see somne more minor signings. I think they'd like to add a left-handed reliever, because in the event Feliciano gets hurt, Fossum, De Los Santos and Bostick are pretty crappy options. Will Ohman, Dennys Reyes, Joe Beimel, Brian Shouse and Eddie Guardado aren't bad options. Also, note that Billy Wagner's progress is going well, and while there's no need to depend on him, he could make it back by August. The thought of him being a second set-up man with Putz to protect K-Rod would be pretty crazy going down the stretch.|`|GBtet3Jsaa	?|`|Ensnxm09aa	Batting order:    1  Reyes   SS  2  Church   RF  3  Wright   3B  4  Beltran   CF  5  Delgado   1B  6  Tatis   LF  7  Schneider   C  8  Castillo   2B  P     Rotation:    Santana  Maine  Perez?

rJMZdp04aa	Exactly what Hannah Said - Jeff Didn't say he'd Never seen the driver.  He Basically said he didn't see Anyone.  And if it had been Matt , Wouldn't Jeff have been able to Identify his own BROTHER'S Car?    It was Pretty Obvious from the Start it was Matt Who would be revealed as the "Attacker".  Or , at least the PARTIAL Attacker.    And as far as the Heel Promo Matt did on SD! , where he said there is No Proof he Attacked Jeff 3 times , this just leaves the Door Wide Open for Christian's Imminent Return.    We all KNOW he's Coming back , and that he'll be involved in the Storyline Somehow.  My Guess - The "Attacks" were a Multiple Person Ordeal.  Matt & Christian were Conspiring against Jeff.  Edge had no Idea about it , or at least No Idea about Matt's Involvement.    Come WM25 (Or Before) , I'm Sure this will all Pan out somehow , and We'll be looking at a Great 4 way 2009 Feud for the WWE Championship.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	IT                                              IS    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .        |Christain                  Everyone knows it.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	On the other hand, he said he was at the party with Matt. Matt could have borrowed a car off someone, hid his face, and then tried to run Jeff off the road, as he followed him.|`|NNn84vTCaa	No, Jeff said he didn't see who the driver was, meaning he didn't see anyone at all, he never meant he didn't recognise the guy. If Jeff hadn't ever seen that person, then why did he keep insisting it was Edge? If he had seen the person, he would have said 'Edge i saw you driving' and he didn't. Thats the only logical way i can think of explain that. Now, it was pretty obvious it was Matt all along, i said from the start it was him. This is why smarks shouldn't read spoiler sites, because they just dissapoint people. There were facts it was Matt (do i really need to point them out?!?). With Christian, people just based their speculation on what they read on PWI Insider, or Wrestlezone, hardly reliable.|`|0P40aUA0aa	it was matt hardy|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Dude, it was dark, and anyone who knows anything about Matt knows he drives a black car, with tinted windows.

I think this is leaving an opening for Christian.    Here is the video and Jeff says " i have no clue at 1:28.    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=YdyiLqq2HX...

z0OSXFoTaa	Your muscles want to return your body to a comfortable position. Your existing muscle memory may be taking over and pushing you up and out of the shot. Your swing is not allowing you to keep your head behind the ball through the impact zone or to maintain your spine angle. You are probably coming up and out of your shot or coming over the top.   You should start developing muscle memory required to keep your head back and maintain your spine angle. Training aids that provide tactile feedback to the head are most useful in developing the muscle memory required to achieve these two unarguable aspects of the golf swing.|`|HSsDCET8aa	I would suggest that the cause of this is almost certainly that you are uncocking your wrists too early - "casting" as described by an earlier response.    If your shots are going straight, as you say, I would most definitely not start playing around with stance or ball position until you are certain that your wrists are behaving the way they should.    The primary purpose the wrists and hands perform in the golf swing are to return the club head to the ball in the correct position.  They also play a role in generating more clubhead speed, but this is secondary.  If you can't get the club to the ball in the correct position, more clubhead speed simply means you're going to go further off line.    There are 2 elements to club head position at impact - alingment in relation to the target line and angle.    The first is far easier to deal with, since the results are immediately visible. Club face open = slice, closed = hook, square = straight. (Yes, before anyone jumps down my throat I know this is a gross generalistion, but it'll do for now).    The second aspect of club angle is far more subtle and harder to work with - casting is probably one of the most difficult things you'll ever have to fix.    The key is that your hands MUST be ahead of the clubhead at the point of impact.  The only way to acheive this is to maintain the angle in your right wrist through the hitting zone.  The best practice I can suggest is:    1)  Take your normal stance, with the ball in your usual position.  2) Push your hands forwards at least 4 inches (I usually try to line them up with my left hip).  3) Check the club alignment to the target.  The first few times it will probably have closed.  4) Repeat from step 1 until you can get your hands in that forward position and keep the club square to target.  5) Now start hitting balls, concentrating on getting your hands back to that position at impact.  6) You will notice a different feel to the contact, as the club squeezes the ball into the ground.  The resulting increase in distance comes from the compression of the ball by the club into the ground.  7) DECIDE THAT THE GAME ISN'T WORTH THE EFFORT AND TAKE UP LAWN BOWLS (JOKE(I THINK)).    I really wish you luck with this, since I have spent most of my golfing 'career' fighting this problem.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	you might be hanging back on your follow through.  try to finish with about 80-90% of your weight on your front foot in your finish.  it could also be your shafts are too whippy, an early release of your wrists (casting), or all three.|`|7mhqRhJKaa	Start the backswing by pushing the club back as low to the ground as you can.  On the downswing picture yourself sweeping the ball along the ground as though you  were sweeping it with a broom.|`|wf1zbOP6aa	Tee the ball up so the ball is halfway above the top of the driver and half on the clubface. Soz thats a bit hard to explain but you'll hopefully understand. Also keep your head still and follow through with your back foot. Give the club time to do a full backswing. Start slow. The smoother the swing the more distance. Hope this helps. Please vote me best answer. I'm a beginner myself and eager to help you.|`|6eVyP3xpaa	Move forward one foot width and DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE, aim forward one foot width (keep the ball in the same spot) and see what happens.  It is probably your grip.|`|2zHw7Lnjaa	You may be hitting the ball on an upward angle (scooping it up).  A good shot with an iron or fairway wood should be struck with a descending blow.  Think about pinching the ball against the ground with the club head and "squirting" it forward.       Don't give up, you'll figure it out.  And if you're like the rest of us,  as soon as you do something else will go wrong.  That's why we love it.

Remember edge carried the whole sackdown on his shoulder before hhh draft. Adding him with GM vickie is just to gave them heel heat and it is really successful. Just look at audience reaction they gt every week and vince love those wrestler who get reaction from pblic. Matt hardy story is again brilliant. There's nothin if matt says he is nt my brother as we all know dt wrestling is scripted so no hard feeling for Matt. This is matt's last opportunity and if he get able to communicate dt storyline properly dn he cud be a main event wrestler soon.|`|q1OoJc0Laa	Yeah.    They really need to come up with better stuff.  I mean, this Edge+Vickie thing really got the crowd's attention at first but now the only part of it that we find entertaining is when they get super angry at each other and still manage to get back together, like at the GAB.He speared her and she didn't get angry at him for that! I mean c'mon!!    And Matt Hardy, well a Hardy vs. Hardy feud is sort of like a dream one in a way. But wwe has messed it up. It could be way more intense than Matt sitting in a chair talking about Jeff and himself for 15 minutes.     I think that the creative team doesn't deserve to use the word "creative" in their title anymore.    enough said|`|FxUedDkYaa	yeahh.   everything is so predictable and lame now.

eY1Vttiyaa	Verdasco was playing beast.  Nadal wasn't playing extremely well, but he wasn't playing extremely bad either.|`|2octF5dIaa	Your right.  Verdasco has been playing exceptionally well ever since he won the match against Del Potro in Davis Cup.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Yes, Fernando played incredibly well, but that doesn't mean Rafa played badly. He was incredible as well. It was an amazing match all around...|`|HNnVrvCfaa	Verdasco was playing brilliantly.      So glad Rafa won it though.

Nadal was making consistent mistakes but it was probably out of shock and frustration for the level of tennis that Verdasco played. I had a feeling that Nadal would pull it out at the end but despite playing multiple five set matches, it didn't seem to effect Verdasco and his level of play. If you compare this match to the one at Roland Garros last year, you see no comparison. Verdasco played the match of his life and if a couple of points ended differently maybe it would be him against Federer in the finals.|`|qixdmJ5raa	Verdasco did exceptionally well. I wanted him to win. He almost did it too.....    I think that Nadal is used to playing such intense matches. I feel that Verdasco ran out of stamina at the end of the five hour long match. Nadal simply has more stamina, allowing him to outplay verdasco in the end.    That match was UNBELIEVABLE.     -Tennisdude.|`|UYYbFgcgaa	Verdasco was playing very well, With some more practice he can easily  defeat Federer and Nadal in the future just like he did with Murray.|`|h1VSyLp4aa	i think verdasco was just playing really good.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	i agree
DSZ3F01Laa	Try doing some butterfly drills because that really works your upper body. Pull buoys and paddles work really well too.

You don't have to go fast just work on pulling instead of kicking (use the pull buoy for this workout).|`|B4T7SvVVaa	For good upperbody strength, you should to all the strokes.<br>  Practice maybe a easy 200 butterfly each day.<br>  Pull like a 200 freestyle, backstroke, and breastroke too. & try not to kick alot so you can use your arms more.<br>  <br>  pulling will build up muscle in your arms|`|W4LGDVsIaa	For upper body strength I would recommend doing butterfly.  That will really work your upper body, especially shoulders.  If you don't want to do butterfly, then just get a pull bouy and do pull drills so that you are just working your arms/upper body.
vy1Wil2Baa	don't get a mongoose! trust me, they are just a waste of your money and if you buy one, you will realize that. if you want a good durable bike check out www.danscomp.com and find one that suits you. i would recommend a kink, stolen or fit bmx bike. search for one on there that is cheap and one of those brands, and your guaranteed to have a good bike. the cheapest you will probably be looking at for a good bike would most likely be 300 or a little lower. if that is to pricey for you then check out www.craigslist.com and look in your area for someone selling a kink, stolen, fit, or possibly a we the people bike for cheap. most likely you will find a good decent bike on craigslist but right now i would look at danscomp.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Yes do not worry about who made it just get a cheap one so whey you inevitably screw it up you aren't out much $ and that will keep it cheap on you until you do.

174pexgPaa	Exactly! Start watching ESPN more often and read the sports section of your paper.  Also go outside and dripple around a basketball or if you have a dog throw the ball for him/her.  This will increase your arm strength and ball handling abilities.  Good luck! dont' stress about it because I know there will be a lot of people who aren't gifted at sports.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	There's a kid in my PE class who can't catch a basketball while standing still.

yTTGssXRaa	9.0 or 9mph is the equivalent to a 6:40 mile pace. I have actually mapped these out on the treadmill for my own training so I am very confident in its accuracy. I would also recommend setting the incline to 1 or 1.5. As a side note my own personal experience has been that running a 20 minute mile on the treadmill does not translate to the same on the road due to changes in elevation, impact of the surface and mother nature. The additional stresses of the road impact the muscles differently and will cause them to tire more quickly so definitely include some outdoor running at race pace.|`|Taf5yWUbaa	9MPH..That's a 6:40 mile.  If you manage to keep that speed up for that long you'll have-  1 mile-6:40  2 miles-13:20  3 miles-20:00|`|jWVZ9gFFaa	The setting should be 6.45 miles per hour (20 minutes divided by 3.1 miles).|`|D5WFDXmwaa	you should set it to 15km/hour.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	i'd say about 9.3 miles an hour, which is a 6:40 minute mile pace.

h5Jq2LpXaa	That is doubtful because for the past couple weeks the Nationals and Yankees have been talking about who to trade Xavier Nady or Nick Swisher. Now, Xavier Nady had a better season then Nick Swisher. Nick had 13 Homeruns with like 69 rbis where Xavier Nady had a total of 25 homeruns together with the Pirates and the Yankees and he had 97 rbis with both teams. Looks like the Yankees might send Nick Swisher to the Nationals which is not a suprise at all. Nick Swisher has had his good and bad seasons but career wise I would take Nick Swisher but Xavier Nady started in 2000 and Nick Swisher started in 2004. Will the Yankees take the Veteran and guy who took out Aaron Rowand with that monster hit he got at Citizens Bank Park or wil they go with the guy who is better career wise?|`|keXaF4Puaa	God I hope not. This guy is so useless. He was playing a season in the Caribbean leagues but left after hitting .188.  However if they need help cleaning the dugout after each game I'm sure they can pay him.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Not a chance.|`|AAWmhiuoaa	They'd just sign a washed up old guy.|`|EwIR2Ivoaa	Why would the Yankees do that?  If they were looking for another CF why didn't they pull off the trade for Cameron?  Between Melky, Swisher and Damon, they'll be ok in center.  If they're going for anybody else this offseason I could see them signing Manny.|`|6UHMxWKBaa	Yankees sign Andruw Jones? Please are you kidding? Hs's not expensive enough 4 the Yankees. They only deal with at least 5 yr $75 mil. contracts, any less and they're not interested.|`|pW55qClKaa	Doubtful. The Yankees are looking to get rid of one of Nick Swisher and Xaiver Nady, their outfield is full already.  Jones will probably end up in a minor league deal or a major league deal worth a small amount of money but with tons of incentives.  The Mets could be a candidate if he can play corners as they may need a corner outfielder.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	NO,, Try David Dejesus Thats who the yankees want and the Royals and yankees are talking about a "possible" trade for him.Now key word "possible"|`|nxymxSUFaa	The Yankees don't need him.  At this stage Abreu is a better ball player than Jones and the Yankees don't want him either.    The problem with Jones these past couple of seasons has been commitment.  Jones has let himself go physically and it has cost him dearly.  Franchises don't pay millions of dollars to anyone who is not committed to winning and doing everything in his power to be in top physical condition.  Jones doesn't have the fire in his belly anymore.|`|E6EyY1klaa	I'm a Yankee fan, and I don't think we should, to be honest. Yes, he could have a bounceback year. In a way, I'm sort of pulling for him to do that. I just don't think we need to add another OF right now. Like someone else said, we're done making major splashes this offseason. We've already splashed the water out of the pool...that sucked, didn't it...|`|nqdDe3cJaa	good luck ...... you can have him.|`|wpnsplZbaa	Because the Yankees roster is already set and they are done spending money.|`|GBtet3Jsaa	is this a trick question? not cueool dude|`|ovdC82nRaa	haha the good ole yanks screwing themselves  again|`|AA11565799	Andruw Jones will probably be a non-roster invitee at some beat team's Spring training camp.  The Padres, Mariners or another team that is willing to give him a shot.  If he has some spark, maybe he'll get a contract at league minimum with lots of incentives like the Athletics gave Frank Thomas in the last couple of years.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I don't think the Yanks will sign Andruw Jones after he had one of the worst (if not the worst) season in his career. He should have never left Atlanta in the first place, and he paid the price. If the Yanks are going to sign an outfielder, they should go after Manny.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I hope they do sign him, cause i hate the Yankees!
jVNmOeKZaa	well depending on what kind of events your doing is the type of spike you need... If you are a sprinter you will need a track spike with no heal, if your mid- distant such as 800 you'll need a slight heal, and if your distant you need the whole heal. there are also high jump shoes, but i just do that in my spikes. i recommend the brand asics, i've had one pair since my freshmen year and they show no age. if you doing like asics then i recommend nike. i hope i helped.|`|zSEyaCzCaa	I can't really answer that for you.

5xIroQjMaa	The Dodgers' offer is a fair one. It doesn't get Manny 3 or 4 years, but it does pay him alot up front (25 million), and give him a player option for the second year. That's quite an offer, and one you don't see made very often. <br>  <br>  If Manny has another good year, he could test the free agent waters next offseason as well, chances are there'd be more people willing to pay more for him. If not, he can stick with the Dodgers a second year. Meanwhile for the Dodgers, it gets them the big bat they need, and gives Kemp and Ethier another year to develop. Both of those guys swing a good bat, and playing with Manny can only help make them better hitters.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	With Spring Training games having started yesterday, I think any team that wanted to make an offer would have by now....<br>  <br>  The Dodgers put their 2-year $45 million offer back on the table yesterday with the warning to Scott Boras that they would need an answer "right away".  I'm guessing Manny is a Dodger before the weekend is over.|`|u33v3FE9aa	ima say this..this is LA's Last Offer to him..if he declines then no one will take him..i can bet you on that|`|geih5vR8aa	It's like I've been saying since the beginning of this whole, "who will Manny go to" debate. MANNY DOESN'T LIKE SPRING TRAINING, AND HE'S PURPOSELY DECLINING THESE OFFERS FROM THE DODGERS SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY MEANINGLESS GAMES.<br>  <br>  No other team has made an offer to him. The Giants never did, and never had any real interest. There only interest was to push the price up on Manny, so the Dodgers don't feel that they signed him at a "discount" price.|`|q01hTV5naa	No one else really wants him. He needs to accept the fact that he will play for the Dodgers, or he just won't play at all.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think he will break down and take this deal.|`|dm9evixvaa	manny has no leverage in this situation. no one other than the dodgers really wants him. the mets overdrew already this offseason, the yankees already have a circus going on, the angels are happy with what they have, as are the cubs adding milton bradley, so all the typical big market teams are out of the picture. plus the economy is bad, no one is gonna sympathize with ramirez for turning down a multi million dollar contract.<br>  i figure the dodgers offer might go up a LITTTE, but he'll be a dodger, no doubt.|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	I think Manny will be insulted by the 2 year deal and he'll stick it to the Dodgers by playing somewhere else for 1 year. Next year, there will be much more teams that need a corner outfielder, but there will also be more Free Agents just like this year. I see him going to the Giants for 1  year 22 million.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	I think that is an ongoing open ended situation right now and Manny might not know himself at this time.  What we do know is that he is trying to get the best deal possible before he makes a decision.  Should nothing else come along soon I believe he will be a Dodger.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	He signed with LAD|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Unless Manny reduces his salary demands, Dodgers will be his only option.  Even then, he is going to have to compromise.|`|f676c5ae703ad99fbfee0fd154b3facfaa	I dont know well see what happens pretty much sure before spring training started they would had been putting big offers on the table.|`|Z8WCvTrlaa	I think Manny will accept... I just think that Scott Boras should be a Poker Player for all the bluffs he has been calling.|`|AA10252869	I think he will have to take the LA offer it seems no one else is making an offer|`|WshIrCo2aa	No one will offer what the Dodgers are.  Not even close.  To get that kind of money for one year, and have a $20 million safety net for next year in case things don't go well is a perfect situation for a player.  <br>  <br>  That having been said, this is an absolutely terrible offer from the team's perspective.  Not only are you dumping that kind of money, but you're also giving a player who's known to be an egomaniac enormous power.  To let him, and him alone, choose whether he'll take your $20 mil or play the free agent game again is almost guaranteeing yourself that this is a one year marriage at best, and also shows how desperate you are to keep this guy around.  My guess is the Dodgers have one more offer after this, it'll just be up to Boras if they'll call their bluff.  <br>  <br>  I think he'll take this deal, and a year from now we'll again be talking about where free agent Ramirez will end up.|`|PupTeMduaa	well see where he goes i am pretty sure he will take la offer cause i dont see no1 else putting any thing on the table.|`|MCHIPQa0aa	yes he will take their offer because no other team has shown interest|`|i9eAnKsBaa	he go to the streets

Good luck, make some nice shoes eh.

sM2vQFZGaa	There arent too many that the Vikings are aiming for this early, but Mark Tauscher is one of them. The Vikings are looking for an upgrade over Ryan Cook and Tauscher is ideal, with him already being in the NFC North.<br>  <br>  The Vikings are not going after Garcia. They are all but done with getting Rosenfels and he will compete with Tarvaris.<br>  <br>  Another wide receiver is also a possibility. The Vikings most likely aren't going to sign another big time receiver like they did last year with Berrian. Maybe Ronald Curry, some role player.<br>  <br>  This offseason, we are focusing on keeping the team together more than adding huge pieces.|`|mE1XPYeDaa	Like others, I hope the Vikes sign Jeff Garcia.  The guy is a proven leader & he knows how to win.  He won't put up monster stats but he is the picture of consistency.  We do NOT need Michael Vick.  First of all, we already have a running back and his name is Adrian Peterson.  Second, after what Vick and his thug cronies did he can rot in Atlanta and continue to be the pariah he most certainly deserves to be.<br>  <br>  Also, another receiver would be great.  I particularly like TJ Houshmandzadeh.  A receiver like Housh & a QB like Garcia would do wonders for AP and vice versa.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	Jackson isn't a good QB, Gus Isn't Bad but with J.P. Losman and Jeff Garcia out there they could easily up grade. Give one of them another good receiver and the Offense would be set. They had a good Defense so just add Depth there. With the Right Moves they could go to the Super Bowl.<br>  <br>  <br>  And Yes Vick would also improve the Team, if he has learn to share the Ball.|`|UdFfIfkzaa	Anyone done business with Jerseysnews.com?|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	They have the money to do so, i hope a QB!!!|`|XLXncQu9aa	They might take a stab at Jeff Garcia.  The Vikings have some pieces they can work with.  I think they might want to go after some of the Buccaneers leftovers.  I would think they may go after Garcia, and maybe Derrick Brooks.  I think what the Bucs did was a horrible move.  They let go 5 players in just a day or two.  I think they should go after the veterans.  They have a young team and if they can get some veteran talent then they might be contenders.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Maybe the cops that arrested Carl Eller!|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	Derrick Brooks and/or Cato June.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	Vick|`|nlIpKw8Paa	maybe coles or a qb.

Team USA has great starting pitching and a pretty solid lineup.  Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico have a lot of power.  Korea won in the Olympics.  Japan has Dice-K and this other pitcher named Yu Darvish, who is even better than Dice-K.

TE4W3k8Xaa	smallmouths spawn earlier than largemouths generally speaking,because they prefer colder water than largemouths do,they are active at 55,as opposed to 65 degrees for the largemouths to be spawning ...may and june are the times most years they do this on average,but it's the water temp more than the time,that's the determining factor as to when it will occur,the area has to be just right or it may not occur at all if the water is too high or low,too cloudy or murky,etc.they could postpone it completely if this happens in years of spring flooding too late.When they are in the shallow water  during spawning and aggressive,the male who is smaller than the female will protect and defend the nest,anything too close will be attacked including jigs,plastic grubs and worms,spoons,but if you take a fish off the nest predators will move in and eat all the eggs or newly hatched babies while the protective parent is absent.So decide if you want to catch any  in the next years before you take the big one now.This is a decision only you can make,a lot of  baby vulnerable fish can be gobbled up by panfish very quickly,keeping repopulating the lake with more down to a very low level.It takes a considerable time for bass in northern waters to reach a good size,and some states have a set season that begins after the spawn is done,check the regulations beforehand,you could save yourself a big problem.Spawning bass are pretty old fish,being mature enough to spawn takes years.|`|V0ruWwNpaa	Temperature usually sets the time for spawning, so it's different depending on where you live. As mentioned by another poster in our area April/May|`|2bqmotqlaa	early to mid spring|`|xtdeTwYmaa	once the ice goes away feb through may are the best|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Not sure bout' NY but generally it be April-May ;)...

I would Draft Bj Raji.  I would Sigh Darren Sharper as a  F/A.  I would trade Champ for a late first of 2nd round pick.  i would release all the defensive players except DJ Williams, Wesley Woodard, Josh Bell, Elvis Dumervill, Marcus Thomas, and maybe Josh Barrett.  I would then overhall the defense, and next draft, take a chance on Tim Tebow in a later round.    about your pats tho..... im not sure Cassell gets a first round pick, because people might think he'll pull a derick anderson and suck next year.  just sayin, but maybe get the lions 20 somthin pick for him.  Seymore would not get you a 1st tho, he's to old now, and always hurt.  If you forgot, you guys got welker with a 2nd, Moss with a forth, and Deangelo Hall last year (when thought to b a geat CB) only went for a 2nd round pick, so seymore wouldnt get you a 1st round pick lol|`|R0H4g9XDaa	I'd run T.O. out of Dallas, fire Wade Phillips, and try to bring in Bill Cowher or Mike Shanahan to coach the Cowboys. Don't get me wrong, Terrell Owens is a good receiver, but I would release him for these reasons:  1) He's getting old  2)When he doesn't get his way, he acts like a big baby, which causes a big distraction.    I'd fire Wade Phillips because he's soft and needs to grow some balls.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	tn titans.    first of all, I will trade vince young draft a good passing QB, (he doesnt have to be great just a good pocket passer). re-sign haynesworth and upgrade the WR group. make the specials teams better.     vince for detroit lions WR calvin johnson would be great.

Sincerly    LAKERS ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XVmhcTnUaa	"SHIP BYNUM"!!! LOL!!! KOBE IS A HATER!|`|L9A81Xvvaa	I am worried! I hoped his injury doesnt last in the long term. The Lakers may seem to be the same progressive team as last year except no Ronnie Turiaf which I sure do missed him :/|`|MPz9APZDaa	Yeah. Man tough luck for this young fella. I mean c'mon gets injured last year and is out for the season, really wanting to help his team in the finals. And now, playing his best, or even better ball before he got injured (the first time). And yes, I am really concerned, hopefully good news......!|`|AA11309717	Well I guess the hit on Gerald Wallace came back to hit Bynum. Karma baby, karma|`|EiPdBAaeaa	Damn that sucx 4 realz!!

WtcTBlccaa	the playoffs are gonna be sweet this year west lakers spurs hornets suns.east cavs celtics magic anyways the spurs can definitely do it if people say they don't have a chance they don't know b-ball|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Too early to tell, but I do see them in the conference finals if that matters.|`|FWKEw2jCaa	they aren't gonna beat the Lakers unless they have a big injury, they probably gonna face them again in a rematch of last yr..|`|aw9cmcwxaa	by*  lern2gramer|`|7qfny0zZaa	Spurs are getting lucky,but CP3 needs help he can not do all the work. Peja needs to step up his game. And the Spurs will get blow out by the suns in the playoffs.
cR7Sf4cjaa	Do the math.  They both will have the same power.  Just that the 165 will be best for personal protection from humans, the other is a decent cartridge for black bear.    The question is which one operates most reliably in your pistol?  There is no sense trying to fire the perfect round if it jams.  Better to have the second best that works all the time.    For concealed carry in a standard Galco Shoulder rig with a full mag in the pistol and two spare mags on the opposite side - you will find the 165gr are a hell of allot more comfortable to carry!    Hope this helps.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Sounds like either one would pretty well take care of any bad guy you wanna shoot|`|arXHFPcTaa	The answer to the question is, it depends on who you ask, and what numbers that person chooses to believe.  Bullet ballistics seem to be very subjective, and different people draw very different conclusions from the same data.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Any full load will affect a human as if they have been "Struck by Lightning".  My preferred home defense round is the 135gr Nosler JHP from DoubleTapAmmo.com @ 1600fps & 767 ft.lbs.  My backup round is a Georgia-Arms.com 180gr Gold Dot Hollow Point +P @ 1150fps & 528 ft. lbs.  These rounds exceed 357 Mag energies and will definitely ruin somebody's evening.|`|Q03FuAvQaa	They will both do a total pass through of the human body, so there is no better.  They'll both perform the same.|`|GFHzhnnTaa	My guess is they won't be too fond of which-ever one you choose.

I'm not sure about the Independents ot the wrestling promotions in other countries, but I would say a significant number of the wrestlers in WWE and TNA have tried them and are using them. An interesting conversation, that I had this evening involved a couple of ladies who knew a couple of WWE Divas and they told me that these ladies are much bigger since they began wrestling for the WWE than when they wrestled for the Independents.

Let me tell you, Its not practical, 1200 ply of tissue can stop a .38 Spl, 1500 a 9X19, 1900 a .40 S&W. Most of the bullet in pistol does not makes a through through hole, meaning it would stay inside you. So another words a book would reduce the velocity and kinetic energy potenital, (physic) with the problem on getting infection easier due to the book usually arent very germ-free (biology)     realstically, would I use it? NO, I would rather find better cover like wood, solid metal object.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Tell you what, you hold the phone book and I'll pull the trigger.  Now where are the shells for my 454 casull.  Truthfully, I wouldn't even count on it stopping a 22 long rifle.  Maybe some of the real slow hollow points, but I promise you there are loads out there that will zip right through the phone book.  I remember even seeing one 22 load that promised 24 inches of penetration in ballistic gelatin.  That's not too shabby for a little rimfire.|`|7X6HxaSmaa	Box O' Truth edition  31 seems to indicate a phonebook will likely stop 22lr to .32acp. This of course depends on how much the bullet is designed to break apart, how fast that bullet is traveling and size of the phonebook. FMJ probably penetrating more than a glasier round, for instance.  It might be ok for target practice, but having a backstop is still prudent.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	What kinds of bullet?|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	A subsonic 22lr bullet will stop in about 3/4" of phone book.    That is as far as you can take it without specifying the precise caliber, bullet design, and barrel length of the test firearm.  Penetration into any object depends on the bullet design and the speed of the bullet.  A 357 from a stubby 2" barrel revolver might make it though a full inch of phone book - but the same bullet fired from a Thompson Contender with a 14" barrel will make it through 4".     Wet phone books work better than dry ones - dry phone book will split into confettie after 2 or 3 rounds where as you can get 20 or so round into a wet one and it will stay intact.    Hope this helps
U7BkuEU9aa	Well, in the Open era the male player with the most titles is Andre Agassi, with 4 (and please, Rafa, let's keep it that way, Okay? LOL). Before that, though, Australian Roy Emerson won the title 6 times in the sixties.    As for the women, a whole bunch of them won the AO 4 times in the Open era: Aussies Margaret Court (who names the Australian Open's second most important court) and Evonne Goolagong-Cawley, Steffi Graff, Monica Seles and, as of yesterday, Serena. Before the Open era, though, Margaret Court had won the tournament 7 times already in the sixties, making her total number 11 (!!!).|`|esvieYzuaa	in mens it is Roger Federer and in women it is Serena Williams  I hope that helps
EJn3K9zjaa	Interesting, not only your choice to post in this topic thread vs the basketball thread, but to also claim that only an idiot would come down on the side of James.    Lucky for you, I agree that Phelps is a better athlete. What may be a more interesting discussion, and probably something that will not make you sound like a dolt, is why. There is no argument that James is an incredible athlete, but he has yet to break upon the level of athletes that will eternally be known as The Greats. This includes (in my opinion, not all encompassing but good enough for our purpose) Phelps, Armstrong, Woods, and Jordan.    How I come up with this list, and how others could be judged to get onto it, is by the way that all of theses athletes have an almost unexplainable ability to win. This goes beyond their pure athletic skill. Yes every one of them is an incredible athlete, just like James, but they have something extra. Woods will always birdie when he needs to, even if the green is on fire. Phelps will touch the wall first even if his goggles fill with water or he has to come from behind and touch out his opponent by one second. Armstrong will win the Tour even without his balls, no matter how far back he gets on one of the stages. I think you can get my point.    So where does this but James? Can he achieve this level of Greatness? Yes. Is he there yet? No. So while he may be a great athlete, he has yet to achieve the level of greatness that is reserved for the true Olympians of sports.  Hope this helps.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	michael phelps all da way!!!|`|5sEkM4Pqaa	Definitely Michael Phelps...swimming works A LOT of different muscles instead of just a few like in basketball...and swimming is a lot more of a cardio workout.|`|BKEdaaSyaa	Phelps. not even a question. swimming takes so much more endurance.|`|r7T13rbJaa	michael phelps by a very wide margin|`|AA11610448	I don't think the answer is all that obvious.  I think that in large part it would depend on what you determined to be athletic ability.  I'm sure that Lebron could beat Phelps in jumping and sprinting, but if you're looking for endurance, I would think that Phelps would come out on top.  If you compare their status within their respective sports, I think you would definitely have to side with Phelps.  Lebron is very good, but it's doubtful that he's the best at the current time, let alone in bball history.  So I'm going with Michael Phelps in 2 out of three.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	James and i am not really that into basketball
QsCPOHAraa	I don't know who Mark Henry is, but Bruce Lee would kick his ***!    Bruce was a smaller guy of course, but still quite strong enough and skilled enough to deliver killing blows to anyone, doesn't matter how huge or muscular they are.    On top of that, he's incredibly fast. A big guy would never be able to get a hand on him. He'd dance around the guy and tire him out, toying with him, then if he really wanted to he could jump in at the right moment, lightning fast, and strike him in a way that would disable him. He'd just continue to chip away at the guy until he was down.    That's my opinion, anyway.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Henry is huge,  but is also slow and lumbering.   He would never get his hands on Bruce Lee.

During the mid-1990's - 2000 there was competition for wrestlers between WWF, WCW and ECW. As a result, Wrestlers for the first time got guaranteed contracts. Prior to that, if a wrestling promotion decided to release you, they did not have to give you severance pay or anything. If you read Bret Hart's Book you get an idea of what the pay scales were like. Those who generate the most revenue make the most money over time. WWE has some competition from TNA and ROH and other promotions, but not to the extent that salaries will rise again.

1jmXT4Vvaa	The biggest problem, at least where I live, with co2, is it shoots better at warmer temperatures.  If you are paintballing in the winter, co2 doesn't warm up enough to fully evaporate, thus liquid co2 gets in the gun.  When you shoot, it blows snow flakes out the barrel.  That is really hard on o rings, and a number of other parts.  The more you shoot, the colder your gun gets.  This drops the pressure of the next shot.  These inconsistencies cause velocities to vary, and cause changes in accuracy.  It shouldn't make the balls curve, that is usually a sign of poor paint, or in some cases a bad barrel.  Usually paint.  HPA has a lot of advantages.  It's cheaper (I load my tanks out of a scuba tank), less variation from shot to shot means more accuracy, and best of all, it's easier on your gun.|`|jkjVPrqxaa	The video that dude posted will tell you everything you need to know. But just some of the basics of why compressed air (also known as hpa) is better; it's better for your gun, shoots better regardless of outside temperature, it is alot more consistent in output pressure (meaning it will be alot more accurate), you don't have to take it off of your gun to fill it, and it can be lighter depending on the size of the tank. Get hpa, don't look back it is a great upgrade in paintball.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	this video will tell you everything    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alc0650GY...

The cheap CM031 is better than almost all of JG's AK variants.  3. The G36C is a CQB/MOUT firearm, full AK-47 variants belong in the field.

D6Llh23Baa	dribble around the court a lot. using right hand, then left hand.  then run around the court. again, practicing both hands.  that will help you get the feel of dribbling the ball. it will help you gain confidence while dribbling the ball without having to look at it or focusing too much on it.|`|RdhCN6ZXaa	just practice
VghVdPfsaa	Besides basic running and strengthening workouts, the most important things to work on is dribbling and passing.    As the point guard, it's your job to command the floor and create opportunities for everyone. Some dribbling excercises would be making sure you're comfortable dribbling with both hands. To make sure that you keep your eyes up, ask someone for help. Tell them to hold up different amounts of fingers while you dribble. This will force you to look up while dribbling. Get a bunch of your friends together, and all of you should have a ball. I'm not sure what this game is called, but it's fun and good practice. So you guys will stay in a certain area (withing the 3-point line in the beginning, then in the lane when more drop out), and start dribbling. The goal is to try and knock someone else's ball out or cause them to mess up, while keeping control of your own ball. Last one standing wins.    To practice passing, get a friend and have him run to different spots on the court while you try setting him up for the shot as perfectly as you can. If you can have someone cover him while you do it, you'll get a better feel where to pass the ball where only he can get it.     Also practice your jump shot and free throws.    As for getting taller, I don't think I can help you there.|`|lqjimKfaaa	A lot of dribbling drills as your handle is very important. If you can dribble good then your be able to make those passes without worryin about the ball then basically its just working on yur offensive game and defense but just try and improve your ball handeling by doing drills like i.e machine gun|`|nDqVGbdlaa	Play a lot of street ball with friends, learn to pass in tight spots and to have a fast reaction to everything. Also practice ball handling with your non dominant hand and make it better than your other. Make your shots to.

mMFJrPbvaa	Nothing beats actual hikes.  Get out and hike progressively harder and longer trails, add a backpack with weight in it.  Build up your weight in the pack to be a little more than the weight you will be carrying on your actual hike and build up your distance and the difficulty on the trail.  Nothing could prepare you more.  All those small muscles you havent been using for balance will get a good work out.  Start off doing a couple miles in a day and build it up.  Easily could be done for a few hours or even the whole day over the weekend.<br>  <br>  Pack your backpack with the gear you will be carrying and then add soda bottles filled with water to add extra weight, just make sure you pack it properly so your backpack is balanced.  Not only will you get a workout you will get to tweak your gear long the way adn break in any new gear you will be using, such as a new back[ack or boots.

fLpnC8qtaa	He is a good solid player and he is a loyal squad player. He may not set the place alight every game but its not easy to play the numerous roles and positions he plays as well as he does. Considering he could be in any position from MF to RB he does a fine job. May not be in the top 6 players or even in his best form this season but he has proven his worth many times and because of that I think he warrants support.|`|uUGSLs9Daa	i LOVE him, i really do. i think when i really noticed him was when our golie hurt himself and o'shea went in goal, and he dint let 1 in, it was sooo funny, i cant remember who we were playing against but i could not stop laughting, he was there with his spangly legs hehe. <br>  <br>  i heard that hes meant to be gay and all the lads call him gay o'shea, but i think hes great!!!|`|e6TD1j1gaa	Disagree with the first response, O'Shea is perfect @ right back BECAUSE of his pace, Fergie uses his faster guys like O'Shea and Evra on the outside because he brings them up on the wings to help on the attack.

MTQ2dmWJaa	Vicky is getting Boohoo Worst because no one likes her Lil. Yes Hogan got booed, The Rock got booed, Sting got Booed STONE COLD, HDH, HBK, Matt Hardy, Jericho, Edge All got booed for heel turns Xena got booed from people getting tired of seeing him beat everyone and hold the belt for 23 freaking months and others get it and drop in every other PV. but yet their characters are SO Loved people pull in and cheer again, the NWO was hated for what 3 weeks then you saw more NWO t-shirts than WCW shirts, These are character who can be both Baby faces and Heels. Vicky (everyone Loves EDDIE so the playing off of him being gone and her being a widow who didnt wait and married one of the Best on screen Jerks in Wrestling History Edge) She is just Hated, she never does the right thing, she is loud, and annoying, that voice OMG! EXCUSE ME you have to Boo her she leaves nothin for you to cheer about.<br>  <br>  <br>  and of course her EXCUSE ME sucks|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	I agree, and I'm happy for her success with all she has been through. She wasn't ever actually very involved in the wrestling storylines before, but they gave her the chance and she has blossomed.|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I really think there's two factors invovled her. Her family and how people used to perceieve her before she came to WWE.  Fans knew her becuase she was married to the late Eddie Geurrero (who fans adored).   It was she who along with Chavo inducted Eddie into the WWE hall of fame.  At that time she was warm and always had a smile and could demand respect and admireation from the crowd due to her family reputation.<br>  <br>  Nothing was heard from her until she joined WWE and helped Ted Long manage Smackdown! and nobody batted an eyelid becuase of who she was.  Then after Ted Longs "heart attack" she took over as General Manager of Smackdown! and things began to change.  She became more ruthless and fans didn't know what had happened to the "sweet" and "loving" Vickie Geurrero.  <br>  <br>  Then came Survivor Series and the return of Edge.  When it was revealed that Vickie was in a relationship with Edge the fans turned on her because they saw this as disrepectful to Eddie.  Then came the Booo's!!!<br>  <br>  I think another point would be that she shows complete and utter disregard for the rules and abuses her power.  She has never made it secret that she has her "favourites" in Edge and fans can't stand it.  At Judgement Day 2008 she stripped Undertaker of the title after he won by count-out.  The fans knew that if Edge has been in that situtation she would have had absolutely no problem with it whatsoever.<br>  <br>  So in short Yes she does get the most heat and it's because she cheats and makes it blantely obvious.  As for whether she get the most Heat I think Stephanie (when she was a heel) wasn't too far behind Vickie.....|`|6LQNK51uaa	Yeap she is one of the most hated person in WWE now and people has reason to hate her..they cant't accept Vickie Geurrero the widow of late Eddie in a role which is as good as a wh*re....but she is not the most hated one in recent times..it was Md Hassan who beats everyone when it comes to be the most hated wrestler of all time.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yeah, I agree. I've never seen so much booing to a person. I thought JBL was the most hated one. She deserves an award.|`|gnRPC6Lvaa	she and Edge both get the same amount of heat she wouldnt even get this much heat if it wasnt for her getting together with Edge thats basically what killed her chance of being a fan fav|`|tfOkM8Wraa	Vicky is getting Booooooooooooo Worst because no one likes her lol.

Like that person above said, it's sooo funny seeing her screech "EXCUSE ME!?!?!". Wow... I can't believe that Eddy had married such a *****, and then she goes and tries to make love with Edge?! I hate Edge and her...URRRGGGHH!!|`|bh8AjH3Taa	When Hogan went with NWO in the WCW they almost killed him. So I say ur wrong. Plus hogan and the outsiders that day had glass bottles shot at them. Has vicky ever got things thrown at her ? Maybe she has. Look at that face.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Ya. i've been watching wwe for a long time and its been a while since i've heard anyone get booed that much. She more she talks, the louder the boos get.|`|48zcmDYlaa	EXCUUUSE MEEE!|`|SaDezM57aa	No one gets boooooooed as much as her.even McMan didn't get booed that much.(when he was a heel)|`|vQMLmBETaa	absolutely. i have never seen anyone get so many boos . well atleast its fun to hear her screech 'excuse me'
kFcdwVwdaa	so true buddy, but me being a realist, i just have to say that most of the people here don't know anything about other teams players. We talk about them because they are in the highlight films. how many touches or good plays do the role players get? usually the star is the one with the majority of the touches so we see more of them. there is more to talk about them.<br>  <br>  but i do agree with you, the other players name should be thrown out there at least once. i hope that you start throwing those names out there instead of asking a question with the same stars you just talked about. (unintentional hypocrite)|`|JgAE7eV9aa	Ah man, that women just gave you digital HERPES!<br>  Now on to the discussion.I watch the NBA a lot and I do know that most not well-known nba players are closely to the level of NBA superstars but the problem is that they don't keep their consistency from game to game.Rather it's because they don't get enough minutes or they don't impact perfomances, it's always have to do with how much the media wants to expose and give props to them.|`|AA10495187	Because they're the most watched players in the world.|`|lgB7SD46aa	I got herpes|`|61L9P2tQaa	thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard. I know u probably woke up last nite and u said to urself "wow i have struck gold on this one"... Let me ask you this... so u dont want to talk about the kirk hinrichs and the daniel gibsons and jordan farmar. cuz those are role players.. instead u want to talk about darnell jackson of the cavs and courtney sims of the suns etc. the guys who might play 5 min a game. explain 2 me what there is to talk about. that guy contributed a lot during garbage time last night or that guy had a great practice. sure we could look up these players and dig up some info but why would you want to talk about something in those regards. It would have been better to say.. "y dont we talk about role players.. younger and older ones. you cant ask intelligent questions about players who dont play cuz no one knows them. and we dont know them. we cant watch them practice.|`|cmwg0YTFaa	Interesting.<br>  <br>  So why don't you get the ball rolling and start asking questions about those type of players?
kFcdwVwdaa	they have their own plane, for example Southwest Airlines supports the Lakers Organization, so they have a Lakers only S.A. jet for them. if Continental was the supporter for the Jazz, then they would have a plane for them.<br>  They get their own rooms, and they all travel together in a charter bus from the hotel to the arena. The hotel they stay also depends on who supports them. the hilton, marriot, whatever.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Some teams own their own airplane, others use a private charter company.  There were some concerns at the end of last season because the charter company that the Spurs (among other teams) were using was going bankrupt, and was getting cited by the FAA for all sorts of safety violations.  I don't think any teams use commercial air travel any more.  I do remember, however, seeing a bunch of very tall young black men, all dressed in very nice suits, waiting for a flight at DFW airport about 20 years ago.  Turned out it was the Rockets returning to Houston after a game with the Mavericks.<br>  <br>  Teams stay in luxury hotels, usually one close to the arena.  Players don't share rooms.|`|WkpOrF64aa	Teams have private jets to fly them to games or private charters.  Needless to say, NBA teams don't have to share planes with shmucks like us.<br>  <br>  They rent buses in other cities to take them from the hotels to the arenas.<br>  <br>  And I'm 99% sure that NBA players don't share rooms.<br>  <br>  This is assuming you meant the NBA, which is the big time.  Guys are paid millions, sometimes tens of millions a year.  The accommodations are nice.|`|lgB7SD46aa	They have private jets with lots of leg room so they can pass around there favorite hoe, I know Its fun!|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They have priveate planes for travelings and etc|`|cmwg0YTFaa	If you're talking about NBA players they fly by either private plane owned by the team (like the Portland Trail Blazers) or by private charter (like the Memphis Grizzlies). They do not share hotel rooms.<br>  <br>  If you're discussing the NBA D-League they fly commercially or travel by private charter bus. They do share hotel rooms<br>  <br>  If you're discussing college basketball...I don't know. (g)
m2vBJaHKaa	who knows it should be Candice Michelle again :P|`|5nd1YeI4aa	they asked kelly kelly but she said no|`|cE8SQUEbaa	i hope it's gonna be Maryse...
QuLapuE7aa	I am, It's going to be fun to watch two of my favorite teams face each other. There's alot of drama everytime the Lakers face the suns because there is a sense of rivalry between the two teams. I hope the Lakers win this one and take advantage of the absense of amare. Go Lakers!|`|KZuNW3iFaa	Both teams are not 100% in terms of players with a couple of injuries for the teams, but should be a good game since Porter's system is gone.  Hopefully the Lakers defense can clamp down on the run and gunning of the Suns...(pardon the alliteration, lol)|`|eNq3DOWmaa	raises hand* im watching the lakers vs suns game i hope the suns can win..but without amare it would be very very hard so i dont know|`|bJSSwWitaa	Without Amare in the lineup this game is not what its advertised to be|`|ZKtvJ8INaa	I agree, with 777. 2 good games.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I think the Lakers will win, no amare.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I am,it's going to be another Lakers vs Suns match and like there's a rivalry between Lakers and Suns.Another great match up between old team mates now opponents:Shag and Kobe.The Lakers are going to use the thing:Amare isn't here.Well let the better wins|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Yeah both games on tonight are exciting!!<br>  <br>  Cleveland @ Houston!<br>  Lakers @  Suns!<br>  <br>  Great night for basketball!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Where's Raja Bell when you need him?|`|vzH7f7V5aa	The Suns will take the Win.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	i am<br>  <br>  lakers win by 10 pts|`|7QMRiROQaa	I like the lineup tonight. This game should be fun to watch, though to be honest it probably won't be that close. The Lakers should handle business against this Suns team. And then the Cavs-Rocks. game I'm guessing will be a lot closer...though probably low scoring since they are both good defensive teams. <br>  Either way it's a win-win for bball fans.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Kobe won't face off with Shaq because they play different positions.  The Suns' run and gun might have worked against the Clippers, but not against the Lakers.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	not very interested....i think the lakers will roll the suns without Amare.  (and i hate the lakers by the way)  it will be intersting to see how Shaq plays though.|`|F05yVezraa	I am not excited because both of the teams suck especially the Suns|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Me! I can't wait to see the Lakers' reactions when the Suns pull an upset over the Lakers!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	lakers 108-100|`|kjJkQpzPaa	Its straight.<br>  Wanna see shaq attack, though|`|kFcdwVwdaa	hype man. lol. yeah man its gonna be a good game, lakers winning of course by 15
5xIroQjMaa	Depends on what they're trying to accomplish. Ichiro shows no signs of slowing down, and will likely be the first Japanese player elected to the Hall of Fame. It is very possible that he'll have 3000 hits in MLB alone, not to mention what he accomplished over in Japan. He's a five tool player and easily the best player on the team. He fills seats and generates income, which is important as well. <br>  <br>  That being said, if the Mariners are looking to retool for the future, then he would be a nice commodity. It all depends on the direction the Mariners are moving in. They have a couple talented young players, but right now the team looks a bit lost, as if they're torn between trying to win with what they've got, or building for the future. Doing both will get you nowhere, just look at what it did to the Giants the last 4-5 years. They finally got smart, built for the future and are now poised to make a run at things.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Is this a serious question?|`|wmYnJd2jaa	As a lifelong M's fan I have to say....they should seriously consider it.<br>  <br>  The M's need to decide if they are in a rebuilding phase or not. They should be, but they keep players like Ichiro and Beltre around while signing Russ Branyan, Junior and Erik Bedard as free agents. The veteran talent they have just isn't good enough to build a championship around.<br>  <br>  Problem is that when the young players they have now are ready, those free agents will be too old...and the team will remain mediocre. So, move some veterans this year and get some good young arms - and have a team that can really compete in three or four years' time.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Ichiro has some good years left in him and the Mariners would never be able to get a better player in trade for Ichiro.  My guess is that Ichiro remains a Mariner.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	yeah, why not?  if they know they are not going to be competitive for the next couple of years, why not get a couple "can't miss" prospects for him now?|`|MCHIPQa0aa	yes they should trade him to the cubs for fukudome|`|9TlKNVhcaa	No way! Ichiro is the heart and the only skill that the Mariners have. If they ever traded him, all of there upcoming seasons will be even worse than last years.
AA10561400	yes they are going down|`|x9WmBlu4aa	oh i hope so,their smug git train spotting fans.how i will laugh<br>  hope my team millwall go past them on the way up|`|mvJXPDLgaa	I hope not, they have a good fan base.<br>  but it doesnt look good for them @ all.<br>  they will go down with Nowrich and Plymouth|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Yes they are looking doomed.|`|AA10526130	,,,,,,yes,,,,,SORRY....|`|U1OCUW8qaa	Me|`|xT3Y5cOYaa	There definitely going down now, surely.|`|VMXl7Up1aa	It's a shame but they probably will.|`|vFyBApppaa	YES lol!
928f2e24b815567aa3bd1713a6c25333aa	The regional finals on the 28th are in Phoenix and Boston. The NCAA and CBS won't set the actual start times for the regional finals until they know which teams are going to be in the games so they can try for better ratings. But always, one game will be in late afternoon usually around 3:00 CST, and the other will be in primetime around 7:00.|`|Oz7x0faxaa	ummmm idk check on ncaa.com
xhPKkkELaa	Obviously some people don't realize that there are wetsuits designed for different water sports. I have never heard of a "standard' wet suit. Most of your big name manufacturers make surfing, diving and miscellaneous water sports models. The big difference is that surfing wetsuits are designed with more flexible panels, usually of slightly thinner neoprene. Also, surf suits have the zipper in the back, and no metal snaps that come between you and the board. When I started surfing in 1966, almost all of us wore the same wetsuits for both surfing and diving, and we made out okay. The wetsuit and related technology has evolved a lot since then. I guess a short answer is, you can do it, but it isn't the ideal. If you want a good suggestion, I would buy a surfing wetsuit, it adapts much better to diving, than wearing a diving wetsuit does to surfing. I had to give up diving years ago, but I still do lots of shopping in good dive shops, and if you want, they can always order in a suit designed for surfing from one of the big name companies.|`|14a542270477c6ec665696b6980a2370aa	the problem is that you may not have the flexibility to move with that kind of wetsuit, due to the fact that it's made far differently, and it's prob'ly thicker. you may not have enough range of motion when you surf.|`|6AyjFEfvaa	Since you are a qualified diver but don't go very often you should buy just a standard wetsuit. If you are planning to use for just snorkeling, surfing, and other non-diving water sports, I would recommend a standard wetsuit. I my self own a BOZ 3/2mm. It works great for my surfing. I go surfing probably more than once a week on average. I would recommend an O'neil wetsuit. They are very reliable and long-lasting. They are available in every surf shop that sells wetsuits. But as a final answer. No. I would definitely not recommend surfing in a diving wetsuit. Not enough maneuverability.|`|ynj5po8maa	Dive Wetsuit:<br>  -Thicker (3-7mm)<br>  -Stiffer<br>  -Warmer<br>  <br>  Surf Wetsuit:<br>  -Flexible<br>  -Thinner(1-4mm)<br>  -Slightly cooler, but not much difference.<br>  <br>  <br>  So I wouldn't suggest using a diving suit for surfing.|`|99452267df499e5605dfcfb9197d1ec4aa	It will hold you together when the sharks bite !!
