Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.

3bFrdnHfaa	I would get the Intel C2D.    For one thing, it runs cooler; no need for fans and cooling systems (unless overclocking is your thing). And its an Intel - generally better overall build and quality.    If I were you though, I would wait until the Intel i7 processor gets more mainstream (and therefore cheaper). Core 2 Duo, is to some extent, old technology now. Plus, new standards are set to come out this year (USB 3.0, Wi-Fi Final N, DDR-3 Ram). So, I would wait. But if you have to buy, I'd get the C2D.    Went AMD once before. Never going that path again.

A quad core processor gives you more performance in the following cases:    * The computer is being used by many individual users for X11 or other graphics systems  * A samba file server and a web server will benefit from more cores.  * Heavy encrypting / decrypting benefits from more than two cores    For any other uses, like games, running picture editors, audio applications or video editing you should get a fast dual core machine instead.|`|WtwpzZXiaa	i would recommend the Phenom II 940 (3.0ghz X 4 cores) 2 MB level 2 cache (4 x 512kb),  6MB level 3 cache,     ocable to 3.5-3.8 ghz  on air     benchmarks shows it can hold up to some of the i7's benchmarks in certains areas|`|uTFuciitaa	Depends on what you want it for the faster duel core is better for gaming but for large number crunching programs like Excel the quad core would be better as it is more powerful.

Multi-core is great when you have different apps running at the same time, but for a single app, the advantages decline.  If you have a specific game in mind, you should check on the internet chatrooms for the experienced performance.  EG - Flight Suim X is supposed to take advantage of all four cores.  For other programs, high clock speed, cache and good graphics card are probably a better bet.    Currently, the dual core system you offer is a great system.|`|ZLI8Ogdlaa	I agree with Sosa.

iUTY2LR1aa	The best way in my opinion would be to do a System Restore, which will undo all your fonts changes and restore your system to a stable state it was before you fiddled with it.    (Start->All programs->Accessories->System Tools->System Restore)  Choose Restore my computer to an earlier time (or something like that) and select a restore point from an earlier date than the date you changed your fonts.    Note that this will undo all changes you've made to your system since, so if you need the new fonts you will have to install them again after the restore is complete. Just do it carefully this time, maybe one by one.

Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies", and "history".  Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without   having to buy or install anything, please click on my avatar   and send send me a message -- ideally with your YouTube   channel or email address. I'll guide you step-by-step, using  plain English and with full explanations.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible.   Not only does it conflict with and ruin YouTube, clicking on   "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"   in order to play smoothly. You don't need anything else.    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|34yKqNaQaa	Defrag your computer.

lRpECZLuaa	A video card, also known as a graphics accelerator card, display adapter, or graphics card, is a hardware component whose function is to generate and output images to a display. It operates on similar principles as a sound card or other peripheral devices.    The term is usually used to refer to a separate, dedicated expansion card that is plugged into a slot on the computer's motherboard, as opposed to a graphics controller integrated into the motherboard chip set. An integrated graphics controller may be referred to as an "integrated graphics processor" (GIP).    Some video cards offer added functions, such as video capture, TV tuner adapter, MP EG-2 and MP EG-4 decoding, FireWire, light pen,TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors.    A common misconception regarding video cards is that they are strictly used for video games. Video cards instead have a much broader range of capability. Being specialized for video, output video cards improve what a computer monitor displays. As well, they play a very important role for graphic designers and 3D animators, who tend to require optimum displays for their work as well as faster rendering in order to efficiently tone up their work.    Video cards are not used exclusively in IBM type PCs; they have been used in devices such as Commodore Amiga (connected by the slots Zorro II and Zorro III), Apple II, Apple Macintosh, Atari Mega ST/TT (attached to the Mega Bus or VEM interface), Spectra video SV-328, MSC, and in video game consoles.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The graphics card is the part of the computer that creates the stuff you see on the screen - colors, shapes, letters.    If the games run well now, getting a new graphics card will only do one thing - make your wallet thinner.

hArcZuneaa	i sugest you go with sapphire radeon HD 4850 512MB beacuse its clocked at higher rate and its memory clock is also high with a sufficient ammount of onboard memory among all other and it supports ATI crossfire and direct x 10 the future of direct x.i"ll be the best among all other listed here.  while buying a grapics card look for higher core clock, higher memory clock and higher the ammount of onboard memory. and also look whether it supports direct x 10 as future games are based on this. more over look for an graphic card with an hdmi interface.an hdmi connects the monitor to graphics card
FBQZ06vraa	No, but what you probably mean by "reboot" is known as  "reinstalling" or "formatting".  You "boot" your computer every time you turn on the power, and you "reboot" it if you do a "restart" while it's running.    Formatting/reinstalling will remove Word and pretty much everything other than the operating system.    Hope that helps.|`|dILqe7nBaa	restarting =rebooting|`|lRpECZLuaa	No, if you reboot your computer it will not remove Word but if you reinstall or format it, it will.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	no|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You probably reboot it every day.

Devi solo per accertarti di che tipo di RAM ci sia installata nel tuo portatile. Poi non fai che andare ad un negozio di computer e ... il gioco  fatto. Per i costi... sono leggermente pi alti di quelle per un computer da casa. Ma dipende molto dai tipi, dalle promozioni che via via si trovano (anche via internet).     Ciao,|`|evVIFCVfaa	si  sempre fattibile  il costo dipende dal tipo di memoria (dovresti indicare il modello del portatile) e dalla quantit che ne vuoi mettere  ciao|`|08bddcb19e03a2dee0a269c519d5bc92aa	si  possibile, non hai scritto che modello di portatile possiedi ma se anche fosse vecchio di qualche anno penso che possa lo stesso montare su le ddr2 quindi dovresti vedere quanta ne vuoi mettere... un modulo da 256mb nuovo dovrebbe costare sui 20 o 25 euro, uno da 512mb invece sui 50 euro... per esistono anche frequenze diverse che possono far aumentare o diminuire il prezzo a seconda dei casi ed anche del tipo di marca... per esempio le corsair possono costare anche 3 volte di pi, ma  chiaro che sono anche molto pi affidabili... in ogni caso questi prezzi che ti ho scritto sono quelli delle memorie ram dd2 a 533mhz di marche "abbastanza" conosciute e che in genere sono pi che sufficienti per qualsiasi portatile e sono quelle che ti consiglio di usare come la Vdata o la samsung che non  male... almeno per la fascia medio/bassa.|`|29660afb6b3bc58992e713176dded0d0aa	certamente si pu potenziare la ram del portatile,anzi  consigliabile se la memoria  scarsa,ma ti consiglio di portarti il portatile al negozio perch non sempre le ram soddim sono compatibili su tutti i portatili specialmente se ai uno slot libero e devi aggiungere una ram in pi.  comunque una ram da 1 gb viene a costare intorno ai 100   il prezzo che  pagato io alcuni mesi fa.  se proprio la vuoi montare tu ti consiglio di scaricarti elettricit statica che ai addosso toccando il pc sulla parte metallica, perch se non lo fai rischieresti di bruciare la ram.  auguri|`|jkZv9NDmaa	Normalmente la risposta  si.  Devi controllare se nella parte inferiore del PC vi siano finestrelle pi o meno accessibili. Di solito hanno un incastro oppure hanno una vite molto piccola.  Vi possono essere almeno due finestrelle, una per l'HD e l'altra per la RAM.  Se trovi quella della RAM ed aprendola  vuota, allora puoi espandere il PC, in caso contrario dipende dal tipo di RAM installata (devi togliere quella ed inserirne una di maggiore capacit se il PC la supporta).  Per i costi non Ti posso aiutare, ma oggi nei negozi standard ed anche negli ipermercati le memorie si possono trovare a prezzi buoni (oltre che su internet ovviamente).

b932ec58f4e07ec83641da0728dd6079aa	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you have lost the previous data when you saved the file.  That is why I recommend you change file names to include YYYYMMDD (today is 20070321).  That way, you always have a previous day's version to fall back to.  Over time, you should delete the older ones according to your update schedule.    Think about.  Disk storage is incedibly plentiful and very cheap these days.  Use it to your advantage.  Organize your filing to include the date suffix as I suggested and your file names will be in ascending order when sorted by name.    Its a simple precautionary step that will prevent this problem in future.  Sorry I can't help you with the current issue.

Di solito la soluzione che si adotta  di far connettere il pc automaticamente all'avvio inserendo una stringa "auto ppp0" (se ppp0  il nome della tua interfaccia di rete) in /etc/network/interfaces e altre robe che adesso non ricordo, perch si fanno una volta e poi te le scordi :P  3.

Dopo il casino un collega m'ha detto che in effetti dist-upgrde funziona solo da terminale. Ma se fossi in te mi terrei la 6.10, non  mai una buona idea usare l'ultimissima versione del kernel, lascia che siano gli altri a testarla :P  4.

3aeba9df671fbab4a03c17494b0f3f23aa	omg .. you got a 2.6???? dont update it yet. for real you will be better off going to psphacks.com. read the tutorials on how to upgrade your psp to the 2.8 sony ware, then down grade it to the 1.5 version, then upgrade agin to the 3.03oec. there are higher versions but they arent fully debugged yet.   why you ask? because if you do that, you can download iso files and they are games. also you can and will get a recovery file so if you brick your psp, you can salvage it without sending it to sony or throwing it away. i did it myself and so glad i did. i have the 3.03oec cw(customware) and i can dl games, psp applications and just enjoy my games really without spending a fortune. again, psphacks.com. they have tutorials and people online all the time to help you if you need it.

Le soleil peut nous donner des coups de soleil, un cancer de la peau et nous tuer mais pour autant sans lui nous n'existerions pas (vitez de bronzer dans un four  micro onde par contre...)    Donc toute onde qui nous touche est potentiellement cancrigne, ce qui va rendre ce phnomne plus important est la quantit d'nergie  laquelle on doit faire face.    Ce n'est donc pas tant le wifi, le GSM ou l'UMTS qui est un problme mais l'exposition  toutes les ondes lectromagntiques.    Si en plus de cela il y a des facteurs aggravants, cigarette, hygine de vie, pollution, maladie, produits chimiques dans les aliments, sensibilit particulire etc etc etc effectivement le tout fait augmenter le nombre de cancers.    Pour autant dire que le wifi est le seul responsable est une aberration.|`|dF10kzEvaa	Tu veux dire qu'on on sera mort  cause de ?a ????

roDMCrZEaa	Por essas coisas a:    Quem usa a internet h pelo menos 3 dias j conhece o MSN, o servi?o de mensagens da Microsoft. O MSN  um habitat natural de pessoas esquisitas, legais, impressionantes, irritantes... Enfim,  o lugar onde todos se encontram.  Uma das coisas mais misteriosas  entender algumas atitudes dessas pessoas.  .  1) O incio: .Tudo come?a com uma simples pergunta: "Voc tm msn?" Essa  a senha! Hoje em dia n?o se pergunta mais o nome, cidade, de onde est teclando. Hoje o que comanda  "Qual seu msn?" seguido dos clebres "Tem cam?" ou "Tem foto?"  .  2) Tipos de nick:   Nicks filosficos: Vocs se lembram daquela poca de ouro onde o nick das pessoas era apenas um pseud?nimo simples do tipo: Gatao38, Dengosa17 e etc? Pois , ela se foi! No MSN agora os nicks filosficos imperam geral, todo mundo hoje quer dar uma de Nietsche, Plat?o, e quer questionar a sociedade.  Cena: Voc est lendo seus e-mails e aparece aquela janela no canto da tela: "Amar  como padecer no paraso, viver em eterno torpor, ser o que se quer ser sem ter medo de ser, enfim amar  compartilhar momentos e decep??es, amar  o pio da humanidade que cada vez mais ama cada vez menos... ACABA DE ENTRAR".  Hoje em dia o MSN virou uma espcie de "Minutos de Sabedoria",  s abrir o MSN e ler um nick para ficar inspirado pelo resto do dia. Sem falar que voc precisa sair clicando pra saber quem  quem.  Nicks carnavalescos: Esse  mais irritante do que os filosficos, este  algo sobrenatural, nicks que usam caracteres que voc s encontra no mapa de caracteres do Windows. E agora com a nova vers?o do MSN eles ficaram ainda mais carnavalescos pois agora possuem 3923454345234 smiles compondo o nick.  Nicks letras de msicas:  uma ramifica??o dos nicks filosficos, por algum motivo as pessoas acham de colocar letras de msica no nick. Voc nem precisa mais buscar letra de msica no Vagalume ou no Google,  s pesquisar sua lista que com certeza vai achar o que procura. Acho que j que colocam as letras podiam tambm colocar as partituras, vamos fazer a coisa direito!  .  3) Comportamentos: Com a introdu??o do MSN 7.0 as possibilidades carnavalescas do programa extrapolaram a linha do tolervel. Tudo bem voc usar um smile aqui, outro ali, mas voc substituir todas as letras do alfabeto por smiles... Voc tem que ir tentando decifrar o que a pessoa quer dizer, porque a letra A dela est dan?ando, o B tem perninhas, o C t rebolando, o E dando cambalhota, e o D piscando todas as cores do arco-ris. Uma risadinha, uma piscadinha, alguns smiles de cumprimento tudo bem, mas n?o transforme a conversa num desfile de alegorias.  .  4) Status: Porque existe o status se ningum respeita? Se o status diz "ocupado"  porque a pessoa est "ocupada". Infelizmente existem alguns que desconhecem essa difcil linguagem do status e te perseguem.  Cena: Voc est l renderizando uma cena no 3DStudio max, fazendo um download de 700 megas do Torrent ou est salvando alguma coisa no pc, jogando, ou qualquer outra coisa, o seu status  "ocupado" e o seu nick  "n?o perturbe". N?o d nem 5 minutos aparece algum com winks e smiles te enchendo o saco e travando tudo perguntando: "T ocupado?"  .  5) Chamar aten??o: No MSN 7.0 existe uma op??o que permite aos usurios chamarem sua aten??o. O infeliz clica no bot?o e sua janela come?a a tremer e emitir sons intermitentes. Se eu n?o estou lhe dando aten??o  porque tenho um motivo. N?o adianta insistir que s piora as coisas, em vez de aten??o voc vai ganhar um "ignore" e "block".  .  6) Enxurrada de winks: N?o satisfeitos com toda a parafernlia do MSN 7.0, ainda colocaram uma nova espcie de sauda??o, os winks. Winks s?o anima??es em flash que as pessoas mandam para voc no meio da conversa. Existem indivduos que acham lindo ficar mandando winks, a vida deles  ca?ar winks na internet e te soterrar com eles.  Cena: Voc est com 20 janelas abertas, photoshop rodando, ouvindo msica no Windows Media Player 10 e aparece um desses infelizes e te manda 342509694 winks coloridos e felizes, e teu pc come?a a ficar lento, o photoshop trava, a sua msica come?a a pular e o idiota continua mostrando sua incrvel cole??o de winks...  phoda.|`|2jM87D27aa	N?o me adicionou, viu...|`|2mBYG78Vaa	 s bloque-las!!|`|34c632c16cee00ba2632bce26374e5cfaa	Oi,  Se s?o chatas nem sei pq est?o no seu msn, tem que aprender a escolher direito mas saiba que pessoas tem defeitos e qualidades,  fcil gostar de algum pelas qualidades mas quero ver gostar de algum por causa dos defeitos.

1bdbd8159e381fc8dfecad4903f0de28aa	I'm a vb.net novice, but maybe you want to use the Control.Modifierkeys property?  It's a boolean value that shows whether the key is being pressed or not.    Used as a variable, it is something like:  Dim ControlPressed As Boolean = (Control.ModifierKeys And Keys.Control)  0|`|3707cc14e0d55f64995947b498ae1603aa	I don't believe you can register just the Control key as a hot key. The RegisterHotKey function creates a hot key which raises an event that your program can then process. You can stipulate that the Control key (or the Alt key or the Shift key, or any combination of them) be pressed along with the specified ASCII key, but not by itself.    If you need to detect when just the Control key is pressed, use the My.Computer.Keyboard. CtrlKeyDown property (see source link below).

e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	No, you can use drives of different sizes - as long as they have the same connection of course.    The drawback is that the array will only use disk space equal to the smallest drive. For example if you used a 50GB and a 300GB, the RAID will only use 2xthe smallest drive or 100GB..|`|14d09e7c7266bc78fa0bfc8bc73ad628aa	You really need two of the same size for raid 0 to be the most effective.|`|7cef8259cbcce7bce5c5c91c8e7993e1aa	It is strongly recommended using 2 harddrives of the same type/size/maker.

Cuando aparezca el men, selecciona "modo seguro" para que Windows inicie con los controladores mnimos para su funcionamiento.   Iniciado en este modo, lleva a cabo un escaneo profundo de tu sistema de acuerdo a lo siguiente:  1- Cierra el msn y desconecta tu Pc de Internet.  2- Ejecuta la utilidad de liberacin de espacio en disco. Esta utilidad la tienes en las herramientas del sistema. Llegas a ella siguiendo el camino:  inicio>>todos los programas>>accesorios>>  >>herramientas del sistema>>liberador de espacio en disco.  Selecciona tu disco rgido y en la ventana que aparece, tilda las casillas de verificacin correspondientes a archivos temporales de Internet y archivos temporales. Aplicas y aceptas.   3- Borra los Archivos Temporales de Internet, cookies, e historial. Esta operacin la llevas a cabo en las opciones de Internet del panel de control.   4- Desactiva cualquier programa "sospechoso" del inicio de la configuracin del sistema.  (En ella se encuentran los comandos asociados a los programas que se ejecutan al iniciar Windows).   Llegas siguiendo la ruta:  inicio>>ejecutar>>escribir msconfig>>  >>aceptar>>solapa inicio.  Busca en esa lista si hay alguno que no forma parte del sistema o de las aplicaciones que has instalado. Si encontraste alguno, toma nota del lugar en que se encuentra y luego de desactivarlo, para lo cual destildas la casilla de verificacin correspondiente, procede a eliminarlo. Si debes reiniciar el ordenador, vuelve a hacerlo en modo seguro.  (Este paso puedes omitirlo si no sabes a ciencia cierta cuales son los mdulos que deben ejecutarse al iniciar el ordenador)  5- Verifica en el panel de control, agregar o quitar programas, si existe alguno que tu no hayas instalado. Si es as, desinstlalo y reinicia el equipo tambin en modo seguro.  6- Ejecuta el antivirus actualizado. Elimina o enva al bal o cuarentena, cualquier elemento que fuera detectado durante el escaneo, de acuerdo a las opciones que se presenten segn se detecten virus, archivos infectados o cdigos malignos para el sistema.  7- Elimina todos los elementos que se pudieran haber puesto en cuarentena o en el bal del antivirus, si se detectaron virus.   Espero haberte sido de utilidad.

Essa manuten??o n?o oferece risco para a integridade e seguran?a dos perfis ativos. Neste momento, tambm n?o  possvel fazer novos cadastros temporariamente."

Recentemente, o Orkut passou por uma srie de aperfei?oamentos com o objetivo de aumentar a seguran?a e o controle sobre os passos dos usurios. Isso ocorreu aps investiga??es policiais detectarem que o site abrigava usurios envolvidos em crimes, como pedofilia.

9qvXZ6neaa	well when i upload a video it takes around 1- 3 days for it to be processed this is because youtube servers all almost always busy so it depends on how the servers are going|`|2mxbb6ULaa	like 10-20 mins somtimes hours. Usually not long though.|`|AKISdqrkaa	it takes hours  cz they have to watch it and approve it|`|lRUV4DFYaa	two to three days|`|AA10341425	not long it toke 20 minitues for me|`|4MKpSJtDaa	it depends how long it is.. i made a video that was 7 secs long and it took like a couple secs|`|SS3Df6DQaa	it depends on your connection speed and also the file size you're uploading... the smaller the file the faster you can upload and complete processing...    It is recommended that you upload wmv file format... good quality and smaller size.. so faster upload... and also faster processing.    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is wmv file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..      --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???  |`|uk7Vovz5aa	oh it'll take a while but if its over 20 mins then you might wanna try again.|`|wW7bNB1oaa	depending on the length of the video it may take as little as 5 minutes to a few days.|`|qaNFQ45Faa	Usually from about 3 minutes to 30 minutes depending on how good your computer is.|`|txquWGwRaa	yeah if u have youtube like pro or something the one where you pay than it would upload faster but if u have the standard youtube than it will take about 2-3 days especially if the video is high res since youtube compresses it to be smaller and less quality for some reason|`|K1a50Cxbaa	For me, a 33 second video would take about half an hour to upload. As you should know, the smaller the video the faster it uploads.  So If you've uploaded yesterday and it still says its processing, I recommend you atleast wait another day. If it doesn't work, it may be a problem with your conection speed.    I also recommend uploading in a wmv file format. It'd be in a smaller size and it's reasonable quality.    Hope I helped.|`|dtE5GHh7aa	Okey, i see, this will be depends on your networks with youtube and your video's size:)|`|UOFruIwmaa	http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...  Read this website it will tell you it is youtube info help  so its not fake
AA10140002	No, it does not. You were correct in not taking those pics.

DianeD  http://www.distinctwebsitedesigns.com/|`|hVlRCoZwaa	find out if you can take them. I am a photgrapher and I copywrite my images. the reason i do this is so that if people take my images without asking they look like complete fools for it, and they can get in trouble. Make sure you ask this is most important. Even though they are on the internet and you can take them make sure you are allowed to!!|`|sCAvtfpXaa	I would always ask the company whose site I was going to use an image from for permission.  I always assume that the information is copyrighted, unless they state that the stuff is "copyleft".

Many burn software support many formats (AVI, Mpeg, WMV, etc), they will do the convertion before burning.  Sonic MyDVD/EMC, Nero, Showbiz......|`|f95d8f26c2e762547b2dd969fb760ae8aa	There is so much you need to know that I couldn't even begin. Go to www.doom9.org you can get guides there, and all the programs you need to do it for free. mpeg2 is the video format, but it it has to be the correct bitrate and aspect ratio.    You will need to get a mpeg2 encoder off the doom9 site. If the one you use demuxes the audio and video, then good. if not download a free mpeg2 demuxer. this will seperate the audio and video. download ifo edit and the guide to use it. when you are done with ifo edit you will have the dvd files, but you are not done. save those files in a folder. do the same with your second movie. then download dvd shrink and the guide to use it. load both folders of movie files into dvd shrink. it will shrink the movies to fit on a single dvd disk. Burn dvd video with your dvd burning software. That is just a quick run of it, you'll need to read the guides on the site.

How would you add them to the standard library?       8Suppose a function f( ) has been defined in file 'file1.h'. If we  9include this file twice a redefinition of function would occur. How would you avoid it?       10Suppose your executable (.EXE ) files have been deleted accidentally and if you want to copy all executable files to the specified directory, you have to recompile all the files. This process would be cumbersome. How would you compile all the files in a single pass.       11There is a function f( ). Sometimes we have to pass 4 arguments to this function and sometimes else 7 arguments. If the purpose of the function f( ) is to only print all the arguments that it receives, how would you write function f( )?       12Write a program to reverse a given linked list.       13Suppose a file 'emp.dat' consists of 10 dates. Write a program to sort and print the sorted dates on the screen.          14All possible combinations of 1, 2, 3 are 1 2 3, 1 3 2, ... These turn out to be 3! combinations. If we take 4 numbers, there would be 4! combinations. If we take n numbers, there would be n combinations. If n is received from keyboard, write a program to generate and print these combinations.     15Write a program to add two matrices of dimensions 3 x 4. Each element of the two matrices is a complex number.      16 Write a program to generate 10 different random numbers?      17 Write a program to arrange the queens on a 8 x 8 chess board so that no one can take the other and print the arrangements of possible combinations.     18Write a program 'evaluate.c' to accept an arithmetic expression as string on the command line and find the value of the expression. For example, evaluate 3 + 5 * 2 should output 13.     19 A magic square is an n x n matrix, where each of the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, appear exactly once and the sums of every row, column and diagonal are equal. Here is a magic square for n = 3:    8    1    6    3    5     7    4    9     2    The following is a procedure for constructing an n x n magic square for any odd integer n.  Place initial number, say k, in the middle of the top row. Then after integer k has been placed, move up one row and one column to the right to place the next integer k + 1, unless one of the following occurs:  (a) If a move takes you above the top row in the j th column, move to the bottom of the j th column and place the integer there.  (b) If a move takes you outside to the right of the square in the i th row, place the integer in the i th row at the left side.  (c) If a move takes you to an already filled square, place k + 1 immediately below k.    Write a program to construct a magic square for any odd integer n.     20Accept two dates and the day of the first date from the keyboard.

Ph3Vwsnpaa	Hola alebal77:  El Hiren's es confiable, pero tiene muchos programas que puedes usar bajo un sistema operativo Windows Colocas el disco y (en la versin 9.1) te abre un men con aproximadamente 40 programas: antivirus, antiespias, utilitarios de diverso tipo.  La otra manera es arrancar la pc desde el cd, lo que inicia un PC DOS y te da un menu con algunos programas adicionales, que generan un disco ram, se instalan y ejecutan. Son muy tiles cuando quieres hacer algo que Windows no permite.  Pero cuidado, en ambos casos tienes, por ejemplo, el Partition Magic, que permite hacer un formateo de base de tu disco, con lo que pierdes todos los datos.    Yo tratara de buscar la manera de desactivar el Smart Hard Drive para que deje de salir ese mensaje, esto lo puedes averiguar seguramente por medio de la pgina del fabricante de tu porttil.  Y por ltimo, si el mensaje aparece, tal vez sea cierto que hay un fallo inminente en tu disco rgido. En este caso haz, back up de la informacin, formatalo y restaura la informacin. El formato permite detectar (e ignorar) los sectores defectuosos que pueda haber, para que ese mensaje no vuelva a aparecer    saludos  ricardo|`|PP8981xJaa	El Hirens Boot CD, no es solo un programa, son varios, que te ayudan cada uno en diferentes cosas.

OALUTVveaa	Your virus scanner may not be able to delete it so you'll have to do it manually. Your scanner should tell you the location of it.     ie C:\Users\Program Files\etc etc    Go to the folder its located in. It may be a hidden file if you can't locate it. If that happens. Have your scanner place it in a "Quarantine Folder". If you open it you still may not see it (but it is there!). Highlight the folder and push "SHIFT + Delete"    That SHOULD work.

2GB6yjamaa	There are all sorts of encryption that will prevent the contents to be shown in a PC's DVD drive.  The problem is that they wouldn't be visible in any other type of drive unless that drive (or the machine connected to it) had the key to said encryption.    I assume, by the wording of your question, that you want to hide content from PC's but let it be visible to DVD players.    The guts of a DVD-ROM drive are very simmilar to the guts of a video DVD player, so it would be pretty difficult to engineer something that would work for one and not work for the other.  Even if you did find a way to hide DVD content from average DVD-RAM drive, there are all sorts of smart people out there--one of them would find a way to trick their PC into behaving like a DVD player.    Even if there existed the most perfect encryption on DVD's, if it can be played, it can be copied. Period.  Worst-case-scenario, you'd have to hook the video-out of a DVD player to the video-in of a PC (there are cards that will do it) and voila, encryption-free video!    If, however, you can control the device that the media is going to be played on, you could use a proprietary filesystem--or just nonstandard file types.  (If you have ever put a playstation disk in a PC you know what I mean.  You see the files, but they don't make much sense.)

Oracle places no limit on the number of columns in a GROUP BY clause or the number of sort specifications in an ORDER BY clause. However, the sum of the sizes of all the expressions in either a GROUP BY or an ORDER BY clause is limited to the size of an Oracle data block (specified by the initialization parameter DB_BLOCK_SIZE) minus some overhead.

The first is obvious: a database.  You can choose from Access, SQL Server, Oracle, and many others.  The second thing you will need is knowledge of a server-side programming language.  Examples of this are ASP (Active Server Pages), PHP, ColdFusion, JSP, etc.  The easiest would probably be ASP with Visual Basic Script.  You can find many examples online.  Specifically, go to www.devguru.com.  He has a great programming reference for VBScript and ASP.    You can't use just HTML to connect to a database, its not possible.  Mainly because HTML isn't a programming language, it's a markup language.  (It can't make conditional statements.)

55474b711a6c2377665e85b5c171cfc6aa	Hola!!! El Windows Vista es un sistema muy nuevo en el mercado. De seguro con el correr del tiempo, aparecern los denominados parches y Services Packs, hasta lograr su funcionamiento ptimo. Adems, es un sistema que requiere muchos recursos y para que las aplicaciones funcionen correctamente, se necesita al menos 1 Gb de  memoria Ram. Por otro lado, se deber tener en cuenta en que tipo de PC se ha de instalar, por cuanto, dependiendo de la antigedad de la misma, algunas aplicaciones funcionaran lentamente mientras que ciertas funciones puede que no estn  disponibles, volvindose, en consecuencia, en un sistema lento para esos casos. Adems, las empresas que desarrollan software, aun no han tenido el tiempo suficiente para adaptar sus programas y hacerlos compatibles con este nuevo sistema, razn por la cual, no hay gran variedad de aplicaciones  que funcionen en el. A esto habr que sumarle, que actualmente resulta difcil encontrar controladores dise?ados para que los dispositivos de hardware, que conforman la mayora de los equipos, funcionen bajo este sistema operativo. Por el momento pienso que es mejor continuar utilizando el Xp.

Es mejor esperarse un poco, total XP ya esta probado y mejorado y trabaja bien...

vjuSBst9aa	An .ogg is a music file for digital multimedia maintained by the Xiph. Org Foundation. The full name of an .Ogg is Ogg Vorbis which can be played by top multimedia players such as Windows Media Player, Itunes, Winamp and many more.     If you wish to convert all the ogg codecs to mp3/wma simply go to the document where all your songs are saved {I'll use "My Music" for example}. Then right-click on any of the songs and it should show a list. Click "Open With" and it should show another list. Click "Choose Program" then a box should appear showing a list of programs. Click Windows Media Player/Itunes and it should automatically convert the ogg codecs the next time you want to play them. Itunes definetely does. On the box it should show a little tick box. Tick that box and your ready to go. If that doesn't work I'll suggest you download a Song converter. Song converters are a lot more simple to use and in some cases, extremely quick.    I hope that helped.    Here are some useful links:    Wikipedia Info - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ogg  Vorbis - http://www.vorbis.com|`|l0nACemdaa	that nothing but a audio codec that plays .ogg files just like mp3 files but with a extension .ogg it plays music files which you can find on the net.|`|AA10513201	OGGcodecs are the files that allow you to play the Xiph.org's ogg media formats, in your case most likely OggVorbis, in Windows Media Player or another Directshow player.    Ogg Vorbis is an open source media format with better compression than MP3; meaning the same size file will be able to contain more data, and thus sound better. A number of software developers are turning to the ogg container to avoid having to pay licensing fees per copy of their software to the parent company of MP3. Because of it's public domain, open source nature, there are no licensing fees associated creating software or hardware with the ability to encoding to or decode from (play) OggVorbis files.    Why would you have it on your computer? Taking a wild guess, I'd say you have something else from Epic Games?  They've used Ogg files in pretty much everything since they released Unreal Tournament 2003. Maybe something from PopCap games, or Croteam (Serious Sam), or even some EA Games.

If they owed money to every customer who got malware while using their product, they'd go out of business, as would every other antivirus company. Antivirus software does not stop malware, and that's been proven over and over again for years. Just look at Yahoo! Answers.    Get some real security and stop shelling out money for antivirus and then virus removal.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|XVpq4tOQaa	McAfree does not owe anything, even if going to "safe" sites being connected to the internet puts you as a treat. And if you have ever downloaded any music or files from limewire or psp, you are telling your antivirus to allow the file to go around it, which is why so many people get viruses from "human error."   If your looking for a better anti virus in general, Kaspersky is  1|`|uuDloQnCaa	Its near impossible to prove that it was completely McAfee's fault so no you probably wont get any money back.    Avast is better than Mcafee and free:    Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Believe it or not McAfee is a  better than average anti-virus.    Dude, the fact is that NO anti-virus  can ever be relied upon to give 100% protection. None of them do, free or paid. Most only detect about 85 to 95% of all KNOWN viruses. When a brand new virus is released, NO signature-based anti-virus will detect it for several hours up to several days. Some will never detect a particular malware.  And over 1200 new variants of viruses and other malware are created by the "black-hats" each and every day.    And a trojan that is undetected for even one hour is long enough for it to connect to the internet, and "phone home" to the attacker with your personal and finiancial information.    You should consider an anti-virus program to be your "last line of defense". Safe internet surfing and downloading practices along with maintaining  your Windows and all your installed software with all critical updates and security patches should be your frontline defense.  ________________________________    Have you been keeping all your software as well as Windows 100% patched and updated?    Almost all viruses and other malware target vulnerabilities in not only your Windows operating system, but also your other installed software such as Java, Flash-player and Acrobat, etc    When these vulnerabilities (or security holes) are patched, a virus can knock all day at the door of your computer but won't be able to  infect it!     I recommend the use of Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important. It's free.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    >>>>>    Avoid the anti-virus called AVG (free version). It is wildly popular with children and the computer illiterate but has historically had the lowest virus detection rate of all the popular free anti-virus programs.|`|HtTp4NGlaa	You probably won't get any money from McAfee.

(It would be magic, since you'd have to create content that doesn't exist.)    If you want to do real-world enhancement - touching up a picture - a program like GIMP (or even Paint, for some work) will do it.

CYDC1pxfaa	Cable is actually faster than DSL.  DSL actually goes through your telephone line, where as Cable goes through your tv cable subscription.  Since your cable line (coaxial) can send information faster that your phone line, Cable is faster.|`|1WaTRF3Caa	CABLE!!!!!  With out a doubt it has to be cable!!!|`|x1YZgCCnaa	It is a personal preference, with DSL you will get the speed you pay for no faster and no slower, with cable you will often get a faster connection but it can fluctuate to slower than DSL.|`|NkbhHcIAaa	cable is faster MOST  of the time , but unlike DSL cable is a shared   connection meaning the more people on a hub in a georaphical area the slower your speed is going to be     Most people in my area use cable i use 6meg DSL there are plenty of times my DSL is faster then the local cable , to be honest most of the time my DSL is faster|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Like they have said, Cable is usually faster. The problem though with cable, at least in my area, is that it is down often. Requests to have my cable repaired are responded with a 7 to 10 day wait for a service call. When my phone line goes down & my DSL, it's fixed within 3 hours. When the electric power goes out you also lose your cable & modem. The phone lines have battery backups & I have my DSL modem on an APC battery backup which gives me internet for at least 12 hours in power outages.

Also make sure that you have a way to reinstall Vista if your XP installation fails.    I'm assuming that you have a newer computer that came with Vista on it. You're going to have to do some searching on the manufacturer's website to see if XP drivers are available. This can lead to numerous complications because you won't have the internet to download drivers that you need to access the internet. Catch-22, right?    Try downloading all the necessary drivers and putting them on a flash drive or burning them to a CD first. Then back up all your files on another disk. Then stick the XP disk in, reboot, when it tells you to hit any key if you want to boot from the disc, say "yes." Then follow the instructions.

AA11434633	If you mean that it's handwritten, I'm afraid you're going to have real problems.  As far as I know, there aren't any OCR (Optical Character Recognition) softwares that are able to reliably recognise handwriting.    If, on the other hand, it's a typewritten document, you'll need to get hold of an OCR software.  This will scan the document as a document and not as a picture file, and you'll be able to import this document into Microsoft Word ... as well as many other word processing softwares.    Personally, I'm currently using OmniPage which is not a free product.  In fact, the only free OCR product that I've found that will allow you to do what you want is a product called FreeOCR.  At least, it's the only one that I've found that really works.    Unfortunately, with FreeOCR, you will lose any formatting that's present so you'll have to replace indents, changes in fonts and font sizes, etc.    Anyway, it's free so why not give it a go?  You can download it from the following site.    Best of luck to you.|`|c19a4bbcee7257a66f310b7975514beeaa	well when it's scanned onto your computer you can't edit it (unless you have some really expensive software).

vL2Ec50Yaa	I doubt that the combination of parts that you will need to put into this machine would be worth it.  You may have to replace the power supply and the motherboard may not be a good fit.  Also, the case might not provide the required cooling that's need for that processor.    I would have to agree with one of the other contributors, get yourself a new machine with the parts that you want in it.    If you purchase instead of building one yourself, the O/S will be installed and they can get it cheaper than you can.  OEM manufacturers can still install XP Pro for you.    With regards to whether or not you have to purchase a new licensed O/S when you change out your motherboard?  Yes you do - unless you install a copy of Linux.  The other contributor has it wrong... switch the hard drive - OK, switch the motherboard - purchase a new MS license.|`|50ce1c41ca187d24c0c8cbe4da30cc32aa	A motherboard is just like a central station that binds everything together. The Hard drive, the monitor, the keyboard, the ports, everything is connected to the motherboard, but it doesn't store any information itself. So when you replace the motherboard, your hard drive will still be the exact same and have your OS on it, all your files and everything. It'll look the exact same when you boot your computer back up. This is a reeally risky procedure however, and you might want to look up some information on how to replace motherboards online.|`|IGT4K2amaa	Nope  If you are replacing your Hard Drive then you need to unless you ghost it  If it is just your Motherboard then no    Good luck!|`|sxo57FPfaa	just buy a new computer?|`|oedys7Mqaa	I believe you do, because the OS installed on your pavilion 533w is activated and tied to your current hardware configuration's unique computer generated hash, which will cause Windows to fail system check and prompt you to reactivate it when you install a new mo(ther)bo(ard). Since you have an OEM license, I don't believe you can reactivate it without hardware being the same.    Basically, you can't without buying a new Windows license. I suggest NOT buying Vista unless you really want to|`|B6iGvW3baa	what is the connection in OS to Motherboard  you are changing mother board now whether you install windows or LINUX , No one should raise eye brows and take it  it is not necessary to  buy the OS, use Linux Ubuntu 8.04  which is free and all the time improving.

AA12094222	TCP Transmission Control Protocol TCP takes care of keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet. Therefore it ensure the delivery of data or Packets to the receiver. TCP offer error recovery services    UDP User Datagram Protocol is also responsible, but cannot ensure delivery of Data to the receiver. UDP does not provide the service of dividing a message into packets (datagrams) and reassembling it at the other end. Therefore, all packets Must arrive in the order they we sent. UDP does not offer error recovery services.    Both operate at Layer 4 (Tansport Layer) of the OSI model & Transport Layer in a TCP/IP stack.|`|AA10518089	The TCP protocol exists on the Transport Layer of the OSI Model.    The TCP protocol is a connection-oriented protocol which provides end-to-end reliability.    By connection-oriented, we mean that before two network nodes can communicate using TCP, they must first complete a handshaking protocol to create a connection.    When we say that TCP provides end-to-end reliability, we mean that TCP includes mechanisms for error detection and error correction between the source and the destination.    These properties of TCP are in contrast to UDP, which is connectionless and unreliable.    Higher layer protocols which utilize TCP include HTTP, SMTP, NNTP, FTP, telnet, SSH, and LDAP.|`|pmna8fhyaa	TCP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissio...    UDP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagr...|`|BbEXpJIGaa	In computer networking, a port is an application-specific or process-specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint used by Transport Layer protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). A specific port is identified by its number commonly known as the port number.    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. Using UDP, programs on networked computers can send short messages sometimes known as datagrams (using Datagram Sockets) to one another. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol    The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP is so central that the entire suite is often referred to as "TCP/IP." Whereas IP handles lower-level transmissions from computer to computer as a message makes its way across the Internet, TCP operates at a higher level, concerned only with the two end systems, for example a Web browser and a Web server. In particular, TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of bytes from one program on one computer to another program on another computer. Besides the Web, other common applications of TCP include e-mail and file transfer. Among its management tasks, TCP controls message size, the rate at which messages are exchanged, and network traffic congestion.|`|3cVzvP9laa	They're both protocols on how data is transferred.    TCP is more browser to server, where-as UDP is a less reliable system for transferring small bits of information computer to computer.    It's been a while since I researched it, but I think I'm fairly close.|`|YXgle6pWaa	It is hard too explained only by me.  in general, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a protocol to transport data between host in local network or outer network, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is another one.  Both of them have different function.  TCP have more reliability than UDP..    for more info see wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Contr...  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Pr...  good luck..|`|a7TnKbXzaa	They are network protocols, governing how network traffic is transmitted between computers.|`|IuX0P05vaa	protocols at the transport layer in OSI ref. model, main differences    i.e rules for transfering segments/packets over the net  TCP- requests confirmation; larger header;slower;reliable  UDP- best effort;smaller header;faster;less reliable

rEqKlpbcaa	This is a persistent malware, although low in risk, it can be exasperating!    Have you tried the following?  1. Update your antivirus and antispyware definition databases.  2. Disable your System Restore [Start>All Programs>>Accessories>>System Tools>>System Restore>>System Restore Settings>>check Turn off System Restore],   3. Clean up all Temporary and Recycle Bins. Use ATF-Cleaner from http://www.atribune.org , or use CCleaner from http://www.majorgeeks.com/CCleaner_Porta...  4. Boot to Safe Mode,  [restart, press F8, choose Safe Mode, login] then run your anti-virus. Clean/Quarantine when necessary.  5. In Safe Mode, also scan for spyware, or malwares using Spybot-Search & Destroy http://www.spybot.com/en/download/index.... or http://spybot.info/en/spybotsd/index.htm... Clean and purge when prompted.     You should run both antivirus and antispyware in Safe Mode. Running only anti-virus application will not necessarily protect you from spywares or malwares; and the vice versa is also true. So to be on the safe side, RUN BOTH in SAFE MODE.    The malware keeps on coming back because most probably, the malware installed a copy of itself on different locations on your drive as well as it stays resident in MEMORY. Doing a scan in Safe Mode would free the MEMORY, and would effectively clean your system.

p9rbEdpdaa	Several things to check if you haven't    1 check the speaker connection if you are using external speakers (you can also unplug the speakers if you have an internal speaker to see if the problem is in the speakers in the audio  system)  2 check to see that the volume is up on your speakers if you have a volume control   3 go to the master control on your computer. in windows that will be a small speaker icon on the bottom right and check to see if it has been muted or if the volume has been turned down.  4 open the mixer control on the pop up when you activate the volume control by clicking the speaker icon. This will give you several choices such as speaker, sounds etc. make sure that none have been muted  5 if you using a program that has a separate volume control, a media player, a sound system etc. check the volume control on that program....usually will be a speaker icon with a sliding control  If none of this works, you may be in the market for a new sound card.

Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

cBT6Qrbhaa	go into your router settings and look for NAT or port forwarding.  Find the ip of the pc you run torrent from.  enter the ip of your machine running torrents and the port the torrent app is using and save.  now when packets come to your ISP IP and are using that port it will be translated into your internal IP based on your NAT settings.|`|4b10bb2dec56a10bb8a1ed00e9ba4a62aa	Does the port forwarded icon turned into green? If yes then the problem lies on the encryption. Because some ISP (Internet service providers), bottle neck the UDP traffic if there are any suspicious activity going on that particular computer.    Try enabling NAT-PMP port mapping and enable Protocol Encryption in BitTorrent. If this didn't work out try the forced encryption.

a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Generally, no.    But there is a chance that the power management software is not working properly.    Try removing and reinstalling the battery. This can sometimes solve issues such as this.    If that doesn't help, go to the website of the company that made the computer. They will have drivers for your model PC and should have updated power management software that could solve the problem.|`|DSOJvIhtaa	Let the battery fully charge. When you have the computer on, leave it plugged in for an hour. Unplug it and see if it does it again. If it dies, you have a bad battery, it's not holding a charge.
78xcSNrKaa	Just check the compatibility mode check box when you save.
a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Nope.    Plus, reformatting the drive just copies over small parts of the data on there. Anyone with a small amount of PC knowledge can recover much of the data after a format.    If you are concerned about the data on the drive, it is best to simply keep the drive and sell the computer without it.|`|dILqe7nBaa	best way is to reinstall os to factory settings|`|WwXrTQgaaa	you need to do a low level format. no, reinstalling the OS will not permenantly erase info.    if it's no big deal, just format it. but you at least need to do that.|`|ejcxh0I0aa	In a word No.    It stored in to many places to clear it all out by hand.|`|DSOJvIhtaa	If you really don't care about loosing any of your personal data...highlight the folder and hit delete.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	If these are FILES, and not programs and you are just not wanting someone to restore the files, download a file shredder and overwrite the files with ones and zeros for a while.

PTYObfjQaa	yea, it wont cause any problems
dfjIBHe3aa	Um.  If you have the pictures as jpegs, I would use convert from the ImageMagick suite.    http://www.imagemagick.org    The caveats are 1. the program is a command line program: open a terminal or whatever they call it in Windows and type convert Directory\* Directory.mpg and of course I mean Directory as a stand in for your movie name, and it will create an mpeg out of every jpeg in directory.  Of course then you have to put a soundtrack on it.  Use Windows Movie Maker for that.  2.  In Linux, at least, which I'm using, it requires an extra package called mpeg 2.    Beyond that though, I have created films with it, and mencoder (a command line program in the mplayer package).  And I've talked to a few Windows users who have used it.

hLcFhhNxaa	First of all you can always go on www.dvdvideosoft.com (100% FREE!), This site is full of ways of converting files; especially if the origin of your uploaded video is form YouTube, If not i suggest you upload your video to YouTube then use their software to convert it into either mp4, MPEG or any video software supported by your website manufacturer, after upload your file via options provided by your website and wallah!.

Just order by whatever column the user clicks on, or by the button he clicks on.  (Use AJAX to update the table for a smooth effect.)    You'll have to learn a few things, but no one can do anything he doesn't know how to do.

Fp0jrUtOaa	It will mostly protect you.  But not completely.    If you are worried about a hardware keylogger (that is, a chip wired directly into the keyboard), then being disconnected may be little help.  Some of those devices are designed to send out the keystrokes via the internet but others are designed to store the information until the chip itself is recovered.  In the second case, the eavesdropper will need physical access to the device but is not hampered by a loss of internet connection.  That's probably not much of a risk for your home computer but may be a risk for a public terminal such as might be found at the library or an internet cafe.  Hardware keyloggers are uncommon but you didn't say which flavor of "watching" you were worried about.    Software keyloggers (which are far more common and are the kind you could pick up from a virus, etc) do require an internet connection to report out their results.  Again there are two basic kinds - those that report in realtime and those that store the information and report it later.  Disconnecting from the internet would definitely protect you from the former.  In the latter case, though, disconnecting would only protect you until you reconnect.  At that point, your information might go out in a batch.    Disconnecting also won't necessarily protect you from picking up new threats.  Viruses can come into your computer via floppy disks, CDs, thumbdrives, etc.  Anything you do to bring new information into the device could also bring in new malware.  And even if you think you already have everything you need, sooner or later you're going to want to reconnect to upload a patch or upgrade to some piece of software you already have.    The better answer in my mind is to have up-to-date and running anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, keep your applications fully patched and lock down your firewall.  Unless you're protecting DOD nuclear secrets, completely disconnecting from the internet seems like an overreaction.|`|AA11595360	Yes... they have to be connected thru a port and if you disconnect the internet then the ports are disconnected... I MEAN YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG THE JACK|`|AA10725924	When you are not connected to internet, you are isolated. Nobody will be able to sniff as you are cut off from the internet world.  However if your mom standing behind you, she can watch your keystroke, right?|`|kQt4ub3Daa	It removes some of the threats, but the recorded keystroke software can keep track of them for years, and ususally does it under another Users login as Admin on a system.       Technically if You have a wireless network, or any computer on the same wired network has a wirewless network, You can also be hacked.       It's like a door in a rented house, It can be opened by the key in the lock from the residents or Owner, by accidentally leaving it unlocked, or by breaking it down.                            Good Luck!.|`|iBrlojt4aa	If there is no internet connections on your computer and (suppose) there is key loggers and spywares on your computer than they might try to send the information to their servers but since there is no internet connection they won't be able to do that. But in case you are connected to internet later they might be able to send that information.     I would suggest that you buy a good Antivirus like Avira or MCAfee as well as spyware removal software like Spyware Doctor and install it and run it to clean the system. They would take care of all the possible security threats later on even if you are connected to internet.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	If you are really concerned about software keyloggers I suggest that you do both of the following:    1. Do a full system scan with the free version of SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/  SUPER will look for specific brands of keylogger software (as well as other malwares).    2. Run a test with K-L Detector. Free from:  http://dewasoft.com/privacy/kldetector.h...  K-L Detector will use a heuristic technique to detect keylogging behavior and should be able to detect ANY keylogger...doesn't matter what brand.    If both come up negative you can be  99% sure that you are software keylogger-free.|`|7lQp3nHhaa	well yes....    but the infection would still be on your computer.    and nowadays, your computer is pretty useless without an internet connection
nd6rENehaa	Short answer: It probably wont be an issue.    Do some investigation first. Visit the manufacturers website and make sure they have drivers available for your hardware model and XP.    Just make sure you have XP Service Pack 2 or 3, and it'll be fine. XP is still very popular and it would be silly for a manufacturer not to have drivers for it still.

SrfLbfwMaa	You almost got that in your formula, you just need to change it a little bit  make it like this    =IF( MID( B8,LEN(B8)-2,1)=" ",RIGTH( B8,1),0)    Try it and let me know    VBAXLMan|`|GI27dKIkaa	The simplest way - is to put a space where there's no middle initial.    BUT - you have to enclose it in quotes - " " like this.  That way - Excel recognises the text string and prints the name as it should be.|`|Fp0jrUtOaa	First, your example is only working even in that situation because there is no period after the middle initial.  Your formula will also fail for somone who has a one-character first name but no middle initial.    Assuming that you always have a comma between both last and first and the first and middle, a more flexible way to solve this might be  =IF( ISERR( FIND(",",B8, FIND(",", B8) + 1)), "", RIGHT(B8, LEN(B8) - FIND(",",B8, FIND(",",B8) + 1) - 1))    That's a really clumsy formula and there's probably a more elegant solution somewhere but it works.|`|MAa4ez4Faa	Just to put this in other words, if my name is "Abdul Mannan M", u want the cell to display "M" and if my name is "Abdul Mannan", u want nothing to be displayed.     so here is the formula.  =IF(MID(C12,LEN(TRIM(C12))-1,1)=" ",RIGHT(C12,1)," ")    The assumptions are:  Cell C12 contains my name.  i would trim the text to ensure my name doesn't contain unnecessary spaces.  i take the total count of the content of the cell and assume the middle name would always come last.  Break the formula into pieces and analyze u should understand it.  Try with both my names and u will find that my formula gives the result u want.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	A byte is a number between (in decimal notation) 0 and 255, so you can represent it as 1, 2 or 3 decimal digits or 8 binary digits ('bits') - each bit is either 0 or 1.  So 5 (decimal) would be 00000101 (binary), 254 would be 11111110, etc.  The value of 'a', btw, is, in decimal, 65, and can be represented that way - or as 00100001 in binary.    Int, char and byte are data types, binary, decimal and hex are methods of presentation.  You can have 101 or 5 fingers on each hand, but the number of fingers doesn't change.

Some programming languages (like Java) have native byte types, while others (like C) do not (though C has char).
8Mz8fuSgaa	I just fixed another one of these issues yesterday.  Depending on how bad it is your best bet is to download MalwareBytes.      http://www.malwarebytes.org/    Install this and run it.  If it installs you're all set.  If not then we've got a real problem on our hands.  The PC I worked on yesterday would not boot to safe mode or let me install anything.  I had to boot to mini-XP and remove the files and registry entries manually.     If Malwarebytes doesn't remove it you may need a professional.    Here is a link that helped me yesterday:  http://www.xp-vista.com/spyware-removal/...      Hope this helps..  I know this one is a pain and will take you at least 2 hours to remove.

nd6rENehaa	Firstly, you'd need a compatible 64 bit CPU.    If you do, there is a major advantage: Better performance. 64bit refers to the size of numbers your CPU can calculate with, and allows them to flow easier.

Using a can of compressed air, blow all dust from the motherboard and all other components. Get all of it out of the case. Do not use a vacuum. 2) While the case is open, power up the computer to verify that all case and component fans are functioning properly. 3) Check the heat sink and/or fan attached to the main processor on the motherboard. It may be necessary to remove the sink/fan and replace the thermal compound, or even upgrade the sink/fan to something more effective. These are the main problem areas.

How many wires do you have coming out of your PSU well not exactly how but they can interrupt the air flow inside your case. Do you have an exhaust fan level with your CPU to evacuate that hot air before it can build up. how bout one on top.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) As long as you're not running short of drive space (and your drive isn't memory, your RAM is), drive size doesn't matter.    2) Celeron is a bottom-line processor.  A 2.4GHz Celeron is BARELY adequate for today's software.    3) Slowdown and hang in games (not in loading them, in playing them) is mostly due to an inadequate video card.  Nothing made 8 years ago is adequate to play today's games.  (That could also cause the problem you have with videos.  Your CPU is doing all the graphic processing - your video card should be doing it.)    4) Slowness in loading from disk indicates fragmentation.  Defrag your drives.    Upgrading your computer is probably not cost-effective.  You can get a better base computer than that one for about $200 - but if you get a new computer, I'd make sure that it can handle at least 8GB of RAM, to allow for future expansion (although 2GB is enough for XP) and had a good gaming graphics processor, and a dual or quad-core CPU running as far over 2GHz as you can afford.|`|bmwOJ9wMaa	Reasons can be many :   1:) Most common reason , virus infection.  2:) Redundant registry entries in start up and probably conflicting registry entries.  3:) Too many programs running in background.  4:) Different devices that you added recently have IRQ conflicts with other devices.  5:) Your sound card is having problems.  6:) Outdated drivers/bios.  7:) Your processor may be getting overheated without you knowing, cleaning your fans, chasis and internal cabinet is a good idea.  8:) DMA is disabled for your new drive.  9:) Your HDD needs de-fragmenting and probably there are bad sectors too in your hdd , possible reason for computer crashes and hang ups.  10 :) And the list goes on and on.

Try any of the GIF animators out there. Coffee Cup Software makes a good one.|`|AA10570173	It's under Windows>Animation. You can do precisely what you want by bringing the three images tother in one file, each image on its own layer. The animation panel will open by default into frames. You can set frames by selecting each image layer and hiding the others, then creating a frame. You can add tween frames if needed and set the timing for each frame. You can choose to loop the animation or play it once. Make sure you using relatively low resolution images, since this will be web only (not print) and if you use high resolution images, when you go to save the animation, Photoshop can choke or crash.    When you are ready to save as an animated gif, go to Save for Web and Devices in the File menu.    Hope that helps.

The common recommendation is to put your router/Wireless access point as high as possible, so it will have the least amount of interference.  All solid objects degrade the signal to some extent.

RxkGpV7xaa	You can try installing the game onto the Flash drives directory, but games are directory dependent, and it may cause you problems. For example, when you install the game in question, you'll be doing it on drive D:. Because Windows likes to change drive lettering ocassionally for some reason, it may suddenly become E:. Now the game will think that the files are still on drive D:, and as a result, won't find them. Your best bet, is to put them on permanent storage, such as your hard drive.    Hope this helps!|`|lOKNsBtRaa	Yes|`|EIAVcnvtaa	It might be possible, but you would have to downloads Sims on ur computer, then plug in the flash drive, and drag Sims onto the flash drive.

NkbhHcIAaa	nope not at all homedepot and verizon are both registered trade marks , thus when they go to register them and see they are taken they file a motion with the international body whom controls the domain issuing and they simply take them. this was done in the early 2000's to prevent people from doing what your thinking     also just so you know it is HIGHLY  illegal|`|CYDC1pxfaa	No, they'd just work around you.  Just like someone already had www.*****.com, ***** sporting goods made www.dickssportinggoods.com (please don't go to the first site, it's a REALLY bad site, if you get my drift.)|`|8p8CqTJkaa	No.    You most likely will not be able to register those domains.    The guys who are distributing the domains aren't idiots.    Companies can buy those domains before Joe Regular gets a chance to do so.    --    If you for some reason are able to buy that domain and try to blackmail them, they will most likely  either go to court and win or they don't care about the domain.
ac81971abc3b2098e68e98b5ebb4b684aa	Yes. I did. Its a beta version valid only for 90 days. Thereafter you have to go to the microsoft and register or obtain a key via telephone. Its consumes too much of HDD space (about 8.5 GB).     The only thing I found interesting was the interface and navigation. Even the random boost that they claimed to be sso great did not impress me much. Win XP Professional is still the best OS for me.|`|AA11339712	No sorry. I think it is yet to come into market.|`|fc46fe0d7b2749ad6f134d2c2caed545aa	It has great graphics if your computer can suport it. Up to 64 bit but i doubt many computers can run that high.  It is a bit funny with installing software and pirated stuff wont work (the cracks wont work on some programs) It asks for permission all the time when you install or remove something which an be a bit annoying but that is the security upgrades it carries.  Missing drivers, some drivers wont work, my Dell D600 (vista trial machine) cannot play sound, this is cos vista has no driver for this particular hardware  and the Dell driver is not compatible with the Vista..... Hows that? Shiiiit. but improvements are in the pipeline apparently. Play with it but dont get too exited yet, it needs work still from the manufacturer.|`|79a046bc8404f9ae1cc9db60093cb9f5aa	Yes indeed, it is one of the most versatile one that i used so far.....Answers your question huh?|`|adb04f850dd7657bed83ca54c968862daa	yes i liked it only used a beta though. uses ALOT of system resources!! Pc's running vista will have to be quite highly speced|`|fd165ac6ac98490c4b227d9851128e6aaa	when it comes to Microsoft never use anything that is new, I would wait for a year or so before some bugs will get fixed...the beta version is out there for a long time already..i tried to install it some time ago and it had so many bugs(nothing works in it) that I switched back...the beta version is not like the real thing anyway, they will introduce many new concepts soon and try to get everything/everyone under control(something that they always wanted to do)
6e0e615c86b7abbf237fca9b526ae8c5aa	The best option to download is to use the Torrent technology. To use torrents you must have a 'client' program through which you are able to download files.    You can use these links to download a client application:    BitComet - http://download.bitcomet.com/achive/BitC...  uTorrent - http://download.utorrent.com/1.6/uTorren...    The second thing you need is a .torrent file. A .torrent file lists the actual file (movie, mp3, application) that you are downloading.     To download .torrent files, visit:    http://torrentspy.com  http://torrentportal.com  http://isohunt.com  http://demonoid.com  http://thepiratebay.org/    Once you have downloaded the .torrent file, open it from the client application. This would initiate the download and connect you to peers or 'seeders'.    To learn how to enhance your torrent download speed visit:    http://edimension.darkbb.com/viewtopic.f...  --------------------------------------...    You can also download kazaa, a similar program to limewire but connects to a different server and hence has different/almost similar content as limewire. Click here to start the download for kazaalite:  http://filesharingdownloads.com/p2pclien...    --------------------------------------...    You can also use emule, another program similar to limewire and kazaa. Click on the link below to start your emule downoad:  http://jaist.dl.sourceforge.net/sourcefo...    --------------------------------------...    You can also use irc for downloading. irc is a chat program with a number of chat channels, as well as channels for downloading. Go to http://mirc.com to download and learn how to conect to mirc, as this program is a bit different in using limewire, kazaa etc.  To download files from irc go here:  http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/security/...    --------------------------------------...    Another option for you is newsgroups and is then again requires a different process from that of the rest. However, its main advantage is that it gives you thebest speed than any other technology. To use newsgroups and how to download from there, go to the link:    http://filesharingtalk.com/vb3/newsgroup...|`|fcc1ee8ae088883a69b5467ab4605891aa	ALL OF THESE CAN      http://www.seekasong.com  http://www.mp3000.net  http://espew.com/  http://www.kohit.net  http://www.emp3world.com/  http://www.mp3raid.com  http://www.muchmusic.net  http://www.soundclick.com  http://www.purevolume.com  http://www.altavista.com/audio/default.....  http://e-mp3s.eu/mp3_download  http://www.sideload.com  http://www.musichunter.net  http://www.mp3-network.net  http://www.yourmp3.net/  http://www.mp3free4me.com /  http://www.mp3fusion.net/  http://www.updatedmp3s.com/  http://www.newestmp3.com  http://www.peoplesound.com/  http://www.hitmp3.us  http://www.emp3s.com  http://www.top1000mp3.net  http://www.downloads.nl/cgi-bin/meta/do/...  http://www.maxalbums.com  http://www.albumbase.com  http://www.1albums.com|`|5ffbf8168bfe5aeaa55ffd411ab0eeddaa	i dont think there is such thing you have to buy the cd. but if u know the songs then you can just go to www.limewire.com get that but i no you wasnt lookiing for that but thats the only thing i can think of.|`|AA11296555	you can use p2p programs like piolet, limewire, warez or torrents....but of course all this stuff is illegal|`|e5637079d01d1d3c674ca894f1355e6eaa	hey try Mp3realm its free try that

Acer products are less expensive but also of lower quality. So if you want quality and durability, buy Asus. If you have a limited budget, buy an Acer. Check PC World and PCMag to see what they have to say.|`|AA11649894	I haven't used Asus, but I've had excellent experience with Acer laptops. They provide excellent value.    I bought one for my wife and she loves it and it works great.  I bought one for my mother and she loves it and it works great.  I bought one for myself and I love it and it works great.    I also have a couple of friends who have ended up buying Acer laptops after I recommended it.    Even higher-end models are frequently available for well under $1,000, with DVD dual-layer burning, 512MB to 1 GB RAM, great screens, good sized hard drives.    The Acer's do not come with a lot of junkware installed, they come with usable software for backing up and snapshotting your PC.    And the hard drive comes from the factory partitioned with a drive D: that you can save the images to.    Very convenient and very smart.

Perhaps you can try Norton or Mcafee to protect your computer, but you should pay for the software.    i also recommand you to use firefox with Google toolbar, which can disable the virus, becasue the virus can only run on IE.    firefox can block any any poppus and disable any virus and spywareware on webpage, so, firefox is much safer than IE. as you know, most of the virus is spread throught internet and webpage.    firefox is much smaller than IE, so i run faster than IE.    download firefox for free:    http://www.adcenter.net.cn/firefox/    Best Wishes && Good Luck!

3c542e30cea696f22ee6296fcea70baeaa	See the link below for a nice listing of available variable types in C++.    A variable that is unsigned means that it does not support negative numbers.  A signed variable does support negative numbers.  A signed character (char) supports -128 to 127, meaning that it can hold any number in that range.  An unsigned character can hold a number between 0 and 255.  You'll notice that both can hold the SAME AMOUNT OF DATA, its just that the representation of that data is different.    The variable type definately makes a difference with regards to memory.  For example storing 1000 chars will take 1000 bytes, whereas storing 1000 ints will take 4000 bytes (on a 32bit machine).  Making a variable unsigned or signed will not change its size in memory.|`|AA11809014	I am answering assuming we are talking about C,C++.  'unsigned' increases range of a variable.

Und je sp?ter du zum Umwandeln gezwungen bist desto besser fr die Qualit?t des Films. Mit deiner Grabberkarte wandelst du deinen Digital-Film ja schon vor dem schneiden in analoges Material um. Wenn du jetzt noch die falschen Programme einsetzt kann es passieren das ein Film bevor du ihn zum Beispiel auf DVD brennst, schon dreimal neu codiert wurde. Dies ist der Qualit?t (und Bearbeitungszeit) nicht gerade zutr?glich. Versuche einfach solange wie m?glich mit dem digitalen Material zu arbeiten.

Das hat zwangsl?ufig zur Folge, dass die Bildqualit?t - gerade bei der Nachbearbeitung ber ein Schnittprogramm - schlechter ist. ber die Qualit?t des Endmaterials (DVD, AVI etc.) entscheidet natrlich auch der vom Schnittprogramm verwendete Encoder ma?geblich, also vorher mal die Tests durchforsten...    Ein weiterer Vorteil von Firewire ist aber auch, dass der bearbeitete Film wieder auf das TAPE in unkomprimierter Form zurckgespielt werden kann (sofern dein D8-Camcorder dies untersttzt, z.B. mein DCR-TRV740E). Dies l??t dir dann die M?glichkeit, deinen Film nochmals nachtr?glich zu ?ndern, ohne die Bildqualit?t weiter zu verschlechtern...

Ich finde auf meinen PC keinen Unterschied der Qualit?t, ob ber Firewire oder von TerraTec (GrabsterAV250), selber ausprobiert, da ber Firewire den CAMCORDER (DV Kassetten) Filme auf die Festplatte und VHS Filme ber den VHS Rekorder ber GRABSTER auf die Festplatte.  http://videode.terratec.net/modules.php?...  natrlich sind meine Erkenntnisse ANALOGE Quellen.    Ich stelle mir schon vor, dass ber Firewire das DIGITALE von Auge her besser erscheint, vorallem wenn Du einen guten LCD od PLASMA PANEL hast, ich selber habe LCD Rckprojektor TV, fr den Preis Super Qualit?t auch mit PAL Aufl?sung.    HDTV kommt irgendwann im n?chsten Jahr in das Kabel, bis es ausgereift ist, vergehen noch Jahre, meine ich, wenn Du denkst, dass ist schon n?chstes Jahr, wrde ich einen PC zur rechten Zeit kaufen, der fr HDTV gerstet ist.     Ich erw?hnte dies, weil von Digital PAL auf HDTV einen Quantensprung ist, da wrde ich mich keine Gedanken machen, ob ber Firewire oder nicht.

9BL6LFJ9aa	Go to the following link, http://www.crucial.com  they can do an on line check which will determine which ram your motherboard supports. They will recommend the optimum amount. You can order on line and although they are not the cheapest it is worth  paying for good ram. They guarantee compatibility with your motherboard and give an excellent warranty.They also give fitting instructions.  I have used them many times and always been satisfied. Hope this helps.|`|044IeGstaa	The Crucial link was an excellent answer. I just wanted to add a video to show you how to physically do this.  http://videos.howstuffworks.com/howstuff...    What they fail to mention in detail. The remove the power thing. Remove the AC adapter, (Charger), if plugged in, AND also remove the battery.    Those little locking tabs they briefly show, are spring metal clips. One on each side of the ram 'stick'. (Ram module is correct computer speak)    Work on a table. Not a bed, a couch, or Directly on a carpet floor. Suspect you won't, but I had to say this.   These areas are High Static electricity areas.    Your body carries Static. Always! Static electricity will silently fry out your delicate computer components. You won't see it, or feel it.    With a desktop computer, you just touch the metal frame of the open computer case, to relieve your body of Static. (Computer unplugged from the surge protector, 'Natch!)    With a laptop, this option is not available. The metal used in a laptop is non-ferrous, or doesn't contain Iron. It's Aluminum, and aluminum won't do it, for relieving your body of Static.   Believe it or not, you can set a large serving metal utensil on your table, and touch it to relieve your body of Static. This is all the ground source you'll need.    (Ram modules have a protective plastic coating on them. The gold plated contact pins at the bottom, DO NOT. IF you handle the ram stick/s by the body of the ram, then static isn't an issue. Better safe than sorry is what I believe, hence the info above)    After you open your Memory Compartment panel, lay it aside. Reach down with both fingers of two hands, and ease those little locking tabs out. Doesn't take much to ease them out. It's just a little tricky your first time. Sometimes the ram 'stick' will pop-up, after the spring metal locks are eased to the outside. Sometimes the ram stick doesn't.     In this case, ease one lock tab out, and gently pull up on this side of the ram stick. -> Just a tiny little bit, until the metal lock tab is resting on the edge of the ram stick. Then go to the other side, and do the same.    The ram stick only comes up to a 45 degree angle. DO NOT force it into a straight up position! You'll damage the contact pins on the ram stick, and the ram stick slot!  You take the ram stick out at a 45 degree angle, and replace the ram stick the same way.    Align the ram stick in the ram slot. YOU will see that it only will go in, in one direction! There is an alignment slot, at the bottom of the ram stick. There is a locating lug in the bottom of the ram slot. These must be matched up.    The locating notch, (alignment slot), is offset to one side of a ram stick. Doesn't look like it at a first glance. Upon closer scrutiny, you'll see that it is.    After you have it aligned, gently push it down in the slot at a 45 degree angle. If it doesn't go, don't force it. Check your alignment again. If it is aligned properly, and is all the way down in the slot, gently push down, until the lock tabs 'click' into place.    There is a notch on each side of the ram stick. The metal lock tab MUST fit in each notch. The snapping of the metal lock tab into the notch, generally makes the 'click' sound I referred to before.

The heat is probably worst that then water.    Remove the battery from the laptop and make sure it is unplugged.  No power to it for 24 hours.

After 24 hours, attempt to power it on only the battery.  Then try again on the power cord.    If either (or both) fail, you will probably need a pro to look at the laptop.|`|1NWjta2jaa	First, stop blaming your brother... Just kidding.  Not much you can do in addition to what you are doing. Yes, try to dry it as much as you can and hope for the best. You know that water is a good conductor of electricity, so it might shorted something and when it's completely dry it may work. If it still doesn't work, something got fried. Take the machine to a repair place.|`|yVMGqyIwaa	pray your dad doesnt murder ur brother|`|xXlYRN0Iaa	Ok first thing to do!    TAKE THE HAIRDRYER OFF OF IT! That could fry some of the electrical parts and melt plastic!    1. Take the battery out.  2. Turn it upside down.  3. Let it air dry for ATLEAST 24 hours.    If the water and the harsh heat from the hair dryer haven't completely damaged it already you can still save it.    Good luck!|`|aZ3UBG5eaa	Don't freak out... But one thing that everybody should know (I am not saying this to be mean, so, take no offense) is that you should NEVER turn on anything electronic that has water on it, even if you dry it off, some water might have gotten inside, & when you turn it on the water acts as a circuit jumper & fries the mother board.    Don't worry, keep the thing off for a while & then try turning it on tomorrow.|`|mAly1gguaa	You should tell your dad the trust about it. And the first rule of at hand is to never take food or drink near any computer. The water shorted out parts inside the laptop and burned some parts out. If it was desk top you could go out and buy a new key board for it and is what so bad about laptops you just can't buy key board then it goes bad. It's cheaper to buy a new laptop than fixing it after putting water drink to it.  So now you have learned the hard way. You pray that father beat his butt.  And hope that he didn't beat you for covering it up for your brother. You should have done and talked to him about it already. I hope that Father and Mother well work things out about the laptop. Because him beating you and brother well not fix it or using a lot of bad words well not fix. And hoped you learned from it all.

NkbhHcIAaa	you did plug the modem to the router and changed the default router IP from 192.168.1.1 so it does not conflict with the modem correct|`|BRpEZTO8aa	Most BellSouth DSL modems already have all your login information... or is a modem/router hybrid.. If this is the case, you don't have to enter the user name and password on your Belkin. Just make sure that the Belkin's Local IP is not within the same range as the BellSouth modem.       From what I know, Bellsouth modems have this IP: 192.168.1.xxx so just change the IP of the Belkin to something like 192.168.2.xxx..and set the Belkin to Obtain its IP Automatically (Internet Connection Type)..      Well, that worked for me..before.
7vh5fOeRaa	It sounds like what you want to do is share the Internet connection (The Alltel Air Card) on one PC with a second PC.  It certainly can be done:    For Windows XP:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306126  http://www.practicallynetworked.com/shar...    For Windows Vista:  http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/21/how-t...      Here are directions for connecting two computers to each other wirelessly by building an ad-hoc network:  http://www.online-tech-tips.com/free-sof...    If you have difficulty doing this wirelessly, you can use a cross-over cable to connect two PCs in order to share an Internet connection:  http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows...    Crossover cables are fairly inexpensive and you should be able to find one at any Staples or Best Buy type store.    So give it a try wirelessly first... and then switch to a crossover cable if that does not work for you.|`|TTn6KDp5aa	Yes, I think. If you go to Control Panel(or System Preferences on Mac), you can set up the computer with the card as an Internet access point.    I THINK it's possible with wireless, but I'm not absolutely sure.

I guessed mine came from a video player that required installation (silly me!) and each time I typed something to go on, an anti-virus webpage would appear asking me to download. Then like 2/3 days later my desktop changed to a huge red warning sign, I was blocked from controll panel and task manager, my internet redirected every page to the antivirus one, even though they downloaded themselves somehow, then 2 days later the computer won't logon or go to startup, it just blue screens. I'm sorry if I'm worrying you here, by laptops literally broke now, so I suggest you get this seriously looked at by computer technicians, the sooner you track it the better.    How long has this been going on? 'Cos if it's started today, as soon as you turn it off, then back on again, it'll probably be worse (mine was)    Hope I helped. Try you best to detect anything now before closing down!|`|P8srm1h6aa	It sounds like you have a spyware in your PC.  If you have lavasoft, adaware program you can use it to run for spyware.  These spyware programs can change your Web browser's home page or search page, or add additional components to your browser you don't need or want. These programs also make it very difficult for you to change your settings back to the way you originally had them.  You can also try to do a system restore to its last known configuration.   To do this, go to start/program/accessories/system tools then system restore.  Once you select to restore computer to an earlier date then the next screen will show you the available restore check point.  You just need to make sure that the date you select is the date that your PC was working properly.  PC will reboot automatically once restore is completed.then depending on how bad the spyware infected your PC, the system restore may not work but it does not hurt to try.|`|9VaIwvcjaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools. Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link. Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections. E.g.    * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.  * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner  * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions. This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful. Good luck!|`|KnMpfK5Qaa	http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?jn...

AA10464818	The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys.     Legitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that. They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month.     Other companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).    The article "Earning Money from Surveys" provide a short list of legitimate market research firms and contains explanations of what to look for when joining surveys (and weeding out the fraudulent ones)  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol121/onlin...

If you can see the Fonts folder, you are not in classic view but rather you are in category view. To switch to classic view, click the "Switch to Classic View" on the upperleft most corner of your screen. When you click on that you can now see the "Fonts" icon.  3. DoubleClick on the Fonts icon to reveal all the fonts you are using. Locate the arial.ttf. Usually it is written as Arial (True Type) with a letter O icon and first on the list.   4.

AA11935119	- Run DISK CLEANUP regularly  - Run Defrag regularly  - Check your Anti-virus solution, get updates and run scans.  (Avoid the Internet Security editions, since they carry way too much baggage and slow down your system)    You should have an anti-spyware solution on your computer. I recommend that you go to http://www.download.com and get AD-AWARE and SpyBot Search & Destory. Install, run, update and scan your computer with both programs.    This double whammy will help keep you safe and running faster    - go to START and RUN, type MSCONFIG and uncheck programs that you do not need in the STARTUP section.    - Get more RAM.

One of which is a virus or bug. That is easy enough to find out if it is a common virus. All you need to do is run a virus check, after that the virus check will delete anything that it has found. If the anti-virus software won't run you should check and see how much memory/RAM space you have. If you have too many things saved to your desktop or if you have a lot of games that require a lot of memory it can mess your comp up, ex. any of The Sims games. For good anti-virus softwares you should check, http://www.symantec.com/downloads/index.... this is the anti-virus software I use.

If you only watch one or two cable TV shows, get them off the internet; a lot of good shows are available for download from iTunes (including Daily Show, Colbert Report and many many dramas). iTunes is (usually) $1.99 per episode, if you only watch 3-4 shows per week regularly, thats only $6-8 weekly and less than $40 per month.|`|c2d4376ec546145cbf5b76d91a3de370aa	Without a TV tuner card you can only watch internet TV heres a link http://wwitv.com/portal.htm

Unclick the "key is provided for me" and type in 0123456789 instead. press ok, then apply when it takes you back a screen.  After a minute or so it should find the network and connect.  hope this helps|`|637e7ebee1dcba42cd5ddfbc0cd527eaaa	The first thing to check is if your computer is on the same network numbering scheme.   The default address for the router is usually something like 192.168.1.1, so your machine has to have a number of 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.254 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.  The easy way is to make sure your computer can get a network address automatically, and restart your computer. Providing your computer is hooked up correctly with the cable, the netgear router should give your computer an address that is in the same range as the router.  If after you restart, and can not get to the router yet. check your network settings by going to START>>CONTROL PANELS>>NETWORK CONNECTIONS>>and double click on the connection that DOES NOT HAVE A RED X THROUGH IT.  There will be a window that will list "this connection uses the following items" Under it will be Internet protocol TCP?IP. Highlight that and then click properties. Make certain that the box which states Obtain ip address automatically" and obtain dns automatically is checked, then restart your machine. You should now be able to get to the web site.|`|297e0df28b2436b34fa660c1bf133634aa	You probably need to put you computer on the same subnet as the router.  Look in routers documentation to see what it is and how to get the page.    You also might need to reset the router.

You might have a bad router if those things don't work.|`|b8248cfb29fe36b1b7617d9cfbaf9831aa	If you can, do a hard reset.

(i'm assuming you already know whether your pc meets the minimum system requirements to be able to run xp?)    first off, backup all of your important files, such as work/pictures/music etc onto cd or some other kind of disk.    the do: start > run > dxdiag and print off the information - it is a list of your hardware. you will probably need to download xp versions of all drivers for your graphics card, moden, sound card etc. put these on the disk you backed up your files to.    then, reboot your pc and enter the setup/bios - when you switch on your pc you'll see something similar to 'press f2 to enter setup' or press delete or whatever, when you see that, press it.    within the setup/bios, look for the boot sequence section and re-arrange it so it searches cds before it searches the hard drive. save this change and exit, your computer will startup up again and say 'press any key to boot from cd' at which point you press a key.    follow the prompts and choose to format the drive with ntfs filesystem rather than keep filesystem intact. when done you should have xp on your system, and in device manager if you notice any hardware not working this is where the xp drivers you downloaded come in.|`|AA10818371	it's probably an old laptop-- and will not be able to handle WinXP.  i would suggest getting a new laptop(save time and nerves)|`|302de686b4a4e7337777418396c492a7aa	Older computers have a setting in bios that controls which drive is looked at first in the boot order. If this computer has a floppy drive, the sequence is probably A:/ and then C:/ (Floppy then HD). You just need to go into your bios and change it to B:/ then C:/ (CD then HD).    I had that problem when I upgraded my Pent II 300Mhz laptop to WinXP. Note that all I do on that computer is surf the web... it's too slow for anything else and there isn't much room on the HD for any apps after XP installed.

If you have none of these, you can also use Windows Paint for reducing image size. I recommend making it 50%, other formats will distort your image.    If you dont want to scale the images smaller you can use split the file into archives with WinRar (get it free from www.rarsoft.com). I use it to split large files when sending with yahoo mail.

0b41984f22128d691287182e6e7821f8aa	A blog is a website where entries are made in journal style and displayed in a reverse chronological order.    INTRODUCTION  So you've heard the term "blog" and you want to know what blogs are all about. Well you've come to the right place. In this series of four articles we will take you from asking what a blog is to having all the knowledge you need to start a blog of your own so you can share your thoughts with hundreds or even thousands of readers.     WHAT IS A BLOG?  Let's begin with some definitions. A bit dry, we realize, but this is a necessary evil. First we'll define the word this whole site is based around - blog.     A blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary. It is a place to express yourself to the world. A place to share your thoughts and your passions. Really, it's anything you want it to be. For our purposes we'll say that a blog is your own Web site that you are going to update on an ongoing basis. Blog is a short form for the word weblog and the two words are used interchangeably.     Here are a couple of other definitions:     "...the first journalistic model that actually harnesses rather than merely exploits the true democratic nature of the web. It's a new medium finally finding a unique voice."--Andrew Sullivan     "[a] collection of posts...short, informal, sometimes controversial, and sometimes deeply personal...with the freshest information at the top."--Meg Hourihan    TERMINOLOGY  As so often happens in the English language, many derivates of the word blog have been created. One who participates in the activities of maintaining a blog is known as a blogger and the activity of keeping a blog is known as blogging. So we could say that the blogger blogs in his blog, but that might cause your English teacher to weep. We are going to use these terms with alarming frequency, so make sure you understand what they mean before you go on.     Blog (noun) - a journal or diary that is on the Internet - Andrew Sullivan has the most popular blog on the Internet.     Blogger (noun) - a person who keeps a blog - Bloggers are revolutionizing the way news is shared.     Blog (verb) - to write a blog - I am going to blog before breakfast this morning.     Blogging (verb) - the action of writing a blog - Blogging is my way of sharing my passions with the world.     Originally blogs were known primarily as places for people to write about their day-to-day activities. Their mundane, everyday tasks became fodder for journal entries. Somehow these writers gained a following and the hobby of blogging was born. Today people write about far more interesting topics. But we'll get to that in a minute.     WHO BLOGS?  So who are these fearless people who would be willing to post about their lives in as public a forum as the Internet? They are people just like you. Once the haven of technical know-it-alls, blogging has suddenly caught-on as a legitimate hobby and has entered the mainstream. Every day millions of people, some of whom have no technical ability whatsoever, write on their blogs. To meet this demand some amazing tools have been created that will allow anyone, even people with very little knowledge of computers, to have their own blog. If you can find your way onto the Internet and follow some basic instructions you can have your own blog. It's just that easy.     WHY DO PEOPLE BLOG?  So you may be asking why anyone would want to have their own blog. We believe the answer lies in the fact that every human has a voice and wishes their voice to be heard. The Internet is a medium that is unparalleled in its reach. Never before have average people like you or me been able to reach a global audience with so little trouble. Bloggers have the opportunity of reaching hundreds or even thousands of people each and every day.     There are still many people who like to share the details of their days. They may post twenty or thirty times a day, detailing when they ate lunch and when they headed home from work. On the other hand there are bloggers who give almost no detail about their lives, but write instead about a hobby or interest of theirs. They may dedicate their blog to something they are passionate about. Let me give you some examples:     What is a blog?  A blog is a website powered by weblog software that let people easily publish online content. The weblog software neatly organizes content in a database, creates permanent addresses for each chunk published (a blog entry or post), and dynamically publishes the updated site.    After the blog has been created, youll only need to log in, type your post, click a button, and presto! your blog is updated with your latest and greatest creation. This is because in a blog, the structure/appearance of the site (the way the site looks and how the pages are organized) and the content are handled independently. Once you have selected a blog template or theme, youll only need to think of what you want to say and the blog software takes care everything else, including keeping track of all the previously content you created.|`|d664b4ebc41d218cc6d4ac2fcdd05e60aa	that will be 5 $ please.|`|77dd9850e9fc7bc0b61b36b8a9407fc7aa	Yes, you have read correct about it. Blogging is a new fad on the internet; it started around 2001. It stands for 'weB log'    Users are free to voice their opnions by the means of an Online Journal(like a daily diary) on any topic they like. Its a great way to express your ideas and opinions to the world; and also interact with like minded people.    There are plenty of blog sites like http://www.blogspot.com  http://360.yahoo.com and http://o3.indiatimes.com    A blogger can keep his/her identity hidden as well.|`|4320e273b6f5338e26c87fe527dba91eaa	its just like a dairy which is online and can bre read by others and they cud also comment on it.|`|c2b2b2b2651d7865a8f7e280a6b6ec55aa	http://www.blogspot.com

I would imagine that one would be C and one would be D.  This could give you flexibility to back-up your data between drives (setting up a RAID level 1array - disk mirroring), so both drives could contain exactly the same data.  This means your data on your computer would always be backed up, even if one of your disks failed.  It's more expensive to supply to 80GB disks than a single 160GB disk, so I imagine that's what they might be expecting you to do.|`|fcacb53faa08b798229db4ab2be0f0b5aa	It will be a big 160GB C Drive

Pouca influncia ir fazer o processador, j que o grfico , em sua maioria, responsabilidade do Controlador de Vdeo do PC. J vi um Pentium I-MMX executar emuladores de Nintendo 64, e o motivo principal era porque estava super equipada com um acelerador de som e vdeo.    Se voc quer realmente executar jogos com bastante cor, grfico e sem travamentos, recomendo uma placa Aceleradora de Vdeo 8x (AGP 8x) com 128MB de VRAM e uma placa de som, que pode ser PCI mesmo, com uns 32 MB de memria dedicada. Lembre-se que o sistema tem que trabalhar, tranquilo, portanto, seu PC, ao meu ver, deve ter pelo menos uns 512 MB de RAM.    Com isso, voc poder executar bons jogos.|`|3f8607eae73843b5d8f28f37b5efe093aa	sempron 2200!!!!|`|d81f5c59208b0fb3b00aac943129e098aa	Para games: Sempron 2200, disparado!|`|ebc8949117f1b4ed277f414fa001941baa	Os dois n?o s?o adequados para se jogar, recomendo um da linha Pentiun 4, Pentium D, Atilon XP ou Sempron acima de 1,8 Ghz.

eb1320fc6cbef5a39e1f58280f7b8fe8aa	The T-type or toggle flip-flop is the basis for all binary counters. A single T-type flip-flop is a 1-bit counter. Its output toggles or changes state on one of the edges of the input clock. In other words, it counts, in modulo-2, the number of clock pulses appearing at the input. If you compare the input clock signal with the output of the flip-flop, you will see why this is also a divide-by-2 circuit.  An M-bit counter can be created by cascading M stages of T-type flip-flops. This creates a divide-by-N counter where N = 2M. Such a counter is called a ripple counter since there is a ripple or domino effect as one flip-flop overflows into the next stage. The propagation delay between the input clock and when the last stage settles is the accumulated delay of each stage. Thus, all stages do not change at the same time. For this reason a ripple counter is called an asynchronous counter.|`|9265b3c724748ec043b637a2a159a472aa	Asynchronous (ripple) counters     Asynchronous Counter created from JK flip-flops.The simplest counter circuit is a single D-type flip flop, with its D (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% duty cycle at exactly half the frequency of the input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip flop (remembering to invert the output to the input), you will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two bit counter:    cycle Q1 Q0 (Q1:Q0)dec   0 0 0 0   1 0 1 1   2 1 0 2   3 1 1 3   4 0 0 0     You can continue to add additional flip flops, always inverting the output to its own input, and using the output from the previous flip flop as the clock signal. The result is called a ripple counter, which can count to 2n-1 where n is the number of bits (flip flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows "ripple" from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division ratio overall is. (To clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit - the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).      You can find the dtailed answer clicking the below link.|`|cc1d92d594531de6b21dd7f2d3c00089aa	Bcoz it makes Ripples in Graph.|`|da492a1f9e541854f11ab19df61933e3aa	b'coz each flipflop in the counter gets clockpulse only when output genrates at its preceeding flipflop except for first flipflop.    thus clock applied to flipflops is in ripple fashoin and each flipflop  gets clock asynchronously.so,ripple counter may be called asynchronous.

Saudi Arabia blocks web sites that the government doesn't think you should be going to, so you likely are out of luck.  There are ways around it (web anonymizers,) but, with a government that isn't known to be particularly tolerant of dissent or violations of Islamic law (like porn), I don't think I'd risk it.    See the "source" link below for a report on Saudi Internet filtering (in 2004)
82b66e4c9d1648127ea40369e3224323aa	This is known as windows messenger spam. Unless you have a legitimate need to have this service running, ie frequent use of tools like Net Send, etc., disable windows messenger service;  Start  Control Panel  Performance & Maintenance  Administrative Tools  Services  Right Click on Messenger and choose properties  Change start-up type to "Disabled"  Click Apply    DO NOT download the "patch" offered, it is an attempt to infect your computer.    btw, your firewall should be blocking the windows messenger ports (137-139) unless you are relying on ICF (the built in windows XP firewall) or have specifically unblocked these ports. If you are only using the ICF, firewall I would certainly replace it. There are many freeware alternatives available, try ZoneAlarm http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/ZoneAla...  as having the ports opened not only will allow messenger spamming , but provide access to any number of other well-known exploits, including the W32 Blaster worm and variants.    ______________________________________...     !!

72c06891bd93484ec49d7166b86570feaa	Sure.  Assuming your using windows XP. Right click on my computer-> click on advanced tab -> click on settings button under "performance" --> advanced tab --> virtual memory then change.    If you have 512mb of RAM set your initial size and maximum size to 768. If you have 1024 (gig) of ram set the initial and maximum size to 1536    Most gamers such as myself recommend you set you virtual memory to static. In such a case your virtual memory won't become fragmented as much, and therefore more stable over time. The game your playing more than likely has a what's know as a memory leak as well.. and that's just the bane of gaming. A static page file should help out.

First thing is that 52 kbps is the maximum speed on telephone line between your home PC and the nearest node of the Internet service provider.    So even if you have 52 kbps on your telephone, if your ISP is providing you less bandwidth for ex 4 kbps then effectively you will get only 4 kbps.    Simple way to undersand is that it is like a small pipe connecting to a dam/reservoir. It depends how big your pipe is between your home and the dam and second thing how much water is there in the dam

If you're just going for the LOOK of the squared writing, putting a superscript on a 2 as earlier suggested would work. However, if you need something a little more accurate in the computer use, Most computers will recognize "^" as meaning "To the power of", so X^2 would be X squared.     And although squared isn't one of them, you can get a lot of characters you normally can't type (including math symbols) by going to Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Character Map.

If in your case, WMP content usually would require authentication and purchase through methods like directing you to the owners site and having you pay for it to actually listen to em, which could be easily bypassed by just using tools like windows movie maker or such and using the "remove password" button.    On the other hand, if you're looking for legal stuff, then how about actually paying for the content you download, means don't hack the password.

This basically means that instead of a graphics card doing the work(all your graphics processing) your processor is doing it. It usually means that the processor will now take some of your Ram for all the graphics work, unlike graphics cards which have their own memory. And so that is why the actual amount does not show up, because a part of it is permanently reserved for graphics.

Transparency 1 is just the mannequin.   Transparency 2 is the red dress.  Transparency 3 is the black shoes.  Transparency 4 is the white hat.  If we lay all of the transparencies on the projector we have a full picture.  Now if we want to change the shoes we just replace the transparency of the shoes and don't have to create a whole new picture so on and so forth.  Layers work the same way.

Mas para isso  necessria uma boa dose de inocncia por parte de quem cai no golpe.|`|c91a5e53d80677a56b31f437c9856363aa	Em um phishing (tambm conhecido como phishing scam, ou apenas scam), uma pessoa mal-intencionada envia uma mensagem eletr?nica, geralmente um e-mail, recado no site Orkut ("scrap"), entre outros exemplos. Utilizando de pretextos falsos, tenta enganar a pessoa receptora da mensagem e induz-la a fornecer informa??es sensveis (nmeros de cart?es de crdito, senhas, dados de contas bancrias, entre outras) ou baixar e executar e arquivos que permitam o roubo futuro de informa??es ou o acesso n?o autorizado ao sistema da vtima.      [editar] Tipos de mensagem eletr?nica utilizadas    [editar] E-mail  Um estelionatrio envia e-mails falsos utilizando a identidade de entidades populares consideradas confiveis, tais como sites de entretenimento, bancos, empresas de cart?o de crdito, lojas, rg?os governamentais, etc.    Geralmente, as mensagens s?o enviadas para milh?es de endere?os de e-mail que foram previamente coletados na Internet. A entrega dos e-mails normalmente  feita por computadores que est?o sob o controle de pessoas mal intencionadas e incluem principalmente servidores web mal configurados e computadores com conex?o banda larga infectados com cavalos de tria (trojans) propositalmente desenvolvidos para permitir o envio de e-mail em massa (spam).      [editar] Roubo de identidade  Uma tcnica popular  o roubo de identidade via e-mail. Estelionatrios enviam e-mails tentando persuadir os receptores a fornecer dados pessoais sensveis, tais como nome completo, endere?o, nome da m?e, nmero de seguridade social, cart?es de crdito, nmeros de conta bancria, entre outros. Se captados, esses dados podem ser usados para obter vantagens financeiras.    A identidade usada nessas mensagens geralmente  de rg?os governamentais, bancos e empresas de cart?o de crdito. No corpo da mensagem normalmente existem links que apontam para sites falsos, normalmente muito parecidos com os sites verdadeiros, onde existem formulrios que a vtima deve preencher com as informa??es solicitadas. O contedo preenchido no formulrio  enviado ao estelionatrio.      [editar] Roubo de informa??es bancrias     Mensagem de phishing recebida por e-mail. Uma suposta admiradora secreta tenta convencer a vtima a clicar na "foto". Na verdade o link  um trojan bancrio.A forma de persuas?o  semelhante a do roubo de identidade, porm a mensagem recebida contm links que apontam pra sites que contm programas de computador que, se instalados, podem permitir a captura de informa??es, principalmente nmeros de conta e senhas bancrias. A instala??o desses programas , na maioria absoluta dos casos, feita manualmente pelo usurio. Tecnicamente pode existir a possibilidade da instala??o automtica desses programas apenas pela leitura da mensagem, mas isso depende de uma combina??o de muitos fatores, que raramente acontece (e que n?o vale a pena ser explicada aqui).    No Brasil, o phishing via e-mail n?o vem apenas com o nome de entidades famosas. S?o usados diversos tipos de assuntos com o intuito de atrair a curiosidade e fazer com que o receptor da mensagem clique no link contido junto ao corpo do e-mail. Na figura ao lado uma suposta admiradora secreta envia supostas fotos suas. Na verdade o link n?o contm fotos, mas sim um arquivo executvel, que ao ser baixado e executado instala um cavalo de tria (trojan) bancrio no computador do usurio.    Outro tema muito comum s?o os cart?es virtuais. Eles s?o um bom chamariz, visto que  comum as pessoas trocarem cart?es virtuais via e-mail. Os supostos cart?es virtuais normalmente tem a sua identidade associada a de algum site popular de cart?es virtuais. Isso ajuda a tentativa de legitimar o golpe e tenta dar mais credibilidade  farsa. A mensagem tem o mesmo formato e geralmente utiliza as imagens originais dos sites de cart?es virtuais. Um detalhe que o usurio deve prestar a aten??o s?o aos erros de gramtica que essas mensagens geralmente apresentam.       Outro exemplo de phishing. Um suposto cart?o virtual. Na verdade o link  um trojan bancrio. Observe o final do endere?o na barra de status.  Outro detalhe fundamental  que ao clicar em links contidos nessas mensagens quase sempre  aberta uma janela para download de arquivo. Nenhum site srio de cart?es requer que o usurio baixe qualquer arquivo!      [editar] Recados no Orkut ("scraps")  Recentemente, o popular site Orkut.com tem sido muito utilizado para o roubo de informa??es bancrias atravs de mensagens de phishing deixadas no "Livro de recados" ("scrapbook") dos participantes.    A identidade contida nas mensagens  de uma pessoa conhecida da vtima, o que aumenta a probabilidade de sucesso do golpe. Essa identidade  obtida normalmente pelo roubo (geralmente via phishing) do login e da senha do Orkut da pessoa que est "enviando" o recado.    O contedo do recado  algo pitoresco, tal como fotos de supostas festas, assuntos sobre celebridades, piadas, entre outras coisas. A mensagem contm um link que aponta diretamente para um cavalo de tria de captura de senhas bancrias (e as vezes senhas do prprio Orkut). Esse programa  manualmente baixado e executado pelas vtimas do golpe. atualmente est se usando tecnicas de pishing via navegador no prprio orkut, os perfis dos usuarios agora aparecem como links para sites variados tanto para pishing ou como apenas captura do endereco ip para mandar inuteis pop-ups ou para encher teus e-mails de comerciais ou qualquer outro tipo de tecnica de scan seja qual for ela.      [editar] Dicas para se proteger    [editar] Alguns cuidados ao ler e-mail  Verifique o remetente do email   Desconfie de e-mails que n?o tenham um remetente conhecido.

You could also only allow certain MAC addresses to use the router. A MAC address is basically a unique serial number burnt into every network card.    Open the router configuration tool and go to the advanced tab. The Wireless Management menu is used to control MAC address access to the wireless access point and to view a list of MAC addresses that are currently associated with the access point. Make sure the Access List radio button is selected an the Enable Access List check box is checked. Now check to see what your MAC address is. Click Start->Run and type in cmd and click OK. Now type     ipconfig /all    look for the physical address. This will be your MAC address. You can then place this address in the access list as enabled. Of course, you can also just ban the MAC addresses that are not yours.    More info is in the manual.

Some programs used to use bit 7 (the sign bit) to signal alt, but that is frowned on because it only works for basic ASCII, and is not extensible to other character sets.

This is required by the Red Book CD audio standard, although manufacturers sometimes include larger leadouts than the minimum 90 seconds. Some CD writing software lets you overburn a disc so that you can take advantage of this spare space.

9db5201a96707708fe6df1a387511f2caa	If you havent yet heard the name Centrino, Intel wants to make sure that you hear it soon. They are spending $300 million to market this new technology.    Intel is known for producing processor chips, and this is the first time that Intel has branded a combination of technologies under one name. The technologies include the Pentium M chip, a newly designed microprocessor, the integrated 802.11b wireless capability provided by the Intel Pro/Wireless 2100 Network Connection, and a new 855 chipset. These components are designed, optimized and validated by Intel to maximize the wireless mobile computing experience.    The mainstay of the Centrino technology is the Pentium M chip. The M obviously stands for mobile, since this technology will be used in portable computers. (It is, however, a confusing nomenclature because Intel has a previous chip called the Pentium 4-M which uses an entirely different technology.) Initial testing shows the Pentium M chip to have outstanding performance. This chip running at 1.6Ghz is outperforming other comparable chips, even those running at higher speeds. Since this chip runs cooler and has reduced power needs, notebook users will also find that the Pentium M extends battery life considerably. Some tests show Pentium M laptops getting as much as four hours battery power on a singe charge.    The Pentium M chip is now available in laptops by many different manufacturers. A Pentium M chip portable computer can only be called Centrino if manufacturers use all three parts of the Centrino technology, including the wireless conductivity.    Intel is so focused on the new Centrino mobile technology brand name that they have developed a new Centrino logo which incorporates the famous Intel Inside trademark in a new shape logo with a striking magenta color. If you havent seen this yet, you are sure to see it soon. And if you will be purchasing a new notebook computer, you will also see the increased performance and battery life that both Centrino notebooks and Pentium Mclass notebooks are now offering.    The CentrinoTM mobile technology will make it possible to create thinner and lighter notebook computers with built-in wireless capability, extended battery life and improved performance. These components are designed, optimized and validated by Intel to maximize the wireless mobile computing experience. Personal computers with CentrinoTM mobile technology were displayed recently at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show, and showed outstanding mobile performance. Centrino-based systems are scheduled to be introduced later in the first half of 2003.|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	Centrino (also called Centrino Mobile Technology) is a marketing initiative from Intel for a particular combination of CPU, mainboard chipset and wireless network interface in the design of a laptop personal computer. The combination currently consists of a Pentium M processor, the Mobile Intel 915 Express chipset family or the Intel 855 chipset family, and an Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 (IEEE 802.11b), PRO/Wireless 2200 (IEEE 802.11bg) or PRO/Wireless 2915 (IEEE 802.11abg) network connection.|`|AA10518849	Centrino technology made by Intel is specially designed for laptops.

Built with mobility in mind, both technologies feature an architected CPU, chipset and wireless connectivity, along with a great battery life. Businesses with staff using laptops and other devices embedded with Intel? Centrino? mobile technology enjoy enhanced employee productivity, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and longer platform stability.  Mobility and Productivity    In today's competitive business arena, dramatic productivity gains are increasingly rare. Mobile computing is an exception, bringing substantial increases in worker productivity. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) free your workforce from designated work areas and provide a new level of flexibility for rapidly evolving business models. Mobile workers enjoy greater flexibility, increased collaboration, location independence and less downtime.  Cost control    Intel defines overall costs as a combination of capital, technical support, and administration costs, combined with operational use and downtime. Intel? Centrino? mobile technology contributes in all four categories.    Intel? Centrino? mobile technology has integrated WLAN connectivity to reduce capital costs through the lifecycle of your IT investment by embedding the technology now instead of later. Ensuring compatibility with leading public access points means less technical support calls and costs.    Businesses with a common Intel? chipset across all mobile form factors can reduce admin costs by standardising on a common Intel? chipset across all mobile form factors. Intel? Centrino? mobile technology is a collection of Intel's best technologies and companies can rest assured their mobile computers are the most reliable they can buy, reducing downtime.

e3e9170314039ee1b1bce8b333b27dfdaa	The basic definition is "lower quality"    The more technical definition is that the dimension in pixels are lowered. Like lets say you have it set to 800X600 right now. Well, lowering the resolution would mean taking it down to something like 640X480. This makes your picture physically smaller, as well as makes the file smaller. And it also reduces the quality.|`|e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	Resolution is essentially the quality of the image once it's been digitized. Low Resolution=low quality.    Low resolution images are okay for viewing on a computer screen, but you could never print them or produce photo copies from them.|`|c8ac75a975fb286b9e5fa3746ac85061aa	Basically think of resolution as quality.  Often times people will use 800 by 600 resolution on their computer screen.  Think of that like 800 pixels by 600 pixels.  Now think of a pixel as a tiny square composed entirely of one solid color.  So when looking at a computer screen set to 800 by 600 you are basically looking at 480,000 dots that are each one solid primary color such as red, blue, or yellow.  When you look at them from a short distance away the colors blend and you can't see the dots and blue dots by yellow dots seem to be a green area of the screen.  The more dots the higher quality the image.  Imagine looking at one of your photographs in 8 by 6 resolution.  It would be impossible to have any idea what you were looking at.  Definitely go for the high resolution or you'll regret it later on.|`|aa52216830aef17907eb11c7f9310722aa	With computers, screen resolution, is the number of pixels in each direction displayed on a screen. Note that I did not say put simply, because it isn't put simply. That's the definition.    Resolution is expressed as two numbers like 1024 by 768. That means 1024 pixels along the bottom of your screen, and 768 pixels along the sides of your screen. This comes to 786432 pixels on your screen. Each pixel is a tiny rectangle, which has three lights, red, blue, and green. With all of them off, the pixel is black, and with them all on, the pixel is white. (The person before me who said they're either red, blue, or yellow is amazingly wrong.) Each of the lights in the pixel turns on and off independently. This is where the RGB color picker comes from. The three colors in RGB are the fundamental colors actually emitted by your monitor.    Lower resolution does not necessarily mean lower quality. If you lower the resolution on your computer, the taskbar will look bigger. This because the computer measures its size in pixels, not the physical size on the screen. With a lower resolution, there is no quality loss in things like the taskbar, dialog boxes, and other user interface elements.|`|5c7c77195c5538ac5f796bf67c3eb28daa	An image or screen in relatively coarse detail. In raster-oriented printing or displays, low resolution has to do with the number of pixels or dots used to reproduce the image. The fewer the pixels, the lower the resolution.
5af017cbe3d4cfc8093c70b6c4a92844aa	A "domain" is a group of connected computers.  It has a domain controller which manages all of the connections and security.  A typical domain would be a Local Area Network where you work.  A web site is, physically, a computer or related group of computers that supply a connection for some service like Yahoo.  Now, that is a simplification at best.  The main thing is that a domain doesn't normally have a web server.  It can, but doesn't have to.  A web site has to have at least one.|`|9ee3cc9edb64f968c41f21f9f3d0cabaaa	Domain is the backend, Website is the frontend.|`|eb1320fc6cbef5a39e1f58280f7b8fe8aa	hi buddy go this link.

a7018ab2b90ae2b638e7ad6b22367810aa	SIM; Apesar de ele ser para XP original, ele n?o  t?o rpido    IE ou Firefox? Seja qual for sua preferncia, h novos elementos a considerar. Com a chegada das novas vers?es desses populares navegadores, eles incorporam recursos interessantes, em reas como seguran?a e add-ons (extens?es que incrementam o software).    Confrontamos os dois programas para apontar a melhor op??o.    A vers?o 7 do navegador dominante da web chega com mudan?as de interface e novos recursos. J o Firefox 2 mostra poucas mudan?as em rela??o  vers?o anterior (1.5), lan?ada no ano passado.    Pela primeira vez ele inclui uma ferramenta anti-phishing embutida. Muitas das outras mudan?as simplesmente refinam os mesmos atributos  que s?o novos no IE7.    A vers?o 2 melhora navega??o, o suporte a RSS (feeds de notcias) e o gerenciamento de add-ons. Infelizmente, ainda existem sites feitos para o Internet Explorer que n?o s?o exibidos muito bem com o Firefox 2.    A Microsoft tinha um longo caminho a percorrer para chegar ao nvel dos competidores (o IE 6 foi lan?ado em 2001) e o IE7 surgiu como um ampla reforma. A nova interface, que agora permite navegar por abas, inclui busca integrada e suporte para RSS.    A Microsoft ainda acrescentou uma ferramenta anti-phishing e refor?ou a seguran?a para o IE7 (uma resposta s vulnerabilidades sem fim do IE 6).    A aparncia do IE 7  semelhante  do Vista. Os bot?es Voltar, Avan?ar, Favoritos e a barra de endere?os est?o comprimidos em duas linhas na parte de cima, junto com um novo box de busca que pode ser customizado com a escolha de mecanismo de navega??o.    H novas e bem-vindas abas  que podem ser arrastadas conforme a vontade do usurio  para assim exibir mltiplas pginas dentro de uma janela do Internet Explorer. Tambm  possvel fazer o IE se lembrar das abas abertas e, assim, visualiz-las da prxima vez em que for usado.    Menos bvios, os updates das abas do Firefox 2 est?o um passo  frente dos realizados no Internet Explorer. O browser da Funda??o Mozilla pode ser configurado para salvar sempre sua ultima sess?o para uso futuro; com o IE7  necessrio selecionar em uma caixa todas as vezes.    O Firefox ainda permite reabrir abas fechadas por meio do menu de Histrico ou clicando com o bot?o direito numa aba aberta. Porm, o Firefox n?o oferece miniaturas prvias.    Os feeds RSS proporcionam uma tima maneira de checar rapidamente as notcias e updates de diferentes sites sem a necessidade de visit-los. O suporte RSS  novo no IE7 e foi melhorado no Firefox 2.    No navegador da Microsoft, se voc navegar numa pgina com feed associado, um cone na parte direita da se??o de abas surgir. Clique nele e ver as ltimas manchetes. No Centro de Favoritos encontra-se o histrico de navega??o. Contudo, n?o h meios rpidos de obter preview do contedo do feed sem abrir a pgina no IE, o que de certa forma vai contra o seu propsito.    O Firefox 2 traz novas op??es de assinatura de RSS.  possvel incorporar feeds de uma pgina pessoal do Blognlines, Google Reader ou do My Yahoo.    Ambos os navegadores adicionaram atributos anti-phishing feitos para prote??o contra sites falsos que tentam enganar os usurios e roubar suas informa??es financeiras.    SEGURAN?A:O recurso do Firefox bloqueia com base numa compara??o com uma lista negra, enquanto que o IE 7 inclui uma anlise de pginas e exibe alertas sobre sites suspeitos, mesmo que ainda n?o tenham sido catalogados  procedimento semelhante ao dos pacotes de seguran?a mais recentes. Logicamente, o recurso n?o  perfeito.    Os usurios do IE ter?o uma escolha igualmente fcil. A vers?o 7 , sem dvida, superior  6. Agora, entre os dois concorrentes, o Firefox continua sendo o melhor.    Espero ter ajudado!  ______________________________________...|`|2fb117cfa28fd57a028351c15fdda700aa	N?o, n?o  verdade.

9dbb2be6163f0d530d27670b0cc6d182aa	Yes it is posiible to get wireless connection at home as long as you have your Wi-Fi Disk in your home or an infrared transmitter and transciever!          Considering a mobile phone with internet access is not good as having cable connection, wireless support only up to 198kbps file transfer and aside from that it is expensive to use,  unlike having ADSL  which is having 100Mbps file transfer per second, depending on your ISP and Net Plan... But either way i'll recommend you a better one to use ... using a Fiber Optic Cable as your coonection cable to network it can gives you the best performance you expected , it has a file transfer which is as fast as speed of light... though it is expensive!|`|fpGI2l7Baa	Using a mobile phone would be very slow and very xpensive.    Depending of where you live there are wireless ISP's but these are quite limited still. Cloud are one. search them out. Either that or just see if there are any unsecured one's that you could use. (with owners agrement ofcourse ;))|`|68356cb7bad1e68a462443a261dd7ef5aa	If you have a wireless adapter on your laptop, you should be able to "View Available Wireless Networks" by right clicking on the Wireless Network Connection under "Network Connections."  If you're using phone line, you're either using dial-up or DSL, both of which are not wireless.  If you don't have a wireless adapter, you can't go online wirelessly on your laptop.|`|f6f3bad18fad3d0e5c0cd0cfbde2d092aa	You can only run a wireless connection if you have an access point for the wireless card to connect to.  An access point can be a public access point - in a library, for example - or a private access point.  What problem did you get with the ADSL router?  Is is configured (or able) to provide wireless connections?    You can get mobile phones that provide an Internet connection but the speed is nowhere near the speed of broadband.  You will also be limited in what you can do on the tiny keyboard looking at a tiny screen!    Update your question with further information and I'll try to help more.|`|36b955fb51b9278c52c7acf89bb9895baa	I Take it u are using AOL Broadband then.    It should work, but i know a few people for which it did'nt.  They then used a bt router (as i do for main computer and laptop) and it worked fine. Mobile internet  is really for someone who needs internet access most of the time when they are out and about.    Fn & F1 will conect ur laptop once it is set up. Yoy got to make sure your details are put in correctly. Seriel No etc. Use the wireless wizard to set up.    Good Luck
AA12090277	I don't have that problem at all. I run Windows XP SP2 on a Dell desktop.You might have an older system or computer or something. Those are the people who usually experience problems. I suggest you upgrade your system, or redo WLM again.

Are you using a different browser other than IE?    If not, empty all of your unneccessary files, (Temp, History, ect) and restart.  If that doesn't work, download it again and see if that fixes the problem.

VlfWKB63aa	A computer is a machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions.    Computers take numerous physical forms. Early electronic computers were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers. [1] Today, computers can be made small enough to fit into a wrist watch and be powered from a watch battery. Society has come to recognize personal computers and their portable equivalent, the laptop computer, as icons of the information age; they are what most people think of as "a computer". However, the most common form of computer in use today is by far the embedded computer. Embedded computers are small, simple devices that are often used to control other devicesfor example, they may be found in machines ranging from fighter aircraft to industrial robots, digital cameras, and even children's toys.  A computer in a wristwatch.  A computer in a wristwatch.    The ability to store and execute programs makes computers extremely versatile and distinguishes them from calculators. The ChurchTuring thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: Any computer with a certain minimum capability is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, computers with capability and complexity ranging from that of a personal digital assistant to a supercomputer are all able to perform the same computational tasks so long as time and storage capacity are not considerations.|`|619dc8630ccfea7a3d2c55baae5fc84eaa	its a stupit question|`|AA12074919	Computer is An electronic device for the storage and processing of Data .It is total based on inputs, processes and outputs .A computer stores, retrieves, and processes data, and work according to user instruction.

zgDipa75aa	Here goes an answer for 5 Marks.    Update:               - This is an query used for data manipulation.               - For updating any query you need to move the pointer to the specific location.               - It is helpful in correcting the errors made in insertion or to change any information without deleting the record fully.               - The storage location of the data doesnt change in update.    Append:              - It is an data Insertion query.              - Data/Record are inserted at the end.              - The pointer moves directly to the location, EOF-1. EOF is End of file and it is an Pointer which specifies that there is no more data available and this is the termination point in any file.             - Helpful in entering New record without moving the file.              I think this may give u atleast 4 marks.  Hope you are satisfied with this....please do tell me about any change which are suggested you by the person who is going to check this answer.  Thank You|`|AA12175750	In update query you change the existing records whereas in append query, you add a new record    The record count does not change in update query, but in append the record count gets added    there is a posibility of data loss if you over write an existing record, but in append query, you do not change the existing record and just add additional data to a new record.    Hope this is Ok!|`|9f370bc437d12a2a92dbf03140c3972eaa	Append creates a new record, update works on an existing record.    Append creates a new record at the end, update just changes the last modified time stamp of the record
414b2aa396684d7f0b75648cdda22e8baa	As the previous answer mentioned you go to the frame you want the animation to stop on and click into the actions panel and give it a stop action.    To add a replay button, make a button symbol and place in into the movie on the frame which your movie has stopped. The click the button and assign it a 'Goto and Play' action in the actions panel set the frame number as 1 so that the button will return the movie to frame 1 and play again.|`|917bcbdeadf720b29b3e65b4d2acc319aa	to learn macromedia flash in a pro way... before that try www.swishzone.com... its actually a flash programming software.... but its made easy for beginers....|`|AA11395404	go to the last frame and right click - actions - + - actions - movie control - stop|`|GZ5ADjRjaa	To have the animation play more than once before stopping you will have to add some conditional logic to the movie.    On the last frame of the movie add this stop action...    stop();      Then on the button put this script...    on(release) = function(){       gotoAndPlay(1);  }    Enjoy!
