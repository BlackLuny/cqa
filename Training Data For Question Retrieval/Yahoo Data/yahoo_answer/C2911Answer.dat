Look up the Milankovitch cycles.<br>  <br>  But lately, not a lot, according to the Solar Center at Stanford University, the Max Planck Institute for Solar Research, and the PMOD in Switzerland. All say that solar radiation has been flat for about 30 years, while over the same period global temperatures have been increasing.<br>  <br>  Despite what climate change deniers may tell you, modern global warming (i.e, the warming that has occurred in the last 20-30 years) does not correlate with solar radiation, or sunspot activity at all. <br>  <br>  Yes, the South Pole of Mars is melting, but not the North. All that proves is that Mars has its own climate. Why not? It's a planet too. But as the as the people who monitors solar activity for a living will tell you, there's no evidence of any recent increase in solar temperature here on Earth whatsoever.|`|AA11264399	The sun is of course the main influence on global temperature, but without the *natural* greenhouse gases our planet would be several tens of degrees colder than it actually is.

Global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) during the 100 years ending in 2005.[1][2] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that most of the temperature increase since the mid-twentieth century is "very likely" due to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,[2][1] and natural phenomena such as solar variation and volcanoes probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward.[3][4] These basic conclusions have been endorsed by 30 scientific societies and academies of science,[5] including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.[6][7][8]<br>  <br>  Climate model projections indicate that global surface temperature will likely rise a further 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) during the twenty-first century.[1] Increasing global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, likely including an expanse of the subtropical desert regions.[9] Other likely effects include Arctic shrinkage and resulting Arctic methane release, shrinkage of the Amazon rainforest, increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, changes in agricultural yields, modifications of trade routes, glacier retreat, species extinctions and changes in the ranges of disease vectors.<br>  <br>  Political and public debate continues regarding the appropriate response to global warming. The available options are mitigation to reduce further emissions; adaptation to reduce the damage caused by warming; and, more speculatively, geoengineering to reverse global warming. Most national governments have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>  <br>  <br>  Greenhouse gas and Greenhouse effect<br>  The causes of the recent warming are an active field of research. The scientific consensus[10][11] is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity has caused most of the warming observed since the start of the industrial era, and the observed warming cannot be satisfactorily explained by natural causes alone.[12] This attribution is clearest for the most recent 50 years, which is the period when most of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations took place and for which the most complete measurements exist.<br>  <br>  The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824[13] and first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. It is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by atmospheric gases warm a planet's lower atmosphere and surface. Existence of the greenhouse effect as such is not disputed. The question is instead how the strength of the greenhouse effect changes when human activity increases the atmospheric concentrations of particular greenhouse gases.<br>  <br>   <br>  Recent increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The monthly CO2 measurements display small seasonal oscillations in an overall yearly uptrend; each year's maximum is reached during the Northern Hemisphere's late spring, and declines during the Northern Hemisphere growing season as plants remove some CO2 from the atmosphere.Naturally occurring greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about 33 °C (59 °F), without which Earth would be uninhabitable.[14][15] On Earth the major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36–70 percent of the greenhouse effect (not including clouds); carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26 percent; methane (CH4), which causes 4–9 percent; and ozone, which causes 3–7 percent.[16][17]<br>  <br>  Human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the atmospheric concentration of various greenhouse gases, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide. The atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and methane have increased by 36% and 148% respectively since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid-1700s.[18] These levels are considerably higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores.[19] Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2 values this high were last seen approximately 20 million years ago.[20] Fossil fuel burning has produced approximately three-quarters of the increase in CO2 from human activity over the past 20 years. Most of the rest is due to land-use change, in particular deforestation.[21]<br>  <br>  CO2 concentrations are expected to continue to rise due to ongoing burning of fossil fuels and land-use change. The rate of rise will depend on uncertain economic, sociological, technological, and natural developments. The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios gives a wide range of future CO2 scenarios, ranging from 541 to 970 ppm by t
jtoxFsdYaa	The question is, just how "green" are electric cars? They are only green if the electricity used to charge them comes from a low emission generating station. Otherwise, we are just moving the source of greenhouse gasses from the vehicle to the power station. Even the use of built-in solar panels to generate some of their electricity has it's downside as the production process for solar cells itself is high in power consumption. Ultimately it comes down to the fact that we get nothing for free. The greenest form of transport available to us is our legs, and there are many other health benefits to be had there too.|`|5QrLcg6laa	Should be done now<br>  <br>  Install electric car recharging facilitis around the country<br>  <br>  Also use more biofuel cars|`|q6phm94caa	No UK government is going to make a wholehearted commitment to Electric Cars, for the simple reason that electric cars aren't the solution to Britain's future transport and environmental problems.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly there will be an increase in electric transport technology and investment, but private electric cars have limitations on their economic and environmental benefits. For the foreseeable future they will only be practical for a small sector of private transport. Investment in improved efficiency vehicle design (including electric final drive technology) is likely to show greater overall benefit to the environment<br>  <br>  If we want to lobby for greener, more efficient, transportation, we should be looking toward changes in lifestyle and working habits which reduce the mileage we travel each year. For example, workable systems for getting kids to school and home safely every day, improved public transportation to reduce car usage needs, changes in work location and reduction in work travel made possible by improved communications systems.|`|kg0ig2Edaa	We shouldnt encourage people to make the global warming situation worse!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Electric transport is a V VERY deeply flawed argument and will only make things worse.

Pine beetles aren't creatures of intelligence. They just go were the wood is and eat it. How is it that global warming DOESN'T play a role in the pine beetles spread? And not just Colorado, it's British Columbia's forests are being destroyed as well. <br>  <br>  Deforestation is causing global warming to speed up since rain forest was sucking up a lot of carbon dioxide, which is now floating around the atmosphere and trapping more warm air which is warming up the Earth. So yes it does relate to quality of air but also global warming. <br>  <br>  You sound like you don't exactly believe in global warming so the CNN article was rather moot for you. Or at least you have your understanding about it backwards.|`|oxriDchOaa	First of all, never trust CNN on anything other than the news.  If CNN tells you that there was a fire in California or that Obama won the election, you can probably trust it.  If CNN gives its Oscar picks or recommends vacation spots or speculates on the environment, ignore it.  It's usually written by some overworked intern who spent 10 minutes on wikipedia.  It's worse than dumb, its dangerously misleading.<br>  <br>  Second, you seem to have fallen under the spell of the anti-Global Warming lobby.  I admit that there is some confusing data and some obnoxious left-wing blowhards, but Global Warming is real and anyone who follows science can tell you that.  As a Canadian, I have seen a clear change in my lifetime.  The winter that used to come in November  now comes at Christmas.  March has moved from winter to spring.  Something is happening.<br>  <br>  Whenever there is a debate, always look at who stands to gain the most on each side.  In the Global Warming debate, environmentalists have relatively little to gain.  Sure, there are green products and companies, but the average environmentalist doesn't own a company.  Most green products are being produced by businessmen who see a growth industry, not environmentalists creating their own market.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it is easy to see who benefits from denying Global Warming.  Big business has thrown millions of dollars at scientists-for-hire in order to create confusion and doubt, and its working.  For example, Steven Milloy, who writes the 'Junk Science' column for foxnews.com, has been shown to be on the payroll of many large companies with vested interests in looser safety and environmental regulations.<br>  <br>  And now, finally getting to your points:<br>  1. New Orleans has always been under sea level, that's nothing new.  However, the sea is rising due to global warming.  That means that it is going to be further below sea level, which means that smaller storms will be able to top the levees and a broken levee will create a bigger flood.<br>  <br>  2. Glaciers in the Alps "may" melt in the middle of the century.  They "are" melting now.  They "will" melt eventually.  We aren't very good at forecasting 40 years in advance, but we do know that they are in trouble.<br>  <br>  3. Pine beetles are sensitive to cold.  Their spread is limited by the cold, and an especially cold winter can wipe out their entire population.  That is why global warming is being blamed, especially in British Columbia.  A string of mild winters has allowed them to cause incredible damage.<br>  <br>  4. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most incredible sights on Earth, and it is dying fast.  It is true that fish still eat the dead coral, but that's little consolation.  There are fish everywhere; it's the coral that's the attraction and it's the coral that is dying.  <br>  <br>  5. The Amazon Rain Forest isn't being threatened directly by Global Warming, but it is disappearing fast.  To say "they should of never cut so many trees to begin with" is incredibly naive.  They are cutting trees because Americans want exotic wood and cheap bananas.  We pay them to cut down the trees.  Global Warming is somewhat related to deforestation, because many places that have traditionally produced food are now suffering drought, which puts more pressure on fertile nations like Brazil and makes it more profitable to chop down rain forest.<br>  <br>  Also, you cannot replant a rain forest like you can replant a forest in the US.  The rain forest depends on almost constant rainfall, hence the name.  Once you cut down the big trees that create the canopy, the water is able to evaporate and the plants below die.  You can't simply replant the trees you cut down because small trees can't hold in moisture.<br>  <br>  I suggest you learn a bit more about the environment before you casually dismiss global warming.  There's a lot more to it than you hear on TV.
TbTO5SXlaa	In 1978, the Ohio River froze solid and I watched people walk across from Jeffersonville, IN to Louisville, KY. Leading scientists were lecturing - and writing books - about the coming ice age. There were reports of glaciers expanding and threatening communities in Russia and Canada. It was, as Shakespeare said, "Much ado about nothing."<br>  <br>  Now we're being told that unless we stop using fossil fuels and scale back our lifestyles to pre-industrialization standards we're all going to drown from the melting polar ice caps. Maybe Obama can give his brother George a job teaching us how to be happy living in a 9x9 hut and cooking over an open fire. Gosh, it'll be like camping out only every day.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't surprise anyone that researchers seeking lucrative grants have joined in this effort.

Once the only area of life, around the equator, is the only thing left, the temperatures heat up again due to building co2 in the air. plants grow by using all the co2 in the air and the ice moves back north to only complete the cycle again some other time.|`|USY4CYJlaa	Nah but things hav definitely been exaggerated|`|GHefTsUyaa	The planet is a living thing and always changing.Over millions of years we have had ice ages and also periods when deserts have extended into Northern Europe.<br>  It's now become a political football.|`|w29tsXLUaa	The world has been here before.

Also, there are MORE polar bears now than 25 years ago too!<br>  <br>  Without hunting being allowed - animals will slowly starve to death during the winter months.  Hunting animals where legally permitted culls the herds out so there are more healthy animals to procreate during the spring. <br>  <br>  Money from the sale of hunting licenses pays to support hiking trails and other nature programs and general support of animal management.<br>  <br>  Loss of hunting license sales also hurts states economies:<br>  <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090215/NEWS/902150333" rel="nofollow">http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  If the US went back to the amount of trees we had 200-300 years ago we would have fewer trees than we do now!   Lumber companies re-plant trees after they cultivate the trees they need.   Lumber companies also put in roads, clean up brush and sometimes install water lines.   Forests that do not have lumber harvested often burn to the ground because there is no way for the fire department to get in to stop the fires.   Millions of animals die in forest fires.   <br>  <br>  In the US the forest fires you see burning out of control every summer are almost always in protected forests where there are no roads, no water lines and no tree harvesting!   Forests burn and animals die by the millions!<br>  <br>  Hundreds of years ago human beings just let forest fires burn out of control, consuming valuable trees and killing millions of animals, now we put out forest fires - another reason there are more trees now than in our distant past.<br>  <br>  So, do you really want to return to the same forest management that we had 200 years ago - which was practically none at all!

However hunting does many good things for wildlife.  It keeps populations in check and under control, because humans have done things to encourage huge population growths of animals.  It also keeps them healthy, you remove the factors of disease spreading and inbreeding.  Humans have hunted animals ever since the first walked upright on the planet, you will never get rid of it.  <br>  <br>  There is much more progress in forestry.  We are getting better and better each day at spreading the word to loggers about the amount of highgrading they are doing, and helping them to slow down.  We will always need fiber to survive, for homes, medicines, paper.  Maybe 90% of the items you touch everyday or come in contact with require some sort of wood use.  We need it.  <br>  <br>  Our forests in the US are at the point where they are starting to grow faster than we are cutting them, so foresters like me have done their job.  We accomplished our goals and hopefully we can sustain it there.  Other 3rd world countries are cutting at an alarming rate, but it is because it is an easy accessible resource for them to compete in the global market.  They will soon slow down, hire foresters and they will be able to achieve sustainability.<br>  <br>  Key things:<br>  We will always need to hunt animals.  If you want to keep animals healthy and surviving, hunting has to be done<br>  We will always need to wood too.  You can't get away from it.  Try going through a day without touching or using anything which contains something from wood...you can't do it.|`|MI0MIAfaaa	200 years ago, the forests that are now the northeastern deciduous forests in the Eastern US were not there.

What is happening to most forest is called land use change, most forest tending to be reduced in size and/or changed to agricultural use which means those particular stands will disappear but the forest type will probably continue.  Those lands that were once forested could return to a different forest type once the land is abandoned, as usually happens.

But there are some aspects that are similar to the things you would do in a war.<br>  <br>  1. There is a need for some collective actions and adjustment of actions. This collective action is really at the root of anyone who claims it is a "socialist/communist" or "world government" kind of problem. I submit that the earlier we as individuals choose to react and do what we can the less intrusive any regulation that does come along eventually will be.<br>  <br>  The extension of this point is that international cooperation based on the motivated self interests of countries is all that is required. the UN or some other body need not necessarily try to regulate the nations of the world, but if we model a private market having some general agreement on carbon trading and technology transfer is probably a good thing.<br>  <br>  Like in World War 1 and 2, conservation of resources, and a degree of thinking about your responsibility as a citizen are probably required for best success.<br>  <br>  2. There really is no "winning" there are however degrees of "losing". It's very likely that there is damage to the environmental conditions of the world that have persisted for hundreds of years. In this way we have nations like Pakistan, India,China, US, Australia which will LOOSE big time, in the Asian states as glacial water volumes first increase and then decrease in the Himalayas, water becomes a serious problem for 3 billion people, without the means to adapt readily.In Australia & North America, seasonal rainfall is apparently dropping pretty sharply in the western 1/2 of the US, and the Southeast of Australia, so these states may already be experiencing some of the losses mentioned above. <br>  <br>  Some states, notably Russia, Finland and some other states may experience some benefits , such as warmer weather, and the ability to farm tundra lands previously frozen, the concern there is what effect billions of unfarmed acres of former permafrost do when it comes to things like pest control and consequent natural methane emissions from thawed permafrost.<br>  <br>  In this way really there may be no reversing some of these changes, at least not without massive investment our planetary GDP simply cannot support.<br>  <br>  3. We in the United States, have a very serious cultural problem. In ways that France, Germany and particularly Japan simply don't. Because there has been recognition of the idea of global warming, and importantly corporations feel the need to participate in the process of changing their societies - for the betterment of their nations.<br>  <br>  Very few US corporations have addressed the concern as aggressively as their overseas counterparts. In this way , when all is said and done, you will have companies that are "on board" and companies that have gone out of business. <br>  <br>  For most intents and purposes, the automotive industry in the US has completely failed to adapt to this new austerity and new concern for creating cars like the Toyota hybrids - for example - which provide top-class vehicles which comfortably exceed the minimums set forth by regulation. <br>  <br>  This coupled with the vehement segment of the US population that clings to bad science, corporate spin and such constitute another impediment to dealing with this problem.<br>  <br>  In this way, the when Exxon and GM become as enthusiastic as Vestas and Toyota with respect to energy and industrial consumer products, I think we could be in much better shape.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day though, the "fight" is not about winning, it's about adapting to what has already happened and what will happen no matter what we were to do.<br>  <br>  There is an additional complication, notably in the US but also in Europe (although they have a MUCH better handle on the topic from a public perception point), is resource constraint.<br>  <br>  Unless we deal with resource restrictions (notably on water and oil/gas and to a lesser extent coal), children born today will have significantly reduced economic opportunities when compared to their grandparents. What happens - after all  - when in 50 years, there isn't oil. Our children will be settling into a world where either there is some cheap replacement (such as a Mr. Fusion), or they will be living more like their great-great grandparents of 100 years ago, with animal husbandry commonplace, food scarcity, smaller communities and overall much less economic activity.<br>  <br>  So over the next 200 years, it might be possible to reverse our inputs of CO2 and sequester methane from the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels. How long it takes the environment to recover, by refreezing permafrost, and for glaciers to re-establish themselves, could be thousands of years in the making.<br>  <br>  Lastly, whatever we do in the 1st world must be transferred to the under-developed world. Africa and Southeast Asia cannot remain persistently poor forever. Providing similar stability and economic opportunity to these nations would require a new type of partnership.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	Don't worry.

N1IQuM1jaa	by recycling, you are using old products e.g. paper, to make new paper, and hence eliminating the need to cut down new natural resource i.e. tree to make the paper...recycling plastic therefore means you are eliminating the need to extract oil from the earth.  <br>  <br>  the situation is similar with saving energy...a lot of electricity is generated from burning non-renewable resources  e.g. coal...by using less energy, we need to produce less electricity, so less coal is extracted from the earth.<br>  <br>  not sure if you are in the uk or not, have a look at the following site - www.communityecochallenge.com (uk based info and stats)  it is for a project i used to work on, which helped people reduce their ecological footprint...it has info on recycling and how it helps the environment, as well as energy saving and the environment.<br>  <br>  hope this helps. it is maybe too simple an explanation for what you require, but i teach this stuff to community groups and children, and usually the straightforward approach is best!|`|WewCtMpzaa	To feel good about recycling, everyone wants to separate the trash into bins, and magically these recycled materials get put back into reuse as recycled paper and plastics. There are many religious who really pay attention and breakdown their trash right, but most just throw any plastic or paper materials in their recycle bins, so a lot that goes into people's bins ultimately goes to the landfill anyways as there are plastics and color slick papers that are not recyclable.<br>  <br>  It would seem smarter to send it all to the same place, and pull only what is in demand. Some of the recyclables such as newspaper are overloading recycling centers, so some centers don't even mess with newspaper until their is demand. <br>  <br>  I kind of wonder what it would be like if the trash trucks dropped their loads on hoppers, and broke down the trash where sorters that all ready exist in the recycle centers grab up desired recyclables, to keep double passes by trash and recycle trucks in the same neighborhood. Make it one tank of gas, and make the jobs of existing drivers, and pick up folks into sorters. This way you would gain experts who know what they are looking for, instead of using the general public, most of who do not really pay attention to what they are binning.<br>  <br>  That would allow you to move it up a knock and have the sorters pull out wood materials to burn in generators, organic materials for natural fertilizer for non-food things like city grasses, and try to keep as much raw trash going into the landfill.

Conservation saves resources, but it also saves you money.<br>  <br>  Consider electricity.

You could easily cut your electric use in half, saving $100 per month. You would also be saving the coal needed to generate that electricity.<br>  <br>  Imagine if everyone were able to cut their electric use in half.

The fact that almost 100% of scientists agree that temperatures are generally rising (when compared to pre-1800s levels i.e. the Maunder Minimum  the coldest point in the last several thousand years) and that mankind is contributing somewhat to that rise, does not for one second lead us to the conclusion that we are heading for any kind of man-made catastrophe as a result.    What I want to see is a survey that asks scientists the question    Do you think that we are heading for a global catastrophe as a result of the human contribution to Global Warming?    And why do we never see surveys with such questions? Because you know as well as I do what the result would be - and where would your consensus be then, Dana?    The truth is that people such as you quote these consensuses and then in the same breath say something like so we need to act now to avert disaster! as if this imagined disaster is what the consensus was about.     It is, frankly, dishonest.

But hang on a minute. These species must have survived the previous warm periods that the world has been through  we know that because theyre here now. So, why is the current warming going to suddenly kill them all? Is it because the current warming is special, magic warming? I think not. Ill take real-world observation over scare-mongering guess-work every time.     Global Warming Is Irreversible    Once again, really? In the past weve had CO2 levels 7 times as high as today and this didnt cause irreversible Global Warming. Again, were back to real-world observation over scare-mongering guess-work.    Climate Change on the Millennial Timescale    This one is simply laughable. It is absolutely ridiculous to attempt to guess how we will be living our lives 900 years from now. They are simply taking today and projecting it into the future. Its madness! France for example gets 80% of its electricity from a source that was unheard of 100 years ago.

Historical Warnings of Future Food Insecurity with Unprecedented Seasonal Heat    Unfortunately, I couldnt get in to read the full text (Im sorry, I cant afford to pay for it) but I note with interest that its based on the output from 23 global climate models Ah!

NO SCIENTIFIC THEORY IS TRUE BECAUSE A "MAJORITY" of "scientists" say it to be true.   (ALL SCIENTISTS once thought the Earth was central to Universe, & also agreed it was flat)    GIVE REAL PROOF... not conjecture|`|w5oQJpDwaa	Since the ''global warming'' invention was by democrats most are going to blame man to extract research $$$$ from taxpayers.The big lie is finally getting out to those who didn't have common sence to see the lie.|`|NqGkbDetaa	Because more Republicans are aware of the faulty data and data manipulation (especially by Hansen) that has been used to fabricate "Man-did-it" Global Warming (NOW called 'climate change' since the Warmers discovered that the Earth is now Cooling).    But I will say this..... If you Warmers want to use YOUR hard-earned (hopefully) money to subsidize the cost of "Curing" global warming.... or cooling.... or 'in-betweening'..... then go for it.  Just don't steal my money or diminish my rights for a totally fabricated and UNPROVEN cause!|`|h2LmAM0Baa	More red states produce oil, oil revenue puts money in their constituents pockets.

5TKEtXERaa	The main thing is reduce unnecessary waste, I use motion sensors on my cfl and led lighting so my family doesn't waste energy, power strips to stop phantom loads. Make sure the house is well insulated, when shopping I look for less packaging and use cloth bags.  I recycle and compost but I have to say I am most proud of the rain barrels for landscape and gardening and flushing my toilet. (WATER shortages and overflowing storm drains that cause havoc. SIMPLE stop using drinking water to flush with).|`|8cCgXQIoaa	Started recycling. Reading up on more ways to be green and giving tips to other people that want them.   Keep the lights off unless they're needed, and we have CFLs. I turn the water off when I brush my teeth and shave.   We hang our clothes on the line instead of using the dryer, we hand wash dishes instead of using a dishwasher, we use a ceiling fan instead of an air conditioner, and we use extra layers of clothing instead of a heater. We collect rainwater so we don't have to use the hose for some things. We re-use old clothing as rags. We use re-usable grocery bags. I turn things off or unplug them when they're not being used.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	I reduce as much as possible. Reduce electricity consumption for the house by about 30%, then installed solar panels. I reduce water consumption. Reduce waste by about 75%. Reduce meat consumption. Reduce travel, Reduce transportation emissions, reduce consumerism, reduce foods grown with synthetic pesticides, reduce toxic chemicals in cleaning and beauty products. And I reuse and recycle.|`|Ch7Q3buOaa	I jump around less........... a lot less
33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Water Quality jobs are beginning to really boom... Besides oxygen water is our most important resource, thus pollution of that source is of big concern. I'm an Environmental Specialist: Water Quality Specialist.... there are many routes you can take in order to become one. I know some people who have 4 year B.S. degrees in Environmental Studies who work in the field... 4 year B.S. degrees in Biology, Chemistry, etc... Although, I would like to mention that a majority, including myself have one of the above as well as a Masters degree in a similar field... Internships related to this type of work help a lot as well.

Axsja3Pcaa	To answer this let me define what sustainability is..  the rate of change of resources=0 i.e,  if we consider a resource it should not only serve the needs right now, but also it should be able to meet the future demand.    There are many human activities like bore wells,discharge of effluents into water bodies( sources of drinking water),urbanization etc.These activities effects water resources by lowering the groundwater levels,depleting the surface water quality etc.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	One of our greatest resources is drinkable water. The planet may be mostly water, but only about 2% is drinkable. We have done many things to make our water supply unsustainable. We have allowed lakes, and rivers to become polluted. In the US and other developed countries we have the EPA to help clean up and reduce pollution, but we continue to allow drinking water to be polluted in other countries. Much of the electronic waste from the US was shipped to developing countries and  was dumped near water ways and allowed harmful chemicals to pollute the drinking water. We have allowed huge populations to draw on natural water supplies not taking into account drought cycles which have severely drained reserves, putting all of those who rely on the source at risk in drought cycles. This is happening in the western states in the US, we sold off water rights to a growing population and now that we are in a drought we will all suffer. Our reservoirs are under 50%, some around 25%. The water shortage threatens all water life, increase risk of fires and the farms that feed the nation have already been told their allotments will be cut by 25% this year. That means higher prices in the market this summer.    We have the technology to use a fraction of the water we currently use in our homes. Lawns average about 50% of a homes water usage, yet it brings no benifit to the owner. They are the cause of a lot of pesticide run off, and the gas powered tools we use to maintain them are polluting our air. We don't need to use drinking water to flush toilets or at least not as much as most use. The majority of the world doesn't shower and wash their hair daily, yet many Americans take multiple showers a day.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	It has not...

Those are just a couple.. google or youtube it... you'll be surprised.|`|cNCC3mCbaa	Top contributor whsgreen makes some sense but you need to recognize that the EPA in the United States has been highly politicized under the Bush Administration. They have not carried out their true mission--especially regarding the protection of vital & precious resources like clean water.     Here's why.....Many, if not most, large corporations prefer that the Federal Government does not "interfere" with their profitability. Which means, "hands off and mind your own beeswax".     Since Bush represented and defended the economic interests of large corporations (excluding yahoo, of course) and neglected his duty and responsibility as a steward of the Earth... the EPA was basically directed to "take it easy" on enforcement of existing regulations. Regulations that were designed to keep our waters clean, fresh, unpolluted and useable for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is up to the Obama administration to steer our nation back on course. I am confident they will do this.    I recommend that you visit the website of the League of Conservation Voters >  www.lcv.org   Also, read Thomas L. Friedman's book, "Hot, Flat, and Crowded" if you really want to get a bird's eye view of what's happening in the world right now with respect to pollution, resource destruction, oil & other energy issues, and all the politics involved.

We use heaters and air conditioners to make us more comfortable when instead we could add or take off layers of clothing.   Sea levels are rising because of the global warming. Polar ice caps are melting which adds to the water. Islands are being swallowed by the water and tides reach higher on shore so when storms occur, the waves get further onto land. Storms are going to become more and more violent if global warming doesn't end.     Humans try to be in control and take matters into their own hands, when it isn't up to them. Trees get cut down and the environment gets damaged.     We pollute the air using cars that aren't environment friendly. The greenhouse affect is continuing, when the suns rays hit the earth and are reflected back into space, they get trapped in the atmosphere.     But this is more how we affect the climate. But it has similar traits.|`|ngExeZjuaa	LOST FREEDOM.  Do your part to help keep the earth clean/healthy, BUT   DON'T FORCE others to give up their freedoms/rights to   "save the earth".

AA11480544	I cannot say for sure in the Houston area but as far as I know there currently is not a broad commercial market for recycled glass.  Most communities municipal recycling centers are taking glass but they turn it into aggregate that is used in road building and don't sell it.  There may be more of a market for well sorted clear glass but I am not sure.  Raw glass is cheaper than recycled glass as of now.
