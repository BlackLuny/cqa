20090202170041AAWzstG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Ok i know everyone asks this question, but I'm desperate. Does anybody have any good book suggestions?	I like books like Blood and Chocolate, the more mythical, fantasy books.    Stuff like Ellen Hopkins, the messed up stories.   The Lovely Bones.   Uglies Series.   I like majorly just about everything. I read Sarah Dessen too so i like the girlier books, the depressing sad books, the fantasy books.   Just don't suggest Twilight. I've read it. It was ok. Didn't like it all that much.   But thanks and advance and i appreciate all your answers.

20090202170639AA13isH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What? Help me figure out the meaning of this story?	The Story of an Hour  By Kate Chopin  (From: http://www.classicreader.com/read.php/bo...    Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.  It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.  She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.  There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: "free, free, free!" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  "Free! Body and soul free!" she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the key hold, imploring for admission. "Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door."  "Go away. I am not making myself ill." No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a

I always saw myself as an accountant, but recently I've started to feel like that area might bore me. I want to do something I will really enjoy.       I have always had a real interest in theatre. I am very shy, and have not done much acting. Personally, I think acting must be amazing. But it's not going to be something I can succeed in. But I'd really like to do SOMETHING in theatre.      Just a few days ago I saw my first ever Opera, and I absolutely loved it. I thought the singing would do me in, but I was actually surprised at how much I liked it. But what got me was the set. And now I've been looking at pictures online of some sets for Operas, and they are absolutely amazing. So I was just curious, can you get a degree in set design, or major in set design?

With the help of the moonlight shinning through the window I can just see the color with barely tint of red.   Blood?   As I cowered in the corner of the bathroom in fear the liquids started to foam as bubbles rising taller and over the bowl.   I suddenly get this tug in my stomach and get this sudden urge to dip my head into the bowl and started drinking.   Blood.   Must drink. Foaming liquids. Head under. Sucking, swallowing.   “HOHOAHAHAH!”   “GAHHH!” screaming I flung off my cover and totally fall headfirst toward the floor.   Crack.   “Oof!” ow. I raise my head and put my right index finger on my forehead expecting to see blood all over my face.   Wow.   What a horrifying dream. Oh, a total emphasize on the word dream. It was so freakish real. Totally.   And the “HOHOAHAHAH!” from the stupid monkey alarm clock I got for Christmas REALLY didn’t make me feel any better.   I hear eggs and ham sizzling in the pan downstairs as I finish dressing and on the way down the narrow twisting stairway.   “Good morning, honey.” Mom calls cheerfully when I plop down on a stool, shivering just a bit.   “Mom, I got this weird dream last night. I was-“I started but was cut off like every morning by dad loud and gruffly yawning as he appear out of nowhere.   “Mat, what took you that long to get home yesterday?” Dad’s voice shook me awake from my nightmarish thoughts. Thoughts that have things to do with toilet, blood and a lot of gross stuff I needn’t mention.   “Mat, you’re shaking.” Mom came from the kitchen and put her cool palm on my head, feeling my temperature probably.   “Mom I-“I try to talk but-   “What happen last night Mat?” Dad fixes his stern eyes on me. “You came home later from usual last night, shaking and pale. You look like something from a horror movie. Did a vampire bite you or something? Dad tried badly to make a joke.   “No, but I did had a night-“Wait a minute. I stopped myself. VAMPIRE?   I gear my thoughts and look back to yesterday.   How HAD I gotten home yesterday?   I couldn’t remember……   Was everything that happens yesterday just a dream? Or had I really did what I thought I did?

The Flat  Bicker, yelling, a constant battle:  A chip bag burst,  Sodas spilt,  And brothers wrestled,  As moms reproach thundered  Atop the radio blaring  A heated political discussion.  Lying on the back bench,  Rest taunted me with skilled evasion.    Suddenly, a screeching squeal  We swerved sharp right.  After shriek and gasps,  Dad set out to attain the spare.    Back against the highway,   I sat in wait,   Gazing at the night.  Held beneath a soundless evening,  The field stretched over slender hills,  Delicately embellished   By sleeping cows and bare oak trees.    Sheltered by a subtle fog,  Tall grass danced in rhythm   To the semis roaring by.  I listened to the cars  As they whistled along  To the vivacious chorus  Of their hectic, familiar voices.

I take a step back      Through memory lane      To remember all the good times      The tears we’ve cried      The movies we’d laugh at      How our love was as passionate as can be      We could stare into each other’s eyes for hours      And you couldn’t look away      You would kiss me ever so softly no matter who watched      I just knew I loved you      Then she came along      You couldn’t look me in the eye      You’d blush or turn away when I tried to kiss you      I told you I loved you      Even though I didn’t know if that was true      I wanted you happy      And you left me      Standing there      All alone      In this place we call home      But it’s not      And I miss you      But I can’t love you anymore      I gave you my heart      And you broke it      She doesn’t love you      So go ahead and slice those wrists hon.      You were happy with me      I see those scars she’s given you      Those wounds, those cracks in your heart      But you don’t see mine      Because I’m smart enough to know you don’t need that      So I hide them      I smile to you      I tell you I’m happy,      Happy for you      So good luck       Because from now on      You’re just a shadow creeping up at night      I’ll help you      I’ll be your shoulder to cry on      Even though you hurt me      You hurt me so much      But I loved you      So I’ll be there      Because that’s just the kind of person I am…

20090202155800AAuF7a3	Arts & Humanities;History	Have you see this movie and do you know its name? in ww2 women?	The movie is placed around the time of World War I or II, I am not sure, but more inclined to believe that it is World War 2 instead of 1. An actress who plays in it has red hair. It all begins with this actress and her fiance. She is pregnant, and the two of them have a fight and so the fiance hits her, she ends up in the hospital. She forgives him, then she gets pregnant, he comes home drunk and I think he throws her down the stairs. So she has a miscarriage. She leaves him and travels with her parents I believe to England. She meets this handsome guy there. They fall in love and marry. She first gives birth to a son, then to a daughter. The daughter dies of some disease and the son starts hating her for that. Then World War 2 breaks out, the husband goes to War. The Germans occupy her house, she has a relationship with the German captain after he rescued her from being raped by the soldiers. Then her husband comes back paralyzed. They have a lot of kids. 8 total I think. In the end, he dies and the family open up 6 diamond stores around the world. If you know the name, please tell me. It is way more exciting then my recap. Thank you.

20090202163016AApHfM4	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poetry meaning ;; Oven Bird - Robert Frost?	There is a singer everyone has heard,   Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,   Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.   He says that leaves are old and that for flowers   Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.   He says the early petal-fall is past   When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers   On sunny days a moment overcast;   And comes that other fall we name the fall.   He says the highway dust is over all.   The bird would cease and be as other birds   But that he knows in singing not to sing.   The question that he frames in all but words   Is what to make of a diminished thing. “   -Robert Frost            I neeeeeeed some reasonable meanings for this poem ?   Please helpp :)

20090202174848AAPE6rU	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How does this part of my story sound? Criticism, anything?	Within thirty seconds, I felt my body burn as I began to sprint. My arms and legs grew hairier and my features melted into those of a four legged mammal. I was a frigid white wolf with a black tail, legs, and ears. My sight blurred to a variety of reds- a baby's pink cheeks to the blood of dying prey. My paws thudded against the defrosting, hard ground and as adrenaline pulsed through my ears, I realized the scent was that of a werewolf, not just some kind of dog. Was it Luke? It couldn't have been Kaleb- I knew his scent. And that definitely was not it. I quickly shut off my thoughts when I saw a glimpse of maroon in the pink bushes, and I changed my course. I leapt upon the human and sunk my teeth into its shoulder.     A young man looked up at me with pleading, terrified eyes and whispered, “Gabe...save Gabe...” My stomach lurched. Did he not realize I was killing him? “What Gabe? What's his last name? How old is he?” My words came out no more than a war howl and  I was caught staring into the agonized eyes of the boy, feeling love, fear, happiness, sadness, terror, and even creativity seeping into my mind. I pushed his personality out of myself when I realized who exactly Gabe could be. Copyright 2009 A.M.       Suggestions? Comments? Criticism?    Kienna, the narrator, is a she-wolf; this was a hunt.    Please, do not complain about twilight. I wrote this before I read Twilight (in July)

I have to write a paper on "the inspiration of British writers and/or their works on musical compositions/composers."  I know there have been about a million songs based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," but I'd like to use a few more examples that are more unique.        So far, I've come up with Iron Maiden's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," Joni Mitchell's "Slouching Toward Bethlehem," based on William Butler Yeat's poem "Journey of the Magi," and Metallica's "For Whom the Bell Tolls," based on Donne's sermon "Mediation 17."

She was holding up a sword on the left i think, wearing some kind of white sheet that was see through and under a tree.

She is dating a vampire that owns a strip club that has mostly vampire and werewolves working for. There are witches and were-leopards (or something) in the story. The main character is like the leader of the were-leopard pack even though she is human (I think)      It is an adult/older teen book and is NOT Twilight. Not sure what book in the series it is but one of them starts out with her going to her friends wedding and a crazy vampire is killing people (i think ones that work in the strip club) and most of the book centers around figuring out who it is doing the killing.

I turned my head slightly to see beautiful brown hair lightly slightly ruffled by the wind. The trees around me shook and leaves fluttered to the ground next to me. There was a big crash.

I used to be in a long distance sort of relationship with a friend of mine. i moved away and we started talking more than ever, and soon we fell in love. she is jewish and i christian, so she said that things could never work out between us and it would be best if we just were friends. i tried for a while but i could not do it. i also began to feel around that time that i was not good enough for her. she is so beautiful and smart and talented and sweet; perfect. so one day i sent her an email and told her that i could not be friends with her. i told her even if someday we were to get back together i was not good enough for her.i was getting B's and C's in school and i did not think i could ever provide for her if we were to get together again. she replied back and said, "i am sorry you feel that way". it has been almost 3 months and and i cant take it anymore. she is all i think about, my school has gotten even worse and i am a complete wreck. the only thing stopping me from contacting her is the thought that she is probably better of with out me. but i cant take it anymore. i want to contact her but do you think it is a good idea? has she already moved on? will she take me back?      thanks soo much for any answers, if you have an questions i would be glad to answer yours too. thanks again

20090202183557AA87oCt	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Those who know their literature/poetry? (details)?	poetry is a big part of literature   and I was just curious if it is possible to have more than one meaning and analysis to a poem?    or is there only one - the one that the author is trying to convey?      For example, lyrics in music can be interpreted in different ways. For one person the music might mean one thing, while for another it may convey something a little different.   Does this apply to poetry too?    Is it correct (in a literature sense) to have more than one analysis to a poem? or is there only one correct way of interpreting it?      the curiosity was brought up because of school. we have assignments for analyzing and explaining poems, and i wondered if there really is only one way to anaylyze a poem.   I feel i look at it differently from what the teacher usually tells us..does that make it an incorrect interpretation?      what are your opinions on poetry analysis?   thank you in advance.            thanks in advance.

Don't you hate it when you're scrolling down the book and author section and you find about 5 questions on twilight on every page? i really wish these people could learn to use the SEARCHBAR! or maybe since they are on a computer, they can google it!       i know, i know, i'm ranting. i guess i should ask something so that i don't get flagged by some twihard or goody-two-shoes.       humm.....ok, got it.      This is a Maximum Ride question: Were you a little disappointed when you read the fourth book and found out that Max had to save the world from Global Warming?       i was. i was hoping for something explosive and awesome but nope, global warming. i was really glad when the voice came back and told Max her mission wasn't over. i waiting for the fifth to come out in March!!       feel free to comment on any part and don't hesitate to give me a star :)

Okay why do you think the author did not immediately reveal the names of the old man and the boy? Why do you think they were referred to as "the old man" and "the boy"?   Also what benefits do you think the boy got from his relationship with the old man?And what emotional benefits did the old man derive from his relationship with the boy?   Okay why do you think this is an apt comparison: "The creases in his skin were as old as erosions in a fishless desert."   And lastly, what do you think the lions symbolize the old mans dreams?   And also what is your opinion on this book? I just started reading it so don't give anything away I just want to know what to expect.
20090202184050AAM1Dt7	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why is it that I'm assumed to be male?	DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a rant. I'm genuinely curious.       Are there more men on Y!A than women? I don't know why, but I would think it'd be the opposite.       OBVIOUSLY this doesn't apply to everyone. Whenever I've had a sex-addressed answer, it has always been with the assumption that I'm male. But maybe that speaks to the fact that men address sex in their answers more than females, rather than the fact that they don't know I'm a woman.       Do clocks and apples scream "male" to people? I'm very curious.

20090202130024AAfqlCt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I fell out with my father, what should I do?	My mother died from cancer, and my father moved to a little village    near a seashore. He is a marine biologist Theophilus Hopkins and a moderately famous man. He writes about his corals and his corallines, his anemones and starfish. He is a preacher, too, and it is his great talent to make his listeners share his feelings. He believes that Christmas is a pagan and popish holiday. He calls it Yuletide. He converted all the people here, and they stopped celebrating it, and just regard Christmas as a usual day. But this year we had a new domestic help, Fanny Drabble, and she said that I should try a Christmas pudding. She and Mrs Williams made one secretly, from orange peel and butter, and there were raisins, and there was a cherry - I have never seen a cherry before! My father is all for plain food, potatoes ”fair to average size,” a half a head of King George cabbage, and so on. I ate a little of that pudding, I could never have imagined such a lovely taste. But my father caught me. He smacked me, said it was a "fruit of Satan", and acted as if I was poisoned, and made me to spit it out. Then he took me to the sea, to collect specimens, to show me that it was an ordinary day. And I prayed, and asked God to smite my father if puddings were allowed. And my father got his thigh cut! I felt very bad, then. My father was smitten because I prayed! I love my father, but after this incident I can't live with him anymore. He is all wrong, and his beliefs are wrong. But I am only a teenager. I have no other relatives, but I do not want to stay with   him. What should I do?

20090202191513AAGO96z	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	In illustration/graphic design, do they care about what college you went to?	Okay so you know how people are really into pedigree when they want to go to college. Many people want to go the Ivy universities. Anyway, I'm a graphic design and illustration major and I would like to go to a state university because its cheaper.       I'm middle class and I don't want to get loans. I want to get grants, do work study and probably hold down another job outside of college. My parents are in their fifties and are focusing on their retirement, so I can't really burden them with anymore college.       They covered my community college tuition but that's all they can do. Once I transfer to a university, its up to me to get financial aid and whatever else I need. I'm worried that I might get passed over for jobs, once I graduate, to people who went to pricier and name-brand universities.      Like what if I want to be a graphic designer/illustrator for a publishing house and do book covers and illustrations for children's books? Will they just laugh at me and ignore me because I went to a state college?
