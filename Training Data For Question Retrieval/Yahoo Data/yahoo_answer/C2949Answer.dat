cAMdBtFQaa	P=I*E<br>  P = Power, or watts<br>  I = Current, the electrons going some place to do work.<br>  E= voltage the pushing force to move the electrons<br>  <br>  The ability of a wire to carry current is based on its size, or circular mils.<br>  A city draws a lot of current, they have a lot of power used so you would have to use very large wires to carry the current required to meet the power needs.<br>  <br>  Look at a 100 watt light bulb, at 10 volts (e) it will take 10 amps (I) to create that 100 watts (P)  Now take the same bulb, and apply 100 volts, 1 amp is all that is required, we can now use a smaller wire because it will only need to cary 1 amp of current instead of 10.<br>  Lets say we supply 1000 volts, we will only need 0.1 amps to provide 100 watts to the bulb.  <br>  In a house we are limited to 110vac, so we have to change wire size to provide the current needed for, say a dryer.  Look at your drier cord, it is much larger than a lamp cord.<br>  <br>  We use high voltage to reduce the size of wires and reduce costs to provide that power.<br>  You can try the site below with different values and see how by raising the voltage, you reduce current.  Wire size is directly related to current and not on voltage, just be sure to hold power constant.  One thing I left out, is distance.  A given length of wire will have a specific resistance, so distance will also affect the size of the wire required.  Carrying 10 amps 10 feet will require 1 size wire, to carry the same 10 amps 1000 feet will require a much larger wire.|`|Nx1J0R9Yaa	It's not an equation.  It was simple convenience.  Had DC current won out over AC, things would have been different, but AC allowed a few big facilities as opposed to a lot of little ones, which was cheaper.  Initially major power sources were geographically restricted, either by the source themselves (such as dams,) or because the generation facilities were unsafe to keep inside highly populated areas..  That doesn't refer to nuclear, by the way.  When electricity was being widely introduced the majority of buildings were wood, and electricity was pushed as being safer than gas.  In any case, once the grid structure we currently have (pun, ha ha) was established, the pattern was set.   <br>  <br>  In this day of solar, wind, etc., the current grid is vastly out of date and inefficient.  Hopefully this is something that will finally get addressed in the next few years.

So in addition to their views I quote here few lines for u, may help u-<br>  <br>  Having plants around not only helps the average office environment feel more natural and "homey," but of course we've all heard about how they help us breath cleaner air. And although generally speaking 1 plant per 100 square feet is good for cleaning out common toxins like ammonia, formaldehyde, and acetone, not all plants are created equal when it comes to how hard they work. <br>  <br>  Different plants are good at clearing different things from the environment, but the 3 biggest hitters are #1 the Areca Palm, #2 the Peace Lily, and #3 the Rubber Plant. Other common office plants that also finished high in the rankings were the ficus (it has to be a real one though!), the dracena, and english ivy.<br>  <br>  How many plants do you have in your office? Knowing how much good they're doing may make the chore of watering them all every week a little less frustrating!<br>  <br>  --- So u can have so many options, depends on your own interest also.

However, recently, CFLs have got to the point where the mercury is almost insignificant. Breaking a bulb isn't a health risk at all as the mercury is vaporized and will quickly dissipate. The concern now that is the wide scale dumping of these bulbs will accumulate enough mercury to do some damage. One big argument against that is that if you're running on a coal power plant, less mercury is in the bulb than would have been released by the coal plant if you were using an incandescent. Another thing is that CFLs CAN (and should) be recycled. We've been recycling the large tubes for years.|`|9RC2EPANaa	DON'T use them!!! they say 3-5 milligrams of mercury is safe. it isn't. i have a friend who was working in her kitchen and one exploded above her. she is now deaf and blind, and has uncontrollable muscle spasms. these lamps are ******* dangerous. <br>  mercury is the second most toxic element on earth, after uranium! <br>  whats the point anyway? they have a very low power factor (around 0.5), which means they use twice as much power as it says on the box. <br>  <br>  also the light that is emitted from those lamps contains high amounts of U.V.A and U.V.B frequencies of light. 10 times stronger than the sun. that is what causes skin cancer|`|iEoSPpWCaa	Hi!!!<br>  <br>  You should get the new generation of bulbs.

Starvation, earth quakes, wars thru out the world, diseases, total collapse of the economy, world in great depression. Death in the billions to ever man women and child.

fSf6rXg7aa	get your school to have separate bins for cans and plastic bottles in the cafeteria--and a bin for liquids from the bottles. also, if the plates you use in the cafeteria are just thrown away-see if they can be recycled too.<br>  <br>  i started one at my school too:) it bloomed amazingly fast(and Im in junior high too)|`|iBitNRZuaa	There is a labor cost involved in recyling; someone has to get those bins emptied when they are full and/or to the right place.  On the other hand, in most communities there is money to be made in recycling aluminum cans....Where there is a money need/desire there is an additional incentive.<br>  <br>  Of course, you must have an aluminum can source in order to be able to recycle aluminum cans!  Assuming that your school has an aluminum can source, you might approach your Associated Student Body (ASB) organization and see if they have an interest in recycling aluminum cans for themselves.  If not, you might see if they would be willing to poll the clubs and activity boards they sponsor for a potential aluminum can sponsor in exchange for the recycling profits.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, any additional recycling efforts will probably require the permission and involvement of the principle.  Unless you are able and prepared to take on the whole project all by yourself, you will need to enlist the help of others.  And, you will need to know more information before additional recycling can take place.  <br>  <br>  Assuming that you can get bins placed about the school for additional recycling efforts - How do you propose that they be carted away to a recycling center?  You might begin by discovering how the paper you are recycling is being gathered and collected on the school grounds then who and how they are being picked up.  <br>  <br>  Does the garbage company that services your school also provide curb side recycling in any form?  Are they already set up to collect "institutional volumes" of recyclables and if so, which types?  Many communities are set up to recycle institutional volumes (dumpsterfulls) of corregated cardboard.  Starting with the types of things that your collection system are already handling is the place to start.  <br>  <br>  Even so, take a look at your current paper recycling system of paper to discover how and where distributed bins are emptied and/or collected upon the school grounds.   Or, does your current system rely on using only a few, centralized collection bins?  If so, what are the expectations about getting the paper transported from its discard source to the centrally located collection bins?  Fourtnuately for you, your school already has a working recycling model in place.  Draw from it to develop your concept into a functional proposal.<br>  <br>  It will probably begin with a little more additional information gathering and what is called "home work" in the real world.  To shave time, cut corners, and get to a more direct conclusion, you should probably enlist the help of your principle early in the process.  They should be able to tell you more information about what is liked and disliked by the current, paper recycling system.  They may already have some ideas about additional recycling.  They may have some valid or invalid concerns about additional recycling efforts.  They may have already researched additional recycling efforts and come against some brick walls; your "job" would then be to discover if they still exist, find a way around or over them, and come up with a counter proposal.  Remember, "teaching types" like to help students succeed.  Don't forget to include asking for your principle's help in your efforts.  <br>  <br>  Remember, the grand effort and movement towards recycling is still in its early stages.  I'm sure that your school's paper recycling efforts miss large quantities of paper generated and used at your school.  In part, the recycling effort is asking for a cultural and social moray change; these don't happen over night.  Be willing to make a start and remember that every item you send to recycling as opposed to the landfill does make a difference.  Even if you only achieve one additional type of item or a few, select collection bins - you will have made your dent in the existing system.  Awareness is a big factor in the equation.  And, the recycling movement is building.  If you can make your dent this year, someone else (or yourself if you have another year in middle school) will be more able to make an additional dent next year.<br>  <br>  Oh, in general the function of administrators ( of which your principle is one) is make their systems run smoothly with as little cost as possible.  In your "home work" phase, you might see if there is a cost benefit argument that you can provide as well.  In some communities, there is less or no cost for recycle bins (even of the dumpster size) where as there is cost for landfill garbage.  Often, a dumpster volume is estimated at a given amount of weight and accordingly billed.  Depending upon the billing estimation system in your community, you may actually save a given amount of money for every dumpster's volume of garbage diverted into a recycling stream.  You can be assured that your principle will be weighing the recycling gathering and disposal costs as they make their decision; they are "suppose to" in general and in this time of reduced budgets, they certainly mus
a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa	Well, to answer the question, you must first accept the fact that you are being misled, as far as Global Warming is concerned.<br>  <br>  “When will the Arctic re-freeze?” you ask. But re-freeze back to what level? While it is true that the current Arctic sea ice extent is lower than the average of the last 30 years (since accurate satellite measurements began), it is also true that the current level is almost identical to the level it was back in 1980 – nearly 30 years ago. So, as I said, what level do you want it to re-freeze back to?<br>  <br>  Also remember that this current “below the thirty year average” level of Arctic sea ice is happening at a time when the Earth has been cooling for the last 8 years. So, whatever else may be causing this unexceptional low level of Arctic sea ice extent, it’s not Global Warming, because it’s currently not happening.<br>  <br>  Returning to the idea of you being misled by Global Warming, take a look at Weatherman’s answer…<br>  <br>  “Yes the planet is going through a cycle, that would lead to cooling if the atmosphere was in its natural state.”<br>  <br>  Well, what sort of cycle is he talking about? A long term cycle of centuries, perhaps? Well that’s just nonsense. The planet is currently warming out of the Maunder Minimum – the coldest point in the last several thousand years – so *of course* the planet is warming on that scale. And if he’s talking about a more recent cooling cycle, well, as I’ve just mentioned, over the last eight years, or so, the planet *has* been cooling (despite the rise in CO2), so I’m really not sure what he’s going on about. Perhaps a cycle longer than centuries? Well why are we worried about a few decades of warming in a cycle of that length? <br>  <br>  Do you see what I mean about being misled? You hear these statements that, on the face of it, sound logical, but when you actually look into it, they turn out to be rubbish.<br>  <br>  As ever with global warming - don't believe the hype.|`|fcc738a2832b685c939f31eb779b66a2aa	I don't think these things are well understood, but it's getting better.  It looks like there is a 20 year solar cycle which is related to polar ice extent and there are many much longer term cycles.  Right now I think neither the arctic nor the antarctic will melt more than usual for the forseeable future.  Some people think we are on the edge of a short term cooling trend which may be as significant as the "little ice age" about 200 years ago.|`|cpxkROqMaa	Some scientist believe that it is a nature cycle.

Some of them are 30,000 feet from the surface.<br>  The smoke was so thick that the sun was blocked, day and night. During the Cold War there was a prediction that Nuclear Weapons could have a similar effect and they coined the term "Nuclear Winter" because the sun would be so dark that the Earth's surface would get cooler, and cooler, everyday, for years at a time.<br>  There was a short version of that during the times of Franklin and he wrote about that.<br>  Yes, I too wish they were right.|`|lm3hzaozaa	If we don't stop global warming it might not freeze, but if we do if won't be for a millions years or so. not any time soon|`|fwnqB0dTaa	It won't<br>  <br>  Yes the planet is going through a cycle, that would lead to cooling if the atmosphere was in its natural state.<br>  <br>  But it's not.<br>  <br>  We have pumped too much CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, into the atmosphere for the natural cooling to take place.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Axel Heiberg Island in the high arctic has an interesting hidden treasure for people interested in Earth's history and oddities.  This island lies above 80 deg. N latitude, but there's a petrified forest.  Other islands in the area have revealed dinosaur bones.  This means only one thing: the Arctic was once tropical or sub tropical in climate. <br>  <br>  Cycles come and go, some are barely noticeable and others are extreme.  The fact that the Arctic has been ice-free and very warm at some point in the past is no secret.  We just don't understand why.  For trees to grow (hundreds of miles above the tree-line) and dinosaurs to roam there was a year round absence of ice and snow for a long era in the north's history.  It's surprising to find evidence of trees at this latitude, and the real mystery is how they survived six months of total darkness even in warm temperatures.<br>  <br>  The Arctic is still very well frozen and in no danger of melting any time soon regardless of what nonsense you hear from the agw folks.  We know it all melted in the past though, and refroze...maybe several times.  We don't have an explanation and can't guess at how long the cycles could take to happen.  We do know that the current warming cycle has stopped, and maybe ended.  The world could be entering a cooling side of the cycle.  Man isn't involved in what's happening.

These corner stones are great because they address potential life-style changes of the person with 200 pairs of shoes wondering what they can do to become more green as well as the person on a mission of a personal zero carbon footprint.  These cornerstones are great because they allow for a continual change of life style despite where you started from, where you've gotten to, and the ultimate ideal.<br>  <br>  In general, once you have the recycling thing down reasonably well, working on the other three so that you don't need to recycle in the first place is where it is at.  The best place to look is at your garbage and recycling streams.  What do you see there?  For many of us, there is a lot of opportunity in consumer packaging.  And, it gets all the more volumous and difficult to avoid as time goes by.  Examine each and every thing you see there and ask if there is an aquisition alternative that would result in fewer items in your garbage or recycling stream; just in asking brings about a different level of awareness.  You might decide that the alternatives are outside of your capabilities, willingness, or comfort zone.  Some alternatives may require an initial investment such as washable, individual serving containers or cloth napkins over paper; often these save money in your wallet over time as well as make inroads into your various waste streams.  These considerations work for your normal, daily activity type of aquisitions.<br>  <br>  But, many of us do minimal "home work" and condsideration when purchasing the types of consumables that last a little longer than the types of things that pass through our daily waste stream.  Appliances, tools, clothing, hobby items, home decor, auto ad-ons, hobby and home projects, recreational activities, and the more.  To reduce your overall "stuff", help the enviornment, and your wallet - Before purchasing, ask yourself do you need it?  will you use it? how and when will you use it?  Better yet, before you even think about entering a store or buying anything, ask yourself what do you need, want, and desire; make a prioritized list of desired aquisitons.  Then do your home work about the cost of use for the items on your list.  -  You may find that a closet with 200 pairs of shoes, some of which you'll only wear once and some none at all, is just too much for your wallet.  Be assured, if you don't adequately use the items you buy, you have not followed the front end of the 4R's.  But, if you consider the items on your list in terms of supply needs, material requirements, composition, replacement requirements, and even other environmental effects you will be one more step along the path of the 4R's.  For you, this may mean something electric versus gas powered, something with a recharagable battery versus disposable batteries, something that costs twice as much but will last a "life time", etc....  For you, it may mean buying used versus new or even "rescuing" someone else's discard whether you are simply Re-using it or going the distance by Re-purposing it.  For you, it may mean buying a glass salt container with metal top as opposed to plastic salt container with plastic top. <br>  <br>  In terms of "doing every thing you can do" about conserving energy - do realize that there are some folks doing the "extreme" by choice; and a number who are doing so without choice.  If you want to reach additional energy savings, examine all of your energy using activites with a critical eye.  Most of us can further reduce our energy use although it may not be comfortable to do so.  Want a quick reality check? - Imagine that you had half the income and four times the electric, gas, and vehicle fuel costs.  What would you do to cut your use and hence your costs?  Then play the utility bill usage game and see how you can get those little usage bars to come down, even by a touch. <br>  <br>  In general, these are all personal life-style types of daily living "green" things.  There is hardly a community I'm aware of who does not have some type of a restoration, beautification program involving vegetation, or other environmentally related volunteer opportunity going on.  If you're feeling reasonably satisfied about your daily, personal life-style activites and directions with respect to "green living", find something to participate in within your community.  Especially with Earth Day approaching, many communities have "single shot" opportunities up coming; things that take no more than a single, part-day commitment.  One of the things that this type of participation provides is a a sense of accomplishment that the continual life-style change or "grind" does not.

0KmJwYunaa	Think of it this way, load up your car with people and cargo and your gas mileage goes down somewhat but if you lighten the load, you get more gas mileage.   How does that work?<br>  <br>  There is a certain baseline that the power plant produces that it will always be producing but the actual amount of power it produces and fuel that it consumes varies with the load on the system.   Conserving does reduce the amount of power that the generation plants are producing.   <br>  <br>  This is true with any electric motor (generators are motors in reverse), the difference is in torque, a loaded system requires more torque but an unloaded one only needs enough torque to maintain it's speed.   The generators in the power plants are still turning at the same speed but it takes less torque to turn them at that speed when you conserve on power.   The energy isn't just the speed but the product of the speed and torque just as it's the product of voltage and current so when there isn't a draw, the energy isn't being generated, just the baseline to make up for the inefficiencies are being generated.<br>  <br>  Also, if there's enough conservation, then there's no need to build additional generation plants hence it's cheaper to save a megawatt than it is to add a megawatt of generation capability.   Keep in mind that to handle the variable portion of the load, the power grid has gas powered turbines that can be brought online on demand and shut off when the load demand eases off.   Also there's energy trading agreements with neighbouring grids to buy or sell energy.|`|SIaF4lhcaa	energy production is 'stepped'.  an individual turning off a light is using less energy, but that's not the same as a plant powering down a generator or a turbine.  <br>  <br>  if houses (plural necessary) use less energy, no doubt, less energy will be produced.  that would be good either from an environmental stance, an efficiency stance, or from the stance of being able to do more with less.  <br>  <br>  but this is assuming we have no other uses for electricity.  <br>  <br>  we still are going to need more energy, to provide the basics for a growing population and to ween ourselves off fossil fuels.|`|9RC2EPANaa	you are correct<br>  <br>  DON'T use "eco" lightbulbs!!! <br>  <br>  they say 3-5 milligrams of mercury is safe. it isn't. i have a friend who was working in her kitchen and one exploded above her. she is now deaf and blind, and has uncontrollable muscle spasms. these lamps are ******* dangerous.<br>  mercury is the second most toxic element on earth, after uranium!<br>  whats the point anyway? they have a very low power factor (around 0.5), which means they use twice as much power as it says on the box.<br>  <br>  also the light that is emitted from those lamps contains high amounts of U.V.A and U.V.B frequencies of light. 10 times stronger than the sun. that is what causes skin cancer|`|FU884E5jaa	yes, because then your a tree hugger|`|hdvd4IdXaa	houses don't consume less energy. houses are consuming moree energy now than they ever have.That's why as of this year a new building regulation has started where as all new houses must have 25% less carbon emissions that houses built in 2006. By 2012 all new house have to have 100% less carbon emissions than buildings built in 2006. Residential buildings generate 60% of the carbon emissions in the UK. Power plants do generate some of the energy but 10% of the UKs energy comes from renewable sources. The government is spending millions to increased this percentage.|`|5TKEtXERaa	Ok I have no idea where you are some areas are worse than others but with more and more people crowding into a space obviously there will be a need for more power. Power plants can run at different capacities if they are not needed to run at more than 80% capacity then they probably won't but what we face now in most areas, California is a great example is that the existing power plants Can't generate enough power to satisfy. This causes either brownouts/blackouts or other problems until new plants can be built. Which whether it is coal fired, nuclear, wind farm, or any other power generating plant is EXPENSIVE and most likely to cause pollution of some sort or another. <br>  <br>     SO, once again Reduce is the most important of the three R's and the avoidance of unnecessary energy use is the best thing that you can do the concept of use it they make it anyway I won't even address.<br>  <br>     As for CFL's yes they have mercury and if you are curious look at my past answers I have answered that time and time again. But real quick with an incandescent light the power plant, which since the vast majority in the U.S. are coal fired plants, spew many pollutants only one of which is mercury into the air the fact that a CFL causes 75% less energy to be consumed thus generating 75% less pollutants it is by far a good idea to switch. Also the pollutants that are spewed by power plants go straight to the environment and the CFL' s if you recycle them as is suggested that 4mg or less of mercury NEVER is released into the environment. <br>  <br>    IF you absoulutely want no mercury then bite the bullet and go LED then you save energy AND no pollutants at the plant or your home. I wish the mercury alarmists would also insist that everone with an old style thermostat would replace it also, seeing as how they are inefficient and they have mercury switches in them that contain over 200mg of mercury (equivalent to over 50 cfl bulbs)|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Choke on my CO2!!!
