Le paradoxe de Fermi (attribué au physicien Enrico Fermi dans les années 1940-50) s'exprime ainsi :    la Terre est nettement plus jeune que l'Univers (de plusieurs milliards d'années)    si des civilisations technologiques extraterrestres existent ou ont existé dans la Galaxie, alors au moins une a développé et entrepris le voyage / la colonisation interstellaire    or on peut démontrer que la colonisation de la Galaxie ne nécessite que quelques millions d'années    donc on devrait en voir des traces autour de nous    or nous n'en voyons pas ! (les histoires d'OVNI sont pour la plupart expliquées par des causes "terrestres" ou "humaines", et les traces dont on parle devraient "crever les yeux" et non pas être de fugitives apparitions)    ... donc ...    l'hypothèse de départ est fausse, et nous sommes la seule civilisation technologique (et probablement intelligente) dans la Galaxie !

20090205104251AAHh5mH	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Eating and the distortion of light...?	While crunching on some chips the other night, and looking at a digital display on my clock, it appeared that, as I was chewing on my food, that the light from the display "looked wavy" within the clock itself.  Almost like the way the road looks in the distance on a hot day.  But (so far as I could tell) the surrounding light and images didn't seem to "look wavy,"  just the light from the display.      Was this vibrations in my head as I was chewing?  Was it affecting *all* the light, and I was only aware of it affecting just the digital numerical display?      Hopefully my question isn't worded so poorly that you have no idea what I'm tlaking about!

20090205111146AAdM2SN	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	During Veterinary surgery, what is the best way to monitor patients blood pressure?	I'm a new student in a Vet Tech program, and in reading about different procedures, and their is one I can't really get comfortable with. I also am having some difficulty locating an exact answer.       I was reading in my text that "Direct blood pressure measurement during surgery is uncommon due to not wanting to place a central venous catheter in patient" during surgery.       So I get that. Does that mean "indirect" IS applied? Commonly?       Would it be as simple as applying some sort of blood pressure cuff on the leg? Would that give an accurate enough reading during any procedure to effectively monitor their blood pressure?      I sort of have a grasp of the procedure for TPR (Temp, Pulse, Respiration) but Blood Pressure leaves me feeling a little gray and naive.       Thanks.

20090205112702AAiXTO5	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	A couple of things I have seen in the past, what could they have been?	For both cases I know it wasn't a plane, I looked at them for a while and they did not move.      1) In Greece on holiday in August 2004 I was watching a bright light above a mountain (relaxing by the pool was the real purpose really), about the same brightness as Venus, after watching it for a good 15-20 minutes, the light moved downwards quite rapidly and eventually behind the mountain, the brightness did not change.      2) About a decade ago I was in the car with my dad, it was broad daylight without a single cloud in the sky, but yet in the sky not quite on the opposite side to the sun but very nearly, again I was watching to see if it was a plane and it most definitely wasn't, it was another bright light and this was with the sun high in the sky.      What could they have both been?      Cheers guys.

20090205104019AAtNJjA	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	If evolution is true...?	Why are fossils of animals and other things not being made today?  Even if a fish dies, it floats, or sinks to the bottom, and then is eaten by scavengers. When an animal dies, they rot if the buzzards don't get to them first, and it is eaten by scavengers and other animals.They do not fossilize. They isn't enough time! What about plants? When they die, they turn back into the soil. They do not fossilize. Where are all the bison that were killed hundreds of years ago? Shouldn't there be fossils of at least some of them? They are nowhere to be found! Then why do we have enormous fossil graveyards? There are fossils today that have been found with food still in their stomachs. Compression of these animals and plants are amazing! Sharks have been found to be flattened to a quarter of an inch! Something had to happened that was extremely fast, rapid, and catastrophic. Fish fossils have been found actually swallowing another fish in Fossil Lake, Wyoming by Princeton University scientists. At Kansas State University, there is a 14 foot fish that has swallowed a 6 foot fish,  but was never digested. All these fossils show that there had a very sudden and rapid event to have taken place. It reminds of something I read about in the Bible a little while ago. Now, what was that? Hmmm. Oh, now I remember, it was the Flood in the book of Genesis.         Just wondering.

20090205111437AAyPpVO	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Are any of you aware of what is going on and how your lives may soon be effected by Feb. 10, 2009?	Please read this blog as well as visit  http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14953       this website has another article that shows the potential threats to crafters, small business', charites, liability to resalers, E-bay sales, and on and on the list goes in some twisted reponse by our legislatures to response to toys with lead in them from China!!!!      Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008    Earlier this week, news reports began circulating about the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 which would require third-party testing on consumer goods (including apparel) used by children. The purpose of the act is to keep lead-filled products away from children. It is directed at lead-based paint and phthalates (chemicals used to keep plastics pliable) in products that children might chew, suck on, or otherwise ingest. Beginning February 10, 2009 (the date the law goes into effect) clothing retailers and thrift stores will be throwing out children's clothing because they do not meet new federal regulations.      This is the Consumer Product Safety Council web page that links to the actual legislation and their legal counsel's interpretation on how the law should be applied  http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.HT...       According to some reports, testing for lead and phthalates could cost as much as $30,000 per tested sample.      We contacted the office of more than one U.S. Representative and were told that the law has been enacted, but the regulations have not yet been released. There is a chance the law would apply only to producers and importers, not retailers (including thrift stores). The law could also affect initial retailers, but not resellers. These are some of the details that are yet to be determined.      Since we don't know exactly who will be affected by the new law, and to what extent the law will impact our ministries, here are some things that missions can do:   Contact the Consumer Products Safety Commission at 800-638-2772. This is the agency that is writing the regulations. Ask them for a clarification on what types of outlets will be impacted by the regulations. Voice your concern as to how this will impact services for people in need.      Call your member of Congress or Senator. Explain how their constituents might be impacted if the product testing is extended to thrift stores and free clothing distribution.   Low income families who currently receive free donated clothing, or purchase them at a thrift store, will be forced to pay retail in a tough economic market.   Social services to the poor will be reduced as income from clothing sales at the mission thrift store will decline, resulting in the inability to fund much needed assistance.   It will cost jobs. Thrift stores provide employment to individuals; lower revenue means cutbacks.   It will have a negative environmental impact as tons of serviceable clothing goes into landfills, rather than aiding needy families.   The legislation dramatically impacts helping agencies (rescue missions, Salvation Army, Goodwill, Volunteers of America, churches and other community organizations with clothes closets) during a slow economy, when their assistance is most needed by the community.   Ask your legislators for help in exempting missions and other non-profits that serve people in need.      Write letters to the editor; include the amount of free clothing given to the community and the numbers of families served. Ask for support in seeing that the regulations not impact the most vulnerable members of the community (you may use many of the points from item #2 above). Voice your concern about lead and phthalates, but ask that the new legislation not place additional hardships on the youngest and poorest citizens.      Remember that legislation can be changed and improved. Keep the lines of communication open with members of Congress and Senators for input into future laws of this sort.      Don't panic, let the legislative process run its course, then be ready to respond when the full details are known.      If you want more information regarding the act, these sites have a lot of good information.       http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive...        http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive...

20090205104105AAoIkDu	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How would I multiply a dB (logarithm) by a known factor?	In a free field, dB intensity to distance obeys the Inverse Square Law. In a non free field environment I measured dB (A weighting) at the source to be 98.8, three feet from source at 80.3, and six feet to be 77.5 with a Type I SLM. I'm a student and can't seem to get the math understood. This isn't necessary for the assignment, but I really want to know how to multiply a dB by 1/4 or 1/9 of the original intensity and be able to compare this environment to a free field.

EX:  Take the number 1,523.  Add up all of the digits: 1+5+2+3 = 11.  Then, add 7 to the number so all of the digits add up to 18, a number divisible by 9.  Therefore, 15,237 is divisible by nine.  You can also rearrange all of these numbers, plus add zeros anywhere in the number, and it still will be divisible by nine.  Plus, if the number is even, then it will be divisible by 6 and 18.      Anyone.........             She likes math, and looks to me for math help.

So I was going to make a 4 L solution for each.      So then would I just measure out 60ug/4L for the 15ug/L solution and 200ug/4L for the 50ug/L?      How much is 200ug/ 4L and 60ug/L in decimal format?      ug/L = micrograms/liter      Is there a better way to do this? I really need help fast! I was suppose to have this set up last week!

20090205112040AAetyku	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Question Involving Electric Potential?	Problem:  An electron acquires 16.4 * 10^(-16) J of kinetic energy when it is accelerated by an electric field from plate A to plate B.  What is the potential difference between the plates, and which plate is at the higher potential?      Solution Attempt:  I know that the potential difference is equal to ΔU/q.  ΔK = -ΔU, so the change in potential energy is equal to -16.4 * 10^(-16), and q = -e = -1.602 * 10^(-19).  Therefore,       V = (-16.4 * 10^(-16))/(-1.602 * 10^(-19)) = 1.02 * 10^(4) V      I understand that part, but which plate is at the higher potential?  Any help is appreciated.

A pedal bin is used to collect waste         The lid is raised by placing a foot on the pedal. A mechanism makes this happen      Rod L and M are separately connected to a common axis at A. A is free to move up or down causing the rod L and therefore the lid to do the same.       (i). A force of 27 N is applied to the pedal as shown. Calculate the upward force the rod L will apply to the lid. Assume the rods L and M and the pedal have negligible weight.            (ii). 27 N is the minimum force that must be applied to the pedal to raise the lid.      Calculate the weight of the lid.               Determine the size and direction of the resultant normal contact force that acts on pivot 2 when 27 N is applied to the pedal.

I know there's a term for trees like these, I just can't find it. It's a defense mechanism for trees in fire-prone areas. It's something like Pyroarchaic trees, but I just don't think that is it. An example is a Ponderosa Pine. These trees are very old, but now they are threatened by trees that have branches all the way to the ground, creating a ladder to them. Jerks. So yeah, what's the term?

I am having an issue with this problem and I don't know why!!!        dynamic system described by a nonlinear differential equation:                       dy/dt  =  A   -   y^3                 A= constant    y= function of time (t)      FIND:  the equilibrium value of y, and linearize the differential equation about its equilibrium. Use first order Taylor Series Expansion method
