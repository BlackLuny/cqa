F5PUol8vaa	Don't worry about starting from square one. Everyone has to start there. <br>  First, always use safety precautions. Wear eye protection and hearing protection when using the power tools. Next thing, have someone instruct you on proper use of the power saws. They are very dangerous if used incorrectly. I would go to the local Lowes or Home Depot and see if they are having seminars that you can attend. If there is a vocational school nearby, see if they have a class on woodworking. Look in the yellow pages for a cabinet making shop. Go there and talk to some of them and see if someone there would be willing to "school" you on proper use of the power tools. They could come to your house and show you on your own tools so you can become familiar with their operation. Be prepared to pay for that.<br>  As for building something, start with a box. Then go from there. You need to learn how to read a tape measure accurately. Know what every mark on the tape means. There is much more but that will get you started.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Is there anyone you know who is knowledgeable in woodworking that could help you?<br>  My father taught me at a young age.<br>  And I'll never forget,<br>  "Measure twice, cut once."<br>  Nothing beats hands-on training.|`|UQWusO1waa	you need a" how to" book with lots of pictures that show each step. go to lowes or home depot. they have a bunch of them. also google " how to use wood working tools book"  you will see some there. get a couple different ones, because they will each be a little different. you will need to learn how to set up and use each tool before you use them. this is where you should start. get ones with color photograghs that show you each tool types and set up.

I've been working with wood for over 30 years and feel like there's so much still left for me to learn.  The term "wood-working," is so all-encompassing, that you have to decide what discipline you wish to excel with.  Like anything else, you need to learn and get comfortable with the tools of the trade. If you don't know how to use the tools of the trade, it will only be that much more difficult to learn the trade.  Once you feel comfortable with the tools, then it's time to learn what to do with them.<br>  Shop around for different wood patterns. It's much better to begin by following someone else's proven instructions in order to build confidence in yourself.  Once you've built a few projects, then you can branch oout and try to be a bit more creative.  Just remember, try not to over-extend yourself in the beginning, or you'll become apprehensive about your own abilities.<br>  Take it slow and learn along the way.<br>  <br>  good luck
ce415442d6934a8dae96b77ac250825faa	To get rid of them, Traps, flooding, and gravel, mesh or concrete barriers can be effective. You'd have to be careful with traps, but maybe you can find a way to place them deep enough into the holes that it would be too hard for pets to get to. A "pit trap" ...made from a large jar or coffee can would catch moles in a way that wouldn't harm  pets. Here's a site that illustrates/explains pit traps, etc:<br>  <a href="http://www.getridofthings.com/get-rid-of-moles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.getridofthings.com/get-rid-of...</a><br>   <br>  Many articles say using Castor oil is effective. Even the Washington Dept. of Fish & Wildlife site, which nixes the noise-scaring approach & other repellents, actually gives out a Castor oil recipe & after saying: "Commercially available castor oilâ€“based repellents have been scientifically tested on moles in the Eastern United States with some success... then says this about a home-made Castor oil recipe:<br>  "The repellent will be most effective where it can be watered into the moist soil surrounding surface tunnels made by moles. Areas that receive extensive irrigation will quickly loose the repellent to leaching. For best results, spray the entire area needing protection; moles will burrow under a perimeter treatment. The repellent may need to be reapplied before moles depart. Once moles move elsewhere, the solution usually remains effective for 30 to 60 days." <br>  The Recipe:<br>  Using a blender to combine 1/4 cup of unrefined castor oil (can be purchased at most pharmacies) and 2 tablespoons of a dishwashing liquid. Blend the two together, add 6 tablespoons water, and blend again. Combine the concentrated mixture with water at a rate of 2 tablespoons of solution to 1 gallon of water. Use a watering can or sprayer to liberally apply the solution to areas where moles are active. The above mixture will cover approximately 300 square feet.<br>  <a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/wlm/living/moles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wdfw.wa.gov/wlm/living/moles.htm</a><br>  Besides Castor oil, some people even try pouring cat litter or human hair clippings into molehills & refill them until signs of the mole have disappeared, but this may not work.<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Proven-Tips-for-Eliminating-Ground-Moles&id=564546" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Proven-Tips-fo...</a><br>  <br>  The Washington Dept. of Fish & Wildlife site also gives a more detailed explaination of using flooding, barriers, trapping & natural controls & states this about eliminating grubs to try to get rid of moles: <br>  "It is often suggested that if you eliminate grubs from an area you will get rid of moles. Grubs make up only a portion of the mole's diet. During dry periods, moles are known to frequent well-irrigated lawns just for moisture. Thus, moles often are present even in grub-free yards. If all the earthworms, grubs, and other soil animals in a lawn are eliminated by repeated insecticide application, moles may be forced to seek other areas. However, the use of soil insecticides is an expensive approach with no immediate reduction of damage and little likelihood of long-term control. In the process, soil insecticides may poison the groundwater, kill beneficial soil invertebrates, and damage songbirds and other desirable wildlife."<br>   <br>  Moles "favor white grubs when they can find them, but earthworms make up roughly 75 percent of a mole's diet."   If you're having trouble with the white grubs that turn into Japanese Beetles ...there are natural organisms (such as  Milky Spore)  that can get rid of those types of grubs.<br>  <br>  "There is also a mole repellent called Mole-Med that has shown to be somewhat effective in tests at Michigan State University...made from castor bean extract."<br>  This source recommends traps & cats to get rid of moles:<br>  <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/homes/20010317quest5.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.post-gazette.com/homes/200103...</a><br>   <br>  This is Bob Villa's site with suggestions from members:<br>  <a href="http://www.bobvila.com/BBS/GETTING_RID_OF_MOLES_IN_YARD-Bugs_and_Pests-1-F117.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobvila.com/BBS/GETTING_RID_O...</a><br>   <br>  Trying different approaches is your best chance of getting rid of moles.<br>  <br>   Good Luck!

You can find it at your local equipment renter and do it yourself. However, you might not want to, the machine is rather terrifying if you are not used to working with equipment of that magnitude. I obviously don't know where you are from, but if you look in your local yellow pages you should be able to find someone who actually grinds stumps for a living! prices vary depending on your location. Also, some of these guys will clean up the dust for you leaving your yard clean, and others will leave it there in a pile. so depending on what you are looking to spend and how much work you want to do, you can have that stump out of your yard in an hour without breaking a sweat!<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AdoTLU0xaa	A great product for this purpose is called a "Stump King".  It is available to buy or hire in both the UK and USA (and most probably other places).  It is basically a tripod which sits over the top of the stump with a chain lift attached.  The chain lift is secured to the stump and thats it.  Use the chain lift to pull the stump out of the ground with minimal effort.  Very very easy to use and widely available.<br>  Hope this helps|`|ad164a07a48d8cedcdfa29ee998d2afbaa	Hi Daniel.<br>  <br>  Ok. If it's a conifer (Leylandii etc) it possible for you to dig it out, but you'll want the right tool. A mattock is tool for the job, as you'll need to  clear a trench around the stump and sever any roots that you come across in the process. If you sever as you dig down eventually it should rock with some leverage and hopefully snap the remaining roots. So dig down, expose the roots, cut out a section of root big enough to get your mattock or spade through and keep going. <br>  <br>  If it's an Ash... good luck. Most big stumps (12 inch diameter or bigger) will need a grinder.<br>  <br>  If you choose the grinding root (sorry about the pun), then get it done by a professional and get a few quotes. It'll be much cheaper and safer in the long run. <br>  <br>  Or just live with it and let it rot, but that'll take a few years.<br>  <br>  Honestly digging it out is all about technique and tools. Sharp tools and a methodical technique. Go on you can do it!|`|hPgRvmTUaa	You could poison it by drilling deep holes and pouring a suitable poison into it to make the root rot quickly. But it takes time and you will be left with the root in the meantime. You need to dig around it and deep enough to loosen it. I had a similar experience and gave up only to realise that I had almost been there when workmen were hired and they quickly completed my work! So don't give up...keep digging and you will root it out.|`|doeg7JSaaa	You've got me stumped lol. but why do you want to remove it? just dig down and cut off the tree a foot or so below ground level seal the stump with bitumen then poison the roots with copper-oxide or similar (ask at your local garden centre) so it rots away.|`|282f3c3ef67f759a8388216dc595a9dbaa	Dig all around it and chop the roots.  then pull like a mother **** er|`|LfUTTJA4aa	Use a matock and a strong spade and plenty of anger. I've taken loads of tree stumps out with just these simple tools.  If you're going to go down the road of stump grinders you could pay 1000's. dig down and around the stump with the spade and use the blades of your matock to chop through any roots. You'll rarely need to go deeper than two foot! Then you need to dig under the stump a little to dislodge any of the fine roots. Quite often you can wiggle it out at this stage like a huge wobbly tooth.|`|YwxYiBgDaa	We had a tree stump that was giving us a real fit to get out.

yu9PHV4Maa	go with the Combat roach gel, it will come in a large syringe and it will have no odor and is made by the same company that make the professional line of roach baits...try avoid spraying insecticide after you apply it....You can place it in the cabinets or on a piece of cardboard and slide under the counter appliances. You will see them for a week or so but the numbers will start dropping until gone. Using a good vacuum where you see them accumulate will quickly remove some of the population.<br>  <br>  edit :  Holy cow with the Boric Acid...  it will be probably 50 times more times toxic than any other insecticide you would buy...if anyone knows of an insecticide more toxic than Boric Acid I'm curious to know what it is.  A table spoon has around a fifty percent chance of killing a 11-12 pound animal, my best insecticide on my truck would take well over a quart to do the same.  Boric acid can be found as an eye wash...diluted down.  Some eye washes also have traces of hydrochloric acid in them but I wouldn't say that hydrochloric acid is an eye wash.   If a child gets a pinch of Boric acid into their mouth it will be a trip to the hospital and there is no antidote for boric acid poisoning.  Yes Boric acid can be used effectively as pest control but most pros I know don't use because it is unsightly..slow acting..and it rates low for being an environmentally friendly use product|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Find a place where you can buy the largest size of Boric Acid, like an Ace or True Value Hardware (also many 'Dollar' stores, where everything costs only $1).  What you want to do is leave Boric Acid along every corner ... the base of the walls, corners in cupboards, etc.  Boric Acid is the only thing that cockroaches can 'walk through' with seeming no 'bad effects' ... but it 'sticks' to their exoskeleton and 'eats away' slowly.  They then carry it back to the nest where they live, and when they are sick and or dying, the baby cockroaches eat the bodies, and they die, too.  Keep dusting for 6-12 weeks (once a week) and you should begin to notice there are fewer roaches out ... which means you'll have fewer roaches in the nest.  Pets can eat Boric Acid, children can eat Boric Acid ... but it's so 'mild' that it's used as an eyewash (mixed with boiling water and cooled) and has no 'danger' to humans.  I've had roaches when I moved into many places, and I also had children ... and I found out that even the pest control guys who use the 'chemical sprays' in homes use Boric Acid in their own homes, for one reason ... it's the only 'poison' that doesn't hurt any larger creature, but it always kills roaches dead, dead, dead ... and the roaches eat the dead ones so you don't get 'new roaches' a few weeks later!|`|t6PS1kBkaa	Roaches hate the taste of bay leaves.

If that were the case the outlet would be switched with the light, meaning the outlet would be normal when the light is on and the outlet would have no power when the light is off.  That is not what you said is happening.<br>  <br>  You said the outlet does not work at all with the light on.  The confusing part you see tells me the light and outlet are in SERIES.  That makes the light dimly lit when something is plugged in and that plugged in item isn't working properly.  Then what would make the light normal with nothing plugged in, the switches would need to be across the outlet (if you shorted the two blades of the outlet the light would come on).<br>  <br>  What I think your wiring was to start with (it fits with your description, but there MIGHT be another case that would cause this, but nothing came to mind).  The power feed for your light is at the light, not either of the switches.  The black and white from the light goes to the switch you were modifying.  The black is the connection to the light and the white is hot.  Current code says that white should be marked to indicate it is hot and not a neutral, but your house may be before that code or it was just not done.  That white connected to the white of the other cable goes to the common of the other switch (I think if you look at the other switch it will have just the 3 conductor cable with the white connected to the common).  The black and red from the other switch connect to your switch, and the black from the light went to the common of the switch.  This is variation #1 in the link Jim K posted.<br>  <br>  Your switch box has a hot wire but no neutral, so you cannot tap power from this location.

chfqTK6yaa	My husband made me a cleaver one by using 2 vanity cabinets purchased at Home Depot and just layed a counter top across, it stays put yet could be moved at anytime and the cabinets are perfect for storage.  If you want to keep the cost at a minimum you can try using filing cabinets and a door or check out your local Craigslist for someone selling used cabinets or file cabinets.  Home Depot or Lowes can cut the counter top to the width you need and of course if you're not picky about color or style, you can get the counter top from the clearance.  Good Luck, hope it helps.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Indy , check out good old Walmart .|`|NbInTVOOaa	Micheals may be
T0pkW783aa	Yes, a duvet cover goes over a comforter or a down filler.  You can use either.  Many people use a duvet cover to replace a comforter which has faded or doesn't fit with the decor of a room.  They are easy to care for since you just remove the cover and wash it or have it dry cleaned.  If you don't have a comforter, you can buy one, either down or a synthetic type of filler; just remember that down isn't always washable and may need to be cleaned at a dry cleaner who specializes in cleaning down items.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	A duvet cover is made of fabric similar to sheets.

MQJ8w56Qaa	You can bury the pipe underground.<br>  Starting near the house, you can dig a trench wide enough to fit the existing pipe, about 4-6" underground.<br>  Continue digging the trench until you get to the end of the pipe, all the while adding a gentle downward slope to the depth of the trench. 1/8" per foot of length is plenty. Example- 8' pipe would require a 1" slope from the house to the end of the pipe.<br>  <br>  At the end of the pipe, dig a pit a couple of feet deep and a good 18" across. Fill the hole with pea stone to a couple inches from the top. The pipe should extend into this pit about 6" and be at least 6-12" underground level. Deeper is better.<br>  <br>  Lay a piece of landscape cloth on top of the peastone, cover with more stone then place regular yard soil on top of the hole.

If the pump is in the basement and there are sewer lines down there, you can pipe the discharge pipe straight in to your main line. Some counties do not allow this because it is relatively clean water that they prefer not to have to sanitize at the treatment plant. So check you local codes and hire a plumber.

944iJNAdaa	It's bursts of hard work interspersed with patience and an occasional watchful eye.  It's certainly not 24/7, unless you have to watch for critters or thieves.  You do need to stay on top of the weeds when they're young, or they get out of hand.  The easiest gardening trick I ever learned was to file your garden hoe down to a fine edge, and then "slice" the weeds off by cutting right below the surface, and not the "chopping" actions that waste your energy.  Keep a flat file nearby, and resharpen the edge frequently as you garden - you'll be amazed how much this helps.  You need to keep a watchful eye out for pests and water needs, too.  They say the best fertilizer is the gardeners shadow.  That doesn't have to be 24/7, though.|`|67bf24c14d9ab5395e568fc716ad0ca2aa	Not with some planning beforehand. Think about why you want a garden - for flowers, for colour, for vegetables - then plan around those thoughts. We have made a pretty colourful garden on our balcony of our unit.

We also had a marine battery to turn on as back up if the power went out. And it did, a few times. We had a plumber put the whole thing in with back flow preventers to keep the water from coming back down the pipes. This did not, however, keep the water from coming in at the seam where the poured concrete floor met the foundation wall when the water table became too high. That happened about two months before we moved from the house...what a nightmare. I will never have another basement.<br>  <br>  Don't know if this helps, but at least you know what to expect.|`|efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	If you had a home inspection done, the age and condition of the sump pump should be listed.  If you did not have a home inspection, I would call in a plumber for an estimate of it's life expectancy.  Another option would be to look on the sump pump and see if there is a manufacturer's sticker.  Usually the month and date of production are listed.  This will allow you to judge the age of the pump against the life expectancy.  However, unless you live in an area that is prone to flooding, I would not worry about it for now.  You would not want to buy a new sump pump only to find out 1 month later that a major system (heating, cooling, etc.) has to be replaced.  I attached a pdf file below from an insurance company.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Don't bother getting rid of this one, but definately get a second one for a back up..I have lived my life with wells, and sump pumps and know they will eventually stop working, and that will be at a time you need it, and the stores are closed..so, just get a cheap back up to have in case.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	Sump pumps can easily last 10 years or more, so you may want to keep it for now.<br>  What you can do, is buy a moisture/water detector to place on the floor next to the sump hole.

944iJNAdaa	It is a lot to ask a neighbor to let you remove and then rebuild his fence.  If you greased the deal with money he might be more agreeable.  Also, most tractors (and I think bobcats too) have loaders that can lift higher than the fence, so you might be able to dump over the top of the fence, and then wheelbarrow from there.<br>  <br>  Awkward as it may be, using wheelbarrows might end up being the easiest method here.  Another, even more tedious method, is something they did in a cave near me (I think it's a national park - Oregon Caves)  - they carried the debris out in 5 gallon buckets.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I researched this further, and these people have what looks like would do the job here, and you might have someone with this kind of equipment locally.

They just need to take down one section of boards, leaving the posts.  Most landscapers can remove the boards in 10 minutes, reinstall in the same.<br>  <br>  Be careful adding that much soil that you do not raise the level of your yard higher than your neighbours, it will create drainage issues and you will be responsible.  Most houses have specific grading plans when built that are checked by landscape architects.  Check with your condo agreement or the city planning department as to whether adding soil and changing the grading is allowed.

If it went further on down the line, try to trace the line out to see where it goes- you might get lucky if there's a clean out near the floor of the plumbing stacks.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario, you'll have to cut into the pipe to retrieve it.  Another option would be to rent a sewer camera and locate the snake yourself, even try pushing it with the camera head, nudge it out into the city sewer where it won't be your problem anymore.  THINK MCFLY, THINK!|`|k7hBT7MGaa	If the end of the snake is close to the toilet, you might be able to grab it with another snake. You would need something on the end of the 2nd snake to grab the 1st snake. <br>  <br>  If the snake fell down a vertical pipe, look for a clean-out near the bottom of that pipe. Open the clean-out, pull out the snake, and close the clean-out.|`|0uTKr8Knaa	maybe try a electro magnet with a snakish tube and battery strong enough to lift the drain snake|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	You'll have to have to call a plumber.
PAWbTYLoaa	I usually bought form Wall mart and for my children from character comforts site. you can find lots of good bedding there|`|FXnHE7mmaa	You can find good prices on bedding and coordinates at lots of places..Giant Tiger, Walmart, Zellers, Sears, Ikea, KMart..all over the place.|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	I highly recommend these sheets:<br>  <a href="http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/view.2/app.detail/params.item.H98113.desc.NorthernNights-WrinkleDefense-400TCSateen-100-Cotton-SheetSet" rel="nofollow">http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/view....</a><br>  <br>  They are SUPER soft & not too thick or too thin.  A bit pricey, but just look at the great reviews.  Worth it & they will last forever.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend a mattress pad like this one:<br>  <a href="http://www3.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?ItemID=14723b7&ItemTyp=C&GrpTyp=STY&ShowMenu=T&ShopBy=0&SearchString=makeover+mattress+pad&RefPage=SearchDepartment.aspx&s4PageSize=15&CmCatId=EXTERNAL|searchdepartment&Search1Prod=True" rel="nofollow">http://www3.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Ite...</a><br>  <br>  Very soft & fluffy and fits thick mattresses too.<br>  <br>  And I used this company to order some great pillows like the ones in luxury hotels:<br>  <a href="http://www.pacificcoast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificcoast.com/</a><br>  <br>  The way I found the mattress I liked was by staying at a really nice hotel (Hamptom Inn).  I researched where they bought their mattresses and then bought one from a local dealer.<br>  <br>  Good  luck and happy shopping!|`|EqPWmRdBaa	Well, I got mine at wal-mart.<br>  The queen size comforter, and two bed shames for about $40.00.<br>  Then the sheets were $15.00. :)<br>  Try there. If not target has great bedding.<br>  Oh by the way, walmart bedding is durable.<br>  My dog plays with it and bites it and stuff, its still in perfect condition 6 monthes later. :)
zM9Lj21waa	i just did a fireplace face out of cultured stone last year ...they bought all the material and i did it by the hour...i charged 25 an hour...this brand was boulder creek but there are many brands...do a search or see what your local suppliers carry...|`|UQWusO1waa	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=stone%20veneer%20fireplace">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=stone%2...</a>
0J7DutA4aa	hahehe i used to have that problem. then i found this neat little mesh bag at wal mart, and it can go in the washer and dreyer. you can put your underwear and sox or pantyhose in it. so it doesnt mysteriously stick to your pants and find its way out when your in public =)|`|m0a7Ox1maa	I use a wash bag - Best Thing Ever Invented!!|`|UQWusO1waa	they slip through the litttle gap at the top of the tub and fall inside the washer, or under the agitator.|`|AA11161263	Many stores sell little plastic rings that will hold pairs of socks together.<br>  <br>  The mesh laundry bags are the best though.|`|8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	the mesh bag works great but if you dont have one of those try using a safety pin and pin them together from the top, so you dont make holes in the toes|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	Argh! That darn sock monster strikes again!!! I always put two in the washer, two in the dryer and always, always!!!........Only one comes out!!!|`|iKYNUni0aa	safety pin them together
49bc95e536997e2638ca74e09150ae4faa	The lady bugs that are in your house are an invasive pest species from Asia.  You need to let them die.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	there's another way..... put them into clear plastic containers with a dampened paper towel and put in the fridge....hold them that way until warm weather... take them out and spritz a little water into the container once  a week or so..... make sure it's a 'warmer' part of the fridge.... not the coldest part... like the drawer at the bottom or the door.... LABEL!!.. *smile*....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturescontrol.com/ladybugs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturescontrol.com/ladybugs.h...</a><br>  <br>  are they the little red native ! ladies or the orange/multicolored Asian ladybugs?....the Asians are shoving the little red ones out... so it's up to you whether you'd want to keep them or not... I don't like them... they bite, stink if you squish them and leave permanent poo stains on wall paint and woodwork .... your choice...(they ARE good at what they do in the garden, tho!)<br>  <br>  they look like these....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ipm.msu.edu/beetleFAQ.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipm.msu.edu/beetleFAQ.htm</a><br>  <br>  not as pretty as the little red ladies, huh?... *smile*....(love your avatar name!!)|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Little you can do.<br>  They eat aphids, and will starve inside anyway.|`|944iJNAdaa	There's really no winning in this situation, from the ladybugs perspective.  In nature, they can't know there's such a thing as heated houses to overwinter in.  At this point, since they're awakened so early in the season, there isn't any food out there for them to eat yet.  But, they're going to use up all of their internal food stores wandering around in the warm environment (in nature, they'd be someplace cool instead, so they could conserve these internal food stores).  It takes special conditions for ladybugs to survive the winter, and these ones didn't find it.  I think you can take your choices here, but for the ladybugs, their choice was made when they stumbled upon your house, and none of them are very likely to survive until spring.  Don't feel too bad, that's one of the reason things breed so prolifically in the insect world - not near all of them survive through the winter.  Still, enough generally do to get the species started again come spring.  It's pretty much an age old cycle.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	They are NOT ladybugs.  They are orange, and "ladies" are red.  Squash them or vacuum them up.
cpmiJQyIaa	It is safe to hand wash, but do not use shout, vinegar or salt.  You will have to pick up a gentle laundry wash like Woolite or Delicare.  I personally have Delicare here as the instructions are very exact and I think it works better.  It smells better in my opinion too.<br>  <br>  Put a small amount of the laundry wash on the stain after it is wet and work it in gently.  Follow instructions on laundry wash of choice for hand washing.  Make sure you wash and rinse the garment in cold water only.  <br>  <br>  Once washed and rinse, air dry only.  Do not put it in the dryer.  Once it is completely dry, check to see if any stain remains.  If so, repeat washing steps.
yaq7oaH6aa	About 12' is probably your upper limit.<br>  Lotsa luck with the deer. They can clear 6' if they`re motivated.|`|bbf5ba03e8f1091ed1d55be1570e5916aa	Usually the posts are between 6-8 feet apart.  I wouldn't go much more than that.  I would also depend on how long the fence is. Divide the total length up evenly so the fence sections look good and solid.  Try not to shock yourself.  Some of those control boxes give off a mean zap!|`|7faa830a5f484403e6668e99c4253665aa	6 to 8 feet is standard.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	Why don't you use the colored braided electric fence wires? The Length depends on the output of the charger. It should say on your charger how many feet it will cover. I would suggest running two along the bottom of the fence , one in the middle and the other along the top for the deer. Because of the thickness of the pigs skin it may be a problem. There is a high and low control to set the fence at.They sell orange and yellow braided tapes and are visible. After a few zaps they learn to stay back even if the fence is not on. Make sure you use insulators on each post to keep the wire from shorting out and make sure weeds and grass don't grow up the fence which can short out the wire. Also do not use a water pipe or electric panel as a ground because it could feed back and cause electric shocks inside the house. They must have their own ground connection. This is done by driving a 8 foot grounding rod into the ground at the charger. The rods are cheap and can be purchased at Home Depot/Lowes electrical department.
F32uPjAraa	Yes you can, Stephan T you do not know what your talking about, take it to any welding shop and they will bronze it back on. Or using oxy cast iron welding you will get the same result, only better, because you are using the same metal. If you bronze it there will be a yellow join mark.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It's hard to weld cast iron.<br>  Brazing is your best bet.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	No way to repair it because they are cast.|`|fjLluy2baa	yes cast can be welded you need to find a welder with that type of experience, watch the video of the cast iron fire place stand<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.muggyweld.com/castiron.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.muggyweld.com/castiron.html</a>
