fKqdHPusaa	It was fair in the sense that George Clemenceau's country, France, had been devastated by WWI. Thousands and thousands of their young men had died, thousands and thousands of families torn apart, their whole eastern side destroyed, so it was not unreasonable of him to want revenge and compensation. Also Germany had tried to invade France at least twice before - so wasnt it fair of French people to want reassurance that it wouldn't happen again? They tried to guarantee this by not allowing Germany an air force or navy and only 100,000 men in their army. They weren't allowed in the Rhineland either (an area on the eastern side of France/west Germany.|`|ooCvJWPHaa	The treaty of versailles was unfair to Germany.|`|7fREUAf9aa	Fair is a very objective term. What might seem fair to one group of people is incredibly unjust to another. To the British and the French everything about the Treaty of Versailles was fair. They were receiving reparations for a war they hadn't started. It also kept Germany down, so they wouldn't have to worry about being threatened by it. Yet in all reality the treaty of Versailles was incredibly unfair to the Germans.|`|uHSzHotQaa	well i suppose ww1 seriously damaged the surrounding counties and cost the other countries billions to resore their countries<br>  additionally, the allies had to protect themselves so thats why they limited there forces so alot of the treaty i suppose did protect the contries<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

The ancient Egyptians certainly had both.  Immense importance was attached to the disposal of the dead, and 'loose women' used to frequent the inns which were popular places of entertainment.<br>  <br>  Before the development of civilisations, people would probably bury their own dead rather than having it done by professionals, and there wouldn't be any prostitutes because nobody would have the wherewithal to pay them.  Women and men in primitive communities normally live by hunter-gathering, or by farming, and the sort of specialised trades that you get with civilizations don't really have a chance to develop.<br>  <br>  Of course people had sex in primitive societies, but that is not the same as prostitution.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	prostitue... people were having sex before they were dying.<br>  <br>  list of proffesions by age(for lack of a better word)<br>  prostitute<br>  undertaker<br>  engineer-someone who makes technology (no matter how primitive) is an engineer<br>  midwife<br>  healer-not necessarily a doctor|`|iJzIIEdfaa	Prostitute obviously, who needed an undertaker?

It's there strictly as a reminder.  Where you'll need to worry about it is on your external light meter.  <br>  <br>  To load the film, you'll need to unwrap your 120 roll & stick the leader into your second spool (should be in the camera).  Put the feed spool (the one with the film) in the lower latch & the take up spool (where the film is going) into the upper latch.  Close the back & wind the film until the counter says "1".  When you're finished shooting the roll, wind the film into it's on the take-up spool.  <br>  <br>  No, you won't need to worry about the X/M switch unless you use a flash.

Amberly<br>  That's a pretty self explanatory one  . <br>  They BOTH hate each other .<br>  <br>  I never thought of Upton, but that's a really good one ! <br>  He actually might be the one to blame ! <br>  <br>  I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEXT BOOK ! :D<br>  <br>  I still REALLY want Josh & her to come back together ! <br>  I always think of them with the paint brushes when<br>  on Christmas break and he gave her brushes for christmas<br>  to remind her of what they did ! <br>  It was so cute<br>  <br>  ahah<br>  I love them ! <br>  <br>  & Since Kate Brian always puts a twist at the end of the book<br>  Poppy would be too obvious so I doubt it<br>  <br>  IT CAN ALSO BE THE RYAN TWINS . <br>  Since The mom also hates her !|`|m8kTovU3aa	Honestly i think the Ryan twins are the most likely, but the only thing is that the person Reed saw in the picture was blonde, but Paige and Daniel both have a light brownish hair... it makes the most sense but I'm not sure.. i cant wait til September!!!|`|9H5ojMX9aa	I think its Paige and Daniel because remember somebody was choking her with her necklace while somebody else pushed her. The reason I think this is because their both loyal to Poppy and were both friends (maybe more) with Ariana. Plus it all adds up. The blond Reed saw in the picture Taylor gave her could be Paige. The Jet skies are owned by the Ryans. They always seem to be keeping a secret. Mrs.Ryan has got to have a reason for hating Reed so much. <br>         As we know from the book Daniel and Paige are never far away from their mother so they probably saw Reed and Upton when the Ryans mother found them both in her bedroom and decided to get back at her. Plus who else could have gotten on the private boat and they weren't at the xmas party when Reed found the picture of a blond girl. I also think that they killed Reed's bird with one of the poisonous fruit from their mother's garden or the seeds Daniel gave Reed were poisoned.|`|GMdnJXkzaa	i'm definitely thinking daniel. He probably got mad that reed hurt poppy and we know he has a temper! also it's gonna be a guy cus the musky smell is probably cologne.

OhWmu0R3aa	Neither were particularly pleasant individuals and although there were roughly 40 million deaths under the Stalin regime from starvation, imprisonment and outright murder, unlike Hitler and the Nazis there was no policy of genocide and conquest. The countries that were absorbed into the USSR at the end of WWII were there for a buffer zone to prevent another invasion of Russia. Hitler and Nazism were ultimately responsible for the deaths of 16 million soldiers and 28 million civilians and countless amounts of suffering, along with the desire to subjugate most of the "inferior" Eastern European nations.<br>  So, more "evil" - Adolf and co hands down.<br>  <br>  Btw, Stalin and the USSR at that time were not socialist, but communist and a Stalinist form of communism at that; something a little different from Marxism or Leninism. You could hardly put socialist France/Holland/Sweden etc in the same bracket as Russia under Stalin.|`|3S3XjvYcaa	hitler, nazism obviously, socialism isn't evil, it was designed to help the working class, but there are obviously problems with that ideology|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Hitler <br>  Nazism

He opened the doors of galleries and museums for color photography.  If you start to think about how much of contemporary fine art photography is in color, you will really appreciate this artist.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Display some colored markers in a design. Check out the sky at different times of the day. If you live near a farm take a picture of some different color animals like maybe they have a bunch of horses ranging in color..

You could have all sorts of races of people get together wearing brightly colored clothes.

7PMuY5ibaa	Here's a clue VAMPIRES DONT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ApG0DpzXaa	Vampires are not real.  They are what is called folklore.  Folklore is a mix of the stories that everybody in a culture knows (like the ugly duckling in our culture) and storybook creatures that do not really exist but which represent certain thoughts, concepts and wishes (like ghosts which represent our wish that people we love do not die).  Some folklore has its roots in history.  Many nursery rhymes are based in history and come from a time when very few people could read and write, so stories became a way of passing the history between the generations.  (Ring around the rosy is a nursery rhyme that is actually about the Bubonic plague).<br>  <br>  Vampires are folklore based on real history.  There was once a very powerful, very very evil man named Vlad Tepish.  (I'm not too sure on the spelling of the last name, but that's how it's pronounced.)  Vlad slaughtered hundreds to thousands of people.  He killed them in one of the most horrible ways anyone has ever thought of.  He had his men take long wooden poles and sharpen them to a point on one end.  Then they would drive the point into the person they were killing's body while that person was still alive.  They would then raise the pole up in the air with the person being killed up in the air at the top end of the pole like a sick flagpole and leave them impaled there still alive while gravity pulled their body slowly down the pole stuck through them.  Some of them took days to die.  Because of this horrific, evil, cruelty, Vlad was called "Vlad the Impaler".<br>  <br>  The story of Vlad's evil was passed down in stories through the years by the people who lived in that part of the world (Transylvania).  Mother's would tell their children that if they were not good children, Vlad would come and take them in the night.  They did not call him Vlad though.  Vlad had been the Count in the area, and his headquarters had been Castle Drakul.  So they told their children "Count Dracula" would get them.<br>  <br>  As the years and centuries passed, the stories got vaguer and vaguer, and got mixed up with other monster stories from folklore.  Eventually the idea of vampires replaced the facts of evil Vlad.  <br>  <br>  This was a small idea in folklore until the movies were invented, and a famous silent film called "Nosferatu" (which is French for vampire) was made.  Nosferatu was such a big hit that other vampire movies got made.  They were hits and made a lot of money.  TV was invented and people made money out of vampire TV shows and vampire books and vampire role playing games, etc... etc... .  Suddenly vampires, which had been a small idea in folklore based on an evil man who lived over 1000 years ago, became a big idea in folklore because they could be marketed so well in the entertainment industry.  But just because they are popular, that doesn't make them real.<br>  <br>  If you want even more detail, ask your question again in the folklore section instead of in the history section.|`|d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	Check out any of the Vlad Foxworthy comedy routines<br>  "...you might be a vampire."|`|kacLYFrHaa	Well, to make this history related I'm going to turn to "Shock Shots Vampires" which came out in 1993. Back in '93 I decided I was going to be a vampire for Halloween so as to greet (and scare some) the trick-or-treaters so I bought a few books to help me get more into the part (I'd never really read books on vampires or watched vampire movies when I was younger so I wanted a better idea on how to dress and such). Chapter two is called Profile of a Vampire and includes a section on recognizing vampires. So from a publication from over fifteen years ago (will be sixteen this September) here is a check list for you:<br>  <br>  "*Eyes are glassy, or fiery red. It can see in complete darkness.<br>  <br>  *Has hair on palms, and index finger. (Uh-oh, look out. This could either be a werewolf or a vampire.)<br>  <br>  *Changes shape into a bat, cat, mist, wisp of smoke.<br>  <br>  *Goes berserk when it sees a crucifix. Runs away.<br>  <br>  *Has no refelect in a mirror.<br>  <br>  *Won't coe out in the daytime. Hates the sun, loves darkness.<br>  <br>  *Has bad breath.<br>  <br>  *Has long, dirty nails. (Just goes to show there are exceptions to every rule. Dapper Dracula, the world's most famous vampire, probably wouldn;t be caught dead with dirty nails.)"<br>  <br>  Ok, does one of more of these apply to you? Then according to something written fifteen years ago you may be a vampire. The book also includes a list of ways to become a vampire. these are:<br>  <br>  "*Was born with teeth<br>  <br>  *Is a seventh son or daughter<br>  <br>  *Ate the flesh of a sheep killed by a werewolf<br>  <br>  *Was killed by a werewolf.<br>  <br>  *Is a dead werewolf<br>  <br>  *Is the child of a vampire and a werewolf.<br>  <br>  *Has red hair.<br>  <br>  *Is a corpse that a dog, a cat, or a child jumped over.<br>  <br>  *Is a child cursed by its own parents.<br>  <br>  *Drowned.<br>  <br>  *Was murdered, and the murder remains unpublished.<br>  <br>  *Was struck by lightning<br>  <br>  *Is different or unpopular.<br>  <br>  *Is a liar.<br>  <br>  *Is a wicked person."<br>  <br>  Again, do any of these apply to you? If so, then fifteen years ago this would mean you were a vampire. Keep in mind these are just lists that were created based on various Vampire myths and are not hard and fast evidence of anything
A6ylS5bJaa	I'm pretty sure you're thinking about Homecoming, by Cynthia Voigt, and all it's companions, about these four kids who live on the streets, trying to get to their unknown aunt's home after their mother deserts them. It's a great novel.|`|02O0SnUWaa	i agree with the first answer. thats what it sounds like. =)

sdvvlgDKaa	Who is the author? I have read a book called Catalyst too. <br>  It was by Laurie Halse Anderson. Is that the book you're<br>  talking about? Because i know of other books i with the <br>  title 'Catalyst'.<br>  <br>  Okay.. i'll edit my answer later if you mean a different book.<br>  A catalyst is a substance that initiates or accelerates a <br>  chemical reaction without itself being affected.<br>  Something that causes an important event to happen <br>  Kate feels that she is the catalyst is everyone elses life <br>  but her's. That she helps everyone but in return, No one<br>  helps her. It is actually very sad.|`|xvjT3Py7aa	The fire, baby dying, not getting into MIT are are all catalysts to discovering who she is and her relationships with her family.

gLp7pvPnaa	Good question, and there are downsides to being human: -<br>  <br>  1. We are aware of the certainty of our death.<br>  2. We have fears of all kinds of possible scenarios, like becoming ill or losing a loved one.<br>  3. We are expected to conform to societies rules even when we strongly disagree with them.<br>  4. We are subjected to others trying to influence us in all matters, from politics to religion.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you can think of a few more, presumably dissatisfactions like these are the reason for your question.<br>  <br>  With all its drawbacks, being human is probably the most precious thing known, and we are probably living in the most interesting time in the whole history of our planet.|`|wxSO48E3aa	We are conscious beings that are capable of being aware of our condition as a species.  Although not everyone is aware.  Those that are aware have a decision to make.  To either embrace all aspects of the human condition and accept them for what they are or to reject them as if looking at the aspects from the outside.  Both ways could lead a person to believing that it's a curse to be human, or not.

KBBonf97aa	Since guitars are very personal, you should probably spend a while in a guitar store playing all of the models and see which one would best meet your needs.  Each one will have it's own sound and feel, so I'd try them through the type of amplifier you'll be using and make a determination based on your experience with each of them.<br>  <br>  And I have to disagree with all the people trashing Epiphone guitars!  I've got an Epiphone LP Jr. that's great for playing live, as well as recording.  The neck is a bit chunky for my taste, but the guitar hasn't given me a moment's trouble.  And it sounds great -- crunchy and punchy, just like I'd expect from a Les Paul.|`|TM3zpfoPaa	Well personally you have that thing for that gibson feel I am guessing.<br>  <br>  You should actually check into the thunder bird or explore guitars by gibson...<br>  <br>  Personally there i no such thing as the best guitar in the world. If there is that is an opinion and opinions are like @ssholes everyone has one.<br>  <br>  You should check into Jackson Guitars with the SSH style pick ups in them... Like the DK2 Dinky for 600 bucks you cannot go wrong and that guitar will sound like all them guitars above if you know how to play with sound with the amp and guitar.|`|6Z4zv8XZaa	To the person above, Fenders are terrible.<br>  Gibsons, in my opinion are overrated. But its all about your tastes, and what you intend to play. <br>  If youre going to play blues/softer music get a fender. if youre playing rock/hard rock gibson<br>  metal should be left to ibanez or dean or schecter [though they are good overall guitar]|`|AA12025213	Epiphones are crap, hands down.

shVgCizBaa	Which of the following men put together a compormise resolving issues between the North and South which was...?b Henry Clay<br>  cStephen Douglas<br>  e Daniel Webster The measures, a compromise designed by Whig Senator Henry Clay (KY), who failed to get them through himself, were shepherded to passage by Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas (IL) and Whig Senator Daniel Webster (MA). The measures were opposed by Senator and former Vice-President John C. Calhoun (D-SC). The Compromise was possible after the death of President Zachary Taylor, who was in opposition. Succeeding him was a strong supporter of the compromise: Millard Fillmore.-------------------------------... Compromise of 1850 was a series of bills aimed at resolving the territorial and slavery controversies arising from the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). There were five laws which balanced the interests of the slave states of the South and the free states to the north. California was admitted as a free state; Texas received financial compensation for relinquishing claim to lands west of the Rio Grande in what is now New Mexico; the Territory of New Mexico (including present-day Arizona and a portion of southern Nevada) was organized without any specific prohibition of slavery; the slave trade (but not slavery itself) was terminated in the District of Columbia; and the stringent Fugitive Slave Law was passed, requiring all U.S. citizens to assist in the return of runaway slaves regardless of the legality of slavery in the specific states.<br>  <br>  The measures, a compromise designed by Whig Senator Henry Clay (KY), who failed to get them through himself, were shepherded to passage by Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas (IL) and Whig Senator Daniel Webster (MA). The measures were opposed by Senator and former Vice-President John C. Calhoun (D-SC). The Compromise was possible after the death of President Zachary Taylor, who was in opposition. Succeeding him was a strong supporter of the compromise: Millard Fillmore. It temporarily defused sectional tensions in the United States, postponing the secession crisis and the American Civil War. The Compromise dropped the Wilmot Proviso, which never became law but would have banned slavery in territory acquired from Mexico. Instead the Compromise further endorsed the doctrine of "Popular Sovereignty" for the New Mexico Territory. The various compromises lessened political contention for four years, until the relative lull was shattered by the divisive Kansas-Nebraska Act.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1850" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_...</a>|`|AA11622701	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1850" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an article with all the information you should need.<br>  <br>  You are more likely to actual learn the information if you have to spend a little time researching it rather than just copying the answer.

Bk4eIAWWaa	The 1.8, right? WONDERFUL for portraits and inexpensive to boot. Love mine, in fact I'm on my way out with mine tonight to shoot some political candidate portraits!<br>  <br>  As for the post above 105mm was ideal on 35mm cameras. With the crop factor involved in your camera 50mm is great|`|4WxJvc5Raa	80mm is better for portrait work (you can throw backgrounds out of focus).<br>  <br>  If it's a Canon 50mm, it will be a  good quality lens, in fact practically all 50mm are generally excellent.|`|a1dkmpjtaa	For portrait work a 50mm lens would do for full length portraits, but if you are going to work any nearer than that you must go for something longer otherwise you will get distortions. Many photographers consider the 105mm as best portrait lens because, when doing a close up of the face the camera photographs it very much as the human eye sees it. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would try to cover all bases by opting  for a quality zoom lens that will give a variety of options all in one lens. It may appear an expensive option, but you won't need to go and buy another lens for other types of shots. Any decent photography book goes into the various types of lens and their uses in a couple og pages or so. It would be well worth reading  (loads of titles in libraries) before you go out and buy.|`|kpPt1c7uaa	Yes, <br>  EF 50mm f/1.2L USM<br>  EF 50mm f/1.4 USM  or<br>  EF 50mm f/1.8 II <br>  <br>  but you can have two lenses in one, for example, an 50mm plus wide angle:<br>  <br>  EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM <br>  or<br>  EF-S<br>  18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS<br>  <br>  or pay attention on canon zoom lenses:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ProductCatIndexAct&fcategoryid=111" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a><br>  <br>  obs:Sigma and Tamrom are cheaper lenses .|`|JxZOM91maa	50mm f/1.8 i'm assuming? it will be good for portraits. however, the reason it's so cheap is because it's not made as sturdily as the 50mm f/1.4. so depending on how good you are at taking care of your stuff, it could be great or a waste. haha.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	Buy it.

AA10276642	Hopefully you are tall and slim and you've already achieved at least the intermediate level in ballet, tap and jazz and are well on your way towards the advanced level in each by taking at least 15 hours of dance per week. If so, you should continue with intensive training and then attend an audition for the Rockettes after you turn 18 and see if you can beat out the scores of other dancers who are competing for each spot.|`|GXnfJfU8aa	Just train really hard at dance. Then pray you get lucky.
O7w6XGqPaa	The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, prevented Congress from banning the importation of slaves until 1808. On January 1, 1808, Congress banned further imports. Any new slaves would have to be descendants of ones currently in the United States. However, the internal American slave trade and the involvement in the international slave trade or the outfitting of ships for that trade by U.S. citizens were not banned. Though there were certainly violations of this law, slavery in America became, more or less, self-sustaining.

And he'll be like "what's updog?" and you're like "not much...but if you aren't either, I'd love to take you to the dance." How's that for inspiration. Haha anyways hope this helps!!! :)
ceBTTCPwaa	Morrie struggles with his disease, ALS, while he anticipates his impending death. Soon Morrie accepts his approaching death when he shares a Buddhist philosophy where every day one must acknowledge the prospect of this being their last day on earth. In a more literal sense, one can only know how to live if they know how to die.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesdays_with_Morrie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesdays_wi...</a><br>  <br>  Throughout every stage of heaven, one concept is consistently drawn on: all lives are connected to each other, directly or indirectly, and whether we realize it or not. The infinite combination of events that replicates from person to person, originating from the slightest nuance of one’s actions, has a profound effect on the fabric of life. In Eddie’s final stage in heaven, he is finally able to grasp this concept, when he realizes how meaningful his seemingly meaningless life was. He is able to see all the people throughout his life whom he had kept safe by maintaining the rides at Ruby Pier. In life, he had no way to comprehend how many people he saved, just as most fail to realize their profound effect on others. As such, we should not view ourselves as individuals, but as part of the whole. Realizing this philosophy returns us to the idea that lives do not truly begin or end, but perpetuate endlessly.<br>  <br>  Not only do all lives affect one another in this tangible way, but ideas and emotions are transmitted continuously as well. For example, when Eddie is in his second stage of heaven, the captain explains to him the concept of sacrifice being transferred to another instead of lost entirely. Also, when he meets Marguerite in heaven, she explains to him that true love is never lost with death, but instead it simply takes a new form – memory – which lives eternally.<br>  <br>  Life is cyclical. Mitch Albom immediately illustrates this by titling the first chapter “The End,” signifying that for every beginning there is an end, and for every end there is a beginning. Ironically, Eddie dies on his birthday. Even in the afterlife this cycle continues. Eddie begins heaven as a bewildered soul traveling to five different stages, but at the end he himself is the first stage of heaven for a little girl. Albom explores the essences of life and death, specifically the inextricable relationship between the two. He explores the idea that there is more to a life than simply living. We live on even after our bodies perish through the effects our lives had on others. As such, life is infinite, regardless of whether or not one believes in the afterlife. To demonstrate this, the book is laid out in repetitive chapter succession: “The nth Person Eddie Meets in Heaven,” “Today is Eddie’s Birthday,” and “The nth Lesson.” This further drives home the fact that life and death are intertwined, and to understand either we must understand both.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_People_You_Meet_in_Heaven" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Pe...</a>|`|5q24OD8Kaa	i read the Five people you meet in heaven but i seriously can't think of a way to make a visual out of those themes. srry

8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	Jim and Lukkkee are correct. The Romans did visit Ireland, but didn't think it worthwhile to stick around. There wasn't anything there they were interested in, so it wasn't worth the trouble. Contrary to popular belief, the Romans didn't run around conquering places simply because they could.|`|AA12225723	I would think they probably explored Ireland a little bit but never made any permanent settlements, sort of like the Vikings did America, they came but never stayed.  Maybe the Irish Sea defeated them.  They never did lay claim to all of England either, they built a wall across the middle of the country to keep the Scots out and the Romans stayed in the south of England.  Hey, recognize me.

Saint Patrick was in fact a Roman [Romano-British] and had been sent by His Holiness the Pope [Pontiff] from Rome to Ireland to bring the message of Jesus Christ to the people there.<br>  <br>  So yes, the Romans did arrive in Ireland, eventually.<br>  <br>  HISTORY says the Romans of the classical period did not arrive in Ireland, but, there's always someone with an argument.  Including myself and I say that if the Romans had gone to Ireland and were then destroyed/kicked out, they would have made no mention of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let us suppose that a detachment of Roman soldiers did reach Ireland by ship and come ashore.  This ship of fools is then slaughtered by the Irish Celts.  The Romans learnt their lesson in Germany and made no mention of their defeats there, thus, let us suppose they had arrived in Ireland and were defeated, they would simply make no mention of it - it never happened.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba14/BA14FEAT.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba14/BA14FE...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/9605/newsbriefs/ireland.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.archaeology.org/9605/newsbrie...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/pir/hibernia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/pir/hiberni...</a><br>  <br>  Keep digging, eventually someone will find something, even an old Roman Army sandal will do.|`|MtO5BXOBaa	i think they came to dublin saw it was cold and not very developed so they left<br>  imagine how different we would be if they had of stayed|`|8Raw4M1naa	Well, the farther out from the center of Rome you got, the looser the control became. By the time you got to places like Ireland, the Roman control was... more on paper than anything.

While the Romans overran the Brythonic tribes to the east, they were in turn overrun by the Germanic tribes (Angles and Saxons), they seldom penetrated the other Pictish and (more ferocious) Goidelic speaking tribes.

The "universe" as we know it with planets and all that seems to have begun with the big bang. But there was material in a huge mass that blew up. That material was in "existence."<br>  <br>  There can never have been a time when existence did not exist, because that would require "nothingness," and if "nothingness" existed, it would be "somethingness." Either way, there would be existence because "nothingness," being required to be "somethingness" if you don't want the problem of that pesky contradiction, means existence has always existed and always will. It cannot have an end, because once again you would have "nothingness," and "nothingness" cannot exist.|`|lcGriJXiaa	First of all, not everything begins . . . God has no beginning and no end.

If a fish could think, he would probably find it impossible to comprehend this `other world` - in another dimension.<br>  <br>  Dreams point to the same conundrum.

nJ0MRH24aa	1) The Bill of Rights is a set of limitations on the power of government whose only enforcement depends on the same government whose power it is trying to limit. This gives the government the power to effectively nullify it in part or whole on a whim by simply not enforcing it, or outright ignoring it.<br>  <br>  2) The Bill of Rights is often ignored by the US government. The Adams administration passed the Alien and Sedition Acts which nullified freedom of the press. Other administrations have had a field day on ignoring the Bill of Rights. The recent Bush Administration has limited freedom of assembly with its ham handed treatment of anti war protesters, limited freedom of religion with its government funding of religious initiatives (charities) and assumption of a soul justifying its antiabortion stance, its anti stem cell research, and its harassment of Muslims, conducted warrantless wire taps of every phone in the USA, removed habeus corpus with the "Patriot" Act, and conducted torture on prisoners who were never convicted of any crime.<br>  <br>  The Bill of Rights make nice philosophy, but the enforcement has been a problem.

Have you had the action professionally setup? A lot of times Guitars come from the manufacture setup incorrectly or not at all. Take it to a guitar tech and have it setup. Costs about $20 to $30 to have this done. Also look into restringing your guitar with lighter strings. <br>  <br>  If you have both the action setup correctly and lighter stings that will be as easy as it's going to play. If you still don't like it start shopping around as there are thousands of guitars made.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	acoustic are always harder than electric in that sense, but they help develop your calluses faster and make your fingers stronger so i always train my student on them anyways.|`|PmiZUblCaa	Yup. Acoustic strings are harder. But that can be a good thing. It's mentioned that they can help develop calluses faster, and can make your fingers and wrists alot stronger. <br>  <br>  If you are still having trouble, next time you restring the guitar, put a lighter pair on the guitar. It's a major difference. I use the Elixir Nanoweb Extra Lights on mine. I have small hands, so it's nearly impossible for me to able to do barre chords correctly other wise.

It will take concerted business investment in yourself as a VO artist to even gain traction and could easily be a few years before such focused efforts pay off. <br>  <br>  The main union that covers VO artist is the American Federation of Radio and Television Artist (AFTRA).

jrzHqstjaa	Most complete and perfect extant collection of Babylonian laws, developed during the reign (c. 1792–50 BC) of Hammurabi.<br>  <br>  It consists of 282 of his legal decisions, collected toward the end of his reign and inscribed on a diorite stela set up in the temple of Marduk. The text is in the Akkadian language. Despite a few references to family solidarity, trial by ordeal, and the lex talionis (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth), it represents an advance over tribal custom in that it recognizes no blood feud, private retribution, or marriage by capture. The principal portion of the code is preserved in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

It's mayan for "I am another you". I think we are all interconnected with a devine intelligence/awareness. The only reason we think and act differently is because of the differnet inputs we have recieved throughout our lives. God is not out there. God is love... dig deep down inside yourself and there you will find him... I have always been there, I just didn't know I was there because of this ego that had been programmed into me since birth had always blinded myself from who I really was through the use of this materialistic illusion we live in. We may appear as some animal seperate from all these other humans but in reality we are all the same. Our body is just the vehicle inwhich we use to roam about this physical three dimensional plane of existence. <br>  Don't think about the negative, don't think about the past and don't pull on the future... Just let it be. Be here now. I recommend reading the book "be here now" by Ram Dass, it's an excellent book on this and its really short too! Don't look for how you differ in relation to things and people, instead look at everyone as another representation of your self expressing itself in a different manner, actually believe and see yourself in everyone else. Look for the good in everything and this is what you will become. Remember be here now!

4ilM2hCwaa	In August 1750, on a journey back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a carriage accident between The Hague and Haarlem in the Netherlands. In 1751 his eyesight started to fail in one eye. The cause was unknown and progressed into his other eye as well. He died some eight years later, in 1759, in London, his last attended performance being his own Messiah. More than three thousand mourners attended his funeral, which was given full state honours, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>  <br>  So I'd say general ill health combined with old age.

Laziness comes just after, very close.|`|v0Iuceg3aa	Fear, because it is a natural human behavior that everyone who is born under normal circumstances has. Laziness is an acquired trait that someone gets when they keep receiving their wants and needs and feel like they don't need to work to get what they want or they just plain don't want to work because they know they will survive. Even someone who faces death may be lazy because they acquired that trait and don't have enough willpower to go back.

cwzH7DVvaa	I'm sorry, but this is terrible writing. You have no grasp of grammar, are continually changing tenses, and appear not to know how to use a spellchecker. This is definitely the right way to annoy me, because it's a common courtesy to check your work for spelling mistakes before posting it online.  Furthermore, you randomly lapse into the character's chains of thoughts when you should be focusing on narrating consistently. This makes it seem extremely unprofessional and like somebody with an attention deficit disorder has written it.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, this is unbelievably shallow. I don't care about the main character at all, you've given us no room for empathising with her or anything; she seems superficial and empty, despite her sad life, because of the way you've written her. You haven't shown the reader the plot, you've told us the plot (I mean about the main character's history), and that's the worst mistake a writer can make. Remember, show, don't tell. Look it up. And the worst bit was...'doc appt.' DOCT APT!? What the hell? You're writing a story here, that means you definitely can't put abbreviations in, you actually have to write full words out, capishe.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be honest, but I'm not going to tell you something is fantastic when it isn't.
5IB5t80jaa	Which immigrants in particular are you speaking about?  This country is made up of immigrants beginning from the 1600's, some as early as the 1500's depending where you are speaking about.  There was a large influx during the 1800's due to the famine in Ireland and the Scottish clearances, but many other countries also had large numbers relocating due to many reasons.

JKml2p9gaa	first of all when using watercolors, you need to use good paper..That will determine alot about the application.  You'll need a good brush as well (camel hair) You can purchase those in a art store, or Michaels craft store even AC moore.  When you begin to use the water colors you should probably start with a "grid" What I mean is on the watercolor paper you buy, make a grid of squares over the entire paper. Next, depending on what type of watercolors you are using the cake type or liquid, place a bit of water on the colors.  You will have to experiment with this first..watercolor is tricky, if you don't watch the painting becomes muddy. Dip the brush in clear water. saturate it first.  Then dip the brush in the color the tip area first. Next you are going to create a shaded look on one of the sqaure grids.  Start in the upper cornor and gently sweep the brush back and forth. Do that on each grid to get the feel of it. Remember, the whole paper does not need to be covered. You can leave a some of the paper.  If you like how it works then you can experiment and eventually for the finished look use a fine brush for details.  <br>  Bottom line just have fun with it.|`|cxiPvqtsaa	not suitable to teach u on this small box.. maybe another day..|`|hIqCpiXKaa	I use <a href="https://store.opusframing.com/sagro/storefront/store.php?mode=browsecategory&category=273." rel="nofollow">https://store.opusframing.com/sagro/stor...</a> I like the quality and the way it lays down mostly. I like it, I do it for me though. I am by no means doing it for anyone else. I am a strong believer that you should test them all and see what best fits you. What you like better. I have a thing for using alcohol in my watercolor(not like liquor). It creates a tie die effect I like.<br>  EDIT: I dont think you should "be taught". Its something fun to experiement with, and see how it works. Cool tricks are online if you want some special technique.|`|OntI5u5kaa	Well, first off, do you remember those paints you used in Kindergarten? They were in a long rectangular-shaped container with oval-shaped paints inside. It doesn't matter what brand of watercolors you buy, even if they're from a dollar store. They usually all work the same. And, yes, you can use pen & ink. My advice is: put the watercolor down FIRST and let it dry. After that put the ink on your artwork. Otherwise, if you do the ink first, the picture is more likely to smear when you add the watercolor. I also think that you can buy special Watercolor paper at WalMart, or maybe even at another dollar store. You can use regular computer paper, but I wouldn't recommend it. Usually watercolor paper has a bumpy texture.|`|FJjBHjcWaa	Supplies:<br>  Watercolor Paper<br>  Watercolor<br>  Watercolor Pencils<br>  Water<br>  Palette
HUDjXVOyaa	Art Therapy is an area of psychology and mental health/healing that may be of interest to you. There is large demand for Art Therapists in America and there is definitely good money.<br>  <br>  Photo Journalism is another interesting career that deals with people and issues. Photo Journalists also do a lot of travel, some times even around the world. <br>  <br>  Are you familiar with World Vision? Perhaps you can work as photographer and travel to remote parts of Africa. You could experience first hand the psychological problems caused by starvation and or aids. Perhaps it would give you the opportunity to learn about unique tribal medicines. I imagine that part of the world is basically untouched, but then again World Vision is bringing their modern influence too. On there TV commercials they mention that if you sponsor a child, they will send you a photograph of the child you have sponsored. I was thinking that perhaps it would be a really interesting job that kinda deals with a lot of problems and issues.<br>  <br>  I wish I had the eduction and experience you do. I find your question very inspiring.|`|HVVyfR8paa	Go to college and study what interests you.  Do as well as you can and hopefully you'll have a better idea after a couple of years but please, don't settle for a BA.  You really should pursue a graduate degree....especially if you want to make decent money.<br>  A BA is a dime a dozen if it's not from a top University.  Stay in school as long as you can.  You'll be glad you did.
ky3B42f6aa	When they invaded England, which was most likely done in waves, the Roman influence was probably already disappearing.  How much "impact" the Anglo-Saxons had on Romano-British settlements is still being debated.<br>  <br>  See   <a href="http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artgue/guestcapps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artgu...</a>|`|G7W1ynD7aa	Nah they just chilled and invaded and sht no problem.
eybHcHz9aa	I know mosaics were popular during the (300 year) Roman occupation. Some "native" households paid for them in their homes, but they were often of local gods,and of poorer quality.<br>  The Anglo-Saxons came after the Romans left, and tended to ignore Roman influence, letting their buildings fall into, well, into archeology instead! <br>  <br>  I can only parrot a tour guide I heard this summer at the Roman Fort where I work (I'm not a roman expert), so if it helps, I'd look up mosaics as a starter.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Most of the people were in fact Romano-British.  The actual number of Saxons [Anglo-Saxons] was really quite small, usually one or two warriors per village.<br>  <br>  Finding anything Saxon seems almost impossible and what mostly gets dug up is either Celtic or Roman or whatever.<br>  <br>  Best suggestion is you get in touch with Time Team C4 - they know everything about the period.<br>  <br>  Saxon cemetary - but why all the Roman pottery?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnkUex1A1CE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnkUex1A1...</a><br>  <br>  you can click right for more. . . .<br>  <br>  In modern thinking what many scholars now think is that most Europeans are of Celtic origin.

He wanted to look like Paul Newman and he liked to take walks alone but he also liked to be with his friends. He was a greaser.|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	Well, didn't he like being a greaser? Didn't he like hanging out with Johnny and the rest of them? Didn't he like to be "tuff" and fight like the guys?

VkfwCBfmaa	Everyone has a talent or gift! Most people, however, only remember the obvious outward talents such as sports or music. If you look carefully, you will find your gift. Here are some examples to get you started.<br>  <br>  -the gift of caring for others<br>  -the gift of being able to cry<br>  -the gift of knowing what to say<br>  -the gift of being a good listener<br>  -the gift of being able to communicate well<br>  -the gift of courage to do what is right<br>  -the gift of standing up to peer pressure<br>  -the gift of making friends<br>  -the gift of a good sense of humor|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	What do you like to do? Guitar? Singing? Drawing? Basketball? Try improving something you like to do by getting lessons, asking someone else to help you or just plain practicing. You do have a talent somewhere, you just need to find it!! <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|f279e76fb473e663c0561d5e2597318baa	I no it's totally cliche' but everyone has a talent. If you dont know it its probably because your only thinking of obvious things e.g singing, acting. Try thinking of less obvious things e.g. can you cook well, when you were at school did you excel in a certain lesson. Hell, your talent might be sex! Look hard and/or try new things and you'll find your talent. Good luck!|`|jN0gSAYsaa	Hell, I'm only 16 and I don't have the obvious talent that a large majority of my class mates have. I'm not a scientist, or a mathematician, and I can't sing on tune and can't carry an accent. <br>  But I can listen. I can give advice, be quiet, take care of others, see both arguments and do lots of other things that, although they don't get you noticed, are talents. <br>  I bet you enjoy something? Writing or studying another language? Talent, just like anything else, needs to be nurtured and cared for. Practise is needed, even for a talent or a gift. <br>  So you don't need to be born with a natural talent that gets you noticed by others to not be talented. You tend to find that it's those who don't have obvious talents that are the most talented ones.|`|GBdeRKuAaa	First Of All Can I ask Youuu were Youuur From <br>  And Youuu Will have a tellent Youuu just Might not think so Just now<br>  But trust me You will have a used To think my life is going to suck when i am older but now am doin actin classes ect I know am going to be an actor when i am older if i want it or anyone wants somethin so bad they can do it <br>  Pleaseee reply|`|f8bba879d02b930f55f403333784e649aa	Find something you do like to do, and forget about having a gift.
MXMMlSJPaa	Agree for me what's matter most  is the inner beauty. that is most important and no one will can take away|`|jYkIyGNAaa	I definately agree...Beauty is just the outside of someone and really doesn't express who they are...To be someyou you need a brain and you have to be able to think so ur right.... what good is beauty if you don't have a brain to go with it..I think i would chose brains over beauty anyday but thats just me...Like they say"Don't judge a book by it's cover"|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Yes, I do. I have actually written a song about how our world has become about looks instead of who we are. No one is concerned about who they are or how they think, all they care about is what others see when the look at them. People need to learn to become comfortable with themselves.

shVgCizBaa	Why did parliment win the english civil war?The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651------------------------------------... Battle of Worcester took place on 3 September 1651 at Worcester, England and was the final battle of the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell and the Parliamentarians defeated the Royalist, predominantly Scottish, forces of King Charles II. The 16,000 Royalist forces were overwhelmed by the 28,000 strong "New Model Army" of Cromwell.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Worcester" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_W...</a> The English Civil War (1642–51) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first (1642–46) and second (1648–49) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649–51) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.<br>  <br>  The Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son, Charles II, and replacement of English monarchy with first, the Commonwealth of England (1649–53), and then with a Protectorate (1653–59), under Oliver Cromwell's personal rule. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although this concept was established only with the Glorious Revolution later in the century.

Take a new born baby, their brain is not developed yet but they are beautiful.  Innocence can be very attractive too.  It is the one that does have a brain but does not know how to use it intelligently.  It is the person that is so self loving that cannot open their heart to others that is empty. <br>  The old saying that beauty lies underneath or is in the eyes of the beholder is basically true,  what may not be beautiful to you may be beautiful to someone else.  That's what makes us all different.|`|gxw7vAJQaa	beauty I see it as more of the soul than the brain.<br>  <br>  I can imagine someone really.. absent minded and with an empty brain as you put it, but with a beautiful and loving soul that i would see that person as beauty.<br>  <br>  This could also be turned around too.|`|RhTmYlDxaa	A woman can be aesthetically beautiful.<br>  <br>  Preference my friend.<br>  <br>  Subjective.<br>  <br>  blah blah|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Yeah.

qDYzdz5daa	No, Epic Fail on your part.<br>  <br>  For one, "talent" and "physical ability" aren't related.  Talent, in this sense, is far more than JUST the physical ability.  It is drive and determination perserverance and "grit," as it were.<br>  <br>  That kind of "talent" is what gets you BEYOND the handicap, and having so much of it that you go from being handicapped to being one of the greatest ever, is a frickin' HUGE amount of ability.|`|lWEWhyTtaa	No, it doesn't<br>  Obviously, they were talented, whether it was actually in athletics or perseverence [which in itself is indeed a talent]|`|bLpNuvPiaa	If you've already asked the question, why are you asking it again?

MAqmVE7qaa	It's nice to have a good guitar, one that expresses your character, something you can really channel yourself through, and part of that is the tonal characteristics produced by the wood, and construction. <br>  <br>  However, at high gain or high volume settings, much of these characteristics are less pronounced. A really crappy guitar can sound great at high volumes, especially if you modify the pickups. The stock pickups and a good amp will produce a "unique" sound, but your not going to get the cut or attack or crunch that your looking for.<br>  <br>  What really matters at high volume is attack, sustain, and CLARITY. It's nice to have a gate to help produce clarity and cut out all the extra noise that doesn't quite reach the threshold. <br>  <br>  There are some amps that give you the breath that really quench your thirst. Plug that Epiphone into a Marshall JCM 800, or a ENGL Powerball 100.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Malcolm X was raised in Michigan, where the family house was burned by the Ku Klux Klan; his father was later murdered and his mother was institutionalized. He moved to Boston, drifted into petty crime, and was sent to prison for burglary in 1946. He converted to the Black Muslim faith (Nation of Islam) the same year. On his release in 1952, he changed his last name to X to signify his rejection of his “slave name.” Soon after meeting the Nation of Islam's leader, Elijah Muhammad, he became the sect's most effective speaker and organizer. He spoke with bitter eloquence against white exploitation of blacks and derided the civil rights movement and integration, calling instead for black separatism, black pride, and the use of violence for self-protection. Differences with Elijah Muhammad prompted Malcolm to leave the Nation of Islam in 1964. A pilgrimage to Mecca led him to acknowledge the possibility of world brotherhood and to convert to orthodox Islam. Rival Black Muslims made threats against his life, and he was shot to death at a rally in a Harlem ballroom. His celebrated autobiography (1965) was written by Alex Haley on the basis of numerous interviews conducted shortly before Malcolm's death.<br>   <br>  MLK<br>  <br>  The son and grandson of Baptist preachers, King became an adherent of nonviolence while in college. Ordained a Baptist minister himself in 1954, he became pastor of a church in Montgomery, Ala.; the following year he received a doctorate from Boston University. He was selected to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, whose boycott efforts eventually ended the city's policies of racial segregation on public transportation. In 1957 he formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and began lecturing nationwide, urging active nonviolence to achieve civil rights for African Americans. In 1960 he returned to Atlanta to become copastor with his father of Ebenezer Baptist Church. He was arrested and jailed for protesting segregation at a lunch counter; the case drew national attention, and presidential candidate John F. Kennedy interceded to obtain his release. In 1963 King helped organize the March on Washington, an assembly of more than 200,000 protestors at which he made his famous “I have a dream” speech. The march influenced the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and King was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for Peace. In 1965 he was criticized from within the civil-rights movement for yielding to state troopers at a march in Selma, Ala., and for failing in the effort to change Chicago's housing segregation policies. Thereafter he broadened his advocacy, addressing the plight of the poor of all races and opposing the Vietnam War. In 1968 he went to Memphis, Tenn., to support a strike by sanitation workers; there on April 4, he was assassinated by James Earl Ray. A U.S. national holiday is celebrated in King's honour on the third Monday in January.

Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means. A disciplinary transfer has displaced him from his native Manhattan into the secluded mountains of northern Pennsylvania. His fears of boredom are quickly replaced by a struggle for survival. When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.|`|fs1P0h7laa	I love Butter Milk Hill.... Thats the first book that popped into mind

But what is very likely in the next 25-50 years is practical immortality.  Once science has figured out the mechanism of how cancer cells multiple indefinitely and apply that in a controlled way to normal cells, then the human body can be "renewed" (or rejuvenated, if you will) successively -- cell by cell -- maybe for hundreds and hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  Of course, like everything else, this at first will undoubtedly be very expensive, so only the rich will get to live forever.  Not very fair, perhaps, but then again, the poor have never had a fair deal on this earth.

NmvaEmKBaa	That's a great idea, but be aware that you will have to talk about Jesus in a historical manner, who he really was and what he preached.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

It might be interesting if you could put a new spin on this, perhaps looking at the political motivations of the period or try and read behind the story to see if you can put a new spin on it.

Life spans have a great deal to do with energy.  The more energy you use up (at a time) the sooner you reach that limit.  Being healthy as humans is very important.

iNXqiDIYaa	For years a "lost" collector's item, here is the second novel from a brilliant young author testing her literary muscle, and it's bursting at the seams with Rita Mae Brown's trademark cast of characters and crackling quips. Written immediately after her classic Rubyfruit Jungle, In Her Day takes a loving swipe at the charged political atmosphere of Greenwich Village in the early seventies. Elegant art history professor Carole Hanratty insists brains transcend lust--until she crashes into Ilse, a revolutionary feminist flush with the arrogance of youth. Blazing with rhetoric, their romance is a sexual and ideological inferno. Ilse campaigns to get Carole to join The Movement, but forty-four-year-old Carole and her zany peers have twenty years of fight behind them and are wary of causes bogged down in talk. After all, says Carole's best friend, the real reason for a revolution is so the good things in life circulate. Her idea of subversion is hiring a Rolls-Royce to go to McDonald's. In Her Day, with its infectious merriment and serious underpinnings, proves that if politics is the great divider, humor is the

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|Nd6uItCDaa	I'm 14 years old, here's a brief list of the best books I enjoyed:<br>  <br>  Airhead by Meg Cabot (Novel)<br>  Genre: Teen Fiction <br>  Rating: 10/10<br>  Background: Centered around a model and a tomboy can't say anymore without spoiling it.<br>  <br>  The Mediator by Meg Cabot (Series of 6 books: Shadowland, Ninth Key, Reunion, Darkest Hour, Haunted, Twilight.)<br>  Genre: Paranormal/Romance<br>  Rating: 8/10<br>  Background: About a young girl who has extra-ordinary powers and meets an interesting guy in her new house...<br>  <br>  The Host by Stephanie Meyer (Novel)<br>  Genre: Sci-fi/Romance<br>  Rating: 8/10<br>  Background: Aliens taken over the earth, what happens when the human mel is still partially in control of her body...(can't explain well but it's good)<br>  <br>  Twilight by Stephanie Meyer (Saga of 4 books: Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn)<br>  Genre: Horror/Romance<br>  Rating: 9/10<br>  Background: About a girl who falls in love with a vampire<br>  <br>  Inheritance by Christopher Paolini (Cycle of 4 books, 4th yet to be published: Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr)<br>  Genre: Fantasy/Adventure<br>  Rating: 10/10<br>  Background: About a young dragon rider and his quest...<br>  <br>  Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan (Series: Lightning Thief, Sea of Monsters, Titan's Curse, Battle of the Labyrinth)<br>  Genre: Mythological/Fantasy<br>  Rating: 10/10<br>  Background: About an extra-ordinary young demi-god and his quests...(Quite Funny)<br>  <br>  House of Night by P.C Cast + Kristin Cast (Series: Marked, Betrayed, Chosen, Untamed)<br>  Genre: Fantasy/paranormal<br>  Rating: 10/10<br>  Background: About a girl who is marked(turned into a vampire) with more than normal powers....<br>  <br>  Vampire Beach by Alex Duval (Series: Bloodlust, Initiation, Ritual, Legacy, High Stakes, Hunted) <br>  Genre: Fantasy/paranormal<br>  Rating: 7/10<br>  Background: About a guy who moves house to find something different about the popular kids...<br>  <br>  Where Rainbows End by Ceceila Ahern (Novel)<br>  Genre: Romantic Comedy<br>  Rating: 7/10<br>  Background: A tale about two friends...<br>  <br>  David Rain by Chris D'Lacey (Series: The Fire Within, Icefire, Fire Star, The Fire Eternal) <br>  Genre: Fantasy<br>  Rating: 7/10<br>  Background: About a lodger and dragons...<br>  <br>  Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead (Series: Vampire Academy, Frost Bite, Shadow Kiss) <br>  Genre: Fantasy/Paranormal - not horror!<br>  Rating: 8/10<br>  Background: About a girl trying to defend her best friend who just happens to be a princess...|`|kiDRiJmVaa	A desperate cry by carlos cuactemoc|`|HmLA6pCHaa	The Gemma Doyle Trilogy<br>  Uglies<br>  Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac<br>  The Color of Water<br>  What Happened to Lani Garver?<br>  Speak<br>  <br>  Happy reading!  ;D|`|fs1P0h7laa	I Loved buttermilk Hill, And I guess Twilight is good but Idk...

I think so when we come to know that individuality is successful only to the extent that it supports the whole.  Only in the smallest sense are we, each one of us, little islands defending our territory. In the authentic grown-up sense, we understand how interdependent we actually are.  That understanding is uncommon.  However, it can actually be scientifically proved and logically argued - in a practically useful way - that no individual persons actually exist.  So then, what is left to struggle is simply one aspect of existence against another aspect of the same phenomena of existence.  That phenomena includes ego.  Do you ask if it is innate?  I do think that this delusional struggle is the result of fearing what we actually are - as completely interdependent and exactly not other than each other in the most remarkable way...as life itself.  Ego as the individual, just will not let go.  Until........it actually does.   When that rare thing happens, there are just no more concepts to fight over.  Until then, self interest rules in a never ending cycle of fear and suffering.  The best any one "individual" can do is see through a lifetime of conditioning.  It can catch on, though it will take some time.

In order to feed the English therefore they exported food from Ireland to England. English landlords evicted tenants from their land because they couldn't pay any rent.

I guess you should look to the horn that you and your friends think sounds the best with you playing it.<br>    I guess the other thing is what's wrong with the Regency?  Find a horn that has what the Regency doesn't.

KHSOVxViaa	It depends what you mean by civilisation, but most likely yes.<br>  <br>  The region of Germany has been inhabited since ancient times, but due to a lack of native writing system, they only exist in the historical record from the time of the Romans.<br>  <br>  Archaeological evidence has revealed a presence since the bronze age, and fairly sophisticated settlements since the iron age, though not on the scale of Mediterranean cities.<br>  <br>  Practical and ornamental goods were traded, extensive villages were built.  It is likely that part of the area was earlier occupied by Celtic-speaking tribes, such as at Hallstatt, with the Germanic peoples migrating southwards in the first millenium BC.  By the time of the Roman Empire, 'Germania' was inhabited by a patchwork of Germanic tribes.

We humans have been asking it since the day the door of Eden kicked us in the butt.  Here's how I've dealt with it.<br>  <br>  Being "happy" is a choice I make.  It has nothing to do with my circumstances.  I choose to accept (own) the truth about myself and my circumstances as they are.  I can feel happy (or contented, or satisfied) in spite of all evidence that I OUGHT to feel happy because I choose to respond to my life in a constructive and positive manner.<br>  <br>  Being "satisfied" is directly connected to having realistic expectations.  If I'm dissatisfied I need to re-evaluate my expectations and see where they need adjusting.  Either my expectations need to be adjusted to my circumstances or my circumstances need to be adjusted to my expectations.  If I can't to diddly squat about my circumstances, then I still have control over my expectations. <br>  <br>  However...even in the most deplorable circumstances I can still choose to 1)love, 2) serve others, 3) be generous, 4) show compassion.  And doing those things will shine a new light on my drooping expectations and increase my satisfaction!  <br>  <br>  Sometimes we discern we are missing an objective standard in our lives.  I mean, why do anything for anyone but myself?  Why accept the brokenness of life around me?  Why bother with anything?  My experience has taught me the only dependable, immutable standard for life is a sovereign, just and gracious God.  (And I didn't use those adjectives at random, they each have an essential role in my portrait of God).  The only reason to keep wrestling with the dynamism of a confusing world is because Someone has a plan bigger than I can see and I'm somehow part of it.<br>  <br>  Keep looking, friend.  Keep asking questions.  Keep on keepin' on.  It will become clear to you.  Fight the good fight!|`|LgxVVDWraa	Please read this all,,<br>  I believe the path to happiness lies with doing what you feel happy.  You're right, when I was growing up my family told me,<br>  "you will go to high school, get straight A's, go to a prestigious university as something in the medical or political science field, then marry a rich educated man and have children."<br>  <br>  I remember laying on my great aunt's bed who lived this example, and realized it was not for me.  I had to see the world, I had to be around people regardless of their income, I had to paint and do things with art.  <br>  <br>  There is a book that changed my life and made me realize so many thing, it is not one of those fancy self help books.  It is a book about a boy Santiago, where his father wants him to become a priest but instead of being a priest he becomes a shepherd.  It is a story, but it has changed the way I look and live my life. It's called "The Alchemist" by the Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho, I read it in 3 days despite being busy with school.<br>  <br>  If there is anything I can offer of help to you, it would be that book.  It is a world wide best seller and many claim that it has awaken them.. there are many books that claim that they will help you become happy, but they don't teach the same way.  <br>  <br>  I realized through books by Paulo that if a dead person were to have a chance to come back from the dead and live their life again, they would know that life is a waste until you do as your heart's content.<br>  <br>  Before I read this book, even though I am only 18, I was not the way most people in my school were.  I am rather strange basically, because instead of contemplating what to do with my friends for the next weekend, I would wonder which is the true religion, or which path should I take with my life?  What is the purpose of my life?  <br>  I would think of my life in cycles, instead of thinking what to do with myself just for college or what.<br>  <br>  Now I am more content, and I am just living as I please welcoming any pleasant surprises that come my way.  On my search for the true religion, I asked an old man who studied in Israel what the purpose of life was.  As you know, there are multiple religions that dwell and claim that city holy.  He spent his whole entire life trying to find the true religion, and found that one should not spend life worry so much, but instead find people they love to be around, and do what they love.<br>  Multiple elders I had talked to said this.<br>  <br>  So instead of worrying about what to do with my life, I simply did as I please and once the universe opened its paths for me, I tried my best to identify it and follow them.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	To become happy within your self you need to first realize that no one in this world is in it to make you happy.  You can only do this yourself.<br>  We all have hopes and dreams and they sometimes fall through and it is upsetting for us.  Things just don't happen when we want them so badly.  I personally gave up on the wishing and hoping and told myself that I was not going to get my dreams anyway and I was only hurting myself.  The day I gave up on the dreams is the day I became happy with myself. <br>  We don't always get what we want in this world of ours and we all tend to want so much, whether it would be out of a relationship, career, etc.<br>  If we all realize that we can strive for something but if it does not happen then so be it then we will be not disappointed when it does not happen. I think that is what upsets most of us.  Just live each day and wake up happy and try not to be disappointed when things do not turn out the way we want them to.

ceBTTCPwaa	Dee is the eldest if Maggie is the youngest as it says in Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  "Everyday Use" is a widely studied and frequently anthologized short story by Alice Walker. It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection, In Love and Trouble.<br>  <br>  The story is told in first person by the "Mama" (Mrs Johnson), a black woman living in the Deep South with one of her two daughters. The story humorously illustrates the differences between Mrs Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who still live traditionally in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee (or "Wangero", as she prefers to be called), who scorns her immediate roots in favor of a pretentious "native African" identity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_Use" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_Us...</a>

Chuck it.<br>  <br>  The road is many things to many people. To the hitchhiker and runaway it's a land of open spaces away from confinement and the hated home. To the homeless bum, it is home, and he knows all the tricks. To the tourist it is often a place from here to there a no man's land. To the trucker it's a meal ticket. For each of these people the signs and the lights, the pavement (smooth or rough) is different; what makes cars slow down helps the hitchhiker, inconveniences the trucker.<br>  <br>  And the road is a sign of American romance and freedom, as in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel m"On the Road," where Sal Paradise wants to be on the move, a symptom of American restlessness. Etc.
A6ylS5bJaa	Firstly, The Vampire Academy series is one of my favorite books of all time. There are currently three out, the fourth will be released this summer, and the fifth sometime after that. They are about three different species of vampires, two of which fight against the third, wvil species. The Moroi are elemental, living vampires, the dhampirs are human-moroi mixtures they are gaurdians for the Moroi, and the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires. This series is amazing, with romance and drama. <br>  The Mortal Instruments series, by a woman whose surname is, I believe, Funke, is about a girl named Clary, who is thrown into the world of demons and demon hunters when she sees some of them killing a demon in a nightclub. There are City of Bones, and City of Ashes, out now, and City of Glass isn't out yet, I don't think<br>  A little off the wall would be the Charlie Bones series by Jenny Nimmo- more and more keep coming out like crazy, but it's about kids with special abilities, some talented in music, art, and drama, some with abilities like telekinesis, talking to animals, talking to people in photographs, etc.<br>  In another genre, are Nineteen Minutes and The Tenth Circle, both written by Jodie Piccoult. In Nineteen Minutes, there is a school shooting, and you work backwards from that event until you get the Whole story. The Tenth Circle was turned into a Lifetime Movie, it is about a freshman girl getting raped and her story. <br>  I would also suggest anything written by Sarah Dessen. Someone Like You is my favorite, it is about a girl who's best friend is pregnant. Just Listen is alot like the Tenth Circle- it was also made into a lifetime movie, called, "How To Deal." It is very good. There are lalso Keeping the Moon [about a girl who lives with a relative over the summer while her famous mother, who is one of those diet book women, travels], Dreamland [about a girl in an abusive relationship], That Summer, and Lock and Key. <br>  The Au Pairs, written by Melissa de la Cruz, are about three girls, Eliza, who was a young socialite before her fathers money scandal het the papers, Jacqui, a beauty from Brazil, who initially takes the Au Pair position to find her summer love from the year earlier, and Mara, a normal girl, who work for the Perry family during their high school summers. I believe there are four books, but I cannot remember what they all are called. They really are amazing though. <br>  Here are some whose authors I don't know. <br>  Rewind [where at the beginning, chapter 20 or so, a boy hits his prom date, and you literally read backwards to get the whole truth,], Kissing Snowflakes [where a girl is skiing with her father, brother, and new stepmother, and falls in love], Blood and Chocolate [about a werwolf girl that falls in love with a human], Silver Kiss [about a vampire who falls in love with a human girl; though a little different from Twilight], Thirteen Reasons Why, [where a girl kills herself, them sends around seven cassette tapes. Each side of each tape tells a story, and each story is starred in by one person who contributed to her suicide. After you get the tapes you must pass them on to whoevers tape follows your, and then live with the knowledge for the rest of your life. I fthe chain is broken the tapes will be made public, so they all have to listen.]<br>  And then, of course, you have to read my book whenever I finish it/get it published. =]]<br>  <br>  I hope I Helped!|`|FrbHRB5Laa	a book with vampires is the house of night series. its good and has like 5 books so far.|`|ZNhOY24naa	Vampire Kisses is pretty good.

That means accept praise with a grain of salt. The way to become an actor (forget the famous, it is merely a bonus for the very successful and a very costly one at that.) is to act, in all the school, church and community plays you can do. There is not any chance of you becoming a teen actor unless you parents make it happen. That means at least one of them has to devote full time to promoting your career.

Improvisation - I'm assuming that's what this person meant - is making something up as you go along; in music, it's often based on a melodic theme. You can get great improvisation books, where you're given a main theme to play to a backing track on CD where certain chords are played, and then you improvise over the backing, based on the chords and the tune. Most people need help from teachers or someone when they start improvising, but I recommend it - it's really fun! Hope I helped :-D

CIkNuSZ8aa	I believe, though you may have to check my facts here, they began having children when they started having sex.|`|NYU37jfGaa	The age of marriage varied quite a lot.  Upper class girls were sometimes married off quite young, in their early teens, arranged marriages were quite common among the upper classes, though both young people were supposed to give their free consent to the union (the church was opposed to forced marriage).<br>  <br>  Among the lower classes, the age of marriage tended to be later, the twenties was more usual.  The common people usually chose their own marriage partners from among their peer group, but would generally not marry until they were in a position to set up home together, either by acquiring some land through gift or inheritance, or setting up in business.<br>  <br>  A woman could have children as soon as she were married. some brides were pregnant before the wedding, as a bethrothal (engagement) was considered legally as binding as marriage.|`|y999LLxdaa	The marriage age was 13-14 so kids came in soon after i assume|`|TVhmGspoaa	in Europe,  it typically depended on what class.

lmVDvmMCaa	You may be surprised. <br>  <br>  Bad news: The idea of a surname family crest is bogus.  Several closely related people of the same surname may have had different designs, and unrelated people with the same surname certainly would.  The marketing scam is simple: "Ignore the rules of heraldry, that heraldry is about inheritance, and buy one of my generic coats of arms!"  Well, the problem is that those generic arms were someone's arms, and unless you can show that you're in the direct male line, then they are not yours!<br>  <br>  Good news: Rumpf is a German name, and the Germans do not have a heraldic granting agency.  For hundred of years Germans have been assuming arms, even dirt farmers.  They don't look at coats of arms as marks of the upper class like we do!  So there is a good chance your direct ancestors had a coat of arms.  But you'll need more than a surname to find out.  You'll need the name of your immigrant Rumpf ancestor, and his male line, with places and dates.<br>  <br>  See the following: <br>  <a href="http://www.wappenbuch.com/A024.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wappenbuch.com/A024.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ahnenforschung-rumpf.de/1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahnenforschung-rumpf.de/1.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rumpf-ahnenforschung.de/wappen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rumpf-ahnenforschung.de/wappe...</a><br>  <br>  There are heraldry societies that can help you.

Unless you are Polish, you will not have a coat of arms at all unless you are the head (i.e. the senior living individual) of your family line. And even if you are the head of your family line, there is no guarantee that anyone in your family was ever important enough to have been granted a coat of arms. Most people weren't.|`|8sB8ASncaa	<a href="http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/rumpf-family-crest.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx...</a>|`|hvjWpq2naa	jessica, that is synthetic, a lie.

LLqTeW70aa	The pictures are not bad but they must tell the story better.<br>  I lack deep in some pictures for ex The future and Cloud Candy. Castle in the mist needs  to be more compressed and needs more work at photoshop.<br>   And you must dare to go closer or edit harder. Peptalk is a good example of that. The story is boy in front of the big water grabbing fathers hand while mother peptalks. Cut away the people around.  The story is in the middle.<br>  The ghetto is taken to far away and above. Imagine that you have taken the same pic from groundlevel.<br>  But some of the pictures are brilliant.<br>  I love the Lion. It has all the elements of catching a moment. And it rises questions. Is the dog angry or...? It also has a very comic touch.<br>  Also The fail attempt tells a good story but I would have moved a little bit closer and a bit more to the left.<br>  Conclusion. Not bad. But try to catch the moment, go closer and imagine try to see the pic from the future viewers eye already when taking the pic. And all work with editing the picture carefully pays off.<br>  Good Luck.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Your pretty good with a camera.|`|8ZBsR4Rpaa	love the castle one, where did you take that?|`|omyTegPOaa	wow very nice pics|`|ERr2Qxieaa	In the first few, you seem to have lots of background which in the case of the pictures isn't the greatest.

kIHpW7gVaa	First you need to make sure you relax your arm. Let it hang by your side while holding your cello with your knees, then bring your fingers into position with your upper arm horizontal. Make sure your fingers are on their tips and make sure you're not gripping the cello too tightly. Everything should be loose and relaxed. Try playing without your thumb on the neck of the cello for a while. It will get you used to loosening up.

You should almost be out of breath at the start.  I'd start "off-stage" (out of everyone's view) and run back and forth a couple of times, then come RUNNING in and start the delivery.  THAT will make the entire monologue exciting, and everyone will be listening.  (That's the whole key to a successful monologue!  If no one is paying attention, you lose.)<br>  <br>  Practice it that way too.  You almost don't need to get every word exact, as long as the emotion of excitement is there.<br>  <br>  When you get to the "sister" part you REALLY have to kick it up even more excited, like you're going to burst out of your skin!<br>  <br>  Use the chair to grip onto it when your excited, as though it's the only thing keeping you from floating.  (You're THAT excited.)<br>  ___________<br>  <br>  One summer I helped do casting for some independent movies, and the potential actors had to do a scene from the movie and also their own monologue on any topic as long as it was the character delivering it.  The ones that really got into it with passion were the best.  The ones that concentrated more on getting every word exact seemed phony.  If you practice this enough, you'll have it down.<br>  <br>  But like I said, get yourself almost out of breath before you start it, and everyone will be paying attention to your every single word.<br>  <br>  Do that and I guarantee you'll ace it!<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!

vQ8XPXsdaa	First of all, take a deep breath and relax! EVERYONE, even seasoned actors get nervous before an audition. It is perfectly natural and doesn't mean that you will necessarily be nervous onstage. <br>  <br>  The first step to a good audition is prepeartion. By being prepared your audition will not only go well but it will also boost your confidence. Do some research. If the audition requires dance make sure you dress properly. If you need sheet music make sure you have it ready. Practice your song, or audition lines before hand. Pack a bag with everything you need before hand. <br>  <br>  Remember that the directors/producers are on your side. They don't want you to mess up. In fact, they want you to do your best and have fun. If they are rude to you, don't take it personally. Thats life! Plus, if you are an actor you can't worry about what others say/think about you. Make sure to be friendly, and polite. Make sure you smile during the audition (unless you are supposed to act sad/mad). Don't make excuses for yourself either. Remember to always do your best!!<br>  <br>  Even if you flub up your audition or act nervous, try and stay calm and proffessional. Remember that all actors are nervous in auditions, you are certainly not the first. The directors will understand that. <br>  <br>  If you don't get a part, then try again. If you are determined and motivated, you will get it! You just have to keep trying. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Mig6O93Naa	Acting is playing an playing is fun, whenever you act be sure to have fun. An audition is just another chance to act and have fun. Be sure to be enthusiastic, energetic and positive at all times. Don't worry about making an error.  Directors expect people to make errors in tryouts. Break a leg!|`|VYFdo6zmaa	dressing isn't really important wear what you feel most comfortable in and just do your best.<br>  To relax just try not to over think things. try to remember you lines but if you stumble on words don't get discouraged or go back and retry the sentence, keep going. It's all right if you don't get it word for word. In fact most directors like it when they see you play with the script. Also when you are auditioning, say your name and information then turn around with your back facing the director give yourself a minute get into character, take a few deep breathes, when you feel you are ready to go turn around and start. You don't have to act to the director but for him. He's is you audience... but if eye contact makes you uncomfortable it's okay to let your eyes stray. <br>  If you are fully into your character then you...aren't yourself... so YOU have got nothing to lose.<br>  I think the most important thing to remember is to always be positive don't let little mistakes discourage you and don't panic. If you overthink you're more likely to stumble so just stay calm and cool and focus on your role for the audition. Pretend you are a regular ol' pro and you'll get treated like one.<br>  <br>  best of luck :)
draNVjbkaa	Getting monologues from plays are the best sources. <br>  <br>  Stay away from film/tv. The problem with TV/Film is you can sometimes unconsciously and unintentionally do an imitation because the original actor usually has set a high benchmark. And on the auditioner's side, they might have seen the Film/TV show and unintentionally compare you to the originator. If you feel that you have to choose a film/tv monologue, you better bring something DIFFERENT!<br>  <br>  So your best sources are plays, literature, or other creative mediums. One of my friends has as one of his dramatic monologues, Tony Stark (Iron Man) in the Marvel Comic story arc about the controversy and split between Superheroes registering with the government and not registering. Stark's monologue is awesome and open to so many interpretations. Compared to Film/TV, plays, literature, and other sources just seem to allow more open interpretation in my and many other's experiences|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Bad idea.  The director is going to want to guide you into his vision of the piece.  You may, in learning that particular monologue, take a direction which he doesn't like.  It would probably be better to come with a separate audition piece AND apply for the cold read.|`|Mig6O93Naa	No, it should make no difference if the sign up into is true.
blmRX9bwaa	It is likely that the empires of the Hellenistic Kings would have continued, and Greece may have gained more power over Western Europe.

However, London might not exist.
dqvZmj22aa	I think taking a current pop song, turning it into a folk song, playing guitar and backing yourself up on flute if you can do 2 track recording, would be a winner.  Think of the Alanis Morissette "My Humps" video, or when Red Peters did a Frank Sinatra style cover of 2 Live Crew.<br>  <br>  Taking a song RIGHT out of it's genre can be funny as h*ll!|`|HJjo8sHRaa	i dont know if youve ever seen the movie Across the Universe<br>  but i think that the songs will be a good shoice for you<br>  especially i want to hold your hand<br>  or cheyenne kimbell Hanging on<br>  or sara bareilles Love song <br>  <br>  yeah|`|PqtUe6mjaa	Honestly, just about anything from Gilbert and Sullivan would be perfect. They're fun, energetic and amazing. The question is do you mind singing a guy's song? For instance I Am The Very Model of a Modern Major General - The Pirates of Penzance.. it's the most fun song EVER in ANY musical EVER! Then again it shows how fast you can sing, but not a lot about how WELL you can sing...<br>  <br>  really though..i think anything by Gilbert and Sullivan is a good start.

QusqTXCaaa	Thats a short answer with a very long question.<br>  <br>  Agriculture:  The Anglo-Saxons kept cattle, a breed of sheep that is now extinct, but its closest modern day relation is the Jacob's Sheep.  Two breeds of pig, and chickens.<br>  <br>  The Anglo-Saxons used a form of crop rotation, fields were alternated between wheat, root vegetables and livestock.  But unlike the crop rotation that emerged in the 15th Century, they did not have a fallow period.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.anmoddracan.org.uk/agric2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anmoddracan.org.uk/agric2.htm</a><br>  <br>  The Anglo-Saxons traded raw materials such as salt, lead and iron.  Finished products included jewellery, glassware, pottery and weapons.<br>  The Anglo-Saxons were excellent metal workers, and some of the items found at Sutton Hoo are breath taking.<br>  <br>  The Anglo-Saxons would probably have done most trade with the Scandinavians and Frisians.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo#Helmet.2C_silver_bowls_and_spoons_.28head_area.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo#...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.regia.org/trade.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.regia.org/trade.htm</a><br>  <br>  The culture of Anglo-Saxon England is too large a subject for me to do justice here.  For purposes of brevity, I could say that it was closely related to Scandinavian culture.  Infact, if it wasn't for the Norman Conquest, then England would probably be considered a part of the Scandinavian sphere.<br>  <br>  Afterall, the Anglo-Saxons did originate from what is now Northern Germany and Denmark.<br>  <br>  The best I can do is point you in the right direction.  <br>  <br>  If you are familiar with The Lord of the Rings, then Rohan is mainly based on the Angles, particularly the kingdom of Mercia, which was a kingdom in the centre of England. <br>  <br>  Some good books to read about Anglo-Saxon England are Bernard Cornwells Saxon Stories.  The author is more famous for his Sharpe series.  But he is currently writing a series of books set in England, during the lifetime of Alfred the Great and the invasion of the Danish.<br>  <br>  There are currently four books in the series, and they really convey the atmosphere and culture of Anglo-Saxon England.<br>  <br>  I will close by leaving a links to a couple of Youtube clips about Anglo-Saxon England.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wl-OZ3breE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wl-OZ3br...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooj25_j3k1E&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ooj25_j3k...</a>

eVptHOOBaa	You are trying to achieve shallow depth of field (DOF) or selective focus... Yes, dSLR and a good fast lens would help a lot, but it is definitely possible on point&shoot, if you know what you're doing. <br>  <br>  I just recently put down a detailed reply to a similar question, so if you don't mind I'll save myself a little typing and cut and paste my own reply from here (you can also look for other good suggestions there):<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmDx4nyXTmrlmvXaXgrDYYHty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224230706AAe5DDe&show=7#profile-info-aYVJTSCWaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  ---cut here---<br>  When you ask this question - everyone yells "APERTURE!", and they are right, but this is not a full answer.<br>  <br>  There are three ingredients that affect depth of field, although they are mutually exclusive in a way..<br>  <br>  So here we go:<br>  1. Aperture, yes, the wider the merrier. Aperture is how much light your lens lets in. You can set your camera to aperture priority mode (A, or Av on a dial) and scroll it down to lowest number (if your camera has this setting - some p&s don't).<br>  <br>  2. Focal length. The longer, the shallower depth of field will be. That means zoom in all the way!<br>  <br>  3. Distance to subject. The closer you get your lens to a subject, the shallower depth of field you will get.<br>  <br>  That's the theory. On practice:<br>  - Zooming in often decreases the maximum aperture, sometimes by a couple of stops (except in very expensive lenses); again zooming in and getting close to a subject means you can get only a tiny subject... So you'll have to work with different combinations of the three things above and try to find your middle ground! But to start - try flowers, insects or other small things! There you can zoom in and get really close! Then move on to bigger subjects.<br>  <br>  You will have better luck with an SLR camera, as their lenses are bigger, open up wider, and larger sensors mean longer focal lengths for the same kind of angle of coverage as compared to point&shoot cameras. But don't listen to anyone, who tells you it's not possible on p&s. It is harder, yes, and in some cases effect is much less prominent, but it is possible, except on the cheapest and simplest of them all - those with fixed focus, that is purposely pre-focused on hyper-focal distance, allowing for maximum dof and not adjustable! Also some of the cheaper cameras have no aperture priority modes, but you can still experiment with focal length and distance to subject!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  LEM.|`|ZltPFk3saa	-_-<br>  a point and shoot can't do that.<br>  you'll need a dslr and a specific lens.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	This photo was not only altered in photoshop, but the photographer used either a macro lens or a "regular" lens with extension tubes.<br>  <br>  Google that and you'll learn a lot :)|`|518798bbc2bda7e567d4666f6f239415aa	you won't be able to change the focus manually - the c913 doesn't support that.<br>  <br>  If you set it to portrait you might get a narrower depth of field (ie a narrowed area in focus) but it'll be hit 'n' miss.  Close-up / macro offering the best chance of acheiving this effect.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you'll have to edit the picture to selectively blur the picture to get the effect you want.|`|lHveTPFOaa	you need an slr (single lens reflex) point and shoots (what you have) don't have manual focus or aperture (which controls your depth of field) wish is what you need to use to get shots like this. you could try using the "flower shots" setting or "portrait" setting to give you a shallow depth of field.|`|z70Mvu5yaa	That is accomplished by a very large lens opening which gives you a shallow depth of field.  If your camera does not have manual settings than use "close up"  "macro" or "portrait" setting.  Play around with all of those until you get the result you want.
9WIbZUH0aa	Nope.  I'm pretty sure the second was the last one (emperor or empress's tomb, I think).  However, I do not know if they plan a movie.  It truly would be wonderful, with all the action scenes, but it would be hard because the main characters get so much older.
5wvQEohpaa	I don't know what you are trying to say. <br>  Maybe it's toe stands.<br>  You are on your flat feet then you jump on to your toes?<br>  <br>  Or heel-to-toe stands. <br>  You jump onto your heels then you go on your tip toes?<br>  <br>  Possibly wings.<br>  <br>  Not flaps or pull backs as someone said. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask you dance instructor or teammates.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!|`|8ygky5g4aa	It does sound like pull backs or pick ups, where you go from heel to toe backwards, and as you go you tap the heal then the ball sort of fast?  These are also called draw backs.  Different teachers call them different things.<br>  <br>  First you need to learn how to do it with each foot by itself, then you put it together with both feet.  This is a pretty hard move, so it may take a while to master it!|`|OnQccyVFaa	um im not too sure what you mean but if you mean going from your toes and jumping and smacking your toes on the ground and landing on your toes those are pick-ups.  sry that's kind of hard to explain! lol :)|`|FDXnufOaaa	pull backs. I go from shuffle than pull backs little more harder! but everyone calls them differently.<br>  Pull backs are also known as pickups.|`|tf0zxuHQaa	I've taken tap for a year and Its called pull backs your a backwards cramproll is heel toe toe heel!<br>  <br>  If these aren't what you are looking for then you should ask a teacher or another part of your dance group!|`|3Qu1MjDYaa	pull backs? fallaps? need more info lol? that second one can't be spelled right lol

First, when Shakespeare describes the blood as civil, he means within one group, or one people who should be united. When he uses civil to describe hands, he means that the hands would otherwise be kindly and innocent, if they hadn't killed.<br>  <br>  "From forth the fatal loins of these two foes": If you read on, it'll say something like "a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life." I can't remember exactly, I'm paraphrasing here.<br>  <br>  Anyways, it's saying that the two men (well, rather their wives) gave birth two two children who will eventually take their own lives because of their unlucky circumstances (ie. Their parents hating each other).|`|NuWSKmBiaa	Okay so the line "From forth the fatal loins of these two foes" is really easy once you know it. "from forth the ... loins" means to give birth, and "fatal" mean that the parents themselves sort of condemn their children's fate. And the "foe" part is, obviously, because the Capulets and the Montagues hate each other.|`|kjBgvy1naa	well the key word is "civil," and the phrase "civil blood" is a paradox. Citizens of a town ought to be civil; that is, they ought to show respect for one another and get along. But too often, they don't. They engage in civil wars and shed "civil blood," which wouldn't happen if they were really civil.<br>  It's a pun.<br>  hope that helps :)|`|V5eaUdMmaa	I think the "where civil blood makes civil hands unclean" part means that, while people (e.g. government) aren't directly killing someone, they're making orders that hurt or kill, and thus the blood of those people is on their hands.

And Screwtape is giving his nephew advice about being a new demon tricking people into going to Hell.<br>  <br>  Talk about the sins committed (like Screwtape's Atheist) and the counter attack against spirits that try to lead him on the right path, the counter attack being to suggest that the Atheist is hungry and thus he forgets about God really existing as he goes to eat lunch. <br>  <br>  I would go through each of Wormwood's pitfalls as he tries to steer his man wrong in the 3 chapters and what Screwtape would have done (his corrections and criticisms).<br>  <br>  The first 3 chapters are so tiny, if you need to reread them just do it.

Okay, here they are:<br>  <br>  1. Edward's a vampires (it's just known that vampires are better than werewolves)<br>  2. I'd rather freeze then have a space heater<br>  3. Edward's romantic, Jacob's a jerk<br>  4. Edward sexy!!!<br>  5. Edward's totally smart<br>  6. Edward can read minds<br>  7. Edward has a name that not many other people have<br>  8.

Edward's Edward!!!!!!|`|j7D3Sazraa	Well, I'm Team Common Sense, but if I had to choose, I would choose Edward.<br>  1. He's Edward, therefore, NOT Jacob.<br>  2. He doesn't say "Oh my god. Vampires suck. My life sucks. Vampires suck" every three seconds.<br>  3. He is so much more understanding than Jacob. Example(This is where Bella and Jacob talk about why Bella loves Edward):<br>  <br>  Is that what it comes down to? Good looks?-Jacob<br>  <br>  Don't be stupid, Jacob.-Bella<br>  <br>  Is it the money, then?-Jacob<br>  <br>  That's nice. I'm flattered that you think so much of me.-Bella<br>  <br>  Aw, don't get mad. I'm serious! I'm trying to understand here, and I'm coming up blank.-Jacob<br>  <br>  I love him. Not because he's beautiful or because he's rich. I'd much rather he weren't either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit-because he'd still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I've ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?-Bella<br>  <br>  It's impossible to understand-Jacob<br>  <br>  Please enlighten me, then, Jacob. What is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I'm doing it wrong.-Bella<br>  <br>  I think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.-Jacob<br>  Well, that just sucks! I guess I'm stuck with Mike Newton after all.-Bella<br>  4. He is Edward(times 6 and you have my ten reasons).|`|S4W7FojCaa	1. He sparkles.<br>  2. He's a vampire.<br>  3. He can fight.<br>  4. He can play the piano.<br>  5. Great taste in music.<br>  6. Loves Bella deeply.<br>  7. Willing to die for the woman he loves.<br>  8. Romantic.<br>  9. Handsome.<br>  10. Vegetarian.<br>  <br>  That's my ten reasons. But if Edward was not a vampire and Jacob was not a werewolf, I would go for Jacob myself.|`|qVEGwLbwaa	1. Edward is HOT and the main character besides Bella<br>  2. Jacob is obsessive and too young for Bella<br>  3. Did I mention Edward is HOT?<br>  4. Edward saves Bella many times<br>  5. I personally can't see Jacob as anything more than friends with Bella<br>  6. Jacob might save Bella when Edward leaves but Edward loved Bella so much he left so she wouldn't die. That's not so bad is it? <br>  7. Jacob is a werewolf and I believe he poses more of a threat to Bella than Edward.<br>  8. Bella loves Edward so I do too.<br>  9. Bella doesn't love Jacob as much as Edward(it's close though) and therefore I love Edward more too.<br>  10. I think Jacob is stuck up and is going after an older woman(Bella) so he needs to get over her(I know, I'm harsh)|`|lJRrSBOWaa	1.Hes sexy<br>  2. hes a vampire<br>  3.He'd die for her (LITERALLY)<br>  4.

iNXqiDIYaa	yes<br>  <br>  When Elena sacrificed herself to save the two vampire brothers who love her—the handsome, brooding Stefan and the sleek and dangerous Damon—she was consigned to a fate beyond death. Until a powerful supernatural force pulled her back. <br>  <br>  Now Elena is not just human. She has powers and gifts that were bestowed on her in the afterlife. What's more, her blood pulses with an overwhelming and unique force that makes her irresistible to any vampire. <br>  <br>  Stefan wants to find a way to keep Elena safe so that they can make a life together. Damon, however, is driven by an insatiable desire for power, and wants Elena to rule as his princess. When Stefan is lured away from Fell's Church, Damon seizes his chance to convince her that he is the brother she is meant to be with. . . . <br>  <br>  But a darkness is infiltrating the town, and Damon, always the hunter, is now the hunted; he becomes the prey of a malevolent creature that can possess him at will, and who desires not just Elena's blood but her death.

Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana, or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. The daughter of Henry VIII, she was born a princess, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed three years after her birth, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her brother, Edward VI, cut her out of the succession. His will, however, was set aside, and in 1558 Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister, the Catholic Mary, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth set out to rule by good counsel,[1] and she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, Baron Burghley. One of her first moves as queen was to support the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement held firm throughout her reign and later evolved into today's Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry, but despite several petitions from parliament, she never did. The reasons for this choice are unknown, and they have been much debated. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity, and a cult grew up around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants and literature of the day.<br>  <br>  In government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings.[2] One of her mottoes was "video et taceo" ("I see, and say nothing").[3] This strategy, viewed with impatience by her counsellors, often saved her from political and marital misalliances. Though Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland, the defeat of the Spanish armada in 1588 associated her name forever with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in English history. Within 20 years of her death, she was being celebrated as the ruler of a golden age, an image that retains its hold on the English people. Elizabeth's reign is known as the Elizabethan era, famous above all for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake, John Hawkins and Walter Raleigh.<br>  <br>  Historians, however, tend to be more cautious in their assessment. They often depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered,[4] sometimes indecisive ruler,[5] who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity to the point where many of her subjects were relieved at her death. Elizabeth is, however, acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor, in an age when government was ramshackle and limited and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and eventually had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's brother and sister, her 44 years on the throne provided valuable stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.[|`|lgM3xZkWaa	She never wanted to get married.She absolutely refused to.Even though many men were near her often she still refused.I read that in a book and remembered it.

gGZz2EGyaa	Grant first reached national prominence by taking Forts Henry and Donelson in 1862 in the first major Union victories of the war. The following year, his celebrated campaign ending in the surrender of Vicksburg secured Union control of the Mississippi and—with the simultaneous Union victory at Gettysburg—turned the tide of the war in the North's favor. Named commanding general of the Federal armies in 1864, he implemented a coordinated strategy of simultaneous attacks aimed at destroying the South's ability to carry on the war. In 1865, after conducting a costly war of attrition in the East, he accepted the surrender of his Confederate opponent Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House. Grant has been described by J.F.C. Fuller as "the greatest general of his age and one of the greatest strategists of any age." His Vicksburg Campaign in particular has been scrutinized by military specialists around the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have included a web site that does a proper bio on Grant and you should get all the information you need from that. Hope it all helps.

draNVjbkaa	Telling us where you are would help.<br>  <br>  There are no specific agencies that work with the Disney Channel. Some of those child actors are with top notch agencies such as CESD and Osbrink.<br>  <br>  STAY AWAY FROM ALAN BALTES! He claims to have info on Disney auditions but charges you for inaccurate information.<br>  <br>  To get an agent in general, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them. By showcase I do not mean scammy conventions like IMTA, Proscout, or Best New Talent. I mean legit ones like at TVI, Reel pros, etc.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.<br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	INTJ based on my opinion and the fact that I'm an ISTJ (but on the bubble between S and N).<br>  <br>  Snape comes off like a person who doesn't let "touchy-feely" issues affect his thinking much.  He's most definitely introverted rather than extroverted.  Also, his chosen profession is potions, which calls for detail-orientation, and following intricate series of steps without error.  However, Snape does have an intuitive side as well - look at all the potion shortcuts he documented in his "Half-Blood Prince's" Potions book.<br>  <br>  If Snape were a Muggle, he'd be a chemist or a computer geek, which are likely career choices for ISTJs and INTJs.|`|v67Oyaukaa	this is my opinion. Snape is a cold person. If he dislikes how someone is acting or if he doesnt like someone, he will pick sides and like other people. For example, in the books/movies snape thinks harry is full of himself  so he chooses to like malfoy of slytherin instead|`|5nvgGbcmaa	In my opinion he would be an ISTJ.<br>  he's definitley introverted, and he definitely has clear-cut plans for the future. he seems to be the type that uses his 5 senses to gather information about the world around him. Also, he seems to try to make his decisions by "Thinking", but his love for Lily and his decision to betray Voldemort makes me think he may be, or may have been, an ISFJ. but overall i think the personality for ISTJ fits him best.

It's my favorite  book)<br>  <br>  Anything by James Patterson|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I'v never read it before but I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|wJ6WCfepaa	1. I like The Twilight Series better because it's romantic and I love how Stephenie Meyer writes!

gNQr7e1Waa	There is much you can do.<br>  <br>   Work on your body. You must be physically and vocal expressive. Keep fit and exercise. Also work on your voice every day. You can buy books to give you vocal exercises. Work on resonance, articulation, support, clarity, muscularity and in addition you could study accents.<br>  <br>   Also start reading as much as you can around the subject. Start building a collection of plays and read them (out loud) to yourself and increase your general knowledge of the subject. You might also like to learn a batch of speeches to have in your personal repertoire. Also look into the history and evolution of theatre. Get on to Shakespeare fast.<br>  <br>   See more theatre and film! The more you see the more you learn. And then begin to study the performance from an actors perspective not just for enjoyment. Also try and watch films from all countries and all eras. Not just the latest Indiana Jones.<br>  <br>   Travel the world and live life to the max. As an actor your job is to represent life so you must have lived it. Try new things and see as much and learn as much as you can.<br>  <br>   Take part in as much theatre/drama as you can - school plays & after school clubs and the like. The more experience the better.<br>  <br>   Then after all that and when you are old enough apply for Drama School - there you will really learn how to act and what you need to do. Go for Rada, Drama Centre, Guildhall, Lamda, Bristol Old Vic or any others you take a liking to.<br>  <br>   Good luck!|`|75nbESJUaa	I like the other suggestion, but notice that actors are usually very good with poetry, singing, and gymnastics. Acting is a lifestyle like any other artisic groove, with the musicians being the weirdest.|`|Mig6O93Naa	The only thing that you can do is to memorize long speeches in plays and recite them out loud. Shakespeare is especially a rich source of such speeches.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Uta Hagen, one of the foremost leading acting teachers of the post-group theatre era, wrote a book entirely on the outline that actor's have very few effective exercises to develop their craft.  One cannot become a better actor by simply reciting monologues, if anything that could be particularly counter effective.  I suggest finding a copy of Hagen's "Respect for Acting" and reading it cover to cover, she has multiple exercises which can be practiced alone or in a small group.|`|KGj1dxhQaa	i just read through a script or a book out loud. it actually helps a lot. try joining a community theatre group or your school's drama club.
umrXBkeMaa	The main thing mom will worry about is that it's an ultra-competitive career and there are thousands of really good, top notch actors who still struggle to make less than $1000 a month.  It takes a LOT of hard work and total dedication to make it, and surviving a LOT of rejection, even when you thought you were perfect for a part.<br>  <br>  To show her that you're serious, sign up for drama in school.  Keep up with your other studies too, and pursue an alternate career at the same time.  Seriously.  The worst thing you can do is depend on success as an actor as your only future.  If you are really good at it, you will shine throughout school AND go on to a Fine Arts program in college AND land the success that you deserve.  But like I said, there are thousands (more like 100's of thousands) of actors who are absolutely fantastic and still need a day job.<br>  <br>  And DON'T count on being a waitress or bartender!!!<br>  <br>  Pursue an alternate career that will give you flexibility in your schedule.  There are plenty of good ones and probably something that you're interested in too besides acting.  Ask your guidance counselor to help you explore these, what fits your personality and interests.<br>  <br>  THEN dedicate the rest of your time to being a great actor.  That means putting in long hours practicing, asking for coaching from the drama teacher, and locating a reputable Actor's Studio near your town (or community drama group) -- your drama teacher can help you with that.<br>  <br>  If mom sees that you're pursuing a "Plan B" career while also thriving on your acting, she'll be 110% behind you all the way.<br>  <br>  Study hard in your liberal arts classes (English, History, etc.).  Sign up for debate class (a great way to learn to master difficult speaking situations and also learn to deal with rejection).<br>  <br>  There are lots of great books for actors too.  Look up acting on Amazon.  Get the books.  Even check out Raminger's books on Directing.  They will let you see acting from the director's perspective so you'll know what they look for.|`|hGFdwOKpaa	Ok so you wait till your mom is cooking or something right? and then you say "hey mim... today in school we were talking about careers and what we want to be when we grow up.

You think maybe I can get some acting lessons?"<br>  <br>  & just continue like that.<br>  That's how I told my mom! :)|`|KGj1dxhQaa	depends on what kind of acting you want to do. but before you decide, find a local acting class. look up information and prepare it in a way to present to your mom. now, what type? if it's musicals or theatre, look into local community theatre groups or your school's drama club and find information on that. look into voice and/or dance lessons and present these to your mom with the acting class. if theatre isn't your thing and you want to do tv or movies, look into local talent agencies. be very very very careful about scams. you might want your mom's help with this one, but still tell her about it. it's a good idea to stick with the dance and/or voice lessons- the more talent the better, even with film acting. if you have a performing arts school, look into that too. just tell your mom what you want to do, how you're going to do it, and by showing her your information, it will show that you care and are willing to put in the dedication. if she says no, or isn't sure, don't give up. no one can stop you from getting your dream. good luck!|`|S01zIagOaa	Tell your mom by actions like first taking part in the school plays or drama department if they have one.
DvToP5h7aa	Cat on a Hot Tin Roof - Tennessee Williams<br>  <br>  Protagonist - Maggie <br>  <br>  Maggie simply wants to make it in life and to stay far away from the poverty that haunts her youth. We see her fight against Gooper and Mae's wiles, against the disapproval of Big Mama, and, ultimately, we see her win a fierce family battle by (successfully?) ensnaring Brick. We root for her, and we don't quite know why.<br>  <br>  <br>  Foil - Maggie to Mae/Big Mama <br>  <br>  Mae and Big Mama are also Maggie's foils as they are the reigning women who, in the world of Cat, have played society's role of "woman" impeccably well. Mae and Maggie both have names that start with the letter M, and they both come from families who were either poor to begin with or who eventually became poor. Both women know how to survive by climbing ladders. Maggie and Big Mama, while existing in vastly different eras with vastly different beliefs, are united by their unrequited love for their husbands. We hear both women convey their love to their husbands, resulting in the exact same response, "wouldn't it be funny if that was true?" The difference between the two women is that, while Big Mama dances around the truth and floats on a superficial stream of conversation, Maggie gets down and dirty with the truth. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character-roles/literature/tennessee-williams/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character-roles/li...</a>

First off, The invading country is forcing their policies, religions, and lifestyles upon them, damaging the host's cultural ideals. Secondly, with colonization, many of the invading countries brought disease, illness, and foreign and invasive natural issues to the host country. It is known that small pox, and STDs were brought into these countries, devastating the populations. Not only that, but many times rats, plants, or other animals were brought over, or hid over and hurt the ecosystems. Finally, most colonizations brought war, and slavery hurting the host colonies.

wnkoTEqVaa	THe German defense was called the Atlantic wall. It was not a wall but a line of bunkers and pill boxes. They were heavily fortified.<br>  <br>  On the beach there was explosives to blow up the landing crafts and other obstacles. That is why Frog teams were sent to dis arm them.|`|WLizHwtkaa	The Atlantic Wall had been planned and implemented by Irwin Rommel. His strategy was to defeat any Allied landing on the beaches, though this was in conflict with the Germain High-Command which favoured strong counter-attacks once the Allies had committed themselves to a landing.<br>  <br>  Rommel's beach defences were designed to make it as difficult as possible for Allied troops and supplies, especially mechanised armour, to get off the beach. They would then be at the mercy of cleverly concealed machine gun and cannon nests that could rake the beach with overlapping fields of fire. This was especially affective at Omaha beach which is backed by high sand dunes and cliffs and this is the beach shown in the movie's opening sequence. These defences worked less well at the British and Canadian beaches of Gold, Juno and Sword because these were backed by flat open country.

S4W7FojCaa	Outlander: When Claire walks through a cleft stone in an ancient henge, she's somehow transported to 1743. She encounters Frank's evil ancestor, British captain Jonathan "Black Jack" Randall, and is adopted by another clan. Claire nurses young soldier James Fraser, a gallant, merry redhead, and the two begin a romance, seeing each other through many perilous, swashbuckling adventures involving Black Jack. Scenes of the Highlanders' daily life blend poignant emotions with Scottish wit and humor. Eventually Sassenach (outlander) Claire finds a chance to return to 1945, and must choose between distant memories of Frnak and her happy, uncomplicated existence with Jamie.<br>  <br>  Big Stone Gap: In the town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, not much happens. The highlight of 35-year-old Ave Maria Mulligan's week comes on Friday, with the arrival of the Bookmobile, the sight of which sends her into raptures. Her favorite book concerns the ancient Chinese art of reading faces. Through her face-readings, we come to understand the hostilities simmering within her family: her father whose small eyes are the clear "sign of a deceptive nature." Her aunt who "has a small head and thin lips. (That's a terrible combination.)" Adriana Trigiani's first novel concerns the family scandals that befall Ave Maria in this seemingly uneventful town. Greed, lust, envy--all the ancient emotional elements--manifest themselves even in this hamlet of "ordinary folk." Fans of Fannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells will enjoy this down-home tale, full of small, everyday details and colloquial revelations. The writing is often awkward, but so too are the characters who inhabit this place: the Bookmobile lady who thinks of herself as the sexiest woman alive; the amateur actors in the local Outdoor Drama who bristle with ambition when they hear that Elizabeth Taylor is coming to visit. In Big Stone Gap, her visit is so anticipated, it's like she's an angel sent from heaven.<br>  <br>  The Thirteenth Tale: Settle down to enjoy a rousing good ghost story with Diane Setterfield's debut novel, The Thirteenth Tale. Setterfield has rejuvenated the genre with this closely plotted, clever foray into a world of secrets, confused identities, lies, and half-truths. She never cheats by pulling a rabbit out of a hat; this atmospheric story hangs together perfectly. <br>  There are two heroines here: Vida Winter, a famous author, whose life story is coming to an end, and Margaret Lea, a young, unworldly, bookish girl who is a bookseller in her father's shop. Vida has been confounding her biographers and fans for years by giving everybody a different version of her life, each time swearing it's the truth. Because of a biography that Margaret has written about brothers, Vida chooses Margaret to tell her story, all of it, for the first time. At their initial meeting, the conversation begins: <br>  <br>  <br>  "You have given nineteen different versions of your life story to journalists in the last two years alone."<br>  <br>  She [Vida] shrugged. "It's my profession. I'm a storyteller."<br>  <br>  "I am a biographer, I work with facts."<br>  The game is afoot and Margaret must spend some time sorting out whether or not Vida is actually ready to tell the whole truth. There is more here of Margaret discovering than of Vida cooperating wholeheartedly, but that is part of Vida's plan. <br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  The last two, true blood and dead until dark, I can't say because I don't know the author.

She later on befriends Ivy and they try to solve it together. While all the Billing girls were at a party, Reed snuck back into Billings in Sabine and Amberlys room and she found a photo of Sabine and Ariana. Reed went to the party in plans to ask Sabine how she knew Ariana and she was full of questions. When she got there Sabine confessed. Sabine was the one who killed Cheyenne. She was the one who has been stalking her all this time. She was the one who sent that video to everyone on campus. She wanted to kill Reed because of what she did to her SISTER Ariana.

No one knows who the killer is, but everyone agrees that Reed Brennan, who took over Cheyenne's role as Billings's president, gained the most from her death. Once the most powerful girl on campus, Reed is now powerless to stop her classmates' accusing whispers. Rumors begin to swirl that she killed Cheyenne. <br>  <br>  that's the synopsis<br>  <br>  And just like that, Reed is kicked out of Billings. <br>  <br>  She's lost everything -- her friends, her home, her boyfriend -- and Reed knows the only way to get it all back is to figure out who really murdered Cheyenne. And she has to do it fast because the killer is still out there. The more Reed investigates, the more she uncovers. And as any Billings Girl knows...secrets can be deadly.
V2v66A7Waa	pointe is going to hurt a little bit. The best way to break in your pointe shoes is by dancing- in class with your instructor. If you want them to be a little softer for class, do plie releves only on both feet in first position. Don't attempt to break them in by hand. If in a few weeks they still sound hard and feel too hard, ask an older dancer to help you break them in by doing a few releves. I do this for the younger girls at my studio all the time, trust me its no problem if they have strong feet, which they should. Remember, the only way you can get beautiful strong arched feet is by dancing en pointe- and soft shoes only make your feet weaker. No pain, no gain- but the pain should not be excruciating. Ask your teacher for help :) <br>  1.In your socks or tights, using your heel, stand on the box of the shoe to soften it up a little.<br>  2. Bend the shank of the shoe in your hands to soften--but not snap!--it.<br>  3. My favorite was to put on my shoes and stick my foot under the tap in the sink and get the box a little wet, not dripping--and then take class.  The box softens and dries to the shape of your foot.<br>  In the movie "Center Stage" (dumb movie, great dancing) there is a sequence showing different girls breaking in their shoes in different ways. Try a lot of different things and you will find one you like.  Be sure your shoes are broken in a little before you take your first class.|`|EZHXhsLTaa	i always take mine and bend them a little bit before classes start and sometimes hit them against something hard. but the best way you can break them in is to simply dance on them.|`|5wvQEohpaa	Everyone else is right.

This simply is not true in the vast majority of cases. The truth is that educational institutions are not interested in their students as much as they are interested in having them enroll so the institutions can get more money.  Sad  but true.   One other hint. If you are interested in becoming an actor, you cannot do it in tandem with another person.  It is an individual endeavor.|`|umrXBkeMaa	First, you'll do infinitely better in your essay and at your college interviews by spelling college with an E.

eeQSrlG5aa	well i think that at the start there are moments when jack and ralph have some form of comraderie however this vastly changes when jack neglects his duty of looking after the fire and goes hunting. A ship passses by and misses them cause the fire is out!! Ralph who seems almost obsessed with keeping the fire going screams at jack who retalliates by tearing the glasses of piggy to start a new one... i think! This could be considered an incident where the relationship changes dramatically!<br>  to be honest i've just finished the book at shool (i'm 15) and have been given basically the same questions (very boring and complicated in my opinion however sometimes quite beautifully written!)<br>  sorry if i could help you more i'd be so happy cause i need help aswell!<br>  good luck!<br>  ooh! another incident might be when they kill simon? or jack decides to leave when the majority has voted ralph cheif!..|`|bFnIipyxaa	I would have to say when Ralph and Jack are competing for chief, and Jack is all arrogant in the beginning, but seemingly accepts that Ralph has been voted, is a kind of significant change in relationship: “I ought to be chief, because I’m chapter chorister and head boy” (15)~Jack. The more prominent change in their relationship occurs when Ralph accentuates the need for a fire and when Jack becomes obsessed and intoxicated with hunting. They both split ways, hence making a big change in relationship, because they are against each other. Especially when Jack leads the hunt to kill Ralph. Between Ralph and Piggy, in the beginning, Ralph is carefree and doesn't worry much about Piggy, he kind of uses him to his advantage at some times. But as the story progresses, Ralph becomes extremely dependent on Piggy because Piggy serves as the brains and common-sense problem solver, especially with his spectacles that are needed for the fire. So Ralph and Piggy's relationship strengthens as the story continues. And finally, Jack and Piggy's relationship was never a good one. At the start, when Jack asserts:  “You’re talking too much,” and “Shut up, Fatty” (14), he is negative towards Piggy. The relationship becomes immensely worse, when Piggy is murdered after Jack's orders. I hope this helped!!!

gGZz2EGyaa	Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross; c. 1820 – March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the U.S. Civil War. After escaping from slavery, into which she was born, she made thirteen missions to rescue over seventy slaves using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.<br>  <br>  As a child in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by her various owners. Early in her life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when she was hit by a heavy metal weight thrown by an irate slave owner, intending to hit another slave. The injury caused disabling seizures, headaches, and powerful visionary and dream activity, and spells of hypersomnia which occurred throughout her entire life. A devout Christian, she ascribed her visions and vivid dreams to premonitions from God.<br>  <br>  In 1849, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, then immediately returned to Maryland to rescue her family. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other slaves to freedom. Traveling by night and in extreme secrecy, Tubman (or "Moses", as she was called) "never lost a passenger". Large rewards were offered for the capture and return of many of the people she helped escape, but no one ever knew it was Harriet Tubman who was helping them. When a far-reaching United States Fugitive Slave Law was passed in 1850, she helped guide fugitives further north into Canada, and helped newly-freed slaves find work.<br>  <br>  When the American Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, she guided the raid on the Combahee River, which liberated more than seven hundred slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She was active in the women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African-Americans she had helped open years earlier.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope all that is some help to you.|`|3rzaWFQFaa	of course she ran away from her master then came back for her family then came back like 20 more times to save strangers from slavery. she is very important she helped make slavery illegal by all the run aways.
gGZz2EGyaa	Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, by the end of his life it was Ingres' portraits, both painted and drawn, that were recognized as his greatest legacy.<br>  <br>  A man profoundly respectful of the past, he assumed the role of a guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style represented by his nemesis Eugène Delacroix. His exemplars, he once explained, were "the great masters which flourished in that century of glorious memory when Raphael set the eternal and incontestable bounds of the sublime in art ... I am thus a conservator of good doctrine, and not an innovator" Nevertheless, modern opinion has tended to regard Ingres and the other Neoclassicists of his era as embodying the Romantic spirit of his time while his expressive distortions of form and space make him an important precursor of modern art.<br>  <br>  <br>  The web site below will give you a full bio on him, good luck with the homework.|`|jPHLqk87aa	hes married to mariah carry and has 10 kids.

Other documents went various medical associations to be use as well|`|qDSvOOwBaa	The doctors disappeared but some of the records ended up in the hands of the OSS-later the CIA. The work was continued-especially the mind control experiments using the new compound LSD that a Swiss Chemist invented in 1938. Later, the compound was used on unsuspecting American citizens as lab rats but the outcome was unsatisfying as the mind control was very limited. Also,  the horrific experiments using the syphilis bacteria on young black males in the south were conducted-these were also a continuation of the Nazi doctors work.<br>  What was done in America is something everyone tries to forget by heaping all the blame on Germany.<br>  <br>  Also, it should be mentioned that the Japanese synthesized the compound methamphetamine for it pilots.

In your quest to find a publisher, research self publishing.  I too am a new writer and don't have a clue how to get published. I liked the idea of of self publishing for two reasons.

Good Luck.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>   <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start. It is best if you send in the entire manuscript and should not worry about protection because publishers have an agreement to not use your material without your consent.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>   Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>   <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.<br>  <br>  Edit your book many times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com</a> to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.<br>  <br>  There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.<br>  <br>  At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com).</a> Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.<br>  <br>  If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose). Also, the marketing of your book is up to you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EdPa53VBaa	I am the Senior Editor/Copartner at AG Press, a small reputable publishing company. We can definitely help you.

However, if you aren't out to make a million dollars, and just want the satisfaction of seeing your work "done", then you might want to consider a smaller publishing house. There are a number of them out there, and the majority of them don't require you to have an agent.  The benefit of that it is that an agent won't be taking a portion of your profits, and you won't have to spend time finding an agent.  (My agent search literally took a year, and wasn't cheap.  Remember, you have to send them all query letters.)  There is also a website called Preditors and Editors, (<a href="http://anotherealm.com/prededitors/)" rel="nofollow">http://anotherealm.com/prededitors/)</a> which has invaluable information on who is creditable and who isn't.  <br>  <br>  Writing full time as your main source of income is difficult.  Trust me.  Most writers have another job - a "day job".  I'm not going to say you'll definitely be turned down on your first go-round, but I'd also say don't be surprised if you are.  <br>  <br>  Another piece of advice to you would be to get a page on a networking site, such as myspace or facebook, and see if you can make friends with other authors.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

This production was directed by Franco Zeffirelli and starred Mel Gibson, Glenn Close, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. In this production of Hamlet, the original old English is used. However, I noticed that any dialog that was too difficult to comprehend or too wordy was deleted from the scenes. Some of the scenes had also been altered. For example, In Act 2, Scene 1, the director has Polonius spy on Ophelia and Hamlet, and this is how he learns of Hamlet’s strange visit with his daughter and Hamlet’s madness. In the original text of Act 2, scene 1, Ophelia informs Polonius of Hamlet’s visit and his apparent madness. I believe the director chose to have Polonius spy on them to obtain this information, because the audience would observe for themselves just how mad Hamlet appears. It was also probably done to save time so that the movie wouldn’t drag. In Kenneth Branaugh’s version the movie is contained on two tapes, and his version was a little too slow moving for my taste. The lines 207-0 213 in Act 2, scene2, where Polonius has a lengthy monologue, also appears to have been cut from the script. In that same act the lines where Guildenstern and Rosencranz enter the scene have been moved to Act 3, Scene 1, a point directly after Hamlet’s “Mousetrap” play. There were also several other modifications to the placement of scenes in this play, including Shakespeare’s famous speech, “To be or not to be […],” which had been moved to Act 1, scene 2. I believe all of these changes were made due to the advantageous nature of the film media. It was possible for the director to show several shots of different actors and events, shifting back and forth between scenes. This gave the effect of the scenes occurring simultaneously. Since these scenes appeared to have occurred at the same time in the movie, it probably made sense or seemed more effective to the director to move the scenes or acts around to what seemed the most logical point in the film. As a result of these modifications, I felt this version of Hamlet was more fast-paced and engaging. It did not drag. I appreciated this production over the other Hamlet films I have seen, because it was made more interesting through director’s shifting camera technique. The setting and costumes of this play were also historically accurate for that time period. And the lighting was well done -not too dark. As far as the actors go, Mel Gibson gave an energetic interpretation of the melancholy Hamlet; and Glenn Close was so intense and very believable as Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother. The other actors also performed their parts very well. In summary, I enjoyed this performance more than Kenneth Branaugh’s production, because I felt it was faster paced and more dynamic. I feel this effect was achieved through the director’s technique of shifting the camera between the actors and scenes to give the impression that events were occurring simultaneously. I also feel Mel Gibson’s energetic performance and Glenn Close’s intense and realistic performance added a dynamic quality, which I have not seen in any other production of this play.<br>  <br>  I disagree with this writer, however, in that I prefer Branaugh's version.|`|JtCiW6pKaa	Yes, its in there.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I'v never read it before but I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|bMbFw8dwaa	"Stay Strong" Simple Life Lessons For Teens by Terrie Williams|`|YyaKq8praa	The Inkheart Series :D <br>  it even has a movie coming out ;D|`|wJ6WCfepaa	Here are some good teenage books:<br>  1.The Host- Stephenie Meyer<br>  2.Hoot- Carl Hiassen

shVgCizBaa	Period of Disunion (220-589 AD)<br>          <br>  In 220 AD the last Han emperor was dethroned by a group of powerful warlords. During the period of disunion (220-589), the warlords established their own private armies and proclaimed their own ruler. Many dynasties were established during this time of turmoil. The time between 220 AD and 265 AD was known as the Three Kingdoms Period. <br>  <br>  Of the three kingdoms, the northern state of Wei was the strongest. After years of fighting, it finally succeeded in annexing the other two states, and founded the Jin Dynasty around 270 AD The unification was only temporary because the Jin emperor's princes began fighting among themselves. Nomadic groups in the north took advantage of the chaos and attacked. In 317 AD the Jin Dynasty lost its territory in northern China. For the next 250 years, northern China was divided and ruled by numerous nomadic tribes, while the south was controlled by a sequence of four short-lived Chinese dynasties, all with the capitals at present-day Nanjing. This was the time of the Northern and Southern Dynasties.<br>  <br>  The Southern Dynasty had a powerful, hereditary aristocracy that had become entrenched in government posts. The Wei had adopted a civil service system based on the nine ranks, which was originally a way for determining by evaluation a person's character and talent. Unfortunately, this system did not work. The social status of the candidate's family determined his post in the government. <br>  <br>  Nobles would marry only within families of equivalent social status, and compiled lists and genealogies of the most eminent families. The aristocrats were assured government salaries and exemptions from taxes and labor service. Intellectual, literary, and artistic achievements among these families flourished. Many of the families were prominent in landscape painting, poetry writing and witty conversation.<br>  <br>  The economy of the Southern Dynasty was much more prosperous than the Northern Dynasty and many Chinese escaped to the south. Because of its temperate climate and abundant water supply, the south was a good agricultural area, and many immigrants prospered in the region when they took on land for farming.<br>  <br>  In the north, none of the states established by the nomadic people lasted very long, with the exception of the Xianbei people. The Xianbei tribe founded the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD). One of the Xianbei emperors used the more advanced culture of the Chinese as a pattern and implemented a series of policies designed to reform and strengthen the state. The Xianbei emperor employed Chinese officials, adopted Chinese-style clothing and customs at court, and made Chinese the official language. A new system of distributing land to the farmers promoted agricultural production. The capital was moved from the frontier to inland Luoyang the old capital of the Jin Dynasty. However, the reform met with resistance among the Xianbei nobles, whose rebellion in 524 AD, brought about a decade of constant warfare. For the next 50 years, north China was torn apart by struggles among different factions. <br>  <br>  During this chaotic period, Buddhism became firmly established in China. In the 1st century AD, it was introduced to China along the Silk Road by travelers and monks. Buddhism was different from other native Chinese religions. As a universal religion, it embraced all people, regardless of their ethnicity or social status. The number of Buddhist temples grew rapidly in China. Many Chinese converted to Buddhism.<a href="http://www.china-tour.cn/Chinese-History/Period-of-Disunion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.china-tour.cn/Chinese-History...</a><br>  Period of Disunion ~ 281-617<br>    After three centuries of conflict, China was reunified in A.D. 589 by the short-lived Sui dynasty (A.D. 581-617), which has often been compared to the earlier Qin dynasty in tenure and the ruthlessness of its accomplishments. The Sui dynasty's early demise was attributed to the government's tyrannical demands on the people, who bore the crushing burden of taxes and compulsory labor. These resources were overstrained in the completion of the Grand Canal--a monumental engineering feat-- and in the undertaking of other construction projects, including the reconstruction of the Great Wall. Weakened by costly and disastrous military campaigns against Korea in the early seventh century, the dynasty disintegrated through a combination of popular revolts, disloyalty, and assassination.<a href="http://www.asianartmall.com/ddisunion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianartmall.com/ddisunion.ht...</a> ------------------What is a period of disunion?The end of the Han dynasty was marked by the separation of the large families of that dynasty. The families took advantage of the weakened state of the government and started to establish their own private armies. Many dynasties were established during this time. This was a period of disunion.<br>     <br>  Periods of disunion are considered exceptions to the rule, flaws in cosmic order, by traditional Chinese thinkers because of the cultural assumption that the world should be united under the rule of

UDEMDcGuaa	It has allowed people to carry on pointless annoying conversations anywhere, (ie the guy blocking the aisle in the grocery store while calls home to find out what brand of ketchup to buy, the person next to you on the train who tells someone"we are now passing the big green building" and other scintilating facts), it has decreased dramatically the attention many driver pay to the road, it has increased the number of annoyances during lectures, movies and other public events with annoying ringtones, it has generally decreased the civiilty of society in general,<br>  <br>  I am certain the third horseman of the apocalypse will be carrying an iphone and twittering satan about the latest youtube video|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	It has made people terrible drivers<br>  <br>  They can not even go through the check out at the store with out a cell phone glued to their ear....very rude!|`|5PakIh3taa	In many ways.<br>  <br>  They allow people to communicate instantly by either voice, text or video.<br>  You can browse the internet (Facebook, etc)<br>  Communicate with many people (eg, the bloke that used twitter after his plane landed in the Hudson river)<br>  Play games<br>  Download content like photos, videos, games<br>  View news and weather<br>  Listen to music<br>  <br>  Some of these things have changed our lives for the worse eg facebook addiction, some for the better like instant contact etc.<br>  <br>  Mention something about the features (games, media, communication) or how annoying they can be!!|`|6YuktLyNaa	It's made communication much easier and more portable as we can talk to friends anywhere.

l23ttRePaa	Too bad the majority of the American people can't see where we're headed. Has nothing to do with you or us loving our country it has to do with us being taken over from within as is the comment that Joseph Stalin made.<br>  <br>  Look at everything around us and stop and think about it. If you don't do as you're told you'll suffer the consequences as in the income taxes which were never passed into law but just threw them in during the war and people paid them with no questions asked so that's where our ancestors left us. <br>  <br>  Earned income is a legal tax. You income from bodily labor is not earned income that was earned from interest and or dividends. I don't know when the American people will wake up and take a long, hard look at what's going on around them. It's sad...we've seen it for years but is too very extensive to even begin to put it all here. I could go on for days as we have studied and researched this for so very many years.<br>  <br>  We need all to stand together someday and really make us a totally free nation again. Of course, I expect statements like .. "if you don't like it then why don't you leave"? But that certainly doesn't answer yours or my questions does it?<br>  <br>  Well, looks like you may have a very good head on your shoulders to see that something is very close in coming to strip us of what little freedom that is left. Hope this helped somewhat...<br>  <br>  Have a great and "FREE" evening.....|`|TNE6uFkTaa	Here is a better question.

However, I sincerely doubt it.  I suspect that they will write something more like:<br>  <br>  "Facing a serious economic depression, the US Did just what they had in the Great Depression (1929-1939) and elected a charismatic leader who used government spending, adjusted tax policies and limited forms of socialism to spend their way out of the depression, thereby also lifting up the global economy and returning much of the advanced world to conditions of growing prosperity."<br>  <br>  Take a look at FDR and at how the Great Depression was ended.|`|S01zIagOaa	Never, because it's not communist.

He has been one of my favorite authors since junior high. Some is his better books are listed with summaries below:<br>  <br>  Ghost Boy<br>  <br>  Harold Kline is an albino - an outcast. Folks stare and taunt, calling him Ghost Boy. So when the circus comes to town, Harold runs off to join it.

Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.<br>  <br>  The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Lovely-Bones/Alice-Sebold/e/9780316666343/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Lovely-...</a><br>  <br>  When we first meet 14-year-old Susie Salmon, she is already in heaven. This was before milk carton photos and public service announcements, she tells us; back in 1973, when Susie mysteriously disappeared, people still believed these things didn't happen.<br>  <br>  In the sweet, untroubled voice of a precocious teenage girl, Susie relates the awful events of her death and her own adjustment to the strange new place she finds herself. It looks a lot like her school playground, with the good kind of swing sets.<br>  <br>  With love, longing, and a growing understanding, Susie watches her family as they cope with their grief, her father embarks on a search for the killer, her sister undertakes a feat of amazing daring, her little brother builds a fort in her honor and begin the difficult process of healing.<br>  <br>  In the hands of a brilliant novelist, the author narrates the THE LOVELY BONES through the eyes of her winning young heroine. This story of seemingly unbearable tragedy is transformed into a suspenseful and touching story about family, memory, love, heaven, and living. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hunger-Games/Suzanne-Collins/e/9780439023481/?itm=2" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hun...</a><br>  <br>  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival.
Fnp2MIycaa	The site below may help you. <br>  I think if I had been a slave at that time I would have thought that I'd believe it when it actually happens.<br>  <br>  Reaction to the Emancipation Proclamation.<br>  <a href="http://history.howstuffworks.com/american-civil-war/lincoln-emancipation-proclamation5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://history.howstuffworks.com/america...</a>|`|zcywXjwOaa	Well, all the slaves were probably relieved about that and thankful for Licoln|`|rsSImhZWaa	The thing you have to remember about the Emancipation Proclamation is that it was brought about shortly after the start of the civil war and was not until the second year of the civil war that the southerners found out about it. the way to go about answering the question that you have asked is somewhat simple, the slaves at that time would have been extremely excited to find out about this new presidential order after the fugitive slave law of 1850 the slaves would have been excited to hear that the northerners cared about the slaves.<br>  Hope this helps if not sorry.
8955f4d866b69f97b83ea516833b5a93aa	They claimed that they wanted to carry out enlightenment ideals through political and social reform, but in actuality their goals were self-motivated. For example, Catherine the Great of Russia was promoting the idea that Russia should abolish serfdom. However, when a serf revolt actually happened, she sided with the lords and aristocratic society, because she did not want the people to  take her power. <br>  <br>  The Peasant Emperor, or Joseph of Prussia (I think that was his name, don't quote me) was one of the only enlightened despots. He would disguise himself as a peasant to learn of the struggles of the lower class. He made radical reforms to change social structure and give power to the people,  but after he died they were overturned. They were too quickly put in place.
8tVMmzvoaa	They wanted to bring in Enlightenment ideas but still maintain control of their country.  They allowed some Enlightenment ideas to sort of sprout up, such as free speech.  They only allowed limited free speech though.<br>  <br>  Also they added things like more voting rights for more people.
EWvzQ4Syaa	Check out a Carvin v3 Combo. 2x12 all tube amplifier. <br>  it's custom shop made in California. Great customer support. You wouldn't be able to play it before you bought it but if you trust your gut and the endless good reviews i say order it , and you could always return it if you don't like it. It is by far the most versatile amp i've ever seen. You can get a great clean sound, a godly bluesy sound and you can also kick it into high gear for a legendary metal sound. <br>  Or you could save money and get a tube modeling amp. like the<br>  Line 6 2x12 Valve Tube amp. designed by bogner. it's a digital amp so you can get a lot of great stuff out of it but for my person taste it is too digital sounding.<br>  HOWEVER<br>  this relatively new digital modeling amp series by Peavey called Vypyr. Is really great. it has analog distortion which sounds a hell of alot better than the Line 6 one. They offer a bunch of models and i believe for 400-600  dollars. They have tube models. You should go check these out in guitar center or something. I doubt they would have the tube model but you can try the solid states and just imagine what it would sound like if it was tube. Look into it at the store and on musiciansfriend.com <br>  i know for a fact that one of these 3 amps (if not all 3) is perfect for you!!!|`|IIa4efh5aa	it's hard to track down Orange prices on the net, but Club Amps probably deserve a look.<br>  <br>  www,clubamps.com|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	You will love that amp. I just bought an Orange Tiny Terror head and the PPC112 cab. This thing is just incredible. I would imagine the Rocker 30 would sound even better. I am a devout Orange amp man from here on out. My next amp will probably be the 30 watt head also and just add a second PPC112 cabinet. I have played almost every type of amp out there looking for the perfect one and now I have found it.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	Go to a music shop and play it, play all the tube amps you can find in your price range.  Grab a guitar like yours and put them through the paces,  play as much as you can and check all the settings.

AA12185092	You won't notice an improvement from increased pixel count unless you are making large prints. Most of what distinguishes professional quality photography is the care taken with composition, lighting, and exposure. <br>  <br>  That said, you will see an improvement in image quality moving up to a DSLR. Their larger sensors give you improved contrast and sharpness compared to P&S cameras. Shooting in raw and learning to adjust white balance and other picture parameters will help you get the best results, but unless you are doing special effects, your picture is 95% done when you click the shutter button. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't just buy a new camera in the vague hope of improving your pictures. When you understand why your current camera can't give you the pictures you want, you're ready for a new one.|`|iqyNCVwIaa	Don't listen to that other guy. Both film and digital can look professional. Megapixels are only important if you're going to be doing large scale printing. To make any image look professional, an easy way to do so is using shallow depth of field. (This makes the backround blurry) You can either do it on photoshop if you're using a point and shoot, or if you have a DSLR, use a lens with a small aperture. For example a 50mm lens with an aperture of 1.8 will give you a great depth of field. :D Hope that helps. Best of luck!!|`|i5OVORXgaa	In order to make professional looking shots you need to have skill... high mega pixels and photoshop are not going to help. Photoshop is only used for artistically enhancing your images and correcting small mishaps. High mega pixels will only help to enlarge your images.|`|lHveTPFOaa	you should shoot with film and develop the photo your self. <br>  <br>  but if you want to stick to digital, you should learn composition and aperture, exposure, ect... any photo will look professional as long as you get the basics down.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	More that likely a professional shot will depend on your expertise... followed by the quality of the camera and lens, and how you light your subject.    Those most important element is you.|`|C77c0OE2aa	Keep this is mind. There were "professional looking" shots long, long, long before Photoshop was ever a thought in some geek's head. The photographer makes professional looking shots with full understanding of light, composition, vision, and knowledge of how to adjust the camera to achieve the vision.<br>  <br>  Sure Photoshop is great, but to answer your question, NO... it is NEITHER about the camera or the program you use. Each is just a tool to be used properly or improperly.<br>  <br>  Your camera is 3 or 4 years old huh? I have a camera in my bag from 1982 that I can get photos with that will rival any taken with any new camera. A good photographer does not need to blame his camera or "program" for his photos.<br>  <br>  If people only needed Photoshop, why would cameras exist beyond a  50 buck point and shoot?<br>  <br>  Sure, a really great camera  will produce better photos when used correctly. But too many people think all they have to do is buy an expensive camera and it will magically take "professional" photos. <br>  <br>  I can go buy a dentist's tools, but would you want me working on your teeth?<br>  <br>  You say you have the basics of lighting "and all that". I must respectively disagree with you. If you DID, you would not even remotely consider asking such a question as this. You would KNOW that magapixels and Photoshop are NOT photography.... YOU are.<br>  <br>  steve

Unless you wanted six lines of ledger along with the tatoo so people could say "that's a C note".  <br>  <br>  The only thing you can choose is between the timing of a note.  A standard quarter note up to a 128th note.  A 128th note is really really fast, while a quarter note is not that fast.  <br>  <br>  Look at all the music symbols available here:<br>  <a href="http://www.dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols....</a><br>  <br>  You could get "believe" spelled out with notes in a creative way.  Using upside down 8th and 16th and quarter notes could let you spell that out.

cKzfxE0Zaa	I don't need to focus on any specific time period. Liberalism has a general trend that always manifests.<br>  <br>  First, there's the pre-liberal period. Conquest. Radical nationalism. War of independence. Nation building. Traditions arise organically from experience and are based on what actually works.<br>  <br>  Then come the liberals. They start with a country forged in battles in which they had no part and with a culture based on traditions that have proved themselves over generations. Then, thinking themselves wise, they start making changes, chopping away all the safeguards, destabilizing all values in pursuit of their ideology.<br>  <br>  Liberals are a bunch of smarty-pants who start with a country and a culture that works well and turns it into a ruin that does not work at all. Liberals insist on being judged by their goals, by their promises, and not by their record or by their results. Every time they fail, liberals blame somebody else, somebody who disagrees with them, someone who questions them.<br>  <br>  Liberalism can be thought of as a destructive kind of radicalism, a radicalism that tears down differences of status or of circumstances that are a natural result of a functioning civilization. The liberals usually cover their destructiveness with appeals to people's sentiments on account of "fairness" or "social justice" or something of that kind. But what they actually do is deny resources to those who are best equipped to use them in making contributions to culture which endure for ever, and give those resources instead to others who do nothing except eat, poop, and breed poor human quality into the next generation.<br>  <br>  No civilization has ever come into existence through liberalism, and none ever will.<br>  <br>  Conservatism is a weak, inadequate reaction to liberalism. Conservatism is not radical. The liberals hit and bite and scratch. The conservatives merely say "Owie! That hurts! Quit!" and try to cover the hurting places with their hands. Every controversy of public policy is, in the first place, instigated by liberals. The battles rage in the streets and in the courts. The liberals don't always get everything they want, but the do get a little of what they wanted. And the conservatives never really fight to recover the lost ground. Instead, they adjust to the new status quo. And, after a brief time, the liberals launch a new crusade to get a bit more liberalism into public policy. Step by step, inch by inch, the liberals gain ground and the conservatives lose it, until the people who call themselves "conservatives" are really nothing more than a paler shade of liberal themselves.<br>  <br>  Nationalism is the constructive radical opposite to liberalism. It's how all nations come into being from peoples who previously had been politically inchoate. Nationalism builds. Liberalism tears down. Nationalism seems harsh, sometimes, but the results are good. Liberalism seems fair on the surface, but the results are foul.<br>  <br>  When you look for a symbol of nationalism, think of Aragorn in J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy "Lord of the Rings," grimly swinging his sword and slaying orcs, then walking over the piles of their bodies to create the human world of the Fourth Age. It's fiction, but it makes a good metaphor. For a symbol of liberalism, think of Saruman, who broke up his white robe into a robe of many colours and began dabbling in forces he could neither understand nor control, thinking himself wise and competent, but in reality being the foolish tool of Sauron. As to who "Sauron" might be in the real world, I'll leave the question as an exercise to the student.

I was a kid in the 60's and remember how some people my family knew would rant and rave against Black people because of what they heard on the news about the Civil Rights movement. So it could be either one.<br>  <br>  But in general, I would say (as a white person) Black people are much better off today than in the days before the CIvil Rights movement. I hope I am right.

The German people were kept in a state of denial, almost in a fantasy world, so they did not realize what was happening until it was too late. Hitler blamed Polish "terrorists" for provoking his attack in 1939, and the Nazis probably started the Reichstag fire which was used as an excuse to take away many of the German people's civil liberties.
5ewRYE4Jaa	In the second stanza Blake writes;<br>  Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves<br>  The feet of angels bright;<br>  Unseen they pour blessing,.....<br>  ------<br>  And then the stanza you ask about reads;<br>  <br>  When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br>  They pitying stand and weep;<br>  Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br>  And keep them from the sheep.<br>  But if they rush dreadful,<br>  The angels, most heedful,<br>  Receive each mild spirit,<br>  New worlds to inherit.<br>  ----<br>  <br>  The literal meaning is that the angels are standing by, watching the wolves and tigers stalk their prey. The angels strive to lessen the need for hunting, however if the tiger or wolf does strike at the sleeping sheep then the angels cannot do anything save guide (receive) each spirit and lead them to the afterlife.<br>  <br>  The more hidden meaning is likely that the tigers and wolves are human predators, and the sleeping sheep human victims. The angels are trying to restrain the human predators from going out and murdering people, however if the predator chooses of his own free will to commit murder then the angels can do nothing to stop him, and can only help ease the journey of the one who dies. Remember, the title of the poem is Night, which implies not just a lack of daylight, but also a possible darkening of the soul.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

gW0nD5cEaa	Taking away of basic freedoms, no freedom of the press, or speech, saying that somebody disagrees with a dictator could lead somebody to prison or even death. It depends on what the facism really is, who gets the worst of it. Under the Nazis, Jewish people were targeted for extermination, the Facists under Mussolini were not much better. Communism and Facism, while different on an ecconomic level are very similar in taking away of freedoms, speech, press, and often in Communist countries all religions, in Facist countries, some religions like Judaism might be outlawed and some Christians might thrive if they agree with the dicatator. Others who oppose the government can be persecuted or imprisoned or killed for not going along with the government on things.

Brutus' mentality of "sacrificing" Caesar for the freedom and benefit of all the Romans could easily be likened to Robespierre's concept of killing Louis XIV: "Louis ought to perish rather than a hundred thousand virtuous citizens; Louis must die, so that the country may live."<br>  And we all know how well the French Revolution turned out.<br>  So, I suppose it teaches us that violence begets violence.

KBBonf97aa	Don't put too much stock into the positioning of your thumb, since each guitarist eventually figures out the most comfortable way for him or her to play effectively.  My guitar teacher told me the same thing yours told you, but having my thumb precariously perched in the middle of the neck made me feel like I was going to drop the guitar, so I disregarded that instruction.  Most of the time, my thumb sits on the top edge of the neck.  As long as it doesn't interfere with the E string, it isn't a problem.<br>  <br>  Just keep playing and follow your instincts.  Let your thumb decide where it belongs.  If it interferes with the E string, you'll just naturally start moving it back a little bit until you find a happy middle ground.  Try not to overthink the issue, since that will suck the joy out of playing.  Good luck!|`|Ow3O7h4caa	The thumb should be roughly in the center with the first joint slightly bent so that you can add pressure as if you were trying to dig your fingernail in the wood LOL.<br>  If your finger sticks out above the neck, how do you play a riff on the 6th string ? Your thumb has to move down in order to play on the 6th string. <br>  Having said that, if you are bending notes and playing pull-off etc.. on the first 3 strings, it is normal to have your thumb the way you describe it because you have to apply pressure to  bend or raise the string.<br>  What I said was applying to a long riff from the 1st to the 6th string which makes it awkward to keep your thumb above the fingerboard. As long as you are comfortable and it doesn't hamper your speed, everything is cool. :-)|`|W2YtVUqKaa	yeah my thumb position just depends on how im playing. sometimes it's looped and sometimes it's behind. i find it easier to bar thing if i have it behind the neck but otherwise it doesn't really matter to me|`|f279e76fb473e663c0561d5e2597318baa	Dude, i know this sounds crazy but teachers dont know s.h.i.t. You dont need to keep your thumb anywhere, let it go where it wants to and in a couple of days you'll be playing perfectly fine.
B8Gwxo1laa	Feuding between samurai warrior clans finally led to collapse of the nominal central government at Kyoto, and for the purpose of restoring order, the emperor appointed the leader of the victorious samurai faction, Minamoto Yoritomo, Japan's first shogun or military commander in 1185. While a form of civil government continued under the emperor at Kyoto, it exercised no real authority, and the shogun was in reality the military dictator of Japan supported in power by his samurai warrior vassals. The title of shogun became hereditary, and this form of military dictatorship endured in Japan until 1867 when the last shogun resigned and the emperor was restored to power.<br>  <br>  Pretty powerful.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	For most of Japanese history, the Emperors have been figureheads with little or no true political or military power. The shoguns ran the empire.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I posted an answer on your other question  :)<br>  <br>  You might want to think about posting this question on the "Classic Cameras" forum on Photo.net.  You have to register to post topics in the forums, but it's free.  There are a lot of very friendly, knowledgeable people there who could help you.  That was where I learned how to develop film!  They have also been a huge help with answering my questions about my vintage cameras. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://photo.net/classic-cameras-forum/" rel="nofollow">http://photo.net/classic-cameras-forum/</a><br>  <br>  Like with your other question, I would recommend a Yashica A.  It has completely manual aperture and shutter speed controls.  It's a very nice, solid, all-metal camera.  And it has great optics...I'm always amazed at the pictures I can take with it.  It takes very sharp, detailed pictures.  A million times sharper than what you can get with your Holga camera!  (Actually, pretty much any decent camera will take better pictures than a lomography camera!  The Holga has a plastic lens!)<br>  <br>  MixedMojo was completely wrong...you can definitely find a TLR in good condition for around $50 or $60, if you look hard enough.  There is nothing wrong with eBay.  I bought my Yashica A camera on eBay for about $65, and it works perfectly.  In fact, I bought almost all my cameras on eBay, and they all work fine.  Just read the description carefully, and check to be sure that the seller has a high feedback rating.  But I have not had any problems at all on eBay.  So that is one place to look.  You can also try antique shops and camera shops, but medium format cameras are getting really popular right now for some reason, and even vintage cameras tend to be WAYoverpriced in camera shops.  I went to one used camera shop, and they wanted $300 for a Yashica A!  I looked on eBay, and I ened up finding one in even better condition for $65.<br>  <br>  Here is my Yashica A camera.  It's in great condition, and I use it all the time for my landscape photos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/gatewaycityca/FILE0330b_small-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/ga...</a>  <br>  <br>  And here is a picture I took with the Yashica A.  This will at least give you an idea of how sharp it is.  (And the actual print is a lot better than the scan).  I took this with black and white film.  I developed the film myself.<br>  <br>   <br>  <a href="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/gatewaycityca/Big_Bear_Lake_6_8_2008_b_small.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/ga...</a>  <br>  <br>  Whatever TLR camera you decide to get, be sure it takes 120 film.  There are some TLR's that used 626 film.  626 is basically the same as 120 film, except that the spools are a little different size.  You would have to either re-spool 120 yourself...or you can also buy re-spooled film, but it's expensive.  It's much easier just to get a camera that uses 120 film.  (The Yashica A uses 120 film).  You can easily order 120 film online, and most good camera shops will sell it too.<br>  <br>  If you really like medium format film cameras, you might also want to think about getting a folding camera, like a Zeiss Ikon Nettar.  But they tend to be more valuable to collectors, and they can sell for higher prices.|`|bocePfyYaa	I am afraid you aren't going to find a medium format camera for that price no matter how old it is. Unless you get lucky and stumble upon one at a garage sale being run by a moron. You can barely get an old used 35mm SLR for $50. I see old canon t-70 and t-90 models that won't use modern lenses going for around $100. You need to add another zero to your figure and then you will be in the right range. I have seen mamiya going for around $500 on craigslist.|`|WaJdOaFKaa	I'm sorry, my answer was totally, and completely misleading.  In fact, I'm a big FAKE.  Gatewaycityca's answer is totally and completely RIGHT.  You should listen to him because he's a genius.  He emailed me and set my ways straight like an arrow.  I wish I was more like him and his pal namedeletedbyrequest.  They are the only photographers here that you should take seriously.  I'm just a moron with a big thumbs down on my forehead.<br>  <br>  Sure, go on ebay and get yourself a $50 medium format camera and you'll get years of enjoyment out of it.  Here, knock yourself out: <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/_W0QQ_dmptZFilmQ5fCameras?_nkw=medium+format&_sacat=0&_fromfsb=&_trksid=m270.l1313&_odkw=medium+format+film+camera&_osacat=0" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/items/_W0QQ_dmptZFi...</a>|`|iqyNCVwIaa	Try and look around for an old Rolliecord at yard sales and flea markets.

This has a waist level viewfinder which can be stunning and it is the cheapest thing you will find. Best of luck! <3|`|z70Mvu5yaa	I think you mean a 35mm camera.  Medium format refers to a larger film size, 6cm that pros use.  Doubtful you could find a used one in that price range.<br>  I highly recommend a Pentax K-1000.  You can get one used at a very fair price, it is manual control with changeable lenses, and they are mechanically dependable, solid and great quality.  Good luck.|`|C77c0OE2aa	I couldn't help but chuckle when I read this. Usually everyone who gets a Holga as their first medium format camera does one of two things,<br>  <br>  1. Hate it, throw it away and never use film, or at least medium format film, again<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2. Get hooked on medium format and want a camera better than the Holga to pursue the format with. I applaud you for realizing that the Holga is a long way from how good medium format can be and wanting to get a better camera.<br>  <br>  I'm not coming down on Holgas, in fact, I think some of the best shots I have ever taken were with it, but it is very limiting and restricts you as to what you can do.<br>  <br>  You may want to search for Mamiya 645E cameras. These are pretty basic, all manual cameras, but the lenses are great and they will take a photo as well as a camera with all the bells and whistles. <br>  <br>  I'm now using a Mamiya 645AFD because I do like auto film advance and my eyesight is not so good for manual focus. If this screwy economy gets back on it's feet again, I may get into a RZ67 system.<br>  <br>  Have fun and KEEP SHOOTING FILM !!! Be an ARTIST instead of someone playing a digital video game!<br>  <br>  steve|`|0qYY7cdzaa	Here is an eBay list <a href="http://photography.shop.ebay.com/items/Film-Cameras__tlr_W0QQ_catrefZ1QQ_flnZ1QQ_fromfsbZQQ_sacatZ15230QQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em282" rel="nofollow">http://photography.shop.ebay.com/items/F...</a> .<br>  The least expensive TLR of good quality is the Yashica Mat 124, the Mamiya TLRs would be the next level of quality and cost followed by the Rollei.

You have to have some idea of where you're going.<br>  <br>  Apart from that you can do pretty much anything.<br>  <br>  Just remember that a scene should open in an interesting way, like with a person sitting on stage alone for a short time which intrigues the audience.<br>  <br>  It also must contain some sort of conflict or tension to engage the audience.

DvToP5h7aa	Of Mice and Men - John Steinbeck<br>  <br>  About Lennie Small:<br>  <br>  …Lennie's character also raises myriad questions, like how he conceives of his relationship with George, and whether the dream farm is a real life goal for Lennie or simply an opportunity to have rabbits all his own. Further, Lennie's comfort with (or obliviousness to) death is odd, as introduced by the first scene with the dead mouse in pocket. That's a hint that we should be curious about Lennie's relationship with death - it's unclear whether "life" in the abstract sense is really that important to Lennie, or if friendship, comfort, and things to pet trump more life-and-death considerations. (Would Lennie find a life without those things satisfying at all?) That brings us to Lennie's way of loving, which is a little too hard and a little too long for anyone to handle. And, as a result, several mice, a puppy, and one woman pay the price.<br>  <br>  Full Character Summary:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character/literature/john-steinbeck/of-mice-and-men/lennie-small.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...</a>|`|kJ80vsVNaa	i read this book too and i saw the movie<br>  <br>  lennie is pretty much "mentally disabled"<br>  and hes a really big guy, and strong, in the beginning it says<br>  george is walking and behind him is his opposite, george is small<br>  so the opposite of that is big so lennie is just big and strong|`|tlBBwNwTaa	Animals such as horses work hard all day and contribute nothing intellectual.

j5Apt8hWaa	Learning any technique is always good to do, but how often you use them will be up to you.  There are NO new ideas ... just variations on a theme.  Don't ever feel guilty for anything you do or learn to do.  It is all part of learning.<br>  <br>  If the technique is too cliché, you may want to avoid it so you don't look like all those who are rushing to make all their images into HDRI or using selective colour.<br>  <br>  There are some times, maybe once every decade that a photographer may use such a technique, but used too often, rather than those techniques being part of a style, they fall into the over used cliché box.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	If the guest speaker doesn't hold a patent or copyright on the technique then you have every right to use it.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with using an idea even when it isn't your own, original idea. <br>  <br>  Be proud of the original work you've created.|`|xcw4EBalaa	As one who is often on the other side of that equation - as a guest speaker or teacher - I can tell you that if I show or teach a technique or style I've discovered or appropriated from someone else, I'm more than happy to have you use it.<br>  <br>  There's nothing precious about such things.  People who think their latest technique is unique to them are simply not paying attention.<br>  <br>  Artistic expression isn't about a specific process or technique.  It's about how one uses any and all techniques available to them to express something in a meaningful way.<br>  <br>  If I share a technique or style with you, and you take it to a new, higher level ... that's great!|`|n71t0xoCaa	Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery how many people try to copy things from the way Ansel Adams for example did it. Add to that that he freely shared how to do it so he is not looking at it as his sole providence. It would be nice if you put a blurb in there of the effect "Images in the style of __________________  whose work I have always admired,"<br>  and thank him/her for sharing the info or mentoring you in the technique but thas not required. One thing about photography community that is so great is the willingness of photographers to share information or teach <br>  But they are your images, your composition and your work|`|LLqTeW70aa	I should say as it is. This guest speaker inspired me to this. I think the idea of telling of technique is that others can benefit from it and also develope it.|`|i5OVORXgaa	It's okay to post them... just remember to cite the original artist (in the style of _______).|`|lHveTPFOaa	yes, nothing is new anymore, every idea has been used. you should experitment with the technique, i bet you will find something that you think up on your own that will look even better because it will be your style and your images. the instructor ment for his method to be a jumping off point for you to get started and then come up with your own thing.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Absolutely it's a good idea!  My instructor tells us that there's nothing that we're doing now that hasn't been done in the past.  That may sound harsh but it's true... so why not be proud of your work?<br>  <br>  I say post it in all it's glory.
kUZIWRfZaa	This is Art we're talking about here! You're an Artist! You should appreciate the human body, as everyone should whether it be male or female. If he's in better shape than you...all the more to appreciate his body, that doesn't mean he's better than you and that doesn't make you "gay." What if he gets an erection...who's to say it isn't because there is a beautiful woman in the room....who's to say he doesn't find YOU attractive? What difference does it make, it's a pose, not a love connection. So what if you get an erection...have you ever watched porn and got an erection? There are men in those scenes as well! Touching and feeling another human body will get you aroused...that's a human quality, be glad you have it...some people take viagra for those kind of problems. Don't be ashamed, this is ART! <br>  Your fears are normal, but don't let them hinder your performance. And if anyone has anything to say about it, laugh with them all the way to the bank, while they wait outside! I say do it and GOOD LUCK!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	i've never understood why you have to pose nude.<br>  you could wear boxers couldn't you?|`|ynCJxyagaa	Posing with another male should not be a matter of concern but I would be concerned that the nature of the pose was in no way pornographic or in any way sexually suggestive.

HSIi8qOWaa	Well!!! I am the QUEEN of obscure music.By obscure, I mean that not many people have heard of them/listen to them. I'll give you some of my favorites!!!<br>  <br>  Bad Religion- "I want to conquer the world"-- punk band that has been around for a long time that centralizes in political themes. I love all of their music. One of their more recent hits is called "Sorrow"<br>  <br>  Ben Folds- "There's always someone cooler than you"-- I love this song! It makes all my trendy friends uncomfortable but it's hilarious. Once again, I love most of his stuff, along as the stuff he did with his old band Ben Folds Five.<br>  <br>  Bird and the Bee- "Again and Again"-- Bubbly pop/technoish song that is perfect for the girly girl in all of us!<br>  <br>  Damien Rice- "The Blower's Daughter"-- Wonderful, folky song that is sure to stir your emotions. This song was the main song in the film Closer with Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, etc.<br>  <br>  The Dandy Warhols- "Bohemian Like You"-- This is a great, funky pop song. I love bumping this up in the car and dancing around in my seat like a goofball.<br>  <br>  Eisley- "Trolley Wood"-- This is one of my favorite bands. They cater to the little girl inside with whimsical, fairy-tale-like lyrics. I love almost all of their stuff. Room Noises is their best album in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Louis XIV- "The Grand Apartment"-- This is a funky, laid-back, groovin' song. It amuses me.<br>  <br>  Lucky Boys Confusion- "Anything, Anything"-- This is a cover of a song from the 80s, but I love this version more. I've been a fan of LBC for many years, and I feel that they should be more successful than they are. Check out their albums from Throwing the Game onward. The albums before that have poor editing quality.<br>  <br>  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes- "Uptown Girl"-- This band is my all-time favorite punk cover band. They cover a ton of songs that we all know, such as: "My boyfriend's back", "I believe I can fly", "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", and TONS more!<br>  <br>  Say Anything- "Belt"-- If you are into alternative sounding bands, and you are intrigued by a wide vocabulary in lyrics, I suggest Say Anything. These guys are NOT afraid to use 4 syllable words in their lyrics. I study English, so I appreciate a band that is able to use language as well as they do. They have a great sound, and I highly recommend them.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!! Happy Listening!|`|2Z7eXVeWaa	You like guitar music? Go with Buckethead, it's amazingly awesome. Whatever mood you're in, he's got it. There's chill music, easy listening, sad, crazy, angry, happy, weird, pretty...all kinds. Check him out for real! He's got lots and lots of albums of different types. No lyrics to worry about, don't need 'em, the music is the lyrics.

Carlo planned everything right down to the Illuminati's "resurfacing". remember? it says there that the church acquired the brands.<br>  <br>  he had access to these brands and the unnamed killer was his unsuspecting pawn.<br>  <br>  the fib about God speaking to him is just part of his front. because he knows exactly where the antimatter is right from the start.<br>  <br>  3) the new pope hid the truth from the public.

eezP5wQ2aa	...Yes, oops! then i woke up...|`|nW3iJkT5aa	If you knew me you would understand perfection <br>  I am also very modest|`|bxlYleZkaa	Define perfection?|`|LGkb4xibaa	perfect is a moveable goal and is a thing of relevance. To one person i would be perfect. To another i would be ghastly. What i find perfect for today, in ten years time i might find awful.  <br>  <br>  I would never look for a perfect person. Perfect people do not exist, but if they did and i found someone perfect it would creep me!<br>  <br>  But traits i consider valuable in a person are:<br>  Loyalty<br>  Faithful<br>  Trustworthy<br>  Funny<br>  Kind<br>  Animal lover<br>  Generous<br>  Open minded<br>  Pacifist<br>  Gentle<br>  Open with emotions<br>  <br>  Perfect to me is something that makes me happy, and that i can rely on and that is stable. Be that a person, thing or situation.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	I often see my friends as perfect before I get to know them better. We are always striving for perfection but the very fact that we care so much about it denotes that we can't possibly be perfect because caring about almost impossible and rather unnecessary goals is imperfect in itself. <br>  <br>  Perfection is unachievable.|`|YmtNel5haa	Congratulations!  You're not perfect!  It's ridiculous to want to be perfect anyway.  But then, everybody's ridiculous sometimes, except perfect people.  You know what perfect is?  Perfect is not eating or drinking or talking or moving a muscle or making even the teensiest mistake.  Perfect is never doing anything wrong - which means never doing anything at all.  Perfect is boring!  So you're not perfect!  Wonderful!  Have fun!  Eat things that give you bad breath!  Trip over your own shoelaces!  Laugh!  Let somebody else laugh at you!  Perfect people never do any of those things.  All they do is sit around and sip weak tea and think about how perfect they are.  But they're really not one-hundred-percent perfect anyway.  You should see them when they get the hiccups!  Phooey!  Who needs 'em?  You can drink pickle juice and imitate gorillas and do silly dances and sing stupid songs and wear funny hats and be as imperfect as you please and still be a good person.  Good people are hard to find nowadays.  And they're a lot more fun than perfect people any day of the week.  ~Stephen Manes, Be a Perfect Person in Just Three Days!|`|5Eb8Zlqmaa	In the immediate sense, perfection is not possible. I often find myself believing we find more of perfection in knowing we are imperfect, than anything.<br>  In terms of battling with the dictionary, perfection is not simply 'flawless' but rather being at your highest state of excellence in a certain field. It could also mean that it is the most nearly state of perfection. <br>  Meaning, this word can take on different definitions for each individual. For example, someones form of perfection in art could seem at a more visual height than someone else. Their painting could display in frame at the grandest museum, while the world admires it and calls it a masterpiece, and says it is 'perfect.'<br>  However, a little kid could slap their hand in some paint and put it on paper and find the same result from their mother. She could frame it, put it somewhere where it is highly visible to anyone and gloat over her child's accomplishment. To her, the picture is 'perfect'. <br>  <br>  So it's all about perception. And if I add in the common perception of today's social society, you will not accomplish very much perfection. You can get the latest styles, surgeries to 'fix' your body, learn the walk and talk the talk, but something new will always come along. It seems nothing is ever good enough.<br>  <br>  I'll leave it with my belief - contentment, is perfection. When you are able to be happy with yourself and whatever it is you are capable of, regardless of anyone else and their opinions upon you.|`|4Ka4Mqo5aa	Perfection is not possible otherwise the human race would surely have now achieved it.  Arguably as the human race as progressed technologically in so many fields it has simply led to a greater awareness of our moral imperfections.  Biologically we will never be perfect because we age and decay, we might try to slow this process down to try and achieve that 'perfect' look for longer but ultimately however much we spend on facial creams etc the aging process will beat us.  Intellectual perfection is also impossible because we will never be able to be in a position where we could say with certainty that we have discovered all knowledge that is possible in all intellectual fields.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	One can become perfect, but this is something very far away from most and is something gained through great strides of self development, self work. <br>  <br>  Perfection is when one has achieved completion, when all of the parts of self, every aspect of their mind and being is harmoniously developed and the whole "man" attains a fullness. One could say that each birth is a sort of perfection, where the baby reaches its completion under the conditions of the womb, having gained the proper development which transcends the womb and makes way for its entrance into the world by becoming "fully developed" in order to BE in the World, be born into it. This birth is one and it illustrates the next birth, which is of our minds. Like the baby we are developing within a "womb" -- and must attain the "fully developed" Mind to be born into the Higher World, which would be our Higher Self. And this continues until we reach the final birth, from which there are no others. <br>  <br>  Born from a womb into a womb, into a world from a world, until one reaches their Omega and units it with their Alpha. Perhaps this was too complex for this question. The Perfect that people talk about is not really objective, it deal with their likes and dislikes, often dealing with polarity, conditioning, etc. Sometimes to them someone is perfect, then when that someone does something they don't think is good, they are no longer perfect.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	I've never met anyone perfect but I have a friend who in my opinion is the nearest thing; she's thoughtful, clever, generous, funny, encouraging and has a beautiful smile, but she tends to swear quite a bit !<br>  <br>  I don't think perfection is about physical features at all, I've met alot of girls who are really pretty but are absolutely horrible! Definitions of perfection will vary from person to person but I think it's the little imperfections that get people noticed|`|RvzPVV98aa	To be perfect, is a feat that is impossible at least in this dimension, if an individual believes that he/she has reached perfection they will no doubt find a philosophical loophole within their illusion of faultlessness, if someone where to destroy everything in the Universe except itself, at that point only will a human or something else will reach absolute perfection in his/her universe.|`|6YuktLyNaa	There's no sense in wanting to be perfect by doing so you'll only become less perfect.  Instead you should look at adding things to improve yourself rather than taking away things you don't like about yourself.|`|2GHiNpHFaa	Rob pattinson is perfect look wise . A guy in my biology class is perfect body wise . And my best friend is perfect personality wise :)<br>  Perfection is a little aesthetic to me :P|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Perfection should be the unachievable goal in all you do.|`|2MoUcXv8aa	Perfection is different for each and every living creature. For example, my girlfriend is perfect FOR ME but other men wouldn't like her even though I think they should... Perfection is possible if it gets to a point where you want for nothing in life and just enjoy living it completely.

UKNTYisAaa	Reaching to your toes. Do it everyday<br>  sit on the floor, put both legs in front of you<br>  then put or position one of your legs to your<br>  side and reach to that leg that is on the side.|`|2kV8WdYUaa	What you can do is take one leg in front of you and stretch it out and the other leg in the back half bent. Then you put both hands out towards the middle of your leg and stretch and also you can put one hand on each side of your body while your doing that and just keep lifting till you look like your doing a split but your not your just stretching you mid section.  Another one is sit on the floor with both feet together touching and take you hands and hold your ankles. Then take you elbows and push your thighs down.  Another one is to lay on your side with both feet extend.   Start with the right. Then swing one leg around (the one on the top)to  the left side of your body like your going into a split.  Then act like your going to sit in that split, but your not your just pressing down.  Then bring the left leg around and do it from the left.  That's called a split walk|`|gXO9aUoOaa	Okay so basically. i am a rhythmic gymnast, the best stretches to try are the splits, but dont push your self to hard, also some other good ones are.<br>  You put your right (or left) leg bent in front of you (make sure its 90 degrees.) the stretch you left (or right) leg out the back. and push your hips to the floor. also a extra bit to this one put your elbows on the floor. it stretches more.<br>  You can also do what us gymnasts call 'Super splits' where you put your leg up on a block (atleast 10-30 cm of the ground(size varies depending on level of flexibility)) Then you slide down into splits.<br>  If you hold this one for 10 to 60 second (what ever your comfortable with) it will definately help you get 'flat' in no time at all.<br>  <br>  Dont know if you knew these ones. <br>  But i thought i would contribute.|`|xnHvrjQFaa	Ok, So i'm a dance team captain and can do all three splits, so...yeah, I know alot about splits. lol.<br>  I would suggest a straddle streach.<br>  Also, the one where you lie on your back and pull your leg up and hold it there for 30 seconds.<br>  My personal fav, while youre watching TV or listening to music, go into your splits, but put pillows underneath you, and gradually pull each one out until youre all the way down. Works miracles! Make sure to do this, take ten minutes sitting in the split for maximum streaching. <br>  Some wall streaches, like standing, back to the wall, and leaning forward, pulling a leg up backwards and basically doing your splits on the wall helps a ton.<br>  <br>  Thats all.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|AZjXKsfSaa	oo well i do gymnastics so i should now this! u should get a chair  or a couch or anything like that and put  your ( left or right ) leg on it and put your other leg on the ground ( bend it) and go down like your trying to do the splits!do it everyday and for about 10 minutes or more and do it while your watching tv ,so your not bored and if that is easy try to put you arms up!  and once u feel like u got it remove the chair and try to do it on the ground! :)

ZB9zkbxxaa	Period after the American Civil War in which attempts were made to solve the political, social, and economic problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 Confederate states that had seceded at or before the outbreak of war.<br>  <br>  Pres. Abraham Lincoln planned to readmit states in which at least 10% of the voters had pledged loyalty to the Union. This lenient approach was opposed by the Radical Republicans, who favoured the harsher measures passed in the Wade-Davis Bill. Pres. Andrew Johnson continued Lincoln's moderate policies, but enactment in the South of the black codes and demand in the North for stricter legislation resulted in victories for Radical Republicans in the congressional elections of 1866. Congress then passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, which established military districts in the South and required the Southern states to accept the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. Southern resentment of the imposed state governments, which included Republicans, carpetbaggers, and scalawags, and of the activities of the Freedmen's Bureau led to the formation of terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Knights of the White Camelia. By the 1870s conservative Democrats again controlled most state governments in the South. Though Reconstruction has been seen as a period of corruption, many constructive legal and educational reforms were introduced. The Reconstruction era led to an increase in sectional bitterness, dissension regarding the rights of blacks, and the development of one-party politics in the South.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The South had to be completely rebuilt.|`|6TPCpZ0Oaa	1865-1877  reconstruction going on in that period
shVgCizBaa	what is the relevance of nok discoveries in Nigeria?It showed the existence of a great civilization in Africa 2000 years ago------------------------The Nok civilization appeared in Nigeria around 500 B.C. and mysteriously vanished around 200 AD. The civilization’s social system was highly advanced. The Nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta. Nok culture terracottas are heralded as the prime evidence of the refinement of African civilizations, and it is suggested that the society eventually evolved into the later Jos Plateau community. The refinement of this civilization is attested to by the image of a Nok dignitary at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The dignitary is portrayed wearing a "shepherds crook" affixed with an elastic material to the right arm ([3], [4]). The dignitary is also portrayed sitting with flared nostrils, and an open mouth suggesting performance. According to some accounts, based on artistic similarities between early Yoruba art forms and Nok forms, there may be connections between Nok culture and contemporary Jos Plateau people. Later brass and terracotta sculptures of the Ife and Benin cultures show significant similarities with those found at Nok.<br>  <br>  Iron use, in smelting and forging for tools, appears in Nok civilization in Africa by 500 BC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nok_culture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nok_culture</a><br>  The Nok civilization was discovered in 1928 on the Jos PlateauJos Plateau <br>   The first pieces were unearthed but then forgotten.

wKSvnna2aa	It's not confusing at all. I read it when I was a LOT younger than you...in my early teens (I'm 19 now). It's a very unique book about a "story within a story" (metafiction). There are many beautiful and memorable quotes in there too, like "we too are stardust." I enjoyed that book. It really is full of knowledge and wisdom, and makes you think.<br>  <br>  ~Sara|`|rh5vbol9aa	It is very amusing history of the philosophy. I advise you to read. And its very clear.|`|X6nQFXj6aa	On the contrary, you're at a good age. I'm almost 16 now, I read it when I was 13. It is HEAVY with philosophy, but it will pummel your brain into serious thought. I honestly skipped a lot, because plato-chicken talk didn't fit into my little brain, but it's a fascinating and extremely well-put-together book. You'd love it, if you like that kind of thing. Thinking, I guess :P<br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy it! (It has a very gripping beginning, too. And the end is really cool. It's not all bla bla bla, there is some excitement.)
LPsmRI5Oaa	I don't think anyone knows for sure? Millions for sure, if not tens of millions. Over 72 Million people died total during the war.|`|8eZkM8mfaa	You probably mean, how many Russians were killed in WW2. More than 20 Million Soviet citizens, about 13 Million among them were civilians. Almost every family in Russia has at least one member who was killed in this war.|`|KyxulVR0aa	millions died in Russian battles of WW2<br>  <br>  major battles include the battle of kursk because it opened up the lane for russian tanks and troops to take a counter offensive to Germany.<br>  <br>  The battle of Stalingrad (the bloodiest battle in history, over 1.5 million were killed in it). its important because russia defeated the german 6th army.
H5Jrd0siaa	The short answer is the largest Tank battle ever.<br>  <br>  The Germans were attacking the russain lines to exploite a bulge in their line. they were going to perform a large pincer move ,one massive army from the north moving south east, anoth er massive army from the south moving noth west. The russians however knew about the attack and were ready for them by assembling the largest tank army ever,right in their path. The main massive clash was at the village of  Prokhorovka. <br>  This was the debut of the German Panther tank and Ferdinand Elefant tank Destroyer.They also had the usual Tigers,Mk4 and MK3 tanks<br>  The russain s employed the usual T-34 and KV-1 but in massive numbers|`|LPsmRI5Oaa	According to the German Records...<br>  <br>  German: 50,000 Dead, Wounded, or Captured.

iJzIIEdfaa	The other Allies would have been crushed. I don't doubt that the RAF would have superiority over the skies, but once Hitler invaded the country with ground troops, even that would amount to nothing. However a showdown between Hitler and Stalin was inevitable and so the Germans would have eventually lost anyhow.<br>  <br>  BTW Stalin killed 20 million by himself, not in the war|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I don't know the death toll, but if Germany had not been 'distracted' from the war in Western Europe and invaded Russia, the war against Britain may have gone differently, and Britain may have been invaded and fallen to the Nazi's. We don't know if this would have happened, but I have heard at least 20 million Russians died in the War. I don't know how many others died before the invasion or after on all sides.|`|H5Jrd0siaa	Your question is slightly flawed.<br>  <br>  The War stared when Britain declared war on German after it invaded Poland. Note that this was a joint invasion with russia. Stalin and Hitler teamed up to carve up Poland.<br>  Stalins motivation for this was to stall Hitler as he was sure that Hitler wanted to invade russia but russia was not ready. Only after the poland offensive and the drive on france, hitler then turn  on  Russia in operation Barbarosa.[invasion of russia]

wYF6U6qlaa	A.  Stylistically, there aren't many hard-and-fast rules on fiction.  It pretty much comes down to placing your words in a way that accomplishes your goal with the piece.  If your goal is to keep the reader's attention at any cost, then you'll want to keep the pace moving pretty swiftly.  If your goal is to make your reader ruminate on a comparison between their own lives and the lives of a character, then you'll want to include more character development.  Decide what your goal is, then set rules for yourself based on how to execute that goal.<br>  <br>  B. Again, this is a matter of preference based on what kind of work you aim to produce.  But a good way to do this is to use the momentum of the plot to reveal more and more information about the character.  Writers of memoirs are usually very adept at peppering information and action to balance understanding with plot development, so maybe read a few of those for insight.<br>  <br>  In response to your specific question about the news pundit, I think it could be a refreshing take.  The only reservation I have is that I've seen it many times in films, which makes it a very strong visual image, but people may react to it shallowly for that reason.  As a writer, you have the opportunity to direct the reader more pointedly and deliver a greater breadth of communication than the TV.  After all, you can communicate thoughts and feelings without being pigeonholed into audio-visual implements . You have to add the extra facets to the scene yourself.   If you choose to use the television, my advice is to also have something going on in the foreground that weaves the two spaces together. For example, maybe your main character has the TV on as he relaxes in his armchair with his nightly glass of scotch, and in between bits of information offered by the pundit he has a halfhearted conversation with his wife about buying new garden hoses.  That way we get information from the TV, but also learn about the character and the plot.  In other words, don't just conjure a television set and sit your reader in front of it.|`|X6nQFXj6aa	Not necessarily. I'm sick when I read slow-moving, description-heavy and setting-filled openings that only want to build a safe beginning. I like when I walk into a room and there's a tension between two people that kills me wanting to know what just happened. It's like that with a book. I want to be thrown into the story moving fast and feel the feelings immediately. I don't want a lead-up. I try to reflect that in my writing by making it more poetic, les descriptive and to convey the mood or emotions in the way I write. I never know where to find books like that to read! <br>  <br>  However, many authors use that method and many people read it, So I think it's just a case of taste!
f6750e9e12e12bfe07b67ab2bc94d183aa	How about the untimely deaths of the mothers in "Hotel New Hamshire" and the mother that got hit upside the head with a baseball in "A Prayer for Owen Meany"?  In both cases young people lost their mothers at early ages.

R5UIMBvcaa	Telemackhos is another of the many exceptions to the supposed rule that characters in epics are static--that they don't change.  At the beginning of the Odyssey, he is still a boy, and by the end, about six weeks later, he is a man.  The change is largely due to the intervention of Athena, who appears to him first as Mentes, a passing visitor, who puts the idea into his head to go look for his father, and then as Mentor, a family friend, who advises him to protest to the council about the suitors' behavior.  Both these actions are evidence of his transition into adulthood, as he begins to assume adult responsibility for ending the state of affairs in his home.  Once he has addressed the council, the suitors realize that he's a force to be contended with.  It may even occur to them that, if Odysseus is dead, the new king may not be Penelope's second husband, but her and Odysseus' son.  Then his journey has several purposes and results, although finding Odysseus isn't one of them.  After all, Athena has sent him in the wrong direction, and she must know it.  But the journey does show him some of the world away from his little island, introduce him to some famous and already legendary people, and provide him with a broader view of  his father from what he has heard all his life from his mother and his nanny.   It also keeps him safe, since one result of his addressing the council has been that the suitors are now plotting to kill him.   So by the time we last see him for a while, in the home of Helen and Menelaus, he's definitely a more assertive and more sophisticated person than the boy we met early in Book 1.|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Odyssey by Homer Written 800 B.C.E<br>  <br>  Study Guides <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/homer/the-odyssey.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mythweb.com/odyssey/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythweb.com/odyssey/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/odyssey01.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides2/Odyssey.html#Odyssey" rel="nofollow">http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guide...</a>

AA10506154	From what I've been told<br>  Poor people work the fields, so having white skin is a sign of wealth.<br>  <br>  When a woman is aroused, her lip pigment becomes more reddish, which is why they simply painted their lips red.|`|HePkXbV4aa	(I got this article to help you since I can't explain it as well)<br>  <br>  Today, the traditional make-up of the apprentice geisha is one of their most recognizable characteristics, though established geisha generally only wear full white face makeup characteristic of maiko during special performances.<br>  <br>  The traditional makeup of an apprentice geisha features a thick white base with red lipstick and red and black accents around the eyes and eyebrows. Originally the white base mask was made with lead, but after the discovery that it poisoned the skin and caused terrible skin and back problems for the older geisha towards the end of the Meiji Era, it was replaced with rice powder.<br>  <br>  The application of makeup is hard to perfect and is a time-consuming process. Makeup is applied before dressing to avoid dirtying the kimono. First, a wax or oil substance, called bintsuke-abura, is applied to the skin. Next, white powder is mixed with water into a paste and applied with a bamboo brush starting from the neck and working upwards. The white makeup covers the face, neck, and chest, with two or three unwhitened areas (forming a "W" or "V" shape, usually a traditional "W" shape) left on the nape, to accentuate this traditionally erotic area, and a line of bare skin around the hairline, which creates the illusion of a mask.<br>  <br>  After the foundation layer is applied, a sponge is patted all over the face, throat, chest, the nape and neck to remove excess moisture and to blend the foundation. Next the eyes and eyebrows are drawn in. Traditionally charcoal was used, but today modern cosmetics are used. The eyebrows and edges of the eyes are colored black with a thin charcoal; a maiko also applies red around her eyes.<br>  <br>  The lips are filled in using a small brush. The color comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the lips lustre. Rarely will a geisha color in both lips fully in the Western style, as white creates optical illusions and colouring the lips fully would make them appear overly large. The lower lip is colored in partially and the upper lip left white for maiko in her first year, after which the upper lip is also colored. Newly full-fledged geisha will color in only the top lip fully. Most geisha wear the top lip colored in fully or stylized, and the bottom lip in a curved stripe that does not follow the shape of the lip.<br>  <br>  Maiko who are in their last stage of training will sometimes color their teeth black for a short period of time. This practice used to be common among married women in Japan and, earlier, at the imperial court, but survives only in some districts, or even families. While this sounds unsavoury to western ears, it is again at least partly because of the optical illusion generated by white makeup: in contrast, teeth seem very yellow; colouring the teeth black means that they seem to 'disappear' in the darkness of the open mouth. This illusion is of course more pronounced at a distance.<br>  <br>  For the first three years, a maiko wears this heavy makeup almost constantly. During her initiation the maiko is helped with her makeup by either her onee-san or "older sister" (an experienced geisha who is her mentor) or by the okaa-san or "mother" of her geisha house. After this she applies the makeup herself.<br>  <br>  After a maiko has been working for three years, she changes her make-up to a more subdued style. The reason for this is that she has now become mature, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. For formal occasions, the mature geisha will still apply white make-up. For geisha over thirty, the heavy white make-up is only worn during special dances which require her to wear make up for her part.<br>  <br>  I know men sometimes wore the make-up as well in kabuki (since it's only performed by men)|`|t0X1cEh7aa	Tradition and culture, same goes for why they wear Kimonos and have fans.|`|pgseuoE7aa	it was the fashion back then, its not like that anymore though.|`|qwvijKexaa	cause its there new fashion style|`|U7VlmXfQaa	its just part of the traditions of their culture|`|SM5mQs5gaa	its not make up.    i came on their faces a little bit

DmYfr5veaa	Which famine are you talking about? The actual great famine took place in I believe the 14th century, marking the effects of a change in climate called the Little Ice Age.<br>  <br>  The Great Hunger was experience by Ireland from 1845-51. There were plenty of effects, as a significant portion of the country died off. Still others emigrated, and the Irish legacy in this country could be counted as an effect. As a result of starving, many survivors were left mentally ill. The predominantly agrarian economy also sustained a shift from commercial grain production to commercial animal husbandry. <br>  <br>  Hope his helps.<br>  <br>  Brian Fagan's book "The Little Ice Age" would be a good read for either one.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Hunger.
o6IPqzrJaa	well, yes, in theory this could be right, after all not everyone at the ministry was for Voldemort, a lot of them, such as Mr Weasley were against Voldemort, other people, not in the order, might have been fighting against Voldemort too, and I guess there could be some people in MM fighting also, but a raining office could be a drag, a problem, and all, but it's not exactly fighting Voldemort is it? I mean, I understand your theory and everything, but if it had been someone from MM, 1) they were giving the death eaters reasons to threaten other MOM workers, such as Reg, he was threatened that he wouldn't see his wife again if he didn't stop the rain, so that isn't exactly fighting against Voldemort and 2) I don't see how a few rainy offices could affect Voldemort all that much.<br>  still it is an interesting theory, maybe some workers from MM were trying to fight, but personally I don't think they were doing a great job.|`|ybjj5WIhaa	Yeah... why not.

wUq7oinGaa	Hernan Cortez happened.  He was a Spanish conquistador who landed with a small army.  There are four main factors that led to the Aztec's fall.  First, the Spanish had superior weaponry and horses.  Second, the Spanish also introduced virulent diseases into the Aztec population such as smallpox and plague. Third, the Aztecs allowed them to come to Tenochtitlan because the appearance of Cortez and his men aligned with the Aztec's mythology.  They believed that he was the second coming of Quetzalcoatl.  Finally, the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, and a lot of it.  Because of that the surrounding tribes helped the Spanish overthrow them.|`|OLcXtWQyaa	their civilization was destroyed by the Spanish. the people are still very much alive. their language, Nahuatl ,is still spoken. they are probably the largest aboriginal group in Mexico.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	The conquistadors nearly wiped them out with disease, slave labor, putting down rebellions and forced conversions.

Get over it.|`|fVVtJQQsaa	I am so tired too, especially those preteen girls going crazy and having nothing better to do than obsess over Twilight, like honestly read ANOTHER BOOK! , because that is the only 4 books that they probably have ever read and i get so mad when they obsess over it like its just a book! geez|`|PtfaM7jEaa	i love twilight but i am tired of the war going on here about it|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Yes. I wouldn't mind them so much ... after all, there's a lot of mediocre literature out there ... but the obsessive reaction to them makes me want to steer clear completely.<br>  <br>  Is the whole "sparkling" thing really that much of a turn-on for young girls? Really? <br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but he's not a well-written character. There's no way a 100-year-old vampire falls madly in love with a plain, clumsy 17-year-old girl. I'm all for fantasy stories, but the plot has to be at least be plausible.<br>  <br>  What baffles me the most is how girls think he's the ideal man. Kids, he's a stalker. If someone watched you sleeping in real life, you'd call the cops. <br>  <br>  It's a story about control and obsession, not love. It's sad that so many young girls don't see that while they're busy swooning over The Sparkly Vampire Who Just Wants To Cuddle. <br>  <br>  It's also an insult to women. The author keeps telling us that a woman is nothing without a man to make her complete, and to swoop in and rescue her every time she trips over a crack in the sidewalk. If I were a girl, I'd be offended by such an anti-feminist sentiment.|`|E0GfSbFsaa	Well, I am one of the people who read it BEFORE the movie was even considered, so I am also pissed about the fan BOOM. Everyone thinks that they are so awesome because they read them at all...    even if it was a week before the shitty movie came out-ugh. And they AREN'T the best out there, although they are one of my favorite series, there are also the Blue Bloods novels and the Uglies novels, and John Steinback Novels! No offense, and I do agree with you, but I am also tired of people asking this question on Yahoo Answers...|`|h28dMdYfaa	i do love twilight but i hate how the only reason most people like it is because of edward. and how everyone is just "twilight twilight twilight!" everywhere you look! it's so annoying. if you're going to like a movie or book, at least like it for more than the boys!!! please|`|JnIy1uFyaa	I enjoy the books, but I am tired of all the teams and Edward and "I wanna be a vampire!" things. <br>  <br>  Sure I like them, I still do! I think they are good, but I am not all fan-girly over them.|`|b7a146ef697ee51a64d659330e1ba1ebaa	I'm sick of seeing Twilight questions everywhere, including ones like this.<br>  <br>  It's just adding to the masses.|`|4yQrkkv7aa	so overrated. I'm sick of it now.|`|KtS7SUDWaa	*gives you a cookie* :)|`|c9xy59Ymaa	Yes.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Don't worry New Moon will be a terrible movie, Christ Weitz will destroy Twilight series just like he destroyed The Golden Compass. <br>  <br>  Edward Cullen is in fact what every woman wants and you are correct in the long run it isn't what a woman wants at all.  I have all ready written up some key points to this but I'll some it up in a very simple quick way. <br>  <br>  Edward Cullen is a poster of Orlando bloom in a Tweeni girls room.  He is constantly there, watching you while you sleep with his perfect hair and strong chin.  Sensitive looking but also strong and mighty like a protector. He doesn't disagree with you, he doesn't commit his poster self to another girls room and he doesn't judge your looks because no matter what you think you are perfect.  Eventually though every tweeni girl grows up and realizes that Orlando Bloom was a very shallow and pointless part of lord of the rings.  They leave there room and there pretty boy poster fantasy and go out and experience what you might call..living an actual life.  Bella never did that, and the people that do actually live often look back and think...why did I want that again?  <br>  <br>  ...eh anyways to answer you question yes I'm tried of it as well.|`|FYkvRaSyaa	Team Edward vs. Team Jacob...? What the flip...? I knew there where fans of the book (from what i heard the movie sucked)....But thats a bit enough. Twilight is a good series but I agree with you guys...They need to chill out.|`|9TK7GLvUaa	yeah, i just went to the search bar and typed in "Team edward or jacob?" in open question and got 16 results. so i opened all of them and answered saying "Team Leah because like her, i never got my happy ending when everyone else did."<br>  <br>  i mean honestly, the books turn out WAY too perfect for everyone...except Leah. yeah, they're all right to read, but the obsession is making me get really annoyed with them and i'm starting to not like them. <br>  <br>  there are plenty of other books out there that are really good aside from twilight, but people don't give those books the time of day, and it's really quite sad. <br>  <br>  and if you really think about it, if you were a TRUE fan of the book, you wouldn't be on a stupid team. you would like the books all around and like all the characters, not choosing between the two. <br>  <br>  it also bugs me that most of the readers probably didn't even know what half of the words mean. i mean their a bunch of 12 year old middle schoolers who think reading this big book makes them so cool when the entire time they probably didn't understand half of the book. <br>  <br>  okay, now i'm just ranting. but yeah, i pretty much agree with you. the books are good...but to a point. every time i reread one of them it just gets worse and worse so if i keep doing that i'll probably eventually hate them. oh well.

Obama being president doesn't really make a hell of a lot of difference in the lives of the average Negro as far as discrimination is concerned. I am a Native American and live in Los Angeles where I don't really face much discrimination. Where ever there is a huge concentration of Indians such as near the reservations you will find the most discrimination. I don''t think there is a lot that can be done to relieve the discrimination problem.<br>     As for famous Americans - President Obama claims to part Cherokee.
cR8UZdi1aa	Sounds like an interesting project!<br>  Have you tried your local newspapers? They will sell older newspapers from their archives, it might cost a bit though. Also if you want to "write" out on newspaper materials, try getting "Newsprint" paper tablets at your local art supply stores. We use this in college art drawing classes for quick unimportant type drawings because the newsprint paper is cheap & isn't made to last, it looks & feels like newspaper & you could also age paper to make it appear old & weathered.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is ask one of Jehovah's Witnesses (YES I'm serious) for older Watchtowers & Awake magazines. There are TONS of articles about Cancer in these magazines, they (or you) can look up the dates of the magazines that discuss the subject of cancer & will most likely be able to find several copies for you. These are Bible based magazines of course, but the articles are always scientific & discusses medical research & personal stories of cancer patients & about the disease in general. <br>  I graduated with a BFA in 2004, a friend of mine was doing her Art-Thesis on Homelessness, she also looked everywhere for articles printed on this, She found very little newspapers on the subject, but she found MANY issues of the Watchtower & Awakes that discussed homelessness & she used all of them throughout the room & her show was a hit! It really did raise awareness for homelessness. So look up your local Kingdom Hall in the phone book & call them, explain to them about your project & I KNOW you will get help in finding articles.<br>  <br>  (Don't freak out about the whole JW thing, people panic when they hear the words Jehovah's Witnesses, but I promise, no one will make you join a club or anything =o) & you might even appreciate how interesting the articles are actually.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

One day in 1922 he happened to have a cold, and a drip from his nose fell into a dish containing a culture of bacteria. Fleming was annoyed that one of his carefully prepared cultures had been ruined. But he was surprised to find that the accidental drip of mucus from his nose had killed off any bacteria it had come in contact with. Fleming isolated the active agent in the mucus. But this agent proved too weak against the main disease-carrying bacilli. <br>  <br>  However, chance favored Fleming yet again--six year later. Contamination from the air "ruined" one of the colonies of staphylococci he was growing, and a mold grew over the bacteria. But where the mold was, there were no staphylococci at all; they had been killed by the wonder drug penicillin. But chance had a big hand in this discovery. If the contaminating spore had not belonged to the rare mold Penicillium notatum and had the culture not been that of a staphylococcus, vulnerable to the antibacterial substance that this mold produces, we might still be awaiting the miracle drug.<br>  <br>  Other accidential discoveries include:<br>  Smallpox vaccination by Edward Jenner<br>  X-Rays by Wilhelm Conrad R?ntgen <br>  Teflon by Roy Plunkett<br>  Microwave (Oven) by Percy LeBaron Spencer <br>  Quinine (anti-malarial drug) by a community of Jesuit missionaries in Lima, Peru.<br>  Potato Chips by George Crum|`|wUq7oinGaa	One accident was the microwave.

LEp7IFdvaa	Wow! that's a tall order...the most important poem of English literature...the most widely read poem of English literature is the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam...but that's a 75 stanza poem, so that's not the one she's referring to.  Beowolf is considered the most important poem of "Old English literature", but it's an epic poem, not a collection of sonnets.  The master of sonnets is, of course, William Shakespeare, but I don't know of any single poem he wrote that's composed of five sonnets. However, there are 5 sonnets by him that she might have meant...they are part of the Passionate Pilgrim Poems...of which only 5 are said to be his.<br>  <br>   It should be interesting to see what she considers the most important poem of English literature.|`|agwxFmITaa	I wonder if it is Beowulf?

Somerset Maugham.<br>  <br>     "It seemed to him that all his life he had followed the ideals that other people, by their words or their writings, had instilled into him, and never the desires of his own heart. Always his course had been swayed by what he thought he should do and never by what he wanted with his whole soul to do. He put all that aside now with a gesture of impatience. He had lived always in the future, and the present always, always had slipped through his fingers. His ideals? He thought of his desire to make a design, intricate and beautiful, out of the myriad, meaningless facts of life: had he not seen also that the simplest pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most perfect? It might be that to surrender to happiness was to accept defeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories."|`|EpGJbHhEaa	I like Anne of Green Gables and the Narnia series too, my favorite in Narnia is The Magicians Nephew.
