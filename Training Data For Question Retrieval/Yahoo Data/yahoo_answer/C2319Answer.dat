6DFhlt4daa	Promtheus Bound (Gk. P. desmts, Lat. P. vinctus), Greek tragedy attributed to Aeschylus, though perhaps completed or even written by another after the former's death in 456 BC. No one in antiquity doubted that it was by Aeschylus, but in several respects the style is markedly different from that of his six other surviving plays. It is the only one of his plays for which there is no didascalic information (see DIDASCALIA) about production, date, and trilogy. It is possible that it was the second play of a connected trilogy, followed by Prometheus lyomenos (P. Unbound), of which a few fragments survive, and preceded by Prometheus pyrphoros (P. Fire-carrier), of which only one line exists, but the order of plays, and even the existence of a connected trilogy, are very uncertain.    Prometheus the Titan, who in the past has aided Zeus to set up his rule over Cronus and the other Titans, has incurred Zeus' anger by becoming the champion of mankind and giving them fire and the arts. In the opening scene of the play, the god Hephaestus, at the order of Zeus, together with Kratos (Power) and Bia (Force), reluctantly nails Prometheus (possibly represented by a huge dummy figure behind which the actor spoke) to a high rock in the Caucasus, to suffer torment for as long as Zeus pleases. The chorus of Oceanid?s, the daughters of the Titan Oceanus, come to grieve with him and comfort him. Oceanus himself also comes, offering to intercede with Zeus if Prometheus will moderate his attitude. Prometheus scornfully rejects his offers, and then enumerates to the chorus all his benefactions to mankind. Another victim of Zeus' tyranny arrives, Io, a mortal whom Zeus has loved and whom Hera, out of jealousy, has made partly cow-like in form. She is doomed to long wanderings pursued by a gad-fly and haunted by the myriad-eyed Argus. Prometheus tells her about her sufferings, about her descendant Heracles who will eventually release Prometheus, and about the fatal marriage which Zeus will one day make unless Prometheus warns him. After Io departs Hermes enters, sent by Zeus to demand from Prometheus the revelation of his secret; although Hermes predicts increased torments for him Prometheus haughtily refuses and is plunged into the abyss with the Oceanides, who decide to share his fate.

889696643460dbe837e2bdc6f6c1a3aeaa	Given your equation you cannot b/c a parabola can only be drawn from a quadratic function (function with x^2 term). There's no x^2 term in your equation therefore a parabola can't be drawn.    But if your equation is -2x^2 -16x -30 then you can draw a parabola by factoring (x-intercepts/zeros) and completing the square to find the vertex.     First set the equation equal to zero like so,  -2x^2 -16x - 30 = 0  Then divide all by -2 to get,  x^2 +8x + 15 = 0  Then factor  (x+3)(x+5)=0  Then solve for x  x= -5 and x= -3  (-5 , 0) and (-3 , 0)    Now you find the vertex (your third point) by completing the square    -2x^2 -16x -30  For now you must ignore the -30  Pull out a -2 from the -2x^2 -16x term to get,  -2(x^2 +8x ) -30   Now complete the square by dividing 8 by 2 to get 4 and then square 4 to get 16, written as  -2(x^2 +8x +16) -30  If you look at the current above equation carefully you really added NEGATIVE 32 because (-2 x 16 = -32).  You must now do the opposite of and add POSITIVE 32 to the 30, like this,  -2(x^2+8x+16) -30 + 32  Rewrite   -2(x^2+8x+16) +2  Now write in vertex form  -2(x+4)^2 +2    Your vertex is therefore (-4,2)     P.S. the 'x' term is negative 4 instead of positive 4 because when x+4=0, 'x' equals negative 4|`|Oc1uvuSzaa	you cant you can either factor it: or convert it to vertex form (which i will do since its easier)    -2(x-8x)+30  8x/2=4  4squared) = 16  -2(x-8x+16-16)+30  -2(x-8x+16) +62  y=-2(x-4)2+62    and you use (4,62){ Vertex} to place the point     i am pretty sure there isnt a way to graph in standard you have to factor it, when you do you get the zeros.    did this stuff last semester !!!! all done now :)

Simplifying 2/6, gives 1/3.    2/3 is 2 times 1/3, hence it's greater.    3/4 is 0.75 which is greater than 1/3(0.33..)    There's another simple way to go about.    Use this method to only verify your answer.    For example, consider 1/3 and 3/4.    Cross multiply them. 1x4 and 3x3                       you get 4 and 9.

If u find this confusing, then go with the earlier method !|`|J7o7FtZdaa	im pretty sure 2 sevenths is because 3/4s is about equal and the 2/3 is bigger and the last two both have 2 as the first number and if there is a bigger number then if  u think about it 2/7 is smaller than 2/6 cause 6 is less than seven. To help u out draw pie charts and u can tell by that and its usually the biggest number that is the smallest unless if its like 5/7 to 1/2 cause 5 is more than half of seven.|`|8ZO8o6Hdaa	A. 2/7|`|cbmkx5Joaa	2/7
BpxY1Tk1aa	It's because people with disabilities are considered "different", and most western countries can't deal with "different". Sometimes it's because they have little education on disabilities, others it's because of religious beliefs that say "you must have done something wrong for this to happen" and look down upon that family.    Both my older and younger sisters are autistic and my younger also has cerebral palsy. Often times in school they struggled with their teachers and classmates because they had very little to no educations on the matter.  My little sister would often come play with me or I found her crying in the playground in primary because her 'friends' up and left her.  However when we changed schools she went into a class that had been taught about disabilities the year before and all of a sudden she was being treated like everyone else, they were delighted to have her there because they understood.  My grandmother is one of the religious ones that I suggested earlier. She has always attacked my mum because she thinks mum must be a demon filled woman for this to happen. She's even got on dad's (her son) case a few times blaming both of them for the disabilities my sisters have.  We also have friends who go by the faith teaching - you have disabilities in the family because you do not have enough faith as Christians.  There's those and a million more unreasonable excuses for the way disabled people are treated.|`|t0mb150gaa	Mainly because they aren't very informed and there parents haven't done there jobs right in raising aware and positive children. I have a hearing impaired daughter who goes through the same thing but we have taught her that some people just don't know how to react to someone different and to never let anyone make her think she isn't good enough because she is perfect just the way she is. I think schools and parents need to do more teachings on how people are different and how to respond to that properly. Just hang in there and know that you are better then the people who make fun of what they know little about!|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Most people live their lives without any knowledge of difference. For them the 'norm' is what they see on the TV, read in magazine and deal with on a day to day basis.  It's only when disability enters their lives or the lives of those they know or love that their views change and adapt.    Is this right..NO.  Is it fair...NO.    Ten years ago I had a very basic knowledge of special needs, yes I have empathy, yes i'm caring but my world seemed a million years away from anyone who had to cope with a disability...    Now I have four boys, three of whom are Autistic and my understanding of their condition is paramount.  I see the world as we all should, filled with uniqueness and difference.    I have had, sadly to deal with puzzled looks of people, sometimes nasty comments said to my sons, and altho' I want to sometimes hit out, shout and swear at them, do they understand? Will my views really affect their day? Will they listen?    Well I would like to hope so but most of the time, they walk away with the same bigoted views they did in the first place.    You are the biggest advocate for you, you have the power to help others realize there is another side to life and you have the right to stand tall and proud...    DON'T let anyone ever tell you different!!|`|lFkVFZgoaa	you are just like me, I have ADHD and i get really hyper in class. i don't have that many friends because i get frustrated. people think i can't think, and also think i am stupid. but i ignor them. but When that does not help i tell them to get a life. i think people don't think before they say somthing. i know how it feels. trust me.|`|aHYY1ai4aa	It is probably because they think that you are a weird person who is stupid and doesn't know anything at all. I don't have a disability, but some people I know have it. They sometimes laugh at you if you look funny.They mostly whisper to their friends then it will wander around your school.People just don't get how disabilities are serious they just laugh like they are stupid humans.But they are NOT. Here's my advice, if people laugh at you just ignore it and live your live and be happy that you are smart and you can stay strong without those mean people pulling you away from your life. I hope you take care.
bO2rzfISaa	Kids in school have few legal rights. You don't have constitutional rights to free speech or privacy. If you were texting in class you motivated her to look through the phone. The info in your phone motivated her to take and look in the other phone. I think you're both in trouble.|`|GemKt7XWaa	No that is your private property. He violated your rights. You could contact an attorney if you wanted to press the issue. You could file a civil suit against the school corp (where the money is) because they didn't train him properly.|`|aqto0hJTaa	If you were caught passing notes, could they read the notes?  Yep.  Not supposed to have it in class = fair game.    Bring on the thumbs down.  Thanks.|`|E98jJXzKaa	I wouldn't swear to it, but i don't think they have the right to view the materials on your cell phone. That is private property! Did you get it back or do your parents have to pick it up? Unless you had that teachers name in the text they shouldn't think anything of it anyways (they wouldn't know that you were talking about them) could be other students. Go to your teacher/principle and say " look i know im not supposed to have my phone out and  i completely understand why you took it. But you don't have any right going thru my private property." Don't be an a-hole because the teacher is in control of your grades for the rest of the semester. =) And i they don't give you  your phone back, have your mom call the school and B**** at them. I highly doubt that they can suspend you or get you n trouble for what was on your phone.  but you could get in trouble for simply having the phone out in class. Good luck.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	In a short answer, yes. You gave up your rights when you walked through the school doors. I don't know of any school that allows cell phone use during class time. You broke the rules. I am sure your teachers were checking for shared information on exams, quizzes and the like. Give it up. A lawsuit will take you over 2 years. You'll be paying $150 an hour for a lawyer and the information on the phone would come out in a court case. Your teachers and administration get free legal advice. You committed the crime, do the time.|`|AA12178390	Where do you people get this idea "private property." You are at school, you have no rights.     Okay you have a few rights but not many.But a right to private property on school grounds is not one of them.    Like someone said it is no different than a teacher looking at notes were passing in class.     You have no right. NONE to have a phone on school grounds. Many schools do not allow them. if you decide to bring a phone to school then you should follow what ever the school rules are on having phones in school. I am sure if they are at out of sight everything is fine. But if you do something that gets the phone taken away then you run the risk of having the teacher, principal, dean, and security guard looking at your text.     I as a teacher I would not look at a students text when taking their phone but that's just me. Can't say I would speak badly of a teacher who did.|`|0GIV43Fmaa	No that is personal property. I believe the worst a teacher can do is take it away but not look through the phone. How would it feel if someone looked through their phone? I hope the teacher remembers that.|`|FSIdkKxKaa	don't respond in the normal angry teenager way. write a paper explaining the joke in full detail, why it was inappropriate (even if you think its not...suck up to her) and why what you did was wrong. then explain that it is your personal property and not the teachers, and the teacher should have told the class they would look through phones if confiscated etc. talk to your guidance counselor or something about it, get ADULTS and mature/smart kids on your side if there's a conflict.  be straightforward and honest throughout the whole thing, or else they won't take you seriusly/blow you off.  best of luck!!
GemKt7XWaa	You could argue the creative aspect of it. Students absolutely should have the opportunity to take those courses. Efforts to save money should be spent elsewhere.  Students can come out of their creative shells through art, music, and cars.  Taking away something that students have a love for will upset them, they will not be motivated, etc.
AA12022384	Sadly there are still some people who do not believe dyslexia exists and that it is an excuse for lazyness or stupidity. I am really sorry that your parents seem to think this way, that must make it very difficult for you and is probably the reason why you were not diagnosed when you were at school.    Of course this is very important to you, probably the best day in the whole of my son's education was the day his dyslexia was diagnosed and like you he finally had an answer to why he could not do things and finally believed me that he was not stupid, which I had been telling him ever since his difficulties became apparent.    He was then able with the correct help to catch up with his peers and do well at school.  Unfortunately this did not happen for you but do not be down hearted by this or by your parents attitude.  A close friend of mine who is dyslexic only learned to read and write well in his thirties.    You now have the answer and I recommend you see this other man and have a thorough assesment which will highlight the areas you need help in.  Because most dyslexics are of above average intelligence many go on to university and all universities have really good facilities to help you.  You should go ahead and apply for the course you want to do.    There are lots of really good websites for dyslexics and their families, a few below, these should help you to understand more and some have areas where you can get professional advice on anything you wish to know. The Being Dyslexic website has a forum where you can chat to other dyslexics and their families which might also help.    I don't know what the answer is with regard to you parents, maybe after you have had an official assesment they will be more open to the possibility and maybe you could get them to look at some of the websites.  The friend I was telling you about had a really bad time with his mother who constantly told him he was stupid even though it was obvious to anyone who knew him that he was a really smart guy.    Whether you can persuade your parents of your learning difficulty or not don't let this stop you achieving your full potential.  Go to uni and though it will no doubt be hard work I am confident you can cope with this and get your degree.  You will get the help you deserve and are entitled to.    Good luck|`|hZIVKiFdaa	You have so far only been screened and it is not an in-depth analysis. There are different forms of Dyslexia and doubt that that you would fit in a high category. As you sound pretty articulate it's very dangerous of professionals to label you as something and you starting to believe and behave in a manner that they would expect you too.     Whatever the results maybe you should no let their labels make you act in a way that may hinder you from being who you are and limit your capabilities. You are bright, don't ponder on society's attempts to pigeon hole you.    Good Luck ;>)|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	For a dyslexic you are mighty handy with that spell checker!|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	talk to your school teacher to ecplain to them your difficulties.|`|441GSyaMaa	Just tell them again, tell them you've been told to see someone else and you're going to see them when you can to get a better evaluation, then I'm sure they'll take you a bit more seriously then.|`|RyMNLddQaa	i think i'm dyslexic.  have a lot of trouble reading, always get words wrong. i could read the same sentence wrong 10 times over and think it was a typing error.  even when writing i put down the wrong letters.  i'm not stupid, i can spell words i just get confused when their on paper and see the wrong letters and words.  i didn't know that there was a test for dyslexia though.  now i read really slowly to be sure i have everything right, and if it doesn't sound right i have someone tell me where i'm going wrong.  as for wrighting, can't help you there i still get things horribly wrong.  thank God for spell checker.    take your parents with you when you go to meet this guy, that should sort everything out.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	They'll come round.     Mine went from denial to now telling me how they contacted the school an asked for tests and the school said i wasn't dyslexic etc. etc. It's all Bul***t.    The important thing is to get a full psychologists report, the uni will arange this. Sosmetimes you have to pay but if you do the NUS has a fund to pay for this. Once you have got that you will need to have an access assesement which will tell you what equipment you need and pay for some specialist tuition. The tuition is great it looks at how you learn in a different way to other students and how to adapt. It also explores the things dyslexics are particularly good at.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You could contact the Dyslexia Association and ask them any questions you need answering.  I used to work for them and I am sure they will be helpful.  They have an office in Eldon Chambers, Wheeler Gate in Nottingham.|`|75NM6Zhtaa	Trouble with dyslexia association is they do charge for the test.Am surprised the school has not advised your parents of their findings.Usually you have a specific teacher a guidance teacher they are called in Scotland ,go to her/him and tell them what is happening at home.I cannot understand your parents as my youngest son is dyslexic and I recognised this before his school did .  Definitely go to someone at school and ask them if they can write to your parents or ask them to come into school for a chat .  Do not worry as soon as my son  was diagnosed he was helped and even allowed scribes for his exams.

8YYwdccpaa	There are many differences between the schools, beginning with the fact that SUNY Fredonia is in a small village about 40 miles southwest of Buffalo. It's a little confusing whether you mean Buffalo State, which is in an urban neighborhood in the city, or University of Buffalo, which has two campuses; one in the heart of downtown Buffalo and the other just north of the city.    It would be difficult to major in Italian or Russian at Fredonia; there are a couple classes but not enough to support an entire major. Certainly students have gone from Fredonia into medical studies, but generally the campus is better known for liberal arts than for sciences. It's a friendly place, easy to meet and get along with people because it's a small school: about 5,000 undergrads.    University of Buffalo is the school of the three that has the medical campus and the strongest focus on medicine and sciences. Since all three are within an hour of one another, you really would be wise to come visit and compare and be sure of which one is best for you. Good luck!
pD2MtL9Oaa	The question is an opinion.  Do you think that Scott's actions fit the definition of treason that you were given?  I think that you could either argue that his oppostion to Riel (who I'm assuming was part of the power structure) was treasonous or you could argue that because he had his country's best interest at heart, he was a patriot.    What do you think?  This is a subjective question that could be argued either way.

lQIKWXDuaa	It means that your expected family contribution toward your education is zero.     Fill out your FASFA. Add all the schools that you intend to attend on your FASFA. This is the reason why they have room for more than one school on the application. Different schools have different deadlines to have your FASFA submitted. The earlier you submit your FASFA the better so that you can meet the deadline for all the schools. You must obey your school's deadline not the federal deadline for your state. The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. The student package consist of grants stafford and perkin loans. The school starts with the stafford and then the perkin loans. Whatever amount extra that you need you have to get a private student loan which is credit base. Your acceptance letter usually accompanies your financial aid award letter to help you decide whether or not you want to attend that particular school. If you submit it after that date they might not have any funds for you.    After you get accepted into school, go back to your FASFA and delete all the other schools.    ss|`|LVZdzPmpaa	If your EFC is zero, that means you are eligible for maximum aid. (EFC is Expected Family Contribution; in your case, it is "expected" that your family is unable to contribute anything to the cost of your education.) This means, generally, that your tuition and fees will be covered 100% with some left over for books and related expenses.     The exact dollar amount of the award package depends on the cost of the school, estimated costs for books, etc. The dollar amound would vary from school to school. But the point is: you're covered.    There are a lot of factors to consider, including the sort of aid the school has available. Some schools have special funds, special scholarships, etc. Other schools are limited to the federal programs, including Pell Grants, Perkins/Stafford Loans and monies afforded by various state scholarship programs. All in all, though, I think you'll be in pretty good shape.    Junior colleges are, by the way, the best education bargain around. Excellent choice.    Make the most of this terrific opportunity. Hope you enjoy every minute of it!

KNtj6quAaa	HOLA yo alguna vez me hice la misma pregunta que tu realizas ahora, y escuche algo que llamo mi atención y seguí este consejo y ahora te puedo asegurar que encontré la felicidad. Espero pongas atención y encuentres la felicidad con las siguientes líneas.<br>  El   corazón humano no tiene la capacidad de dar el amor que tú necesitas para ser feliz, la limitación del    corazón  humano es grande, pues no puede hacer nada por sí mismo.   El siempre dependerá de otro corazón    que lo ayude y que igualmente le ame, para que el también pueda ser feliz. En esas condiciones el corazón   humano, esta siempre sujeto a las limitaciones de otro, a veces hasta más débil y mucho más carente que nuestro propio  corazón .Aumentando así cada vez más el circulo vicioso de la infelicidad . Un carente  busca a otro carente, un frágil se apoya en otro frágil, en la esperanza de que cada uno le dé al otro la felicidad que ambos no tienen, pero el resultado de eso es la caída, pues nos estamos apoyando en algo sin sustentación en sí mismo, de la misma forma, un alguien quiere hacer de nosotros su fuente de felicidad, colocando en nuestras manos, su enorme necesidad de ser feliz, y nosotros tú y yo, que también estamos necesitando desesperadamente de felicidad nos sentimos confusos e impotentes. En ese momento de angustia y soledad es que debemos recordar aquella frase: “JESúS TE AMA”, ?SI!  Jesús te ama y con un amor  que nace NO del corazón  humano sino del     corazón de “Dios”. <br>  Nadie te puede amar como Jesús te ama, simplemente  porque Jesús NO tiene amor.  “ EL ES EL AMOR” El verdadero amor que no puede ser encontrado en el     humano porque viene de lo alto, es espiritual, sobrenatural, sagrado. <br>  Jesús no espero ser amado por ti para también amarte, él ya te ama: ahora, ayer, ma?ana y siempre. Su divino amor no establece condiciones o imposiciones para amarte “Jesús te ama como tú eres” para EL tú no eres fea o linda, grande o peque?o, blanco o negro, rico o pobre,  joven o viejo. Pues Jesús no ve tu apariencia, pero él ve    tu  corazón  y es ahí en tu  corazón  que él quiere habitar, para lavar tus heridas, sacar toda tu amargura, secar tus lagrimas y limpiar las cicatrices de tu alma. Porque tú eres demasiado muy importante para él. <br>  El    corazón  humano, no tiene la culpa por ser limitado, si alguien no te dio la felicidad que tú esperabas, es porque nadie te puede dar aquello que no tiene. <br>  Pero cuando tu aceptes recibir en tu corazón ese amor que perdona, ese amor que no cobra, ese amor que da la paz,  la alegría, tu corazón humano será transformado en un  corazón espiritual, pues en él habitará el amor de Jesucristo. <br>  Entonces tu vas a comenzar a ver, a perdonar y amar como Jesús El Se?or.

Pero todas las respuestas para ser feliz están en ese manual. Otros usan manuales equivocados y ven la vida como algo lleno de angustias, odios, ansiedades, miedos, porque eso dice el manual que la cultura en que viven les dio ; pero no es la naturaleza la causa del sufrimiento sino los deseos, miedos, odios, sentimientos que están dentro de ti, dentro de tu programación. Nuestra felicidad no puede depender de los acontecimientos externos, y si sufrimos es por la forma en que reaccionamos ante esos acontecimientos. Entendemos por amor algo que no lo es, el amor es amar las cosas y personas tal como son, sin importarnos cómo quisiéramos que sean, lo que nos llena y nos hace feliz es el amor que damos, no el que recibimos, cuando recibimos y condicionamos nuestra felicidad a lo recibido, estamos iniciando en el camino del sufrimiento, porque en el momento que nos dejen de dar, o nos lo den de manera diferente nos sentiremos mal, y ciertamente eso ocurrirá porque todo cambia en la vida.  Si amamos a los demás solamente porque estamos llenos de amor y queremos darlo a otros, sin necesidad de esperar nada a cambio, estamos en el camino de la felicidad que no se perturba ni se agota.

Creo que una parte de la personalidad es hereditaria, pero la otra se adquiere y el asunto es que no te das cuenta que adquiriste y que es hereditario, por el hecho que si vives con tus padres desde antes de nacer, nunca saber que heredaste o que adquiriste.<br>  Pero por lo general la personalidad se basa en Valores, principios y acciones conductuales que nacen de lo que tu mente tiene programado.<br>  Hay una teoría que se llama PNL, Programación Neuro Lingüística. aquí aprendemos un poco en cuanto a que hemos sido programados de acuerdo a todas nuestras vivencias que ingresaron a nuestra mente a través de los cinco sentidos, ya que es la única entrada que tenemos para todos los estímulos que vienen de fuera y funcionan así: <br>  Todo lo que recibiste desde antes de nacer hasta este momento en que estás leyendo esta respuesta ha quedado grabado en tu mente, esto se va al subconsciente y comienza a tomar todo lo que coincide con tus valores, principios y normas de vida, así tu vienes y los procesas y de acuerdo a como lo procesas, será tu actitud. Te explique todo ello, porque así como reaccionas, así como son tus actitudes, es tu personalidad.<br>  Por lo anterior creo que una parte se hereda y otra se adquiere y tiene mayor impacto la que se adquiere.<br>  Espero te hay respondido así como deseas.

TP3WalzAaa	PAY ATTENTION CIARA! Only joking.<br>  <br>  I'm 20 years old which means that it wasn't very long ago that I did my GCSEs; which means I remember quite well how it was. <br>  <br>  Believe me Ciara you have nothing to worry about in Year 9--certainly nothing to cry about. Everything you learned and will learn will obviously make things easier for you in years 10 and 11; but everything you need to pass your GCSEs will be taught to you in years 10 and 11. <br>  <br>  I wasn't a very good student before year 11--I changed when it finally hit me that I'm going to take my GCSEs--and other things that made me realize that learning is simply important--not just to pass an exam, but to learn. Anyway, what you need to do from now on until year 10 is train yourself to read, which is the most powerful learning tool after the 'teacher'. It isn't easy to do at first, but like every other skill you need to practice before it becomes easy. A weight-lifter can't lift a 100kgs on his/her very first attempt, but by struggling first, he/she will be able to eventually. If you're not used to reading--though you might be--I won't lie to you; you'll be bored at first but eventually you'll like it. Then when you get to year 10 read the material that your teacher directs you to. You'll notice that hardly anything you learned in year 9 will come up; which is a good thing because it tells you that you shouldn't worry as much as you are about not being happy at your current performance (which doesn't mean that you shouldn't care about SATs). GCSEs are 98% about the last two years and the key is to concentrate when you're there. The brilliant thing about you is that you woke up even before you needed to wake up. You're basically a step ahead of most of the other students your age.<br>  <br>  As for what to choose; why not try speaking to your teachers.? I don't know if it's still the same--though I can't imagine that it has changed too much in four years--but when I was in school, people were embarrassed to speak to teachers. I know I was. They know you more than you think they know you. Just think about it. The chances are that they spent a lot of time with you--in the classroom and out--since you started attending that school. They are learning things about you every time you step into their classroom which gives them a good idea of what you might be good at. What they say isn't what you have to choose, but you can use what they say to help you make your final decision. There might be a particular teacher that you feel comfortable with more than others, so ask him/her; and discus it privately if its necessary. You can also speak to friends and family, but I'd advise you to talk to a teacher that you choose--not someone you have to meet as an appointment arranged by the school. If you haven't already done that you'll be surprised how useful it can be.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I really wish you all the best. By the way, I can tell that you 'are' good at English judging by the way you wrote the question...but leave out the slang when you're setting any exams.|`|R7mnEUOZaa	You have along time before you take these. Talk to your parents about your worries. Maybe they could speak to your tutors and get you some extra help if you need it. My gut feeling is you are having a crisis of confidence and need a little TLC.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	Not everyone is good at taking tests. This doesn't mean you're a failure. If you have done well at maths and English before, you have demonstrated that you can learn. Perhaps you just need a little extra help.  Does your school offer tutoring? Can you see a counselor and talk about your concerns?<br>  <br>  Remember,  many people have talents that can't easily be measured in a classroom environment. For example, you may be good at listening to people's problems and helping them, or you may be an excellent cook, or you may have a gift for writing, dance or music.  Please don't be discouraged. Even Einstein couldn't make change on a bus. <br>  <br>  Look inside yourself, discover what you love to do and then do your best to excel at it. Test scores seem important now, but when you are an adult, no one will care what they were. Do you care what your parents' test scores were? The only thing that really matters is making the most of the gifts that you have been given. |`|xVA4BRIvaa	Exams and qualifications aren't the be all and end all. You will find something you're good at in time =] Even if you don't, remember not everyone does know. I don't (even though i probably should). Just keep working as hard as you can and try your best.

I doubt things are as bad as you make out, especially if you acknowledge that you do have areas of strength.<br>  <br>  As for GCSE's - they seem like the most important thing in the world at your age - but in the grand scale of things it's nothing. That's coming from a 26 year old. 10 years ago when I passed my GCSE's I didn't get particularly good results, but I DID get enough to get me into college, which paved the way to university and to a graduate job (I'm a Diagnostic Radiographer - taking x-rays and helping to diagnose and treat patients - and I make a good amount of money.<br>  <br>  So try not to worry about failing - you've got plenty of time left to sort your exam revision out - and if you take the initiative to speak to a teacher (or ideally all of your teachers when no-one else is around) and voice your feelings, they will help you as much as they can to ensure you pass your GCSE's. Don't worry about high marks - you just want enough to ensure you get into college. When you're in college - your GCSE's become entirely irrelevant. When you get into University (which I'm sure you will if you take my advice) - your college grade becomes irrelevant as employers nowadays are more interested in your most recent qualification.<br>  <br>  I was in the same situation as you - and by taking a deep breath, facing my demons and speaking to my teachers - I turned things around at the last minute and... well here I am.<br>  <br>  Best of luck for the future.|`|sdSHGhDiaa	Breathe deeply. You have only just started Year 9, you have 2 & 1/2 years before end of GCSE, you have time to work on your weaknesses. Everyone has both strengths and weaknesses and whatever you may feel you have strengths too, the key thing now is to discover what they are. If you want to take GCSE's speak to your teachers and ask them how they think you'd fare in their subject. GCSE's are not for everyone though and many schools now offer vocational qualifications which rely more heavily on work throughout the course and not the final exams. It also offers more opportunities to re-attempt LO which you don't do as well on. Perhaps you should consider BTEc or similar, they are good courses. I also recommend you chat to your form tutor and/or a careers advisor. Good luck and remember confidence breeds success :O)|`|4vDPfZA9aa	definitely do not give up.. keep trying your hardest!! i didn't do too well in school, so i got help from friends and teachers, and ended up graduating on time, with a 3.5 GPA. ask your parents for help, and your teachers too.

L9r8qBR5aa	Hola, yo soy de CCH y antes de responder tu pregunta dire algo: estas dos Instituciones son iguales asi que no dejemos que haya una division entre estas 2, los CCH tienen mala fama de alumnos, pero mejor fama como temario escolar, ya que de estas 2 han salido infinidad de excelentes alumnos ejemplo.

PObalyQoaa	Hola Anatomic voy hacer mis aportes a tu tesis espero que te sirvan...<br>  En la edad de preescolar es aconsejable leerles a los ni?os los distintos soportes de texto y luego mostrar las imágenes.<br>   Los gráficos de los libros estructuran la imaginación, no permiten recrear y crear.<br>  Los adultos cometemos el error de mostrar la imagen anticipada y el ni?o se pierde en la imagen visual y pierde el hilo conductor del relato.<br>  Las imágenes atrapan, mas si son en movimiento como los adultos preferimos ver la peli que leer el libro.<br>  Si yo te digo casa, seguro que tu representación gráfica es la tradicional por la imagen percivida y transmitida de peque?a (estereotipos) Suerte!! |`|SDHvDNGJaa	Super común, pero es bueno que tu le inculques a los ni?os<br>  el buen hábito de la lectura.<br>  =?)|`|6mEFDOm4aa	Prefieren mirar tele.|`|1ce5cf1f94630ba4654a4bd9d9c2c1e8aa	Depende en gran medida de la estimulacion que le des a tu ni?o en el hogar.<br>  Hay padres de familia que sientan al ni?o en frente de la television por horas,sin fomentar no solo la lectura sino otras actividades que ayuden a su desarrollo intelectual,motor,de lenguaje,etc.<br>  Y puede ser por muchas causas, falta de tiempo ( por parte de los padres) flojera,apatía malos habito que ya se traen ,etc.<br>  |`|HaDt61zgaa	En realidad hoy en dia a la gran mayoria de los chicos les atrae más todo lo relacionado con tecnologia (computadoras, celulares y television), que los antiguos pasatiempos de las generaciones pasadas.|`|fltyniSeaa	EL PROBLEMA NO ES CON LOS CHICOS SINOM CON LOSPADRES QUE EN VEZ DE DARLES UN LIBRO LES PONEN LA MEJOR NANA DEL MUNDO Y SOBRE TODO NO COBRA LA TV|`|PYxRntkiaa	Los ni?os de ahora ya no son como los de antes|`|mhZp4K6Daa	La televisión es un medio que atrae al ni?o, ya que la imagen está en continuo movimiento. El problema que tiene es que la información o contenido pasa muy rápido y es muy difícil que el ni?o procese toda la información. <br>  Por otro lado, el álbum ilustrado son imágenes de una historia que el ni?o puede tocar y ver. Depende mucho de las imágenes. Hay muchos cuentos que atraen a los ni?os: 3d, con texturas...<br>  Yo como maestro, desde mi experiencia creo que el ni?o está más atento, alegre y motivado cuando se le cuenta un cuento con imágenes. Además se le trabaja la imaginación, atención, memoria...<br>  Mientras que la televión no deja jugar con la imaginación, además un ni?o deja de estar atento cuando ve una pelicula de dibujotos después de haber pasado 15-25 minutos. Bueno espero haberte ayudado. Suerte con la tesis|`|KSfWdqlxaa	Yo tuve q hacer un trabajo sobre este tema jeje. Entre otras cosas es más común que vean la televisión xq los padres para tener al ni?o entretenido (y tener tiempo para el trabajo o lo ke sea) lo sientan frente a ella. Además de eso, puede q la televisión les llame más la atención porque vea a los adultos hacer lo mismo (sentarse y verla), y ellos tienden a imitar lo que hacen los mayores. Otra posibilidad es que les parezca más interesante y llamativo por el sonido, los colores...<br>  Uno de los problemas es que muchos padres no dedican su tiempo a fomentar los hábitos de lectura en su hijo: puede sentarse a leer con él, ponerse a leer de vez en cuando para que su hijo vea lo que hace...<br>  De todas formas el libro, aunque parezca más "aburrido",  va a fomentar la creatividad en el ni?o (podrá imaginar a los personajes...)<br>  espero q t sirva jeje ^^|`|ACCPxHEsaa	mi hermano prefiere mil veces la television antes qeu un libro.

1tvGBIZGaa	The answer lies in base 4.<br>  <br>  In base 10, you count up to 9 before going to 10. In base 4, the maximum digit allowed is 3, and the number of digits is 4 (0,1,2,3).<br>  <br>  When you get to 9 in base ten, the next number is 10.<br>  When you get to 3 in base four, the next number is 10.<br>  <br>  So, counting "4" as 10:<br>  <br>  2+3 <br>  = 4+1 <br>  = 10 + 1 <br>  = 11;<br>  <br>  For further understanding, if you count up to 33, the next number is 100! Since base four's biggest digit is 3, the biggest 2-digit number you can have is 33.<br>  |`|cx3L3LuOaa	tell her that you asked a frade 11 math teacher and they said that the only way that 2+3=11 is that if the rest of the equation went: the interger of 2 multiplyed by the lowest common denominator of 3 is equal to that of n*(*=squared)T(4)(0)+11<br>  if you dont find the answer then use this^^^ because I think that you teacher wants you to spend 3 hours tonight finding the answer|`|NAjzczhjaa	It's in base 4. =D Be happy with the 100% <br>  (Stupid teachers.

ubrcIGN3aa	No. The most important year is junior year. If you do very well your junior year and do decently on the SAT you will be at least considered. I got into an ivy league school when I thought I had no chance and I didn't even do all that great on the SAT (1950). A lot of times its just luck when applying to schools like that because there are so many qualified applicants. It's possible it may come down to whether or not the person reading your application is in a good mood.|`|mhoMVNRwaa	NOT AT ALL, I would definitely go ahead and apply; DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT YOU TO GET IN BECAUSE OF THEIR FAILED DREAMS!!!!

AA10988289	I think I know what you mean.

The girls have tried to get rid of the ties, and the school has decided to get a new uniform which includes fitted shirts and no ties for the girls, but it won't be inplace for a couple of years due to the new school being built. (unfortunately I wont have unifrom by this point)<br>  However at my school they decided to impose a very strict rule on ties, after local people and parents complained at how we wore our ties two buttons down, with our two top bottoms undone. So they imposed a new rule which meant if we were caught with our top buttons undone, it was an immediate bad mark, 5 bad marks= a detention with the head master. You could get as many bad marks from one teacher as they wished. It worked well, but after a while the teachers got bored of stopping students between lessons, and wasting time at the start of lessons, to write and mark down bad marks, so the kids got to know this, sooo although we're not as bad now, we only undo the top button, some teachers still impose it, but we know which ones, so we get away with it :)|`|afUj51Aeaa	I don't get your answer.<br>  <br>  but I use ties only on special events and jazz concerts/shows (trumpet)<br>  <br>  never in school... it feels weird

La discriminacion pueder ser por Religion, preferencia sexual, racismo, etc.<br>  La discrimicion es cuando tratas a una persona demanera diferente a las otras por prejuicios, cuando es discrimicacion por Religion se refiere a que cuando una persona no ejerce una religion determinada, se le hace a un lado o se le da un mal trato por eso.<br>  Cuando es por preferencia sexual, es por ejemplo con los homosexuales, k se les trata diferente por k les gustan las personas de su msmo sexo.<br>  Y pues en el rascismo, se les trata mal por ser de algun color diferente a los demas o de un lugar diferente.|`|c530d67058b9e4e37e1ab3d8fb8bcc38aa	Racismo es solo un tipo de discriminacion:<br>  Tipos de Discriminación<br>  Discriminación por Edad<br>  Discriminación por Discapacidad<br>  Discriminación en la Compensación o Igualdad Salarial<br>  Discriminación por Origen Nacional<br>  Discriminación por Embarazo<br>  Discriminación por Raza<br>  Discriminación por Religión<br>  Represalia<br>  Discriminación Basada en el Sexo<br>  Hostigamiento Sexual|`|FoDFDPPWaa	Discriminacion es discrimnar a alguien ya sea por su raza, sexo, edad lo que sea, y racismo es discriminar a alguien exactamente por la raza.|`|Kua9rAD5aa	ya te contestaron|`|7vgtUhw8aa	El racismo es un tipo de discriminación.

Technological advancement came as a result of interest in the sciences. Ordinary people, though usually abused by the cruel factory system, were the workforce that labored to create the modern system.<br>  <br>  In other words, these events involved both commoners and elites, and as the question asks, it is important to consider both sides of the situation.|`|rghk8yMeaa	-the middle ages when Charlemange forced religion upon the Saxons and there came the spread of Christianity.<br>  <br>  -feudalism/manorialism

Changing moral standards refers to whether or not the moral standards of society as a whole, or segments of society, have changed over time.<br>  <br>  For instance, a hundred years ago, it was considered immodest for a woman to show her ankles.  Obviously, this is not the case now.<br>  <br>  Fifty years ago, a woman's belly button could not be shown on TV.

Then you find the number of atoms by multiplying the avagadro's number (6.022 * 10^23 atoms/moles) and you have the atoms of Zn in 120g<br>  2) (molar mass of C*2)+(molar mass of H*3)+(molar mass of O*2)<br>  3) do they mention the temperature? If they do, you can use PV=nRT to calculate n=number of moles and multiply with avagadro's #.<br>  4) BaCl2 has 3 atoms, so you divide the number of atoms with 3 and you get the number of molecules. Then divide the number of molecules with the avagadro's # and you get the moles. Multiply the moles with the molar mass of BaCl2 and you get the mass.<br>  6) 25 moles * molar mass of CO2 (44g/mol)<br>  7) at STP, T=273K and P=1atm, so for PV=nRT<br>  P=1atm V=? n= 48g/molar mass of SF6 R=0.0821 L.atm/mol.K T=273K<br>  Plug in and solve for V<br>  8) 5g/ molar mass of Al2O3. Multiply the moles with avagadro's #<br>  9) Density of CO2=1.98g/L. Density * the given volume will give you the mass. <br>  11) C mols=40g/12.0g/mol, H mols=6.67g/1.01g/mol, Omols= 53.3g/16.0g/mol. Divide the smallest # of mols with the mols of C,H and O. Round your answer to whole numbers. Your empirical formula should be CH2O. Now calculate the molar mass (empirical formula weight) of CH2O. Divide 90.0mols/g by the # you got before and round to a who #. multiple CH2O by that # and you have the molecular formula (C3H6O3).

Modern alliteration is predominantly consonantal; certain literary traditions, such as Old English verse, also alliterate using vowel sounds. <br>  <br>  [From AD– + Latin littera, letter.]<br>  <br>  (also known as ‘head rhyme’ or ‘initial rhyme’), the repetition of the same sounds—usually initial consonants of words or of stressed syllables—in any sequence of neighbouring words: ‘Landscape‐lover, lord of language’ (Tennyson). Now an optional and incidental decorative effect in verse or prose, it was once a required element in the poetry of Germanic languages (including Old English and Old Norse) and in Celtic verse (where alliterated sounds could regularly be placed in positions other than the beginning of a word or syllable). Such poetry, in which alliteration rather than rhyme is the chief principle of repetition, is known as alliterative verse; its rules also allow a vowel sound to alliterate with any other vowel. <br>  <br>  Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: alliteration <br>  <br>  Repetition of consonant sounds in two or more neighbouring words or syllables. A frequently used poetic device, it is often discussed with assonance (the repetition of stressed vowel sounds within two or more words with different end consonants) and consonance (the repetition of end or medial consonants).<br>  <br>  Classical Literature Companion: alliteration <br>  <br>  the literary device in which two or more words in close connection begin with the same letter (see ASSONANCE). It was not a common device of Greek poetry, but is a feature in Latin saturnian verse (see METRE, LATIN I), and was adopted thence by later Roman poets including Ennius and Virgil, as when Ennius writes:<br>  <br>  fraxinu' frangitur atque abies consternitur alta.<br>  pinus proceras pervortunt.<br>  <br>  (‘The ash tree is shattered and the lofty fir laid low. They overturn the tall pines.’)<br>  <br>  <br>  It is carried to grotesque excess by the same poet in the line:<br>  o Tite tute Tati tibi tanta tyranne tulisti.<br>  <br>  (‘O Titus Tatius, such great things you brought upon yourself, arrogant ruler.’)<br>  <br>  (more......)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/alliteration" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/alliteration</a><br>  <br>  the repetition of the same letter at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; as in the following lines: - behemoth, biggest born of earth, upheaved his vastness. fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.<br>  note: the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words is also called alliteration. anglo-saxon poetry is characterized by alliterative meter of this sort. later poets also employed it. in a somer seson whan soft was the sonne, i shope me in shroudes as i a shepe were. plowman.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dictionary.babylon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.babylon.com/</a><br>  <br>  the commencing of two or more words, in close juxtaposition, with the same sound. As Milton defined rhyme to be " the jingling sound of like endings," so alliteration is the jingle of like beginnings. All language has a tendency to jingle in both ways, even in prose. Thus in prose we speak of " near and dear," " high and dry," " health and wealth." But the initial form of jingle is much more common - " safe and sound," " thick and thin," " weal or woe," " fair or foul," " spick and span," " fish, flesh, or fowl," " kith and kin." The poets of nearly all times and tongues have not been slow to seize upon the emphasis which could thus be produced.<br>  <br>  Although mainly Germanic in its character, alliteration was known to the Latins, especially in early times, and Cicero blames Ennius for writing " 0 Tite tute, Tati, tibi tanta, tyranne, tulisti." Lucretius did not disdain to employ it as an ornament. We read in Shakespeare: " Full fathom five thy father lies: Of his bones are corals made." In Pope: " Here files of pins extend their shining rows, Puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux." In Gray: " Weave the warp and weave the woof, The winding-sheet of Edward's race." In Coleridge: " The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, The furrow followed free; We were the first that ever burst Into that silent sea." Churchill describes himself, in his Prophecy of Famine, " Who often, but without success, had prayed For apt alliteration's artful aid," - an example which is itself a proof of his failure; for alliteration is never effective unless it runs upon consonants. <br>  <br>  (more......)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Alliteration" rel="nofollow">http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Allitera...</a>|`|XHCoIo3zaa	It is a style.

Do want to find out what's intriguing?<br>  <br>  This is designed proportional to those bungalow houses you had seen. It was built way back in 1938, thus, it is still standing strong for 71 years. Imagine that! And because it could be considered as an 'antique' house, the exterior before was different. But after some years, we had given our house a new look. We had also replaced our old windows to add a fresher look. <br>  <br>  Another thing that I like about it is that it had been established in a quiet neighboorhood. Our house is also pretty close to school. That's an advantage for me as a pupil studying there. <br>  <br>  Going in to the interior part of our house, it also has an amazing feature. It has three doors mainly used for our entrance (and exit). Of all those, my favorite door is the one we mostly use, that could take us to the kitchen. <br>  <br>  Speaking of which, we had nine rooms in our house. Specifically, we had four bedrooms, two bathrooms, an average-sized living room, dining room, and of course, my favorite, the kitchen. Adding to that, we also have a concrete basement. Could you imagine how spacious our house is?<br>  <br>  But if would be given a chance to re-model our house, I'd probably give much focus on the area of the bedrooms and the basement. Why?

ztIzX8Unaa	A heretic is someone that believes that the strict interpretation of a particular religious dogma is incorrect.  See the wikipedia link for a discussion of heresy.<br>  <br>  This phrasing was most commonly used by the religious elite in Christian sects, such as the Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  In the middle ages, heretics were sometimes put to death by various methods, including being burned at the stake.  This is what happened to Joan of Arc.  Religious leaders such as a Pope or a Bishop would be the ones that sentenced a heretic to be burned at the stake.  The actual execution would be done by an underling of some type.<br>  <br>  Owning an encyclopedia would be heretical since it is likely that entries in the book would not match religious dogma 100%.  For example, a modern encyclopedia would have a section on the theory of evolution, and this is not in agreement with religious dogma that states that man was created by God in his image.|`|E6SQA7f0aa	A heretic is some one who goes against the beliefs of the Church.<br>  The answer to who would burn people is pretty much white people, Christians, and the founders of this country.<br>  They do it to keep the people in power in control, by keeping the common man ignorant and a slave to fear.|`|scPdS4Pfaa	A heretic is some one who dose not acsept or beleave in an established view.

Lowell (Mr. G to my students)|`|AA11089669	The key to questions like these are remembering the equation y=mx+b, which I'm sure you talked about in class. In the equation, m=slope and b=the point on the y axis where the line passes over it. If you can get y by itself on one side you shouldn't have much of a problem. Taking the first one as an example, first subtract the 2.5x from both sides leaving you with 5y=75-2.5x. After that, all you have to do to get y by itself is divide everything by 5 leaving you with y=15-1/2x. So now, what you know is that the slope is the number in front of x(-1/2) and the y intercept is 15. In order to graph the equation, go to the spot of the y intercept (0,15) and then just use the slope of -1/2 for the other points. In other words, from the point (0,15) just go down 1, right 2 until you have a good idea of where all the points will be and then you can use a ruler to line up the points and draw the line. <br>  <br>  I know sometimes it's hard to explain these things in words, but hopefully this helped.|`|T0wS6h0aaa	1)<br>  2.5x+5y=75 Solve for y<br>  -2.5      -2.5x Subtract 2.5x on both sides<br>  5y=75-2.5x Divide both sides by 5<br>  y=15-0.5x Fix the problem so that the slope is first<br>  y=-0.5x+15 Put a value for x and you will get y <br>  <br>  2)<br>  x-2/3y=1 Solve for y<br>  -x       -x Subtract x on both sides<br>  -2/3y=-x+1 Multiply both sides by 3<br>  -2y=-3x+3 Divide both sides by -2<br>  y=3/2x-6 Put a value for x and you get y<br>  <br>  BTW I am also in Eighth Grade|`|wtaOgdSOaa	since in order to graph the equation need to be in y=mx+b form, you need to putt them that way.<br>  for the first one divide both sides by 5 since u want the y by itself. so they cancell out and 75 divided by 5 is 15.<br>  after that u subtract 2,5x from each side.<br>  the equation should end up y=2.5x+15<br>  and then you graph that.

Just make good grades and keep up lots of extracurricular activities and community service stuff, and make a good score on the SAT/ACT and you'll have a good chance of getting into wherever you want to go.

As it turns out, in the long run abortion saves lives and in the short run it is impossible to avoid abortion.

Many colleges have deals with certain companies (IBM, Sony, Dell, Apple) to get discounts on laptops and even offer on-campus service and repair, as well as cheap/free software that would otherwise cost a ton of money.  See if the college you're attending has a deal like that.  Also, some majors require specific software or operating systems.  My friend had to buy a Mac for her Photoshop classes.

There is a cost difference between these options so if that is a factor for you your best bet is a book or group class. Whatever you choose you should start off taking a diagnostic test to show you exactly what reading questions give you the most trouble. You can then work from there learning tricks to help you improve. You may even be able to find a free test in your area, Princeton Review offers them. You may also want to check out any local colleges and your library to see if they're offering any programs.

In line with the current political agenda, sports development professionals are increasingly involved in using sport as a tool to assist with a range of social issues, including social exclusion, cohesion, health, regeneration and crime reduction. This module introduces students to the basic theories, principles and practices of sports development and how these have developed over time. It highlights the links between the political agenda of the day and the impact this has on the work of sports development, as well as the importance of issues such as partnership working and sustainability.

She said, “Be careful what you say or do because there is always someone watching!” My mother’s observation is similar to today’s controversial issue, the Patriot Act.

AA10754658	Both schools are the top in the field. It's kind of like saying you'd rather have a toonie than two loonies. That said, one girl in my reporting class actually came to Ryerson for journlaism after a year at Carleton. She came because apparently Carleton takes too long to jump into journalism -- like, it's more talk than do. Within our first month in one class we wrote two stories, she said at Carleton it would have taken them an entire year! <br>  <br>  Then again, that's what SHE said. I can't verify those claims. I think each university has something awesome to offer. They are both academically well off and use their location to the student's benefit. In Toronto, well, you're in the middle of downtown Toronto. The Eaton Centre is right beside us (some classes actually have you learn on top of the Eaton Centre), as is Yonge St., the CN Tower is always within view, MuchMusic is a 10 minute walk away, CityTv is moving beside us within the year or so. And at Carleton, you've got the government.<br>  <br>  Still, I'm biased and I think Ryerson has more opportunites.<br>  <br>  Newspapers probably will die out thanks to technology. People can read the news on the phone, Internet, etc. But there will always been a need for writers.

Dj5f1SRfaa	Just give a brief synopsis so your audience knows what to expect...<br>  <br>  and make sure you do not just read through the PowerPoint slides- let them be a visual guide and not your entire presentation. There is nothing worse than listening to a PowerPoint presentation that you could just as easily read from the projector.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Yes, you should have something yo say for each slide, don't put everything you need to say on a slide.|`|00792da82dde73ce69a0bb30ddb3220baa	Ask a question, about their expectations or tell a story.<br>  <br>  You need to grasp your audience's attention within the first 30 seconds of your speech or presentation. If you don't grab them in that short space of time, you could lose them. The people you are speaking to could simply look at you, but be thinking of the next coffee break, the shopping they need to do or that attractive person sitting in front of them. Without gaining the immediate attention of the audience the moment you start to speak, you could effectively be talking to yourself.<br>  <br>  Something like a gunshot, fireworks or a troupe of naked dancers should grab the audience attention, sure enough. But your problem is you have to follow them - and that may well be an anti-climax for the audience. Dramatic starts to presentations and speeches can often backfire. People remember the sudden drama, but often cannot recall what the speaker actually said.<br>  <br>  What you need are openings to your speech that make the audience want to listen to the rest of what you have to say. In other words, the stunning start to the speech or presentation has to be something you say, rather than a dramatic device.<br>  <br>  There are several options you can choose from, but audience research shows that the most preferable attention-grabbing opening you can make is an anecdote; tell a personal story, preferably funny. Most business presenters try to be serious, or set the agenda right at the start. Time and time again, audiences report that this is the sure way to lose their attention. Yet, time and time again audiences say that personal anecdotes are a great way to start a business presentation - even serious ones.<br>  <br>  If an anecdote isn't appropriate, there are other options. Starting with a question, or a series of linked questions, is a favourite loved by audiences. Similarly, a quotation by a famous person is also a good opener to a talk or presentation.<br>  <br>  Other possibilities include a statistic or a controversial statement about the audience or the subject area. An appropriate poem is also a good start.<br>  <br>  Things to avoid to open your presentation or speech include jokes, role plays or anything where you are trying to be 'clever'. The audience may be offended and therefore will distance themselves from you, lessening your impact. And even if you get a good producer for a major conference speech, try to avoid their convincing cries that you should make some kind of dramatic entrance. It's great for the show's production team - but not for the audience.<br>  <br>  No matter what the size of the audience, you can use the suggestions here. Whether you speak to a small group or several thousand, anecdotes, questions, quotations, statistics and controversial statements will always work.|`|OFGE01tRaa	"Hello, hello and H E L L L L O O O O!<br>  Is this a beautiful crowd or what?

Also as other ideas, i would make a list of what the picture reminds you of when you see it, is it hot or cold, is it happy or sad, what colour stikes you the most about the painting , then with that list i would come up with a food that fits<br>  eg if i said hot, happy,red , i'd probably pick hot red chilli peppers or a menu involving ho red chili peppers if you get what i mean.

qK8wcP2Aaa	Symbols are objects, characters, figures, or colors used to represent abstract ideas or concepts.<br>  <br>  Mockingbirds<br>   <br>  The title of To Kill a Mockingbird has very little literal connection to the plot, but it carries a great deal of symbolic weight in the book. In this story of innocents destroyed by evil, the “mockingbird” comes to represent the idea of innocence. Thus, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence. Throughout the book, a number of characters (Jem, Tom Robinson, Dill, Boo Radley, Mr. Raymond) can be identified as mockingbirds—innocents who have been injured or destroyed through contact with evil. This connection between the novel's title and its main theme is made explicit several times in the novel: after Tom Robinson is shot, Mr. Underwood compares his death to “the senseless slaughter of songbirds,” and at the end of the book Scout thinks that hurting Boo Radley would be like “shootin' a mockingbird.” Most important, Miss Maudie explains to Scout: “Mockingbirds don't do one thing but . . . sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That Jem and Scout's last name is Finch (another type of small bird) indicates that they are particularly vulnerable in the racist world of Maycomb, which often treats the fragile innocence of childhood harshly.<br>   <br>  Boo Radley<br>   <br>  As the novel progresses, the children's changing attitude toward Boo Radley is an important measurement of their development from innocence toward a grown-up moral perspective. At the beginning of the book, Boo is merely a source of childhood superstition. As he leaves Jem and Scout presents and mends Jem's pants, he gradually becomes increasingly and intriguingly real to them. At the end of the novel, he becomes fully human to Scout, illustrating that she has developed into a sympathetic and understanding individual. Boo, an intelligent child ruined by a cruel father, is one of the book's most important mockingbirds; he is also an important symbol of the good that exists within people. Despite the pain that Boo has suffered, the purity of his heart rules his interaction with the children. In saving Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell, Boo proves the ultimate symbol of good.
4Lzf3wenaa	Well, first you want to find the total amount of sugar.  So do the amount of boxes 1010 times the amount of sugar in each 2.12.  That is 2141.2, so there is 2141.2 pounds of sugar total.  Divide this by the new amount of sugar per box to get the new amount of boxes.  then it is 1070.6,  which is rounded to 1071 boxes.  Take the new amount minus the old amount of boxes to get how many more.  So 1071 - 1010 is 61.  61 is your answer.

AA12310790	I think the comma after 'restaurant' indicates that 'which' does not refer to 'restaurant' but to something that has been written earlier.<br>  However, I would personally like to rewrite this into two sentences, with the first sentence reading 'Most of the restaurants have more than twenty television sets in their premises.' You could then consider the second sentence with something like 'These sets are more than likely to show ....'.<br>  Of course there are other different ways of expressing the same idea. You could try out some yourself, and come up with a better construction.|`|dsogAKkgaa	The sentence has a couple problems, but what you're referring to has to do with the relative pronoun "which." Normally, this word refers to the closest candidate, which in that sentence is "restaurant." Figure out a way to get the "which..." next to the word "televisions" and it'll sound better.

For instance, to achieve parallel structure in sentence # 2 above, you'd change it to:<br>  <br>  "She is a kind grandmother, a good parent and a caring friend."<br>   <br>    In the original, flawed sentence, "kind" is an adjective, "good" is a subjective completion, and"cared" is a verb.

It depends what type of analytical eye you are looking at it with.<br>  <br>  In the sense of only considering the words within the poem:<br>  I'm a little hindered as I can't find a clear definition of supersession.  It seems to me to be that "death" as man knows it is something to be feared and thus has defined it by this. We hope to not die and for things to go well.  Animals, on the other hand, seem to simply accept it.  Therefore, man didn't create the moment when life ends, but what we call "death" due to how we define it and what we associate with it.  We die every time something goes wrong because we have the feeling of everything ending and we dread it, but we hold onto hope, until the very end, that it will change.  Then we repeat the process throughout our lives, seemingly causing ourselves more pain because we just don't accept events as events.<br>  <br>  My attempt at analysis might be off due to the fact that I don't understand one of the words.|`|o1ibwPKPaa	Well every poem has different meanings for different people.

EQKaMfPAaa	They make it possible to manufacture goods at a very low price because the labor they provide is at a very low rate. This increases the margin(profit) for the company selling the goods and a small portion of this savings may or may not be past on to the consumer.  It also causes people is some areas to loose jobs because the labor rate they would require is too high.  For example in the USA we pay a worker sowing blue jeans approximately $6.50 an hour (depends on what minimum wage in that state is). In one of the sweet shops they may make $6.50 a day or in extreme cases a week.  So you can see why companies would choose to have workers in low cost sweet shops in other countries manufacture the goods for them. Simple terms: It shifts jobs to regions that charge less for labor in order to maximize profit and keep pricing competitive with other manufactures that are also doing the same.
lQIKWXDuaa	As an undergrad, you can major in anything. Medical school dont have a major requirement. They just need you to complete the pre-medical school requirements. You can do whatever else you want have a double major, a minor etc...  <br>  <br>  I encourage to double major in education. You can get a great teaching job if you dont get accepted in Medical school.<br>  <br>  The pre-med requirements that you need to complete while in college are:<br>  Biology (I &II), Chemistry (I &II), organic chemistry (I &II), physics (I &II), Calculus (I &II), English composition (I&II). Extra classes to make your self competitive are : anatomy & physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistic.<br>  <br>  You need a cumulative college GPA of 3.5+<br>  <br>  You also need to have research experience and clinical experience. Shadow a doctor or something. My advice to you is become an EMT or an RN while you complete your pre-med requirements, this will give you plenty of clinical experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  MCAT: you need to ACE the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT 35+ should be your goal. You take this test in you Junior Year in college. Use Kaplan or another test preparation center. Get the examkracker book it is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with this website. They are the one who give the MCAT exam and you will need to apply for medical school through them. <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/</a><br>  <br>  You will need 4 STRONG letters of recommendation.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you is to major in something that you can use in case you dont get accepted into medical school. Heaven forbid that you dont get into medical school, what is your alternative plan? Major in whatever else you see yourself doing if medical school does not work out.<br>  <br>  ss|`|Moz2d806aa	No. You need a stronger background in biology and chemistry than just a physics minor will give you.

Also, if you read some American classics, I guarantee you will improve your writing. By reading more, you are internalizing new words and various phrases that you can use or modify to place in your own writing.<br>  <br>  Writing is about getting your point across while maintaining your audience's attention. Some literature has the ability to keep your mind holding on because of its great phrasing or memorable lines, even though the matter at hand may not be great in itself. Other writing may deal with compelling pieces of information, but if it is not well-written, it will be less of a success because nobody wants to waste time reading something that is TOO complex and has no life.|`|zldPWUymaa	A few good resources are the following books:<br>  <br>  On Writing by Steven King<br>  <br>  Writing Down the Bones (forget the author)<br>  <br>  Reading and studying what the writer does also helps.

Another big one is the technological advances in transportation.  There is no longer a need to write formal letters to tell friends and relatives about major life events such as weddings, births, etc.  Printed invitations are sent and then many can hop on a plane or drive a car to attend the events in person.  In earlier times wagons, horses, or even slow trains would not allow such travel so the news would have to arrive in letters.

You could do a little research on what would be needed. You could also come up with a schedule for yourself - show that you've really taken an interest in this. Give your reasons as to why you want to be homeschooled, and ask why she is against it. Is it because she doesn't have the time? Or is it that she thinks you won't be able to socialize? My siblings and I LOVE school, we love learning everything we can, and have never had ANY problems "socializing" with people of ANY ages.

I think your mother is wise to recognize that you expect education to be handed to you and homeschooling is something you have to work at.  Unless and until you make some effort towards your own education, you will not have demonstrated to your mother that you have the ability to learn on your own.

b375eaa19dd6c56e9909e7ba789daa39aa	Well, I guess you could have asked your older teachers in your school about this. But seeing as you asked it here...  Everything was done by hand - and I mean everything from attendance to recording grades, to correcting long tests, to establishing rules, etc etc. If you see it on a computer today, it was done the LONG way before computers.   Teachers used lesson plan books and wrote in detail. Some still continue that today despite the computer. Some teachers just don't want to learn how to use a computer especially if they learned how to do this with a pencil and paper when they were training. It has been the most difficult group to teach computers to by the way. Teachers are perfectionists and they were afraid they would mess up a computer just by hitting the wrong button. So they stayed with pencil and paper - it was more effective for them and they were sure that the information was the way they wanted it.   Now, don't misunderstand here - there is a lot to be said for NO computers. There were no games to be distracted by, no iPods, no Wii, no laptops -  it was books, paper, pencils, study. Now it's a computer, books, paper, pencils and study.   Remember that the computer is just another tool for us to learn and teach by. It can be a good thing, it can be a bad thing, depending on how you use it.   Unplug it and what have you got? Just you and your brain.   I hope this inspires some discussion in your class or at least some thought as to what the place of computers is in education today. It's an interesting topic.   Good luck!

Dyslexia is a lot more than reversing letters though - for example, my son is dyslexic, and has no problem reading (reads well above grade level), but his brain doesn't process phonetic sounds that he hears.  This makes spelling a mess for him, and writing as well.      I wouldn't worry about it; most kids her age do this.  It's awesome that you asked about it though - and it sounds like you're doing a great job teaching her!

7Vy4K83Gaa	its good but here are some changes that i made: <br>  <br>  For the totem pole, the animals that I chose were a deer, an owl, a salmon, a dove, and a hummingbird. These five animals have similar characteristics as I do. For instance, deer in native’s belief represents compassion, peace, caring, adventures, gentleness and many more, these characteristics resemble my personality because I care about others and when they are in need I try my best to help them. Secondly, I chose the owl because it represents insight, clairvoyance, and messenger. For instance, I try to be insightful by… Thirdly, I chose salmon because it symbolizes proud, confidence, wisdom and inspiration because every thing I do, I do it with confidence and I have inspirations to help me reach my goals in life. Furthermore, I chose dove, which symbolizes love, gentleness, cross-world communication and peace. I chose dove because I try to love and gentleness towards people. Finally, I chose hummingbird, which represents timelessness, healing, warrior and a messenger because I fight for what I want and I try my best to achieve it.|`|eTVF46eoaa	After the word more put period.

So you're either looking to do premed (a course sequence, not a major, and you can do it at any 4-year college) or the requirements for entering a grad program in neurology - biology, chemistry, and/or psychology.
EaDJpvs0aa	School is an environment in which people go to learn.  School is the easiest parts of life. Although it does suck, we still have to do it.  This is nothing compared to going to work and stuff.|`|8j7FCEOraa	lol Wait until you are out of school. Your going to look back and be like damn, that was the easiest time of my life.    Add: If you want to fight about being 'free' in this world then you've got alot more to talk about then just the education system. Thats the way the world works, you need education to get a job, you need a job to buy a house, you need a house to have a family. You're going to have a hard enough time getting a good job with just a highschool education. If you want to be free then fine. But that also means being a street bum, because people actually have to work for the things they get in this life.

AA11901508	After 31 years in the classroom, I have come to realize that try as you might, some students are just going to make poor decisions in regard to their behavior.  Occasionally there have been times when I look back that I see that my reaction or response might have "added fuel to the fire" but those times are infrequent.  Try not to be so hard on yourself.  Keep up the good work.
ds1RoS80aa	First problem:    -3(4+w) - 6w =  (-3*4) + (-3*w) - 6w =  -12 + -3w - 6w =  -12 - 9w    The problem with Shaikha's answer is the assumption that this equals zero.  You don't say that in your question so we can't assume it.      Second problem:    9/(-3) = -3  44/(-8) = -5.5    So:  9/(-3)-44/(-8) =  (-3) - (-5.5) =  (-3) + 5.5 =  2.5    Hope that helps.  I don't understand the method Shaikha uses, but it seems to work.  The problem with his/her answer is in the second to last line:    -72/24-(-132)/24    If you subtract a negative number such as (-132)/24, that is the same as adding 132/24.  He/She subtracted (132/24).|`|YYJ2SlKbaa	The first one you have to distribute the -3 with 4+w|`|8ltErjr4aa	1Distribute -3 into parenthesis and then add or subtract like term meaning -12-3w-6w=  combine like terms              answer -12-9w|`|Ym6ZxUiWaa	-3(4+w)-6w=0  -12-3w-6w=0  -12-9w=0  -9w=12  -9w/-9=12/-9  w=1.33  --> steps  mutiply (-3)through the brackets -12-3w-6w  add-3w-6w=-9w   we move -12 to the other side   -9w =12   divide by -9 so we can have w alone  w=1.33    --------------------------------------...  9/(-3)-44/(-8)  (9*-8)/(-3*-8)-(44*-3)/(-8*-3)  -72/24-(-132)/24  = -8.5    --> stepss   we make the domeniter equal by multiplcation   (9*-8)/(-3*-8)-(44*-3)/(-8*-3)  than we substract and divide -204/24
LKUjbuCuaa	you use math(s) in most lines of work, including jobs in which you would never expect it.      Would you expect a psychologist, educational expert or ecologist to use math, for example.

It doesn't have much use in the beginning(i.e. in school and all) but in future it is used in a hell lot of stuff. Each and every technical subject(not languages) in the world uses mathematics to some degree.  In Bio for size ratios and concentration of substances etc... In Chemistry for amounts of chemicals.In Physics for all the calculations. Even in IT/Computer studies it has many uses. And commerce.....Well those are based on numbers. Dude! If you are scared of giving maths exam my answer to you is "DON'T".It is very easy. Just keep doing the past papers and the least you would scrap would be a "B". The Least. I gave my Maths IG last year and I and my 99% of the batch(literally) got an A*.Seriously!! Maths in my opinion is the best subject ever. It is a good thing it is compulsary.Hope you like the answer. Thanks for reading(i.e. if you have read it)XD.....XD
