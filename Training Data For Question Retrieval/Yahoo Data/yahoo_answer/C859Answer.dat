067eb67d4b939c7da11d1ae0a597a9c0aa	Si tu as eu un travail dclar pendant suffisamment longtemps, tu peux prtendre au ch?mage en France si tu as t licencie ou si tu tais en fin de contrat en Italie. Il faut cependant demander un imprim le E quelque chose (je ne me souviens pas) de la part de l'agence locale pour l'emploi ou un autre organisme (renseigne-toi auprs des euros conseillers). Ensuite, on te fera une quivalence de salaire que tu aurais touch en France (Le ministre du Travail, je crois). Il faut travailler, je crois un jour en France pour prtendre  des allocations ch?mage (sous condition que tu ais t licencie en Italie ou en fin de contrat et que tu ais travaill suffisamment longtemps). Si tu russis  travailler un mois en France et que c'est un CDD ou que tu te fais licencier, on prendra alors ton salaire que tu avais en France, avec la dure rtroactive du temps que tu as travaill en Italie.  Pour les jeunes filles au pair, je ne sais pas comment cela fonctionne, mais vas-voir d'urgence un euroconseiller (l'ANPE te donnera un nom dans ta rgion). Pour la dure de la retraite, tu peux te faire donner l'quivalence en France.   Moi,  une poque, j'ai boss au Luxembourg en interim pendant 9 mois. J'ai par la suite retrouv un boulot en France en CDI que je n'ai valid. Le boulot en France a dur 7 semaines et pour les allocations ch?mages, ils ont pris mon salaire fran?ais (car >  un mois) et la dure de travail au Luxembourg. Pour la retraite, il me semble que c'est inscrit sur mon dossier ( consulter sur internet), mais le ministre du travail fran?ais a rabaiss considrablement mon salaire compte tenu qu'on est trs bien pay au Luxembourg. Conclusion : j'y ai perdu, mais j'ai d? y gagner par la suite car ?a faisait plut?t bien d'avoir travaill  l'tranger. N'oublie surtout pas de faire valider ton E quelque chose en Italie. Si ce que tu a gagn n'atteind pas le plafond trimestriel de la retraite fran?aise alors tu n'auras rien. Tente le coup, il faut de la patience, tlphoner et leur casser les pieds.  Ton exprience au pair ne peut tre que positive, car si tu parles italien, tu peux faire des choses intressantes, surtout dans la rgion Rh?ne-Alpes.|`|e0CamsGMaa	je ne sais pas si vous cotise en Italie pour le ch?mage, si oui vous aurez droit au ch?mage en Italie.

Il datore di lavoro pu richiedere che gli sia fatto un'altro controllo per accertarsi che veramente  malato altrimenti rimandarlo al lavoro. Naturalmente, a questo punto, la responsabilit se la assume il medico di controllo. Ci sono tante altre cose da prendere inconsiderazione ma non mi prolungo di pi. Ciao|`|6d8264dae8d9e00537d01fab766197a5aa	la malattia prevedeva l'impossibilt di muoversi?

Salvo ovviamente che uno sia fuori casa per esami clinici/visite.

In pratica, dipende..... In caso di licenziamento, il dipendente pu ricorrere alla magistratura del lavoro, per cui, alla fine, tutto dipende dalla decisione del giudice. Non  cos scontato che il giudice dia ragione al datore di lavoro, anche in presenza di prove schiaccianti contro il lavoratore. Ricordo il caso di un operaio, in malattia, beccato e fotografato allo stadio mentre assisteva alla partita. Venne licenziato, ma il giudice ne ordin la riassunzione.  Comunque sia,  chiaro che il futuro di un dipendente la cui riassunzione  forzata dal giudice non  molto roseo. Penso che al tuo amico converrebbe tentare di ricomporre amichevolmente la questione, esponendo le sue ragioni al datore di lavoro e promettendo di non farlo pi. Se il tentativo non ha successo, penso gli convenga cercarsi subito un altro lavoro e, nel frattenpo, rigare diritto.....
Soi4pKzCaa	No non puoi farlo. La questione non  per quanto riguarda il reddito, ma il massimo delle ore lavorabili per il lavoratore. 40 ore sono quelle per contratto e puoi arrivare ad un massimo di 48 ore con gli straordinari, altrimenti scatta la sanzione sia per il lavoratore sia per il datore di lavoro. Per poter fare quindi due lavori tu dovresti fare un massimo di 40 ore settimanali pi 8 ore si straordinari.

p4K2buKXaa	Don't ask for anything really low OR really high.  Generally, you can't go wrong with writing in 'Negotiable' or 'Open' in the desired box.  However, if you are required to enter a numeric value, or feel that you should, take a visit to salary.com.  You can type in the job title and zip code of the area, and it has relevant filters to help you narrow things down (such as inputting your level of education to more accurately depict the worth of your education).  For instance, running a search for Paralegal in Houston, TX returns the results that 90% of paralegals make at least $33,000 a year.  50% of paralegals in Houston make at least $46,000 a year.  25% of paralegals make at least $54,000, etc.  The site has an easy to understand graph that lays everything out for you.  Considering these factors, you're looking to make as a new paralegal at least $30,000/yearly.  But if you put $30,000, your future employer is always going to try and negotiate you DOWN, forcing you to settle for perhaps $25,000-27,000.  So as a rule of thumb, you want to take the base minimum of what you would settle for, and add 10-15% of it to it.  So I would put a nice figure of $35,000.  It's not outlandish, and if they try to talk you down, you should at least get $30,000, which is what you wanted anyway, and if they decide to hire you on at $35,000 which is what you asked for, then it's all the better, because you got more than you expected.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Most universities have some sort of 'Career Centre' -- ask there, they'll have plenty of experience with your situation, transitioning from student employment to a 'real job'.

So you probably won't get the laptop for 50 cents.Sometimes they place a reserve at the auction so that they won't be forced to give something for a very low price. If they are using this you will see the message "reserve not met" which would mean if the highest bid was 50 cents, then they wouldn't be forced to sell it to you.It is important that you look at the sellers feedback before you bid to make sure you are dealing with a reliable seller.|`|PClyMS0xaa	Well, I've made a few purchases on eBay, but they were all reasonably priced.

And if you do find a laptop for 50 cents, go ahead and bid, the seller is binded to sell it to you.   However, that situation would barely ever occur as there are reserves and also many people wait at the last moment to place a bid  23 hours is a lot of time on eBay, It has a lot of customers and therefore a good place to sell and buy stuff.

I had a friend who bought a designer handbag from Ebay and when I inspected it for her the only give away that it was fake were the small screws on the interior of the bag. As for your "guarantee", try getting a refund from a scammer. It doesn't happen!
QCtJJ04Uaa	A background check does not bring up past employers. Usually all it does it check for any criminal history such as any arrests or charges.    If you don't want a certain employer to be contacted, simply take that one off your resume before you turn it in. Some applications also have a section where they ask if they can contact a past employer and you can select no, but be prepared to explain why. Some people may think of that as suspicious. For that reason, it may be better to not include it at all.|`|ry4DKt0Qaa	They will find out.  Trying to hide it could lose you the job.|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	Most employment applications ask for "complete information and that you can be terminated for not providing such"      But on a resume you put down what you want.  If you had a job you will get a bad review from, be ready with a good explanation.|`|zYQtUuzmaa	Background checks are to see if you have a criminal record.  Where previous jobs are concerned the only information they have is the info you provide. So if you want to leave a job out then you can go ahead and do so.

2id292TDaa	I suggest you work with a REALTOR for several reasons:    1. Your Realtor will be able to help you determine how much you should offer for that house based on local comparable properties, condition of the house, market conditions, and any buyer incentives.    2. As a "Buyer's Broker", that Realtor's services are paid by the seller, not the buyer, unless you sign a Buyer Representative Contract that states otherwise.    3. You are a first time home buyer. Buying a house is an exciting and emotional event. If this is your "dream" house, why not allow a professional to help you get that dream house. A good Realtor will help you determine what price to offer and with what terms. Your Realtor will help facilitate the transaction and ensure your interests are protected.      4. The house you want is listed on the MLS, meaning that the Seller is being represented by a Realtor. The seller's Realtor will be looking out for the seller's best interest, wouldn't you like to be represented by your own Realtor who will be looking out for your own interest? If you chose to not have you own Realtor, then you will be represented by the Seller's Realtor as well. So you might as well have your own Realtor who will be working for you and representing you in the transaction.    5. You can hire a lawyer to write the purchase contract, but there are many other aspects of the transaction such as inspections, working with lenders, title companies, appraisals, etc. I'm not sure to what extent a lawyer will be involved in these details, but I am certain that they will be billing you for every minute of their time they spend working on your behalf.  Bottom line, you will be paying your Lawyer's fees, but the Seller will be paying your Realtor's fee. Which would you prefer?    I'm a Realtor and many may think my answer is highly bias, but if I was a doctor, accountant, or factory worker, I would still suggest you work with a Realtor. I'm not advocating you pick any Realtor to represent you, ask your family and friends if they can refer you to a Realtor they have worked with and are satisfied with that Realtor's services, personality, and work ethics. I know there are some Realtors out there that have given the public a negative image of us, but great Realtors are out there as well and I hope you find one and get the house of your dreams.    If you want more general information on buying a home, you can visit my website at www.JoelCapellan.com. This information applies in California, but the basics of homebuying are there. They do differ state to state, and again, that is why you need a local Realtor to help you in your transaction to see what applies to your situation.    Good luck house hunting and I hope you do get your dream house.|`|40ed8373886309665b44b92fc9ab7c0faa	So - I hate to say this, but I agree that you should use a realtor...I bought my first home without a realtor (with the help of a lawyer, who btw, apparently knew less about real estate then I did) and whatever the difference in cost I would gladly pay it, had I to do it over again. It was a nightmare figuring everything out on my own and keeping paperwork straight.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Why would you not use a realtor?  It doesn't really cost you anything, and you're likely to get the best deal.|`|uFXR9TsLaa	get a realtor.  Without one you do not know the comps and how to negotiate the best deal.  People without realtors always end up paying more.|`|ZzlfFjOuaa	why would you choose a realtor? they get 5% of the cost of the house, maybe more!    I'm also a first time home buyer. Why would anybody choose to go through a realtor if he or she did not have to? I suppose you would need some kind of lawyer to make sure the contract that you are signing is legally binding and will put the title in your name. Do you have lawyer friends? A lawyer is probably more expensive than a realtor, though, huh? I'm just curious about this question my own self. What do you? just knock on the door and ask to buy their house? How will you get the contact information to contact the owners of the house?

Perhaps you're referring to to Sherry Peel Jackson, a former IRS accountant who claimed there was no such law. Mrs. Jackson is now in prison for willful failure to file a return or pay tax. She appealed and lost. She hates the food and complains that the prison is cold at night.    Even though she was told the law several times, and the judge told her again at her sentencing, she still claims there is no law. Some people are just dense.    In those cases where people have "won" in front of a jury, they've only won in the sense of avoiding prison. Basically, they convinced the jury that they were too stupid to understand the law. They still had to pay every penny of tax.|`|aTlpDt84aa	Of course!  That's why people go to jail for tax evasion!|`|9eyETvWpaa	I'm guessing you're from the USA.

Sure I have a fixed payment with a rate somewhere around 8.5%, BUT I JUST RECEIVED A LETTER SAYING THAT THE INTEREST RATE WAS GOING TO AROUND 13% BUT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE YOUR PAYMENT WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  It went on to say it had to do with the cost of doing business.    I think you also have to pay an upfront fee of about 3% of the loan amount.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM IF POSSIBLE|`|nDnrA2jsaa	i work in the debt settlement business.. i just had a call today from a guy that has been with COFS for 2yrs.  he said he entered $38K into the program @ 12.99% w/a payment of $904 for 5 yrs..  he is upset cuz he just received a letter stating an increase to 16.99%.  he has made all his payments on time and hasnt missed one.  he stated that he was told by customer svc. that due to the economy they have made increases on most if not all accounts.  COFS is funded or owned by Credit One; i personally have a credit card with them.  many of the credit consolidation and consumer credit counseling companies are either funded or owned by c/c companies.  based on our debt settlement program with the same payment of $904, we'd have him out of our program in 2yrs.  something to think about!

I was thinking of buying a duplex and living in it with my tenant as neighbor. I was wondering what kind of legally binding contracts would be necessary to make sure the tenant pays rent. (and does not bring cockroaches into the building! yikes! What would YOU do, then?????!) May I discriminate against smokers if I have to live next door? I have asthma!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does anyone know? Thanks!     PS. the original idea, is to have a relative live next door to me, but, if I can't get my neice/nephew/cousin/sister to pay rent, not just mooch off me! I need some legally binding document. Or... must I accept all applications as a possibility to live in my building? if I already have a tenant in mind????? Are there discrimination laws? will I be in trouble? if I favor allowing my cousin to live next door? instead of "Bob, the smoker"????

You don't have to say what you do on the forms.  As long as you know the amount you earned that's all you need.  You write it in on the forms (or tell the amount to whomever is don't your taxes) and you don't have submit actual proof or pay stubs.  The IRS only needs that if you are audited in the future.

There is an import dept just for this.

It could not be reregistered until all these were done.  It would also have a Q reg for ever too to show it was an import.  If this is not happening then something dodgy going on for sure.
0SFGnjq2aa	if you ordered the item on your credit card, then you shouldnt worry, as if you pay for items by this method and they dont arrive, then you can claim the money back from your credit card company.    If the order was stated as guaranteed next day delivery, and that didnt happen, then they have broke the contract on delivery and yes, you are entitled to dispute this.    As for the company, why are they not replying to you?  Inform them that you will be contacting your bank if paid by credit card and that you will be asking them for a dispute form, and failing that inform them that the internet is a wide medium and you could inform potential customers of theirs that they dont deliver when they promise.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I had a similar thing - it said 24h delivery but when I contacted them saying it hadn't come they said Royal Mail say it could take up to 5 days to arrive so I had to buy one and now it still hasn't come about 3 weeks later and they're refusing to refund me, they just said we've re-sent it, it could take 3-4 days to arrive. Urgh!     If you can't get any contact at all then try going to a consumer advice center, or CAB if there aren't any specialist consumer places in your area.

Once you have it set up you can list your item for sale, when deciding on the price to sell your item you need to remember you need to make a profit off of it, when deciding on how much you are going to charge for shipping you need to remember that going through customs is additional fees and all. Take in to account that after your customer buys the item and pays for shipping that you are paying at least 15% less than what he is paying you for the entire order.    That is a easy way to make profit|`|CzXNXJHpaa	Hi there,   anything is possible, if you log in to ebay, select site map (top right) then look down the listings to sell internationally, you will see that the adress will be ebay.in If when you are building your advert you select intenational it is all explained in as much detail as you want  hope this helps   good luck

Ja que tem mais apetite para acoes, entre com 60% a 75% do seu investimento de 40 mil em renda variavel ( compra direta de acoes ou clube de investimentos) e 40%-25% em renda fixa (titulos do tesouro, fundo DI, cdbs).    Bons investimentos.

There are a few legitimate data entry companies but are not hiring and have large waiting lists (1-2yrs). The majority of data entry jobs you seen online are scams. A real company will want you to have skills inc fast typing, may want you to know MS Excel, and will usually ask that you have high speed internet. Once in a long while you may found one online on a job website but thats rare.

mwkfirjRaa	My recommendation is that you set aside $1,000 in a federally-insured savings or money market account as an emergency fund.  Then, apply the remainder of your refund against your credit card balances.      My other recommendation is that you pay off the credit cards with the smallest balances first, so you will have fewer accounts to tackle.  This gives you a big emotional boost, and helps you stay in the debt reduction game a little longer.    As soon as you pay off your credit cards and other debt, other than a mortgage, you can beef up that emergency account.    Good luck!|`|PFXNGl1Uaa	it is good to have a little for emergency. But credit card interest vs savings account interest??????|`|XZG35fxSaa	If you don't have any other savings, I would recommend paying a minimum amount and saving the rest.  You'll pay more in interest, of course, but you never know when you'll need that cash for an emergency.|`|suWnr83laa	I would pay off most of the credit card and save the rest of it in case of an emergency.  Just be very strict with yourselves about paying off the remaining credit card balance quickly and knowing what an "emergency" is as far as the saved money is concerned.|`|um6rmdegaa	pay off credit cards then figure out how much you pay for c/c now and put most or all of that in savings.
mwkfirjRaa	Some banks and credit unions offer this option, but many do not.  It's just too difficult with automated check processes and electronic transactions to enforce the dual signature requirement.    Most joint accounts allow either person to write checks and withdraw cash.  Either person has the right to all the money in the account.    All you can do is call different banks and credit unions and see what they offer.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	sure can!!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Don't let allow any one to convince you to change to a joint account under both your names with 'or' instead of 'and' Or  means either of the parties can withdraw as much as they without the other person even knowing  and there's nothing you can do. If you are married, unless you don't trust your spouse, a joint account should be acceptable. One option is for both of you to have separate accounts  and a third account for joint debts. Sit down and figure out how much each person  should contribute and when a bill is due each of you put your share in the joint account.That alone solves a lot of problems because both of you will have some spending money that you can do with as you will without compromising your bill paying. Btw to be fair the one who makes the most money should deposit a larger amount. It's worked for my husband and me and we've been married 20 years and still going. We bank at Compass and we have 3 checking accounts and my husband's business account so I would image any bank or Credit Union will let  you have 3 different accounts.|`|df60a9c74cae5865e20fbd697771af95aa	I guess one of both would have to disappear, at the time the remaining one includes the others name and funds.

When I dealt with morgage brokers, they were fast and efficient.|`|HDpCTaEtaa	Most banks will just sell your mortgage to an investor. So it doesn't really matter what bank you "choose".

tw44fqCpaa	How long ago did you do this?  Just now?  If your parents already did their taxes and claimed you - your efile will be rejected so you make the change and resubmit.  If they haven't filed yet than yours will be accepted and you need to file a 1040X to correct it after you receive your refund.  It has to be mailed - can't be efiled.  And depending on how long it takes them to process the amendment, and when your parents want to file - they may be stuck mailing instead of efiling due to being rejected over the duplicate ss  claim.|`|AA11747374	It's called an amended return, where you make corrections to a filed return.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Yes.

e9VWQ4RFaa	First check your employee handbook for policies regarding pregnant employees. If there's none listed, and you plan to return to this job after the birth, then it's in your best interests and your baby's - and even the company's! - to contact human resources. Some actions by your supervisor may actually be abusive (such as discussions about your private physical needs with other employees or limiting your bathroom breaks), harassing, discriminatory, and even downright illegal. Companies don't want to protect managers or supervisors that could expose them to potential and costly EEOC complaints or lawsuits. And just because you're pregnant, you don't deserve to be treated this way.|`|iMZqwnUoaa	Personally i think you are over-reacting. You are about to go into you second trimester.

You waited 'a minute' and he sent someone to relieve you... what do you want from him... He is in a business after all. Now you want to report him???|`|mTK8noEAaa	I wouldn't call the manager to complain unless you think he is likely to accept your complaints.    Either a union official, an HR person or the manager's manager (as the last resort) would be the people to speak to.    Whether he is entitled to cut your hours or not, belittling you and making comments about your health in front of other staff is bullying and is unacceptable.|`|AA10387392	You should make him aware of what you noticed and if nothing changes, report it right away.

They charge interest on the dollars they issue, because they have the power to do so, If anyone has a problem with this, they should take it up with their elected officials;  though I doubt it will help.    3.) To try to pay back the interest, more dollars must be issued.   It's designed so that the nation is always in debt.    4.) The President chooses the board members that he is told to do so, or else he will find himself in a rain of bullets like Pres. JFK.:  No one but no one messes with these International Banksters.    5.)  The members vote on monetary policy.  Their vote count as one vote for a total of seven.    6.)  Our own Government has but its two votes, which count for squat against the banksters five votes.    This is all stuff that should be covered in a high school government class, but it's not.

e9VWQ4RFaa	I had a boss that did this once, and in a meeting setting. As I predicted, it was poorly managed and caused a lot of bad feeling between her and her department. I declined to participate, saying that this wasn't really my role to do so and as such I didn't feel I could do this effectively.     If it's part of the company's official review process, that's one thing, but personally I've never seen that. I have, however, seen managers do this for a variety of other reasons: laziness, reluctance to take responsibility as managers, forcing coworkers to 'compete' against each other, or even, as you suggest, to uncover 'dirt' on others. I've even known one manager who tried it because he sneaked out of the office so much to attend baseball games that he had no idea whether his staffers were doing a good job or not.    You might want to ask around to find out if this is a real practice at the company or just something dreamed up by the boss, and then take your cues from there.|`|nxZQKmjMaa	Usually when managers ask employees about their peers work performance and team skills it's to evaluate that particular employee on the benefits of keeping them. They want to make sure that they are a productive member of the organization, a team player and an effective communicator with coworkers and clients/customers.     There are several performance evaluation processes companies use. Therefore, it is not illegal to get another employees input when performing evaluations. But you can opt out of it due to personal differences. Your employer does not have to force you nor should they punish you for declining to comment on that particular employee.    If you accept however, your employer will not disclose any information you provided. Everything you say will stay between you and the employer.

No need to commit to a specific career just yet, but these are some to explore:  writing articles for magazines (journalism)  being a news or fashion photographer for the music or fashion industry  being an editor  working in a business capacity for a publishing company or magazine, for example in marketing, advertising or publicity  filmmaking    Read up now on what goes on at a magazine. Get a student internship at one when you're in college. Or find a local magazine and see if they have teen go-fer or clerical jobs, or volunteer at one to learn the ropes.    Also try writing articles for local, neighborhood or town papers. Submitting them with photos greatly increases your chances of getting them accpeted.

It's not society that says you have to, but take it from one who put off getting that degree for 10 years, it's all but impossible to even get an interview without it.     That said, on average most adult will have between 3 and 5 careers in their lifetimes. Just because you pick something now doesn't mean you're locked into it for the rest of your life.    If you're really looking for some direction now, don't be afraid to talk to a career counselor to narrow your options to fit your interests. Also, cruise job boards like Monster to get a sense of what kinds of jobs exist out there and what employers are looking for. You may see something interesting that hadn't occurred to you before.

If you get a refund, what takes time is the store processing a refund, they pay the bank rather then the account. The bank then process that to your account and this takes them time too.    But agree yes, banks process money in the favour of not paying interest to the consumer as the less money in your account, the less interest they pay you. And it is kind of odd that now banks are saying "money may appear in your account sooner then normal" at the same time that interest rates are being cut...

fbqrIdkuaa	A Loan Officer is basically a sales person.  They sell the mortgage product to the borrowers.    Whether or not it is a good job or how much it pays depends on who you work for.

If they are willing to train you and pay you a decent salary, that might make it worth while.

NFt6MQD0aa	No, it is not price fixing. First, the vendor has a choice as to whether or not to accept the contract and the terms from the supplier so it is perfectly acceptable for the supplier to dictate terms. If the the vendor doesn't like them they don't have to buy and if enough people don't like them the supplier will either have to change the terms or go out of business.   Also, this isn't collusion between competing vendors to set an above market price (market price with competition) that consumers will pay due to a lack of information. For it to be price fixing two or more competitors have to collude to maintain matching prices so they can share the market equally. This is illegal because it denies the market certain important information. Price fixing is more common than you might think because it is hard to prove. Additionally, it usually doesn't last long because there is always an incentive for one party to undercut the price to take the business of the entire market.

EI4fmPnoaa	Unless you're living on BIA trust land (and you're not, or else you wouldn't be asking this question), you still have to pay taxes like everyone else. In fact, even if you were living on federal trust land, the only thing you'd get to avoid paying is property tax. You still pay income tax, sales tax, and every other tax that everyone else has to pay. And if the land you're living on is not federal trust land, then you'll have to pay property taxes, too.    If you're actually eligible for enrollment in the Cherokee Nation, then you'll have an ancestor on the Final Dawes Rolls. If you're eligible for membership in the Eastern Cherokee Nation (North Carolina) then you'll have an ancestor on their census.  If your grandmother really was a "full" Cherokee, then you might be eligible for membership in the UKB. Membership criteria is the same as for the Cherokee Nation, but the "blood quantum" requirement is higher. But I find it hard to believe that someone not already enrolled really has an ancestor that close.    And if you don't have an ancestor on any of those lists? Congratulations, you're white! Your Cherokee ancestor was able to avoid confiscation of her property, loss of all political rights, and forced relocation to some of the most god-forsaken lands in the entire United States. Quit complaining because you don't get to have "special rights" now. You already got yours. Let somebody else have a turn.    Oh, and as for the other benefits? The Cherokee Nation has steadfastly resisted individual payouts from casino revenues, and are instead putting the money into non-casino businesses and social services for tribal members living within the 14-county service area of Oklahoma. Which, once again, if you have to ask the question, you're evidently not.    Feel free to celebrate your Native American ancestry, just as other white people celebrate their French, German, or Scottish ancestry. But don't ask for money, because there isn't any. And it isn't intended for you, anyway.    Here's the Cherokee Nation web site:|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The TRIBE may be tax exempt, the tribal MEMBERS are not.|`|wXloRCegaa	If your grandma is full blooded then she should have the necessary paperwork.

However, state income taxes have been held not to apply to tribal income earned on the reservation by Indians domiciled (permanently living) on the reservation.  Indians working off the reservation are generally fully subject to taxation by the state in which they work and Indians living off the reservation on state land are also generally fully taxable by the state in which they live.

Ge6oHWQ1aa	Yes, you have to.  If you don't it's Tax Evasion.  If you lie on it it's Tax Fraud.|`|AA10469473	Well, you should be worried that the FAFSA people will catch you when they compare what you claimed against IRS records, since you could lose your financial aid for lying on the application for saying you don't make any money when you do and could have to pay back what you've already gotten, plus penalties and interest.  Whether or not you file a return, the IRS has your income info since your employer reports it to them.    If you are a dependent and made over $5450, or are not a dependent and made over $8950, you are required to file a return.  If you don't and have a refund coming, they'll just keep the refund.  If you don't file and owe more tax rather than having a refund, the IRS will eventually just send you a bill for what you owed originally plus interest and penalties.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Well, sounds like you could go to jail for fraud.|`|WmkG0on3aa	yea you should be worried, you could go to jail|`|pt6wIlS1aa	If your boss is withholding money for taxes, then you are officially on record as earning the money. You only have to file a tax return if you earn over a certain amount. But you want to file, because you'll probably get some money back as a refund or rebate.     Lying on your financial aid application is FRAUD. If they find out about your income, they may expect you to pay them back, plus interest and penalties. If you don't earn a whole lot, it may not affect your financial aid at all.|`|CvkTOBZGaa	Hi, I'm Susan, and I work for TurboTax.    When your boss takes taxes out of your paycheck, he is reporting your wages and the taxes he withheld to the IRS, and he also pays that amount to the government on a regular basis.  I assume you will receive a W2 form - if you haven't already.  If you do not file a return, some time down the road you will get a letter from the IRS and you will owe penalties for not filing a timely return, possibly also interest on any unpaid tax liability.    I'm not sure what your Financial Aid situation is, but I recommend that you be forthright with them about your true income situation.    Hope this helps,  Susan, TurboTax Tax Compliance Service manager|`|VI2dc4xcaa	As far as I know, yes, you are required to file a tax return.|`|OjLKcuviaa	I am almost sure that if you make less that 4000 you do not need to file taxes but If you put 0 for dependents on your taxes you will almost always make money by filing. Plus you need your tax information to get most financial aid from the government.|`|fFvIK7hQaa	You are really only required to file a return if you owe additional tax.  If you dont owe additonal tax (have a refund) the IRS has no claim against you.      While it is great to file a return anyway, you are just wasting your time and killing trees.    Course, your boss could be a total Byatch and might not actually be sending the money into the IRS.  You'll only know if you file a return and claim the alleged witholding.    Have a doogie and worry about it next year.    420 and out.

JdgEQsi7aa	The benefits of diversification change significantly over time. And second, besides the US investor, the benefits of diversification are always existent. Therefore, the investors could mostly increase the performance of their portfolios by investing in international asset.  To sum up, international diversification results in significant additional returns for the investors under consideration (except the US investor). Although these additional returns are time varying and different according to the currency of the investor, a better international diversification improves the portfolio performance. A Europe-wide diversification leads to a significant increase in the Sharpe ratio, which is in most cases even higher than the improvement due to a world-wide diversification. Therefore, a further integration of European capital markets that diminishes the home bias should result in higher portfolio returns for European investors.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Your question hinges on the word "benefits." I think that there must be some notional point at which acquiring additional types stocks goes beyond diversification and is really a matter of buying more types of stocks for the sheer hell of it. You might just as well invest in indexes.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	It is difficult to track too many stocks in your portfolio, unless you have a huge team of analysts and fund managers.    As an individual investor, you should not hold more than 10 stocks in your portfolio as overdiversification is also not good.    If you want diversification, invest in mutual funds. Exchange Traded Funds are a very good option. Check this link: http://in.biz.yahoo.com/090131/203/6ze61...    Happy Investing|`|Ch9TedMcaa	More diversification means less risk.    So it increases. Good luck.|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	the more you diversify, the more you eliminate unsystematic risk through inherent cross-hedges.    now, if you're talking about aggregate benefit, that should always increase as the number of securities in the portfolio increases.    if you're talking about marginal benefit, especially with regard to net benefit, once you have too many different securities, frictional costs (transaction costs) can actually more than cancel out the minimal marginal benefit to the aggregate, and impose a negative marginal benefit on net.
CvkTOBZGaa	Hi, I'm Susan, and I work for TurboTax.    Call your tax preparer's office as soon as  you can to see if they can resubmit with the correct information.  They can correct the return up until the time that it is officially "received" by the IRS's computer system.    Depending on why you need to delete a dependent - that could cause your electronically filed return to be "rejected" by the IRS (for example because the dependent had already been claimed by someone else who has already filed their return) - and then you can correct the return and resubmit.    If the return is "Accepted" by the IRS, then you will have to file a Form 1040X to amend your return.  Your JH tax preparer should be able to help you do this.    Hope this helps,  Susan, TurboTax Tax Compliance Service Manager|`|5ocZVuaCaa	If you are unable to stop or cancel the e-filed return, you will need to file an amended return (1040x) Please DO NOT file it now. Please wait until the system processes your original filing, then submit the amended return.

COKp8MVYaa	I would start right on campus with your college store.  Not only the store itself but look at the products carried.  Suggest to the store the same position each issue (ie back cover) Also look to corporations that hire in your field of study - Parker, GE, Boeing, etc.. and alumni who want to promote their businesses as well as support the school via the paper.  Although there are fine lines between editorial and advertising - offering an interview my not be a bad idea.  If you have Pepsi on campus go to the local distributor, same for Coke or Frito Lay.  No need to hunt down a top exec at the national level.  Check the vending machine for a label and contact number...   Call other schools and ask for a copy of their paper - see who's advertising - go from there.  Unlike others that have replied, I would not go into a meeting with an ad already mocked up.  Ideas and suggestions are one thing - but once they look at an actual ad, it will get stuck in their head - tough thing to undo if it's not the message they want to convey.    Live by numbers die by numbers - if I run the local pizza shop I already know how many students do or don't eat my pizza.  Once you discount its a tough road to increase esp in hard economical times.  Show your value over other choices.  Best wishes.|`|M2AiWt85aa	You need to make sure the businesses feel that they are getting a great deal for their ad!    Take in to your meeting with local businesses the % of students who do certain things (like eat out, shop locally, have pets, etc.) to show them the potential of placing an ad. (Also tell them the readership of the paper.)    Also, do you have the authority to give them a discount if they commit to 3 months of advertising?  (Remind them that any new marketing campaign takes at least 3 months to see it's effectiveness.)    Start with some mom and pop stores, move on to national chains.  The more smaller stores you can get in there (they will be easier to sell the idea to), the more other people will want to have an ad in there too.    Everybody wants and needs to sell their product or service.  Otherwise, why be in business?!  Your job is to find out what they want and give it to them (in terms of advertising).    *Also*  If you can help them create a unique ad that will appeal to the college market - that would be great!  It would be even better if you could go into the meeting with the ad already created!  (Along with survey results of how many students would be likely to go to the store based on that ad!)

JdgEQsi7aa	In Malaysia, any business enterprise must take one of three forms:  (i) a sole proprietorship;  (ii) a partnership; or  (iii)a locally incorporated company or branch of a foreign company.    With the aim of reducing red tape, the Malaysian Government has set up an investment center called the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority ("MIDA"). Senior officers from the Finance and Labor Ministries, Immigration, Customs and Environmental Departments are stationed at MIDA to help answer queries from investors. MIDA's role  is to receive, process and convey decisions on manufacturing projects, including tax and investment incentives, exemptions from import and customs duty, expatriate posts and other matters affecting investors.    1. The Industrial Co-ordination Act 1975  The most important business activity regulated by the MITI is manufacturing. Basically,all manufacturing activity needs to be licensed unless the manufacturer has shareholders' funds of less than M$2.5 million and employs fewer than 75 full-time employees.  The manufacturing license, when issued, usually contains provisions on:   - equity structure;  - transfer of technology by the foreign shareholder;  - employment of Malaysians and expatriates;  - export requirements and the use of raw materials from Malaysia; and  - anti-pollution measures.  Where a proposed manufacturing project involves agreements for the provision of technology, management or intellectual property rights by a foreigner, the agreements must be submitted to the MITI for approval.    or mail me at echos9@yahoo.com. i 'll provide u all details.|`|dMknJjY0aa	this is my clear favorite for this kind of info    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1782170 6dzz5z5...
AA10469473	You enter the amounts from your own records.  You don't send in receipts unless you are audited and they ask for them.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	You enter everything on line 1.  Since they were not reported on a W-2, you do NOT check that box.    I would recommend that you first contact your employer. It is very possible that their accountant was not able to produce these 1099-Misc reports on a timely basis.    If the accountant simply did not produce these reports, I would suggest that you request that he provide you with a copy of these reports. If the employer suggests that you either forget about it or his accountant was not able to produce these reports, then you have 2 possible ways of handling the situation.    On one hand, you can ignore the 1099-Misc! But these is against the law and if you get an audit, you could heavy fines and penalties for not reporting this income, additionally, if the employer gets audited, you might also get into trouble with the IRS.    Or, you could report this income on your tax return as a Schedule C income from self-employment actiivities and offset this against necessary and reasonable business expenses. This is the best approach in my opinion!|`|tw44fqCpaa	You are required to have records of your income and expenses whether or not you receive all your 1099s.  It's all lumped on Line 1 gross receipts.  You won't always receive 1099s for all your income.  Do not check the box about the W2.  If you are using software like turbo tax then you want to be in the business income section.  You will have a spot to enter the gross receipts that weren't reported on a 1099.

JdgEQsi7aa	The Indian retail market, which is the fifth largest retail destination globally, was ranked second after Vietnam as the most attractive emerging market for investment in the retail sector by AT Kearney's seventh annual Global Retail Development Index (GRDI), in 2008. The share of retail trade in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) was between 810 per cent in 2007. It is currently around 12 per cent, and is likely to reach 22 per cent by 2010.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	The retail market in India is facing slowdown with the ongoing financial crisis happening across the world markets.  Since the markets always have internally linked with each other, the impact of the crisis is generally shared among all. The following circumstances are creating unwelcome interruptions to the Indian retail industry. The industry hopes for the best alternations to overcome the acrimonious situations.    Markets in recession worldwide and India too:    The current meltdown in the world markets is shaking the globe today. Not even a single country seems to be off the hook. The high level of inflation has been a wet blanket for the global markets. The roots of the world markets are nearly pulled away with the heavy downfall of the American financial giants. Amongst many countries, India too not exempted from the impact of world financial crisis. All this is leading to a temporary recess for the markets from a regular busy schedule. However, these fluctuations are not new for global market. For the decades long, markets, across the world, have been witnessing such ups and downs. But the ultimately fact is that the market growth rate is always constantly high when comparing to such downfalls.    Economic slowdown:    The Financial crisis is adding to the pressure on global economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now sees the world entering a major slowdown. The recovery would depend on three key factors: commodity prices stabilizing, the crisis in the US housing sector bottoming out, and emerging economies providing a source of resilience. But, if the current crisis were to last longer, the emerging economies are more likely to be affected.    The impact on retail industry:    The inflation or the economic slowdown is adversely affecting the retail industry. With the suddenly disturbed economical status, consumers are gradually losing interest on buying. And for the interested, the unbalanced income, followed by the economic slowdown, is not meeting their buying requirements. This evolution had soon disappointed the hopes of retail industry. Anyhow, its all a short-term crisis for the retail industry until the things turn around.    Low marketing and advertising budgets will work out: :
Y7l9w11Maa	The fact that you closed on your home in 09 makes no difference - the grant still needs to be paid back.  An amendment was recently proposed to congress to raise the potential amount from $7500 to $15000 and have it not be paid back, but it has not been passed yet.  If this is passed, to qualify - the home must have been bought in 09.    My advice to you would be to wait to see if this bill gets passed before you claim the credit- you might potentially get more $$ and *not* have to pay it back.  Whether or not you do this greatly depends on if you need the money now... if you don't, wait around for a bit =)    (EDIT)  You really need to contact a tax professional (like someone from H&R Block or whomever you feel comfortable with).  I found references that this addition to Obama's stimulus package is going to SUNSET the previous home buyers credit... MEANING...once this goes into effect, the previous one will no longer be available!  This could pass within a few months.. so talk to a tax professional ASAP or you may lose all chance at any credits!

You could still file a police report, but without any evidence, there's probably nothing you can do.|`|xJZSpsRhaa	your still alive? then that's good.  Don't worry about it, money is money.  I mean, there's Alot of worse things that could've happened.  But, this is a common thing to have happened.  All you can do at this point is learn from your mistakes and remember next time not to leave it laying around.      It does suck and I'm not saying that.  But, like I said, it will take time to get over.  You still have your health and had a good time right? besides the money? you also have your ID/VISA's/Birthcertifactes/Drivers License... those are the things I would be more worried about.  Trying to get them back is a pain in the a$$.      Also, the police won't do anything.  I think they would see it as a waste of time because who knows how many people touch your wallet.      Sorry to hear about it, but life goes on.    Hope this helps!
Hx88UGlpaa	Christy...seeing you didn't get enough answers...Here's a link to find out what is dischargeable in a bankruptcy and what is not...It's the US Bankruptcy official website @ www.usbankruptcy.gov    Easy answer, if it's a credit card warrant, seeing to take you to court and sue you, yes, it's dischargeable...Student loans, IRS taxes, criminal court fines are not dischargeable in a bankrutpcy filing. Follow that link as it provides excellent information on bk and the new laws. Good Luck!|`|Saul1Bhuaa	You can do whatever you want.  However, certain debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Try to find someone with good credit to cosign. Smaller landlords might not know to ask for credit and cosigners but people are getting more informed now.|`|1o3OqSioaa	Definitely go for the smaller type apt. situation run by a mom and pop operation. They will go more by their instincts and feelings about you. If they like you and think that you deserve a chance to prove yourself, they are more likely to give you that chance. Corporations are cold, and money hungry and don't care about the individual.   If you get letters of recommendations from your teachers, pastor, or any upstanding members of the community that would really help a lot. Also, if  you need your parents to cosign, if they have paid their utilities and mortgage on time, they can use these as references to help get you in with the mom and pop apt. complexes. Yes, offering an additional deposit should definitely help with the smaller complexes.|`|JMmMN4gNaa	cant
KzcDt8V9aa	I will not only tell you the answer, but the way to find the answer,  If $50.00 is the 100%, then what number is 66%? should be the question.    So you put it in a 3-simple rule (that's how it is called):              $50  -  100%               ?   -   66%    Then you multiply in a crossed way 66 X 50 and then divide it by 100 which gives you 33.  Then you subtract this from 50 and will give you 17.    You use this method to find any percent.  Hope this helps.|`|eNpnvpSbaa	$17.00         66% of 50.00 is 33.00 so you subtract 33 from 50 and get 17|`|0obmh7SYaa	forex-  http://tradingsolution.org/|`|Ch9TedMcaa	$33.00    Well yes, the final answer is $17.00. I thought she just meant a straight $50.00- 66% because that's how I read the question.

Bqi7jmsPaa	This has not become law yet. We will have to wait and see what happens.  The president must still sign the bill into law and it must be reconciled to the total stimulus package amount.     There will undoubtedly be more information in the next few days, so I would for sure wait to file if I were a new home buyer.    You should also understand how this "credit" actually works.    It will be a tax credit of 10% of the value of new or existing homes, up to a $15,000 limit and everyone would be eligible, not just first-time homebuyers.    The tax credit isnt really a tax credit, its really just a tax free loan with some qualifications. You have to start paying back this loan within two years and you make equal payments over 15 years. When you sell your home, any profits will go first into paying off that loan. If you sell at a loss, the difference will be forgiven.|`|AA10469473	What was passed was an amendment to add it to the stimulus bill that is currently under consideration.  The bill itself hasn't been passed, and this provision might or might not still be there when the bill is completed.|`|9f5cf371a486f28c8261718807ca8762aa	The credit anyway is not good cause its more like a loan you have to pay it back.|`|AA11747374	go to a tax preparer website or go to the states website and it will have a lot of info for 1st time homebuyer|`|ii7xvDBuaa	no but i know that for the 15k U WONT HAVE TO repay it but for the 7,500 u have to interest free..
jaQnxUZ6aa	Look, this is called hard collection. They are tough on you, and you have to be tough on them. They'll try to use every way possible to get money, and well, you take their offers easy.    Interest rate compensates the bank for the risk it bears by lending money. What happened is that you got a better rate because your dad reduced the risk. Now that the dad's risk went 100% they have to reduce it through different means, and that's by either requiring more collateral/deposit/downpayment, or by increasing the rate. Try to use your credit history with them and negotiate the terms. Offer them a 0.1% rate increase and say otherwise you will move the loan to a different bank and screw them. Banks make money by lending and if they lose customers, they don't make money. Also keep in mind the last thing they want is to replace your loan with your car and try selling it, which isn't their job activity, emphasize that to get more concessions. Now i am a banker and i would do that, i am not sure how much confidence you can project in negotiation, but i suggest you try. Good luck!|`|wqV08EcIaa	They legally cannot do anything to you unless you co-signed his loan.  Threaten them right back with going to a lawyer if they persist.  You can probably hit them with a harassment suit or at least get them to leave you alone.  You have no obligation to your fathers dept unless you signed for it.|`|XZG35fxSaa	It doesn't make sense for the lender to apply your payment to his loan.  They're getting the same amount of money either way.  It sounds like they're bullying you to get your dad to pay up.      He's a cosigner on your loan.  You're not a cosigner on his.  In this situation, his delinquency shouldn't affect your credit, and the lender should have no recourse against you as long as you make your own loan payment.|`|fQpANz3Kaa	just tell the lender you want to be responsible for making the payments.  as long as you make them in a timely manner, you should have no problem|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Two reasons why not to buy a car.    1. Cars are unfriendly to the environment and cause traffic conjestion. Buses and trains are also unfriendly to the environment, however more efficient and cheaper. No matter how badly-run they are right now, they were worse in the past and are most likely to get better in the future.    2. My parents took 8 years to pay off a car loan, and that was only due to the 5th price placing of a lottery ticket. I've heard stories about car loans and debts, it's just not worth getting yourself into that situation when in the near future, public transport will improve, it just needs customers.

AA10464818	I take it you are looking for grant to start a small business    It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business.     One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/... , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.    Your best bet actually will be from the states if they offer grant programs for women (or any other special interest groups -- minorities, women, disabled, veterans, etc). Or check with non profit organizations, particularly women organizations if they offer grants. Examples include    Iowa Women's Foundation http://www.iawf.org/  New Mexico Women's Foundation http://www.nmwf.org/guidelines.html    Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...    "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."    Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Here is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.  http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALO...    Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|N9ygGImkaa	This is how I received my funding for college.    http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/

35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	I don't believe you will.  I'm in much the same position myself.  You don't qualify under the taxpayer section unless you have a net tax liability, and you don't qualify under the training and learning section unless you claim social security payments.    I think what's really unfair is that someone who earns $5,999 doesn't get it and someone who earns $79,999 does.  Or that parents of school children get $950 to assist with their back to school expenses, which basically means half a dozen exercise books and a box of pencils, while we're left needing hundreds of dollars worth of textbooks.    It's probably just an oversight.  I'll send Kevin a letter and get him to sort it out.|`|bUdH8HQ8aa	all i know is that they said workers...not sure if this means full-time or whatever.. bit ambiguous i know. so im not sure sorry
AA10289917	It isn't the bank.  You need to put your purchases on another card, credit card or prepaid card.  Then you pay it off promptly from your checking account at the time you are billed or before.  You have some control, using that method.      I had the same problem.  I had ATM purchases that came with  surprises like you got.  I only use the ATM card for purchases when I definitely have room for mistakes on my part.

The big loser, though, is the government as it will miss out on tax revenue of these executives'  earlier 1,000,000+ income.  The world would be a much better place without all those tax havens. So they should disappear rather than capping the fat cats..|`|0b04c7a0c2d6347def6134f6598d75d4aa	Maybe not if they've become used to 3 or 4 times as much.|`|AA10289917	Yes, with plenty for savings and investments.

4A2IxqI6aa	It's normal to want to explain yourself when receiving criticism.  You don't want to be perceived as "bad" at what you do, so you try to alter that perception.  Everyone does, so most people have been in this situation.    A boss should expect to hear a little feedback like this when giving criticism, but remember, many bosses are human beings too.  They don't particularly want to criticize and hurt people's feelings, and they don't want to deal with it for longer than they really have to.    The bottom line it, in the business context, your explanation doesn't matter.  The behavior that he's criticizing matters, and changing it matters.    The best way to handle it is to put yourself in his place.  Literally pretend that you're the boss.  The boss has a job - goals to accomplish, tasks to perform.  The boss has an employee (you) that isn't getting things done the right way, in the boss's opinion.  And the boss's opinion matters - that's the definition of the boss's job.    So, he's explaining the problems and the changes he wants to make - keep pretending you're the boss too at this point!  Stay focused on the tasks and business processes.  Give your input about changes to make.    For example, boss says Employee always seems to be away from the desk.  Boss's solution, chain Employee to the desk.  Your solution, you happen to know that Employee's desk is near the entrance, and when a stranger walks in Employee winds up escorting him all over the building.  So, you propose: hire a receptionist and mark the entrance more clearly.    This way, you can explain the criticisms by offering a solution.  Bosses dig that.|`|Qj7QlmwSaa	Yes|`|e9VWQ4RFaa	It's common. The key is in how you present your side. First, it's important to acknowledge that you heard your boss's criticism. Take notes of what your boss says, and then go over each, paraphrasing what you think you heard so that you have a clear understanding. "I hear you and I think what you're saying is..." Now offer new information that your boss may not know or offer solutions for the future. "My actions may have been interpreted differently than I intended. What I was trying to do was..." And then go from there.     If the list is really "long" as you say, though, polishing up your resume may be your best next step. It's okay for a boss to have some criticisms, but that list should never be "long." If that's the case, that may be a hint to move on.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Part of life is being able to take criticism about something and use it to improve.  It's not always easy because it breaks down our own belief that we don't have problems.

But I notice that Temp jobs are helping the ends meet a little bit. For two weeks, any job that is temp usually pays well for a few months and then they let you go.    The strategy is: Get a temp job. While you have that, stay optimistic and look for other ones. Definitely keep in contact with where you apply and keep your name on their mind. Show persistence.    Another way you can make money is on Elance.com. They have assignments from $50-$500 you can get paid for. Its usually employers who just dont have the time to do the paperwork themselves.    You can also try simple wash and sets, or your mom can do home care for elderly women. $20 here and there goes a long way. Its what I call a "side hustle."

They are transmitted through the Federal Reserve Automated Clearinghouse system and then flow to the member banks.

Much of it was IRS refund traffic.    Once it hits the bank it's up to the bank as to when it will post to your account.  Some post in real time and would post to the account sometime on Friday.

ae431f10c17ce7cc6ba393acd8b372d1aa	An interesting and lengthy question that possibly deserves an equally lengthy answer.    I have worked for various companies.  Everything from a family owned business that employed 3 family members, to a large Wall Street firm that employed roughly 40,000 people.    The issue that we have here is that in trying to regulate businesses, it's as if the government is trying to please everyone...and in doing so, they please no one.  Like the saying goes, "You can't just be a little bit pregnant".    As a shareholder in a wide range of publicly traded companies, I have had a few of my common stocks go to zero, while the companies filed for bankruptcy (Lehman Bros. and WaMu are just 2 of them).  Even though it cost me money personally, I am thinking that the best way to go about things is to simply allow the grossly mismanged businesses to fail completely.  That is what capitalism is all about; survival of the fittest.  The ones that made the biggest mistakes and have taken the biggest falls, are also the ones that were perhaps the greediest.    What bugs me MORE is that fact that the executives of these failed companies have now come come to the US government for money to keep their businesses solvent.  And, while holding their hats in their hands and asking for a taxpayer funded bailout, they also have their friends in the backrooms writing bonus checks to themselves.    As another saying goes, "You make your bed, you have to sleep in it".  These folks made their beds.  Whether it be in the form of sub-prime lending, or using derivatives to squeeze more profits from their balance sheets, or manufacturing vehicles that American consumers can not afford because of the high cost of fuels, the executives were providing the leaderhip that led to this mess and at the very least, they should suffer the consequence of unemployment themselves.    Here's a novel idea.  Before these HUG banking conglomorants became what they were, who was servicing those home mortgages in the past?  The answer?  Local banks!  It used to be that when someone in Middletown USA wanted to buy a home, they applied for a mortage with the Middletown USA banks.  The loan officer would review the application, look at their own banking records, verify employment with a simple local phone call, and possibly even drive to the property to inspect it to make sure that the home was worth what the buyer was paying (ensuring adequate collateral for the bank).  Compare and contrast this rather old fashioned idea to what has been going on for that past 20 years!  The mortgage lender is 2,000 miles away and has absolutely no idea who they are dealing with.  For all they know, the property is a spruced-up double-wide trailer that they are lending $400,000 against.  So, my question is...what's wrong with going back to basics and allowing these motgage banking giants to fail?  There will be a void that would quickly be filled by...small town banks.    I could go on and on here.  But I wish to make one more point.  It's time that shareholders take back ownership of the companies.  The boards of directors are often bloated with upwards of 15 people that do absolutely nothing in the way of corporate oversight on behalf of the real owners, the shareholders.  Often times, these people serve on multiple boards of directors and are paid six figure salaries PLUS benefits from each company.  For what?  To rubber stamp their approval on everything that the CEOs say?  It's time for a change...and the change needs to happen on the ownership level.

W9zRaPp9aa	You are probably not going to find too many book wholesalers in Conway Arkansas or in Arkansas at all for that matter. Publishers generally work as their own wholesalers. You can buy direst from the Publishers if buying with some volume (not necessarily 100's of books) with a 40% - 60% discount.     If you know a publisher just contact them about buying wholesale from them. I have done this in the past buying as few as 15 - 20 books, 4 or 5 of each title.

Ch9TedMcaa	When their investment increases in value from "short-selling."|`|7cnOO9PNaa	Hedge funds use a variety of investment strategies, style and instruments.  Some managers may use hedging, but it does not imply that all hedge fund managers use hedging.    More generally, investment managers use hedging to control their exposure some risk factors, while seeking leveraged exposure to other risk factors.  They don't seek to eliminate risk completely.|`|jaQnxUZ6aa	Hedge funds started out as funds holding hedged positions, but they are no longer that. Now they use all kinds of strategies and most aren't even dealing in derivatives or short selling.    Profit comes from the fund's investing strategies, which you can read about in many books. But it takes lots of experience to actually develop a fund that consistently makes money. Many funds describe their strategies in general terms to maintain their proprietary status.

It's risky, and unlike the average job, there are no guarantees.  It's difficult to "time the market" if not impossible.  The best investment method is to target large, stable, undervalued companies in this particular market.  It might be best to wait a few more months to see if we have truly hit rock bottom or if the markets will dive even lower.  Remember profit comes from buying low and selling high (or from dividends).  So it's prolly best to keep you money in a savings account or in a 3 mo.

If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy then we may hold your funds up to 180 Days, fine you up to $2,500.00 USD for each such violation and take legal action against you to recover additional losses we incur. You acknowledge and agree that a fine up to $2,500.00 USD is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's damages, considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages may be impractical or extremely difficult. PayPal may deduct such fines directly from any existing Balance in the offending Account, or any other PayPal Account you control.      14.2 Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000.00 USD, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If a party elects arbitration, that party will initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.    We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or the Services (such as limiting access to any of your Payment Sources, and your ability to send money, make withdrawals, or remove financial Information);   We may contact buyers who have purchased goods or services from you, contact your bank or credit card issuer, and warn other Users, law enforcement, or impacted third parties of your actions;   We may update inaccurate Information you provided us;   We may refuse to provide our Services to you in the future;   We may hold your funds for up to 180 Days if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability; and   We may take legal action against you.     The real issues in all of that are that you agreed to these terms.  All disputs are handled by arbitration without personal appearence.  Then if they find you at fault and they will it is entered in court and your wages may be garnished - not for the 200 but for the 2500 dollar fine and their legal costs. Further they state they will contact your other creditors.  This is blatent use of blackmail but you agreed to it.  Most credit cards hold the view it you are not in the good graces of any other creditor then they can raise your rate to the default penalty rate usualy 30% or higher.|`|jZqgcZmraa	trust me, if you owe someone 12 cents, they will send your account to collections and it will ruin your credit|`|AA10289917	I think they will let you know when it happens.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|3EBKrVrDaa	Mow lawns, rake yards, shovel snow, etc..

hxG4zLX5aa	well obama's gonna hook you up with a $15k tax credit so that's cool, but it all depends on your objectives.  you "benefit" from it if you have a place to live, or you can benefit if you can rent it out, or you can benefit if you're getting tax deductions.  so your definition of benefit is very important.  if this is going to be your primary home for 10+ years, then you could do fine right now.  if you're looking to see it appreciate in the next 5 years, it ain't gonna happen.  if you're looking for an investment where you can earn monthly income, then it all depends on the rental market.    assuming that you're looking for your first home and you plan on staying there for a while, prices WILL continue to drop- guaranteed- at least for the next 2 years.  put 20% down and do a 15 year conventional loan.  anything longer than that or anything less down and you're paying too much.  hope this helps.

So I got notice of tax sale and had to scramble to get the money from the title co. myself and pay the rest myself until I could sort out escrow with my lender (another long story).    If I had somehow lost that 2nd lot to tax sale, my home encroaches on it by 1.5' and my fence surrounds the back yard of both lots.    I imagine anything completely on your property is yours and you probably need an attorney to figure out what to do about encroachments.

Its so easy and refunds comes in 8 days,direct deposit.|`|jxIAHrHsaa	On their site, they will let you "pre-file" and give you all payment options and costs. Sometimes it depends on the refund amount.|`|e0WziJjCaa	regardless of the refund amount its 271.00|`|bDoJuBEkaa	Don't do your taxes at H&R Block. They claimed that my return was not eligible for the child tax credit because it was married filing separately. Well after contacting the IRS, calling another tax preparation service and doing turbo tax I found out the return was eligible for the child tax credit (this is not earned income credit, but the normal child tax credit). When I called H&R block to inform them they told me I could just go to the IRS pick up the forms and file them myself if I did not agree with them. This was the difference between OWING almost $700 and GETTING a $1300 refund. Had I found this out later H&R block would have only refunded me the tax prep fee of about $300. H&R block basically wanted a married filing jointly fee so they could receive a MORE MONEY for preparation and a HIGHER COMMISSION on a rapid refund. DO your taxes by turbo tax and wait the 7 extra days it takes to get your actually refund deposited into your acct. Then you actually get the refund your due and not have to pay someone over a $100 to borrow money for 7 days which is enormous interest rate when you think of it in those terms!|`|2u63Fc5vaa	Their "Rapid Refunds" are actually refund anticipation loans. They're expensive and if your tax refund gets delayed (as they have been recently) you may be responsible for the balance. They're not worth what you spend on them and H&R is a terrible way to get your taxes done anyway.

dffe0637ce0d1fb4a653af444962ca54aa	If I understand you correctly, you're having trouble creating a style for your signature that looks the same every time you write it?    Don't worry, this is normal.  You're at the age where most people are just starting to sign their name on a regular basis.  The best thing to do is just to practice.  Get a sheet of notepaper and sign your name on it over and over.  Don't even think about what it looks like, just write it quickly.      At first, your signatures will look different.  After you've filled several pages of notepaper with your signature, they will start to look the same.  You'll eventually end up with your unique signature, you'll get used to writing it quickly and it will look the same (or mostly the same) each time.  Good luck!|`|7VnmPYuXaa	Just scribble your signature on the back and then smear it a little bit.  Then scribble your signature when you sign the receipts at the store. I would say that on 1 out of 10 retail clerks even ask for your card to verify your signature and then probably 50% of them actually try to compare the signature that you have on your card to the receipt you just signed.      Always put at least one "t" and one "i" in your signature and it will stand out to the small percentage that are trying to verify it.      If you sign it sloppy and fast with a "t" and a "i" somewhere in the signature I would be willing to bet a lot of money (if I had some) that you would never have any problems.|`|4hJJkfmpaa	just have a squiggel or whatever you can do|`|u1RpKfCfaa	If you are truly underage, take advantage of it.

YJtCee2Uaa	You MAY ASK but not necessarily legally charge if there was no written signed agreement regarding the circumstances if the offer were to fall through.    They are offering to compensate you some of your lost, but most of the time, potential employers are not obligated to repay back your choice to risk for the possibilities.  It is simply the value of risk you accept to possibly improve your job choice.  It is not their responsibility to ensure YOU ARE QUALIFIABLE for the job you seek.    Again, unless there is a specific contract agreement outlining the terms of seeking the job and the contingency of compensation for said job no longer being available to you, then there is no actual legal avenue for you to seek and you will have to accept whatever "gracious" offer coming your way    Good luck and sorry it didn't work out    EDIT ADD    Not necessarily.  Based on what you wrote me.  It is simply you agreeing to the terms of the job duties and the requirements to get the job.    Does the agreement cite anything about the job becoming unavailable and its terms?
AA11284831	As a W-2 employee an LLC would be utterly useless to you.    And IMHO, the vast majority of LLCs were created by people who had no clue what they were doing and were snookered in by dishonest shysters who were lining their pockets with legal fees with no consideration for the clients' best interests.  LLCs provide limited protection for their owners, that is easily pierced in a closely-held company.  And while taxation at the Federal level is simple due to their disregarded entity status, at the State level they are a mish-mosh of confusing and conflicting filing requirements, minimum franchise fees and other reporting requirements that do little for the business owner aside from drive up compliance costs unnecessarily.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	As the previous poster stated, you cannot convert employment income from a W2 to self-employed income.

RNqRnG86aa	You need to be much more specific because water damage may be covered in certain circumstances but flood damage is not covered in any circumstance.     In the USA no homeowners policy will cover damage due to a flood. Flood damage is specifically excluded. Coverage for flood would have to be purchased through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Try your state insurance commissioner first.  Your "case" depends on the source of the flooding.  Homeowner's insurance does not cover flood damage due to natural events.  You need federal flood insurance for that.  If the "flood" was due to a plumbing problem, homeowner's insurance should cover it.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Contact your local bar association for a referral to attorneys who specialize in insurance coverage disputes.    But, I'm curious as to why you believe you have a valid case.  Insurance is a standard contract.  Is the type of loss explicitly excluded from your policy?|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Well, you need a civil lawyer.     If the water was from OUTSIDE the house, coming in, that's FLOOD.   NO homeowners policy covers flood.      If your house was vacant or unoccupied, and the water came from a burst pipe inside the house because you shut the heat off, THAT is ALSO specifically excluded.     I have no idea what you think your case is, but the denial from the insurance company should have the reason clearly spelled out in it - AND, it should reference the policy section.   Having an excuse WHY your house was vacant or unoccupied, is NOT a case.    But any civil attorney should be able to give you a one hour free consult, and tell you if you REALLY have a case.  Here's a good hint - if they aren't willing to take it on a no-win/no-fee basis, you do NOT have a good case.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	A pipe burst is not a flood.     Why did they deny your claim.   You might want to post that info to get more help.    Call the Department of Insurance in your state.

They will investigate and tell you if your right or wrong.|`|ZKgqQfwRaa	Just an FYI, if you can afford the repairs do them yourself.  A water damage claim will put a mark on your record for a long time to come.  Not only will some carriers refuse to carry your policy, but the current carrier you're with will surely increase your rates and you'll end up paying more in increased rates over time than the repairs were.    My experience is home insurance should be carried with a very high deductible and used in major situations you can't otherwise afford.  Lesser claims will just increase your rate (or rather keep it from decreasing) and cost you more in the long run.  ESPECIALLY water damage claims.

In addition to being able to claim your child as a qualifying child (under 19) or qualifying relative (over 19) and receiving those tax benefits, you can also claim:        Any child/dependent care expenses you paid for care of your child so you and a spouse can work or hunt for work.  This usually ends when a child turns 12, but will continue indefinitely if your child is permanently disabled.  You can claim up to $3,000 a year (depending on you income).|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Legally blind, larger standard deduction for him.

But if they are disabled you are able to claim them as a qualifying child instead of a qualifying relative.  This enables you to receive the same benefits a child would allow you, such as earned income credit.      If they are younger than 19 you receive no extra benefits from claiming a child who is disabled.

Get a pocket size note book and in the morning start recording every thing you purchase, even if it's a package of gum. Total each day. Do this for at least a month. Then you can see where your money goes and what you are willing to give up. If you require a Starbucks latte every day then forget it. You have to be willing to give up things you don't need. At the same time , you will be shocked at how much money is frittered away without realizing it's going.Now, create a budget. You have x   of dollars coming in each month, so your budget will reflect how it is disbursed. The key element in any budget is to pay yourself first. The recommended amount is 10%. Even if that only amounts to $5.00 a month, do it. At the end of a year you will have $60.00 you didn't have before. Keep doing the record keeping.

You can also visit your local citizens advice bureau and they can put you in touch with a legal advisor in your area who will guide you through this. This service is usually free of charge.
IKakoOfyaa	Yeah, a lot of problems had to do with people putting in the wrong amounts for the stimulus checks or trying to claim a credit where none was due, but many returns were kicked out as having "errors" when no credit was claimed at all...in other words, returns that were done correctly were flagged as having errors if nothing was entered on the rebate recovery line item.  The IRS is just getting around to telling people that, but it's not doing a thing as far as turn around time for refunds.    The refund cycle chart should be disregarded.  Add two weeks to the original date it shows and by then, you should have your money, but no guarantees.    And as far as seeing a tax professional being able to miraculously solve the IRS's computer problems, that's bogus.  There are complaints all over the web from people who had their taxes prepared by CPAs running into the same problems.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Lots of people are getting burned by that dratted stimulus check.

BSs2Qombaa	The average rate of return of any LIC policy is 5-6%. They are not going to give you anything from their pocket. Even to give you insurance, they deduct mortality charge. If someone from a group of random 1000 die & nominee get the insured amount, it is because of the fact that other 999 survived during the same period & they lost their mortality charge.     Even if they promise a lifetime policy like Jeevan anand, The money is already deducted from your accumulated amount & rest is given to you on maturity. There are 2 calculations done, one to verify that company gets profit in any situation & other for showing to customer that this product will give you sooooooooo much return.|`|Pha5dVqdaa	LIC's Jeevan Anand is one of the best Plan to opt for.

YnHYhCnlaa	Anyone who answers the phone should simply say that your sister is not there and that they should find another way to contact her. You should advise your sister to give them different contact information, like her mobile phone and what hours they can call her. if they break this agreement you sue them. A good way for you to answer the call is to ask the person if they mind the conversation being recorded in which if they respond yes, you ask them to state their full name and their alleged case, and the reason for the phone call. If they know they are being recorded, they will usually back off because if they say one thing wrong they can get sued and they will lose, this pressure on them makes them nervous, instead of you being the nervous one. Of course. Also seek advice at a citizens advice centre, they help people who are having difficulty with debt.    Good luck|`|O48bGszmaa	dont answer the phone if you do tell them you get them for harrasment if they call again it might work but there is really nothing they can do bout you not paying but it will mess up your credit if you not worry bout credit then dont worry bout it|`|m8WgexFUaa	Debt collectors are inexperienced if they try to collect through family members. If your family members are confronted by the debt collect with the matter of someone else's debt, I would recommend advising them to say: "That's not my responsibility, talk to them."   As far as what your sister should do about debt collectors - Pay it.    But If she can't pay a debt,,,,    Say: "Sorry, I just can't afford anything, not even 5 bucks, I'm really strapped for cash. And even if I COULD pay 5 it would probably just go towards interest so I had better just wait until I can pay more" And just repeat it until they stop asking. And if they don't stop asking just hang up the phone.    And to lighten the mood of the intimidating debt collectors, have fun with it- just say: "kshskhskhsh SORRY, skhskhkshskh CAN'T HEAR skhskhskhskhsks YOU..... SKSHKSHKS GOING THOUGHT A skhskhskhskhskhs TUNNEL!" ~click~    Furthermore, Debt collectors are governed by the FTC with certain laws and can be punished if they violate them and it will result in compensation to the debtor if violated. They can't call before or after certain times of day and they can't call more than a certain amount of times.    Go to http://www.ftc.gov for more information!    God bless!
eyaymXDFaa	Cheek it http://www.epersonalinjury.ca
WzKrZoHQaa	Absolutely.  You should have maybe 3 CV's and you "tailor" each one accordingly.  So if you are applying for a Customer Service position then you highlight and draw upon these skills which will be of more interest than if you drove a JCB for example - as impressive as it sounds this bit is not what you need to bring to the front.  Mention the JCB later !      The reception positon gave opportunity for you to mix with a cross section of people from all walks of life - some needing urgent mediacl attention so you had to be able to "prioritise" as well as remain calm under pressure as when ppl are in pain they are not always pleasant but you remained professional throughout.  Good pleasant telephone manner with clear diction (ppl can understand you at other end)  Dr surgeries often run over and so a flexible approach was required - it was never a strict 9-5 - this demonstrates yr flexibility.    If you were say happy to step in say if someone was ill then point this out.  Willing to work as part of a team and can also work on own initiative too.    Good luck with your application.    Always remember even if you DO have CV and a company asks you to complete their application for DO - don't just staple yr Cv to the application form - it will get rejected without as much as a look.  If you cannot be bothered to do a first thing they ask of you then they won't consider you.   Other thing is - on their own application form they can go straight to certain fields to find info whihc saves companies time in the process.  If they need say at least 4 GCSE's and 1/3 have only got 3 then of couse they won't bother reading the rest of the application form - again because they specifically stated needed 4 GCSE's.  They needed this for a reason.  It saves them time.  So fill in the form YES and attach yr CV to the back for futher ref.   Always get name correct of person you are sending it to.  Nothing annoys an employer more than you getting their name wrong - it will be binned.    DO ask the referee's in advance if you can use their name as a means of contact too.   Many when called or contacted haved not even been asked if they WILL provide a ref and get a bit upset when they are caught on back foot and may say wrong thing.  Prepare them.    Also spend half hour finding out about the company they will ask you what you know about them and not everyone does research before an interview.  Show them you are committed and have done yr homework.     Hope this helps and jolly good luck|`|Jet2E58aaa	All work experience is relevant in some way so put it all down.

("Non-Transferable" means you CANNOT change the name on the ticket...this is to prevent people stealing each other's tickets...the only provision is...if you catch the "name problem" on the ticket within 24 hours of purchase, they will cut you some slack.  But you can (by and large) NEVER change the name on an airline ticket.  If you buy a "refundable ticket," and need to change the name, you would simply get a refund on the ticket, and purchase a new one for the new passenger at the going rate...this ALSO prevents people from breaking their "advanced purchase requirement" and trying to slyly burn the airline by buying a cheap "advance purchase" ticket, but then changing it to fly earlier than agreed upon.  The airline views your attempts to change your ticket (or name on the ticket) as your way to defraud the airline of it's ticket prices and rules...)    (It has to be the airline's verifiable fault in order for them to waive any fees and add collects (read the contract you signed when you purchased the ticket online (it's in that box that you clicked "I Accept" but you didn't bother reading the fine print)...engine failure, etc...Weather, or your personal problems are NOT the airline's fault, so don't expect them to lose money because your Uncle Ernie (or whoever) got sick or died...that is NOT the airline's fault, so they will not take responsibility for it.  They have no cheap way to verify the truth of people's sob stories, so if the airlines just let fees and such slide every time people had a personal problem, then EVERYBODY would lie about having personal problems, because NOBODY would want to pay the change fees and add collects, which are designed to make the airline a profit...remember...the contract of carriage says that they will get you to your destination in a reasonable amount of time, but safety is their number one concern, so they'd rather inconvenience you by canceling your flight than KILL you in a fiery plane crash...)    1.  Your "outbound" flight is what determines your original contract advance purchase price...(if you buy a 2-week advance purchase ticket, that means you must keep your flight date two weeks in advance of your original purchase AND any changes you make to that date...if you change your outbound flight 3 days before departure to get there early, you just broke your advance purchase price contract, so they hit you for the difference, because if you had originally paid for a 1-week advance the price would have been higher, and the airlines are going to get that difference because the original reason they gave you a good price was that you had more of an advance...it's the way they gouge business travelers, because they know business travelers can't buy in advance, and their companies will pay whatever it takes to get the deal closed...    2.  Ideally, the airlines want you to stick to your original flight plan, because it helps them keep track of load factors and statistics, and helps them plan ahead their revenue expectations, so if you change your ticket, expect to get hit with change fees and add collects.  Also, whenever you change your ticket on the phone, you are eating up the sales rep's sales, because they have to take the time to change your ticket when they could be "selling" more tickets, get it?  So the airlines need to make up for that "lost sales income..."    3.  They want you to do everything online, because that way it doesn't eat up their sales time on the phones, and it eliminates the paper trail and costs to the airlines...    4.  If you are not a wealthy person, my recommendation is to plan your life around your trip, NOT the other way around...In other words, if Aunt Edna calls and wants you to postpone your trip, simply don't do it.  Just say NO to life's demands that would cause you to want to change your trip plan.  If Uncle Ernie dies...well...you just might not be able to attend the funeral, because in doing so, the airline is going to charge you almost a thousand dollars in change fees and add collects, not to mention the hotel changes, so...Uncle Ernie is dead...I'm sure he won't know that you didn't attend the funeral, and so you're off the hook...Just tell Aunt Edna that you are very sorry, but due to a much needed vacation in Hawaii, you will be unable to attend...    Stick to your flight plan NO MATTER WHAT!  (and stop complaining...you were supposed to READ that contract you signed when you bought the damn ticket, and stick to its' provisions, or you WILL be charged a lot more money, which defeated your original purpose of getting cheap ticket.  Airline tickets are only cheap if you stick to your original flight plan...)    The airlines DO offer tickets that are free to change, but they are expensive, so you can't say you had no choice in changing your ticket...The airlines are saying "Hey!  We offered you a more expensive ticket that is free to change with no penalties, but since you're not a wealthy person, you opted to buy the cheap tickets that have change fees and add collects, and it's not OUR fault that your Uncle Ernie died, so don't come whining to us...you had the option to buy a "refundable ticket," but since you wanted to save money, you opted to buy the "non-refundable" ticket that has penalities, so you made your bed, now you have to lie in it!"    (I was the complaint manager of a major airline for 14 years, and I NEVER had to change my ticket, because I planned my life around my trip dates, NOT  the other way around, and I simply said NO whenever aunt Edna requested I change my plans...emergency or not...capiche?!?)|`|afkygHMgaa	I am going to star your question as I have a contact that may be able to answer you since he is knowledgeable in this area.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Looks fine to me.|`|QNA6eKsvaa	well well well Mrs XXXXXX you have seemed to commit Robbery this is illegal and so now I shall call 999

85P8But3aa	Is the computer defective? And did the site or where ever you bought it from say that you could get a refund if you were not fully satisfied? You can't just open lawsuits willy-nilly. I doubt a computer company would do what it's doing if it was confident it's legally secure - by which I mean, when you buy a lawyer over a computer and demand money, they'll just point at a piece of paper and say, "Oh, no, you agreed to these terms in this contract."    In answer to your question, however, in the unlikely event that you actually win, they'll probably just replace your computer. And if you pretend you've undergone severe emotional trauma due to the horiffic experience, maybe you can get a few bucks for unneccesary infliction of emotional distress.

RfgaQibWaa	We are looking at an FHA loan as well.  We were told that in order for the FHA to approve the loan, the house needs to appraise at $100,000 minimum.  We looked at the less expensive houses too and they needed to much work to appraise that much.  We were also told that FHA will not approve if there is peeling paint inside or outside the house.    You can also do some research online like we did to see what is needed for an FHA loan.  Good luck, and you may not be ready to afford a house with FHA approval yet.  Your budget sounds too tight.  Don't forget that when buying a foreclosure, the selling bank does not always pay the closing costs.  Also, you will need to pay for the home inspection and home appraisal out of your pocket.    Wait another year or so, when you have more room in your budget for the unexpected costs that come with home ownership.

g8LLIeXKaa	I feel you won't be blocked but what may happen is that you will be at the bottom of the mailing list to get your coupon(s).    Since you already have cable, they know that you will have at least one TV that works. Also, they might limit you to 1 coupon instead. (It's like with AAA membership. If you break down and with kids or far from home, you get a faster response then if you were without kids or near your driveway.)    It would be dishonest to straight out lie but I do not think they have a way to find out or not.    If more than one person lives in your home let the person who does not pay for the cable order it as technically they do not have cable.
M2AiWt85aa	You can start by looking on ezinearticles.com.  Find good, positive articles on there and you can put them on your site IF you post their bio box information.      You can then contact those writers directly and let them know what you are doing.  (If you always allow a business to put a SMALL "plug" in their article, you will get many more submissions.)    Look all over the internet for article submission sites and do the same thing.      Find sites that are about good things, contact the site owner, and tell them of your service.  If they can put their website at the end of the article, it will give them incentive to write a positive piece of news.    Cater to beginning writers.  It can be very hard to get their first "byline", and this is a great way for them to get that.  Are you going to have a print edition at all?  This will be even better and even more incentive for them.    What will make people WANT to write a positive piece of news for your site?  What is in it for them?  How can it help them?  Why is your site important?  Why will people go to your site to read this positive news?    I am not coming down on you - I have even entertained the idea of "positive news".  However, you must think of these things so you can be successful.  You must come up with answers to the questions above.  Unfortunately, people are programmed to see the bad in everything.  You are going to have to find people who are willing to see the GOOD!    Churches might be a great place for this.  Community outreach programs, youth groups, etc.    Good luck.  People need to know there is good going on in this world!

I know, legally, that base is USA territory.  It's going to be hard to place.  It's not going to be worth it, for an insurance company in the USA, to write a policy on a base in another country.  Even the postage, to mail the policy to you, would mean they're writing coverage at a LOSS.  Not to mention the overseas phone calls . . .  Meanwhile, the companies in Spain, won't want to touch liability on what is legally US soil.      Most daycares, even here in the USA, in the home, are UNINSURED.  That's because the COST to insure them starts at $500, and doesn't include medical payments for the kids' injuries, or abuse or molestation in any form.

ZW0JHvdraa	If you want to gain diverse experience in all areas of accounting, the best way to obtain it is to start with an entry level position with a public CPA firm.  In this type of environment you get to work on the books of multiple clients, with all types of businesses.  You will do write-ups, some basic tax work, journal entries, etc.    In the private sector, you can also gain experience, but not as diverse as when working in the public sector of accounting.    So, my suggestion is to start in public accounting, work your way up as you gain experience, and then perhaps think about broadening your horizons.

UeLigNB0aa	Based on the numbers you provided and my estimates for the interest rate (5.0% 30 year fixed) taxes and property insurance you should have no problem qualifying for a purchase price of $250,000.00 using an FHA loan. Just an FYI, you provided your net income which I used but a lender will use your gross.  You will want to get pre-approved before speaking with a realtor. One of the first questions they will ask is are you pre-approved.  I think the important question is what are you comfortable with paying every month. It does not matter what a lender will approve you for if you are not comfortable with the payment.|`|AA11820201	Today you need 20% for down payment of your house.

9k4d7Kytaa	It's life insurance in most places.    Anyway, my experience won't be too helpful since it's based on US rules (Arizona in particular)...but being pregnant does NOT make you uninsurable.  Maybe with some companies, but not as a general rule.  I've written insurance on pregnant women.    Each of the issues you mentioned (depression, heavy alcohol use and asthma) are concerns for the insurance company and depending upon the severity may have a huge impact on your rates.    If you were quoted preferred rates (insurance agents usually like to quote these rates if their client tells them they are in good health) then your rate will most certainly go up.  Each of those three factors you mentioned would normally disqualify you from preferred rates.  Because you have all three, you may be surcharged on your rate, or you may be declined outright for coverage.    If you are surcharged, or declined outright, ask you life insurance agent if you can use the underwriting results from his company to apply with other companies.  If you can, you normally don't have to do any of the medical testing again, the new company will just use the results from the old company.  That's allowed here, but I don't know if it's allowed there.    Good luck and congratulations on your child!|`|kIblsxJQaa	Its different with each Company.  I recently applied for some quotes and the differences were huge (as much as 5,000.00)!!    BTW its life Assurance not Insurance.    Sorry to be pedantic BUT;  insurance is when you insure yourself against something happening  we are all going to die at some point so you cannot, no matter where you are, insure yourself from death.  You take out life assurance and the term of the policy assures that you dont die before a certain age.|`|y2ZukikXaa	In the US you wouldn't be insurable...not while you're pregnant.    g' day.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Well, you posted to the USA board.

dCbIHBpGaa	You will need to file dormant accounts with Companies House. These are proper statutory accounts of the business but in an abbreviated form due to the lack of information to display. The accounts will still need to show directors, registered address of the company, company number etc etc and should include a Balance Sheet even if the only entry is for the share capital of the business. If you are preparing the dormant accounts for a 12 month period from the date of incorporation, then these will be due at Companies House ten months after the year end date so there is plenty of time to file them yet. If you are going to prepare your first accounts for a period other than 12 months check the rules on Companies House website here as they are slightly different... http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/g...    An accountant will typically charge about 150 - 200 to prepare and file dormant accounts on behalf of the company.|`|e49bc7cb6c53df85c09de682b62a95eeaa	Go to the companies House website at the link below.  Click on Search Company Information and enter your details.  When you get to your company's page it will tell you the date the accounts have to be made up to (the Accounting Reference Date) and the date they are due.      You might like to note the ten months to file is being reduced to only nine.  This applies to all accounts which start on or after 1st April 2008.    If the company has been completely dormant (with no entries through the bank account) then you can download a form DCA which is very simple to complete.

qgr6Q4qbaa	Hiya    You don't deduct the 20% from the gross figure.  Deduct the cost of materials first, then calculate the 20% tax on the rest.    When you prepare your invoice you don't list payments you have made to your sub-contractors.    This is taken from the HMRC website  'Subsistence and travelling expenses count as pay, so they'll be liable for deductions too. But VAT, the cost of materials and certain other costs like plant hire don't count as pay, so the contractor will exclude them when they work out how much to deduct.' http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/advice-sub-pa...

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Is he being asked to work from the other branch PERMANENTLY?  Because if so, this is AGAINST what his contract says.  His contract says that he may need to work in other branches as the need may arise - not permanently.  So, if they did want to move him to another location permanently, they would have to give him 30 days notice of this in writing as this is a change to the conditions of his contract - not just tell him to go on Monday.    So, if they gave him notice of the change and he didn't want to accept it, then he is redundant.  However, redundancy only applies if the distance that the employer is now making him travel is "unreasonable".  There is no definition of "unreasonable" - it depends on people's own personal circumstances.  You can read more about it at the link below.    However, if the move is not supposed to be permanent, then this obviously doesn't apply as his contract states that he can work from other branches on occassion.    You mention discrimination.  This is in NO WAY discrimination.  What would be discrimination is if the Managers deliberately picked someone else to go because your husband has a pregnant wife.  Employers are required to treat all employees the same regardless of their individual circumstances.    One thing that you don't seem to take into account is whether your husband's employer - either since he has been working there or when he was applying to work there - has ever asked if he has his own transport.  Usually, this is something that most employers ask as part of the application process, to make sure that you can get to where they want you, and so that you're not relying on public transport.  If they had asked, and he has ever answered yes, then they do have a right to expect him to have a car for his use.  The fact that the family only has one car and you need it doesn't come into the equation.    Basically, legislation is somewhat sympathetic towards parents and to expectant mothers, but usually not to expectant fathers.  So I would be surprised if you really get anywhere with this.|`|8xMhLMoRaa	*Technically* they are within their right to do this since it is in your husband's contract that he can be transferred to other locations. But I think you are right, it does sound malicious. Since the managers seems totally unwilling to negotiate with your husband, I think it is probable that they are trying to get rid of him, although if he has done nothing wrong, they are walking a fine line, very fine line really. I know you said you have had trouble getting help from citizen's advice, but you must keep trying because they can make phonecalls on your behalf and they know exactly how to handle this kind of thing.    Please bare in mind that if they make it impossible for your husband to reasonably stay in his job, if he resigns, he still may have a case for constructive dismissal which legally is almost the same as being outright fired. Tell him to keep records (if possible written records from his managers as well, specifically that he has raised concerns with them about this new move) of anything that happens now because if he pursues this route, this will be important as proof.    I don't really feel that it is reasonable for the managers to make comments about your pregnancy or to suggest things about your own transport and perhaps I'm wrong, but maybe they are saying that stuff to try to push your husband into reacting to it. They sound like really scummy people to be honest, and your husband would be better off not working for such awful people, but don't let him quit without good reason. At this time especially, it may be difficult for him to find something else, and with a baby on the way, you definitely don't want to find him out of work.    Best of luck with this situation, and all good wishes for the rest of your pregnancy.|`|tvF86mRDaa	That's so terrible! Sounds like they could be trying to get rid of him, especially with how things are at the moment with the recession.  Go to the citizens advice bureau, they will be able to give legal advice I would think and would be able to tell you your rights. Do that asap.  I would go down the road of discrimination if they did make noises about firing him, as its not his fault he cant travel! Maybe suggest they provide some sort of solution to that, such as a company car/van? Paying for taxi's maybe?  I really feel for you and think you need to get some advice on your rights asap before this man makes life even more difficult for your husband.  Good luck. x|`|lPzcDxCsaa	advice him to engage in the work at home jobs and home business opportunities on the internet.And when he starts making progress he will fire his Boss.      But to be honest, a lot of work at home jobs are scams and schemes, so you have to be very careful when choosing any business opportunity. However, there are also many legitimate work at home jobs as well as home based business opportunities on the internet that can help you make a lot of money online fast.      There are some important factors to look for when searching for a legitimate work at home job or home based business opportunities as follows:     Must have very good products or services to promote   Must be in good standing with Business Regulation Agencies   Must send paychecks out at least once per month (on time)   Must have been successfully in business for at least three years or above  Must have a great support, training and leadership|`|LgKYrup2aa	Tricky. Is he in a trade union? In which case - they will be able to help him.    If not Citizens Advice Bureau is your next choice.    To clarify the issue  -  it seems that you are saying your husband will either work at his normal place of work or accept redundancy but will not work at the other branch.    However, you also say that his contract says he can be moved  to another branch "as needs arise."     Well 'needs have arisen' and they've exercised their right under the terms of the contract.    I don't think he has a lot of choice but to accept the change. They could argue that he has been fortunate until now not to have been moved around previously.    How much longer before you go on maternity leave? Might be the better option for you to get taxis for your last few weeks at work  -  or can you get a lift from someone else? Or the bus.    I think they are within their rights. It might not seem fair to you.    There is a distance limit on how far an employer can send someone to work. I don't remember it. Try Googling for it. You might find under employment legisaltion. Also Try ACAS - but time is against you.    My view (as a manager of large workforces for over 30 years) is that employer is within his rights - based on what you have said about the contract of employment.|`|156P5bWqaa	Personally I believe that letters are excellent, providing they are presented using excellent punctuation and spelling (always use a spoil chequer!).

C4QKsi88aa	I am a financial advisor.  There are thousands of financial advisors out there who can do the same thing when it comes to Estate Planning.  They can us the same products, tools, rules, etc.  What it comes down to is if you trust this person.  I always tell clients, " you can do everything exactly the same across the street with Morgan Stanley, the question is if you feel comfortable with the person".  I always tell clients that I don't sell anything, I educate.  So if I were you I would find someone who can educate you and not sell products...    Also remember although you can try to learn these things, you there is no way to keep up with new tax laws, trading rules, insurance products, mutual funds, re-balancing, split ticket, A and B trusts, By sell agreements, cds vs annuties, etc.....  Do you have time to figure all this out?  Do you ask your Doctor to build your house or your Accountant to do brain surgery..probably not.    So get someone qualified, trustworthy, and speaks in simple terms..    Interview your advisors before you choose!!!    For some free advice, there are two parts to Estate Planning...    Accumulation Phase (which people spend 95% of their time)  -Savings, Checking, Stocks, Mutual Funds, Annuities, Business, Real Estate, Bonds, etc....    Distribution Phase (which includes preservation of assets, keeping money from Uncle Sam)  - Living Trusts  -Life Insurance  -Registration/Titling of your Businesses   -Tax planning    Now you can attack these areas like, asset allocation or probate, or life insurance within these two realms.

Daq9gituaa	The 2009 stimulus bill has not been nor is it anywhere near being finalized. At the rate the stimulus bill is proceeding, it will be sometime before the proposal becomes effective. Mr. Obama had hoped the program would be a done deal by mid February with an effective date around 01JUL09. The longer it takes for the stimulus bill to be finalized and placed into effect will delay the date that it can be applied by taxpayers. If you wait to file your taxes until the program becomes effective, then you could may face a penalty for late filing. Even though a Home Buyers Credit is being discussed, the question remains if it will still be a part of the stimulus bill and will it be retroactive to year 2008?

Def join one of the forces, if you go get yourself down to the careers office you will start your "adventure". you will have to do lots of training and test before you go, so this will keep you very busy! Get yourself down there now and you could be in within 3 months!!    However, depending on the job ou choose it could take up to 18 months. But if you get going now you will have something to look forward to and something to focus on!!    Go for it.    EDIT*** You only need to commit for four years actually. But you do have a six month period when you first join to say that you dont like it, and you can leave, no questions asked, so dont think that if you go you are stuck.

Royal Air Force (pls don't call them the RAF they will correct you every time you say it - even in the career shops) this is a great career choice and there are many areas for you to go into.  Go to the websites - you will need interview and take an aptitude test - psychosymetrical testing - you can get books on this to help - speed is the key as you get approx 4 mins to complete 20 Q's and that is just one page.  They do tell you there and then if you have passed though but if not you cannot reapply for at least 6 months PLUS you ONLY get 2 attempts - a third one of you are very very lucky  and missed it by say couple of points.    Cruise ships are a good "get away" but again you are assessed by every passenger and need to get 6 every time - if you are given less than 3 for 3 times in a row they will put you off at next port and you have to make own way home - no messing.  They not interested if yr granny just died - off you go so unless you are dedicated to keeping a high standard where nothing is too much trouble attitude don't apply.  http://www.cruiseshipjob.com/    Depending where you are but try Research houses - not medical research but they take on post grads in a number of roles  try these   http://www.mintel.com   for UK     http://www.djsresearch.com/   for Uk again     Good luck you are lucky to have a safety net with parents many don't have     Work out some goals but this can only be done by starting from the end and working back to today.  Work out what it is you finally want to end up with on yr last breath, house, family, pension, career, environment, globally etc and put systems in place - you have to work backwards otherwise it won't work - it may be that you today you HAVE to make a call to start something that won't bear fruit until 6 months time - like Royal Air Force............|`|5AwLW1buaa	You sound like you should really do a year out abroad.

The year out lets you focus a bit more on what you want to do long term as well. No disadvantages!    ***EDIT The only problem with the RAF is that you will need to commit for at least 5 years.

RzX1c1nxaa	brokers charge only the commission on the value of sale.    you have come to know the property only through the broker. you meet the seller directly through the broker. negotiate your price directly. if the deal is through, you can pay the brokerage.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You can't.  The seller has signed a listing agreement with the Realtor and even if you were to go direct to the seller, the Realtor still gets his commission.  The seller pays the commission and not the buyer.  Many buyers mistakenly think a home is priced at $X, then the commission is added.  Not true.  The market price includes the commisson.  Retain a Realtor that represents buyer.  A buyer's agent is still paid by the seller through the listing agent.  Plus a buyer's agent will provide you with a CMA - competative market analysis which will show you the price of comparable homes.    realtor.sailor|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Sorry, but brokers don't make "the rate high."    If you want to avoid brokers, then buy directly from the owner. Look for FSBOs (for sale by owner). However, that's no guarantee that the price will be any less. In fact, many FSBOs choose that route because they want (or need) to get as much as possible, and many tend to overprice their properties.    Brokers actually help keep prices down, in many cases. That's because they tell the seller what their property is actually worth in today's market, not what the seller would like it to be, and not what it might have been worth a couple of years ago.    Even if you do decide to buy directly from a seller, have some plan in place to determine the true value of the property so that you aren't overpaying.|`|fCF02V87aa	I disagree that Brokers are making rates high. In fact most Brokers-have dramatically cut their commissions due to the Housing crunch. They are trying to make a living and provide many valuable services to make buying and selling easier. It is not only unethical to try to circumvent a Broker that is holding a listing---it would be a breach of the sellers contract in most cases. Your only options are buying from owners that aren't using Brokers

SN5dYkafaa	The IRS makes clear in Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Higher Education, that amounts transferred from a Coverdell account to a "qualified tuition program" (IRS lingo for a 529 plan) are viewed as qualified education expenses and are therefore tax free -- as long as the amount of the withdrawal is not more than the designated beneficiary's qualified education expenses.    There are several reasons a college saver may want to take this course of action. For example, to consolidate college assets into a single account with a more generous contribution limit. Whereas Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (CESA), formerly Education IRAs, limit contributions to just $2,000 per beneficiary per year, 529 plans typically allow much higher lifetime contribution limits -- in excess of $200,000 per beneficiary in many states. And unlike Coverdells, 529 plans generally do not impose income limits that restrict the ability of higher-income taxpayers to contribute.    As you take other variables into account, keep in mind that Coverdells and 529 plans are still relatively new, so the legal and procedural precedents for specific strategies may not be well established yet. For example, there is the question of the ownership and control of any money that is transferred from a Coverdell to a 529 plan. By declaring in Publication 970 that "the designated beneficiary of a Coverdell can take withdrawals at any time," the IRS effectively states that the funds in a Coverdell are owned by the beneficiary. If those assets were moved to a 529 plan owned by a parent, however, it could be construed as a transfer of ownership from the beneficiary to the parent. In theory, at least, that could raise legal issues down the road if the parent eventually uses the money for personal reasons or changes the beneficiary of the 529 plan.    It's also important to remember that Coverdells can be used to pay for primary or secondary school costs, whereas 529 plans are limited to college expenses. Consequently, you might want to contribute to a Coverdell and a 529 plan if you need to pay for a primary or secondary education in addition to college.     Disclaimer.

QwcFQ4GRaa	A homebuyers tax credit is intended to stimulate, or rather, resuscitate the flailing housing industry. Currently appearing on the instructions to IRS Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, are instructions on how to claim a tax credit of $7,500 related to the purchase of a homebuyers first home. This may be replaced by a $15,000 tax credit if the 2009 economic stimulus package ultimately passes.    Individual Income Tax Returns: $7,500 First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit Details  According to the instructions to Form 1040, taxpayers must meet the following requirements to claim the credit:    1. Bought a main home in the U.S. after April 8, 2008  2. Did not own any other main home within 3 years of this purchase  3. Made less than $95,000 (for individuals) or $170,000 ( for married couples) in 2008  Currently, the taxpayer claims $7,500 on the tax return, but is required to pay back that amount over a 15-year period.    $15,000 Homebuyers Tax Credit May Replace Existing 15-Year Interest-Free $7,500 Loan  As part of the negotiations behind the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the 2009 economic stimulus package, a $15,000 non-repayable tax credit has been slated to replace the original $7,500 tax break if the plan is ultimately passed.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	It doesn't - yet.  It's just a proposal, not a fact.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	From what little has been released - it will be for new buyers and current home owners, and it will be a credit vs. a loan.    10% of the price or a max of $15K.|`|5Gxll9Hkaa	This hasn't been enacted into law yet, so nobody knows.  It has only been proposed so far, and is being discussed as a possibility by lawmakers.    You need to wait until the law is passed (if, in fact, it is passed) and then see what the law says.    Hard to wait - I know!|`|nELcZqQnaa	Not to sound ignorant, but is that a deduction from the total amount of taxes due or is it a deduction from the amount of income you would pay taxes on ?|`|xJi3ixgGaa	The new plan is not just for first time home buyers but it does have to be your primary residence. I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.  Hope this helps.

AHCelSY1aa	Oh Lord.  I hate to hear about these types of cases why I left this particular field.  Unfortunately you cannot do that.  You will literally be jeopardizing your guardianship of your daughter.  What can be done is an emergency hearing can be held due to the circumstances, but without your attorney returning your calls you can attempt to do it yourself.  All court houses have offices where they help individuals fill out this paperwork.  I would call the attorney again and make sure to leave a message it is an absolute emergency and your daughters health and welfare are at stake!  I sincerely wish you the best of luck.  I wish I could be of more help to you.|`|qWytoOMmaa	I've got kids so I'm going to tell you what I would tell a friend.    The advice that you seek is probably not going to come from this group because giving advice of a legal nature like this without full and complete disclosure is risky business - and why you are being told to contact a lawyer.  If the lawyer isn't responding fast enough, find another lawyer.    Also, this is not legal advice - it's just what I would do in a serious situation:  If the safety and health of a child is in question, I would consider contacting the police or sheriff with the facts of the situation.    Also some things to consider:    Depending on the age of your child, Conjunctivitis and rashes occur.  I have kids, it happens.  The question is: did the person who was caring for the child have enough sense to try and solve the problem, or did they neglect the problem?|`|2xO8AxYRaa	Is this a one time occurrence or is it happening every time he gets the child. If its one time anything could of happen. Kids get rashes all the time. I suggest you keep notes and take pictures and you really need to seek out an attorney, because if this is an on going occurrence you really do need the aid of an attorney.

WgT5l14baa	Most contracts recognize that money has time value and if the landlord does not receive the money on time, then you have had use of the money and this is, for all practical purposes, a loan.  Most contracts provide for a rate of interest, or a late charge that is expressed as a percent per month, again, for all practical purposes, interest.    A collector who acquires a contract, acquires all the rights of the landlord, including the right to add late charges/interest.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	No they can't add interest, but they try.    You don't owe $7000 if you did, they would have taken you to small claims court.    A landlord is obligated to try and re-rent the property - and in most places, apartments re-rent within a month. So the worst case is you might be liable for 1 or 2 months rent.    My advice to you is to ignore the collections agency and throw their letters away.  They bought the debt from the apartment complex for $50 and now they're trying to extort money from you using heavy handed and illegal tactics.|`|A8k9NHigaa	Have they sued you and gotten a judgment yet? If they have then they can add interest at the State allowed rate for all judgments. Otherwise, ask for a copy of your lease and read all the fine print, if it does not say they an add interest, then they cannot.
E7IPy6cDaa	do you have the right to claim them? did you all live together? the only one who has the right to claim the children is the person who lived with the children the longest and supported them the longest. did you provide more then half their support?    did they live with you for more then half the year? did their mother live with you too? did she work? is the "boyfriend" even thier father? not enough info...    edit: sorry didnt see your first question... file. if they lived with you get their soc  's from school or from their dr's office someone HAS to have it. you have to have proof they lived with you all year. file and claim them. you have a right to their tax benefits. the irs will go after the boyfriend. he will owe. you will get what is rightfully yours.  good luck with grandkids. they are lucky to have a grandma who stepped up to care for them.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Call the IRS and discuss this.  Your post doesn't have much information in it.    If everybody lived with you, the grandchildren were qualifying child to both you and your daughter and the boyfriend (if these were his kids) and the tie-breaker at the irs is is parent with highest agi first, other parent, then non-parent with highest agi, etc.    If the boyfriend (as father of the children) didn't live with you, then he had to have a signed form 8332 to be legal.  He he filed without the form, especially if he claimed EIC, he wasn't eligible to.    Unfortunately, if your daughter won't share the SS number with you, there isn't much you can do.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Without the SSNs, you cannot claim them.|`|NZuJR79oaa	I don't think there is anything you can do, I had a friend with a similar issue before where both parents wanted to claim the child and the IRS informed my friend that whoever filed first would get it.  Which doesn't seem right.      This is what happens when you help out people who don't care about you.  Learn the lesson that you're daughter is not appreciative of your help and withdrawal it.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	You still have the right to claim them, but you do need their SS 's to do so. You still file your taxes like everyone suggested in the last question, but when the IRS finds out that the boyfriend's refund was wrong, they will come after him and make him pay back the difference.     As far as getting the SS 's that's a personal issue between you and your daughter. I suggest you sit your daughter down and have a good butt-whooping talk with her. Tell her she needs to act like an adult and do what's right instead of protecting her dead-beat boyfriend. Tell her its for the good of her kids. Tell her you may even take legal action against her if she doesn't give you the numbers.    Another option would be to tell her you need the social security numbers for medical purposes. Say the doctors are demanding it.     Also, if  you have legal custody of the kids you should have their social security numbers somewhere. If you don't have legal custody and you're just watching them as a favor so your daughter can date dead-beats, then maybe its time you start a legal custody battle.     Sorry I don't have better advice on this point, but the bottom line is you need to get those SS 's for your taxes.    EDIT: to the folks who answered before me, I realize the question isn't clear, but this person asked another quesiton earlier and they do have the right to claim the grandkids, they lived with them all year while the kid's mom ran around dating a deadbeat and neither the mom nor the deadbeat boyfriend provided any finacial support all year. This person has every legal right to claim the kids even if someone else illegally claimed them first.|`|znr8SBiWaa	If your daughter won't let you have the SS numbers, there's really not much you can do.    You could file a claim of tax fraud against the boyfriend, but it's a long process, and likely to cause many problems between you and your daughter.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	who had custody of the children during year?  who provided more than 50% of their support?  why would be allowed to claim them in the first place?

Energy Sector    Terry Peters    Story Tools  -+ Change font size     Print this story    E-Mail this story  Share This Story  Facebook    Digg    Stumble Upon    More    Story tools presented by    Shares of UTS Energy Corp. (UTS/TSX) are trading well above the $1.30 per share offer price from Total SA, which implies that investors expect a higher bid will emerge.    The obvious company to look to is Petro-Canada, a partner in the stalled Fort Hills oil sands project with both UTS and Teck Cominco Ltd. However, Petro-Canada said it would welcome Total as a partner, saying this would only be beneficial for the project.    Nonetheless, the low valuation of the French oil giant's bid has analysts anticipating plenty of interest in a UTS auction.    In addition to its financial capacity, Total could bring its expertise in heavy oil, refining and marketing, according to Canaccord Adams analyst Terry Peters. He also wouldn't be surprised if Total was interested in buying Teck Cominco's 20% share of Fort Hills.    "Ultimately, with its other oil sands assets, the potential exists for significant strategic alignment of both Total's and Petro-Canada's assets in the oil sands business," Mr. Peters said in a note to clients.    He also feels that Total's bid for UTS highlights some hidden value in Petro-Canada for its 60% stake in Fort Hills.    Canaccord continues to rate Petro-Canada a "buy" with a $38 price target.  ,,
