GWrwYozqaa	In russia in 1861 Alexander II emancipated the sefs , the serfs at that time had to live in a ghetto they were section off and had to live in a certain part of russia just like the jews in nazi germany . The spanish diesease wiped out about 90 percent of the indian population , the spanish wanted to colonize the indians land and convert them to christianity , the spanish used the indians as slaves .
Ys47rcdkaa	Here's my opinion: I didn't like it. At all. Why? You use, and this is something I find myself repeating far too often, cheap rhymes.<br>  Your poem doesn't HAVE to rhyme.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: No, I agree, I was being a bit rude. I tend to get snarky when the rhyme scheme is off.<br>  I like the content, and I think with some polishing it can be much better.<br>  Besides, that's just my personal opinion, and I'm a very harsh, bitter critic. ;)|`|6JD1KKYcaa	it's ok but not superb, rhyme or no rhyme.
NR3YnkVPaa	He seems to be contrasting American western expansion,(wide open prairies, always more room to move on down the road) with "Irish expansion" (ironic intentions) which cannot go outward like america because it is a small island, so it goes downward, into the bogs which are quite deep and have their own treasures to find (like the butter that was over a hundred years old, found to be in a rare state of preservation). Notice the last line: "the wet centre is bottomless", you can't say that about the american expansion west. It ends at the Pacific ocean. But still, its much more pleasant to live in Los Angeles than 50 feet deep in an Irish bog (not to mention the smells).

TIsgCnhkaa	The conflict is known by several names. In British North America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. Because there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and thus it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name remains standard in the United States, although it obscures the fact that American Indians fought on both sides of the conflict. American historians generally use the traditional name or the European title (the Seven Years' War). Other, less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.<br>  <br>  In Europe, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War usually has no special name, and so the entire worldwide conflict is known as the Seven Years' War (or the Guerre de sept ans). The "Seven Years" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the actual fighting in North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Jumonville Glen skirmish in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.<br>  <br>  In Canada, both French- and English-speaking Canadians refer to it as the Seven Years' War[citation needed] (Guerre de Sept Ans) or the War of the Conquest (Guerre de la Conquête), since it is the war in which New France was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire. This war was also known as the Forgotten War.|`|opdtWmzzaa	The English and their Indian allies were fighting the French and their Indian allies. But there were very few tribes which sided with the British, so they called it the French and Indian War.

There were also a lot of American Indian tribes involved, from the Abanaki to the Iriquois, mostly on the French side; from the point of view of the Brits and the American colonists, they were fighting the French and the Indians. The Brits would never have won without the tens of thousands of Colonial Militia troops involved.|`|dYGnVjjoaa	The Indians were allied with the French against the British.

What you're refering to as "thought" is actually a string of chemical and electrical reactions in the brain. Time is a method of measuring the the speed of light relative to an object; i.e. the solar year. "Time" is basically light speed, and since nothing can be faster than the speed of light without destroying matter it is imposible for a material like electrical impulses to move faster than the speed of light. Time is faster than thought.<br>  The other part of the question is more neurological: with the current understanding of the brain we know that thinking something and thinking about your previous thought are two seperate tasks and cannot be done by the brain at the same exact time. This is why you need time to think about what you just thought about.|`|ty6xmeHeaa	I think thought is faster than time because when you think you get carried away and when someone asks you a question all these thoughts just flood you mind. it's really amazing.|`|ElTNcN2Uaa	time has absolutely no speed whatsoever.

HORACAnlaa	A great doctrine for rocks but the conditional nature of life shows us that things do matter if you wish to stay alive. Nihilism accepts the theist position that there must be an ultimate meaning for everything, every act of our being must be formed against this ultimate meaning, and then throws out the existence of the ultimate meaning. However if we throw out the theist notion of a divine meaning, or an ultimate end outside of life, we find the nihilist position is meaningless. Life has meaning but the meaning of life is contained within life. We don't need to have our existence validated by a God for our lives to have meaning. Life has inherent meaning because it's a live. Nihilism, in the end, is the bastard step-child of theism, it rejects God, but still wants God to give us meaning. I choose life.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Let me think. Now my brain is a complete vacuum.

LIfe without existence is not life at all because without the idealism that we are alive for a reason, a goal or a task. No one is truly alive, which means we are all truly dead and we are merely electrical signals within a chuck of moving carbon. Without meaning what defines us as human, as sentient or even as living beings. NIhilism is just another way to mix scientific ideologies into religious philosophies in some preparation for some religi-science war that will supposedly happen. This really is just another pathetic attempt of science trying to worm it sway into religion instead of the opposite way around.|`|BS2dgOIWaa	Nihilism is a school of thought built completely on theory.

onkUcy19aa	The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, alternatively known as the Amritsar Massacre, was named after the Jallianwala Bagh (Garden) in the northern Indian city of Amritsar where, on April 13, 1919, while doing a peaceful demonstration on occasion of Punjabi New Year, British Indian Army soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer opened fire on an unarmed gathering of men, women and children. The firing lasted about 10 minutes and 1650 rounds were fired, or 33 rounds per soldier. Official British Raj sources placed the fatalities at 379. According to private sources there were over 1000 deaths, with more than 2000 wounded, and Civil Surgeon Dr. Smith indicated that there were 1,526 casualties|`|HxXduL1maa	Probably the most fateful and petrifying day in the History of Indian Freedom Movement is the day of the Amritsar Massacre. The date was 13th April, 1919. It was a Sunday afternoon and about ten thousand people, including many women and children, gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh, a garden in the city of Amritsar. The people assembled there to conduct a meeting, peacefully protesting against the arrest of two leaders of the Indian National Congress. It was a peaceful protest and the people who gathered there were all unarmed. <br>  <br>  Jallianwala Bagh had already become by that time, a public square, a place for the Indians to meet for meetings and protests against the oppression. At that time, Edward Dyer was the British General and on seeing the crowd, he ordered his men to open fire on the unarmed and non-violent group of innocent people. <br>  <br>  The design of the Jallianwala Bagh was such that it only had narrow gate for moving in and out of the place. General Dyer placed his soldiers at the only opening of the Jallianwala Bagh and without any kind of warning, ordered to fire on the Indian crowd. <br>  <br>  The Amritsar Massacre, also known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, is an extremely dishonorable and disgraceful event because of the kind of brutality that was practiced by the British on the helpless Indians. For a long time, the soldiers unloaded the bullets ruthlessly and brutally on the crowd that was trapped to death. Nearly four hundred people were killed and more than a thousand were severely injured. <br>  <br>  This appalling and horrifying event of the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar resulted in the mass Indian uprising and insurgence and ultimately led to the Indian Freedom. But, the tragic day of the massacre in Amritsar will always bring a bloodcurdling and terrifying memory in the minds of all Indians.|`|gWX21Jtwaa	Most of those killed were Indian nationalists meeting to protest the British government's forced conscription of Indian soldiers and the heavy war tax imposed against the Indian people.

FaX8awk1aa	The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon was written by Karl Marx between December 1851 and March 1852, and originally published in 1852 in Die Revolution, a German-language monthly magazine published in New York and established by Joseph Weydemeyer. Later editions (such as an 1869 Hamburg edition) were entitled The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.<br>  <br>  The pamphlet shows Marx in his form as a social and political historian, treating actual historical events—those leading up to Louis Bonaparte's coup d'état of 2 December 1851—from the viewpoint of his materialist conception of history. The "Eighteenth Brumaire" refers to November 9, 1799 in the French Revolutionary Calendar—the day Louis Bonaparte's uncle Napoleon Bonaparte had made himself dictator by a coup d'état. The work is the source of one of Marx's most quoted statements, that history repeats itself, "the first as tragedy, then as farce" (with the former referring to Napoleon I, the latter to Napoleon III): "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."<br>  <br>  In a preface to the second edition, Marx said it was the intention of the work to "demonstrate how the class struggle in France created circumstances and relationships that made it possible for a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero's part."<br>  <br>  The work also contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."<br>  <br>  Marx's interpretation of Louis Bonaparte's rise and rule is of interest to later scholars studying the nature and meaning of fascism. Many Marxist scholars regard the coup as a forerunner of the phenomenon of 20th century fascism.

hl4kkvXhaa	Watch out for anyone who walks up and hands you a business card and rattles on about how you could be a model...if only you pay a fee.  Sure, I know most people think they'd catch on, but I've seen quite a few very intelligent people get swept up in it all...these people are slick, and working you to get your money so they get paid.  So...they'll say anything.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend how I got into modeling, actually.  The agency I went through had a call at a mall.  I actually wasn't even there for that that day, but my boyfriend at the time convinced me to try.  But, the thing was, I knew the company's reputation before I tried out.  This was a huge agency based in L.A., with smaller agencies throughout the U.S., and many of their models were doing a lot of print, ad, and screen work, so I knew they were legit.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you is start looking for agencies in your area.  Once you find some, be sure to ask around to find out their reputation before walking in the door.  If you meet a ton of girls all saying they're going through them...and will have work once they get through classes, but can't seem to find anyone who has actually gotten anything but maybe a few leads that went nowhere (or no leads at all), you know to steer clear.<br>  <br>  Be wary of web sites too.  Many modeling sites offer to find you jobs if you pay a fee to be advertized on their site.  The problem with this is that, most people don't read the fine print.  Once you post your pictures, the site has control of them.  This means the site has a right to sell only those pictures (and at a lower fee than you would charge...which earns them even more money and you nothing).<br>  <br>  Start looking through fashion magazines and looking at the agencies those girls are affiliated with.  A lot of people think they can't work for agencies with "that type" of girl, but honestly, modeling isn't about perfect beauty...it's about the right makeup, hair, and clothing...and more importantly, camera angles and digital "touch up".  Those girls don't run around looking so precise...they're normal, but just getting paid to be "doctored" by the camera.<br>  <br>  Look online for agencies such as Ford Modeling Agency and John Casablanca's Modeling and Career Center.  <br>  <br>  Another tip:  Don't alter your body to suit the agency.  For instance, I talked to a girl who had implants to make a prospective agency happy.  When she went back, they turned her down again, and told her she needed lipo.  The girl was a stick!  Any agency who gives you dangerous advice, or doesn't keep a strict monitor to watch the signs of eating disorders is not the place to go.  My agency taught us to maintain a healthy diet and excercise regimen, and those who were caught using dangerous methods (starvation, vomiting, laxatives, etc) were indefinitely suspended and the agency paid to have them put in a rehabilitation hospital.  Any agency that tells you that fasting a week before a shoot or "cattle call" is okay is not the place to be.  These are the types of people who are disreputable, and in the end push their models too hard, resulting in a tense insecurity, low self esteem, eating disorders, and angry behavior towards competing models.<br>  <br>  I usually don't advise people to go into modeling.  In fact, I tend to advise against it because it really does a number on your self esteem when you start getting rejection after rejection (which you will...everyone does...even the biggest names in modeling).  A close friend of mine is a gorgeous girl, but modeling turned her into a tired, bitter cutter, alcoholic, and drug addict.  What was crazy was that she was still getting calls!  I quit on my own before I stopped getting call backs because my education was too important to waste in my opinion.  So, even though it got to me a bit, it wasn't nearly as bad as girls who have done this for years.  But, I also have to admit that sometimes experiencing things for yourself is the only way to go.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Don't bother with modeling school or competitions - they don't make you a model and will cost you a lot<br>  <br>  Instead send in pictures directly to the agencies and they will call you if they think you have potential - and the only thing you'll have to pay for is your transportation to their office.

When you walk, lets your arms be loose like spaghetti and don't swing your hips too much, give them a relaxed feel. Walk sophisticated, not diva.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Go to www.modelmayhem.com and read through everything, don't just jump in. It is probably one of the best starting out opporunities for aspiring models.

NR3YnkVPaa	In stanza 2 he states the theme: don't need to see the whole thing, I can reconstruct it from just seeing part of it.  Which is often true enough, but then he goes on to say that seeing less he sees more. Meaning more than what the others see who go out and see the whole thing.  Now that is a surprising claim. Then he goes on to make it even more surprising. He says that if the part he sees is "flawed, distorted, dulled" he still sees it better than those who see the whole thing undeformed.  How can he say that??? The last stanza suggests an answer but we get no details. It says that "art" gives something that "nature" cannot give. Something to do with an "obliquity", or an oblique way of seeing things that somehow captures the essence of a thing in a better way than seeing the whole thing. It may be that he is contrasting a mere "beholding of nature" that is just a kind of bare perception, to a kind of artistic "seeing" that is trained and knows what to look for and how to recognize what is important. and thus, only needs to see a part of it in order to understand its teleology (purpose, or end) and its essence.

You want to take lessons and learn the theory as well (learning chord structure is the best thing you could ever do).  DO NOT get into the habit of learning how to only play from tabs.  Find a credible teacher, and you want to start playing on an accoustic.  In my opinion everyone should learn how to play piano first, but thats just me :p|`|TQhaUIg1aa	of course it's not too late!<br>  i'm fifteen and i've only been playing for a coupla years!<br>  the song that inspired me to play is eruption by eddie van halen.<br>  i then went out and got myself an electric guitar for my fourteenth birthday and started looking up tabs and techniques and started too learn. then i went out and got some lessons which improved my playing further. <br>  i'm gonna be sixteen in a few months.<br>  if you can't get an electric,start learning things on the acoustic. just simple things like chords to songs that you like. you can find tabs/chords of songs on the internet and sites like ultimate guitar!

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, an education if film would be a good start.  Finding a good film school that offered a wide array of courses would be ideal because then you could learn about sociology, psychology (these would help you understand groups and individuals), science, and you should also look into taking courses in zoology, or maybe even getting a certification in some sort of wildlife and/or domesticated animals.  The reason I bring these up is because, even if it's not necessary, it would be helpful to understand the animals you would like to film.<br>  <br>  Since documentaries are narrative, you might also consider taking writing courses, and courses in communications (such as communication studies, media communications, and visual communications).  And, if you are thinking along the lines of National Geographic, this may seem silly, but a geography class...and some cultural classes would be really good (such as World Culture, foreign languages, Cultural Diversity, and etc).<br>  <br>  The great thing about going to college these days is that, unlike when I went to a traditional campus, the advisors are more likely to know how to help you design a program to suit your interests the best.  <br>  <br>  Depending on how old you are, you might find it helpful to speak to a school guidance counselor, and maybe begin looking into some colleges.  Talk to the advisors, and explain your career goals, and see if they can help you come up with an academic plan suited to you.<br>  <br>  I know I always say this...college is very important, no matter what.  With the economy in such a slump, it's especially important to get as much hands and real world training as possible.  College can help you do that.  And, in your area of study, you would be more likely to end up in an internship that could get you recognition and possibly a full time job faster than trying to start from the bottom rung with nothing but a dream.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!

nQ3kFPMVaa	Stay in school and keep doing drama until you graduate. Get involved in local amateur groups, do indie/student films, and take lots of extra-curricular classes. When you're ready, you can go to a local university and study acting. Definitely do the course at VCA it looks excellent on a resume. You are so far doing the right things, auditioning for the school play, doing classes! I don't know much about Hoppers as I'm on the other side of Melbourne, but you may find a couple of amateur groups in your area: check the first link below for companies.<br>  <br>  First off, check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb.<br>  <br>  AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.<br>  <br>  Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.<br>  <br>  If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.<br>  <br>  Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.<br>  <br>  Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.<br>  <br>  DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.|`|NjYCvfYGaa	Find an acting coach, take lessons.<br>  <br>  You aren't wasting your time, if it's your dream you have to go for it.<br>  Make sure your parents support you on this, if they don't then convince them because legally you can't go/do anything/anywhere.<br>  <br>  I wish I would have started pursuing acting a lot earlier and I'm only 15...<br>  Don't waste time, do the research and get on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck on the audition.<br>  Give your heart out! good luck|`|mxjEzY1Laa	<a href="http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check

Habit 5 is called: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood: Principles of Mutual Understanding.  So, if you and I have a conflict, you say to me "let me listen to you first, see if I understand where you're coming from" you listen carefully, ask me questions, but don't bring YOUR views into the picture until you fully understand mine. You might ask me, "so you think this way because of that?"... "Yes" is my answer.  Now it's your turn. You get to explain to me exactly how you feel and I am less likely to interrupt you because I've already said what I had to say. Besides, I KNOW you understand me. The dynamic changes when we bring our human aspect into the picture. You'd be amazed at your sense of generosity when you understand another's true motives; they're not always as sinister as we think. You may find that what you thought was a conflict is merely a misunderstanding, or more likely, a lack of communication.<br>  <br>  Notice there is no fancy technique or manipulation here. The habit says "seek to understand" a healthy thing that we all know we must do, but a difficult task when dealing with conflict.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.

i5FP4Vbraa	What the Normans brought with them was their version of French, Norman French.  We actually got a two tier language for a while and you can see this in such as "cow" - which came originally from Dutch - pronounced coo.  This word cow showed you who looked after the animal.  But the word for the meat of the cow is beef [Norman French Boef - boof].  Thus we start to have a split language.  The cow man or cowboy and the Norman Knight eating the Roast Beef in his castle etc.<br>  <br>  In addition to all of the above, the normans introduced new names to England. Up to the time of the invasion of 1066 very few people had surnames in England and would probably just go by the place name where they lived.  Thus we get say John of London [drop the of and we get John London.<br>  <br>  The Normans insisted that everyone have a surname and lots of Norman names got spread about - Norman names are mostly of the Teutonic [Germanic] kind and not French - this we get Gilbert, which the Normans probably pronounced as Zscheel-bear.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is that English [a sort of Anglo-Saxon] of the 1066 period simply continued on it's slightly gutteral way with the full glottal stop, masses of miss-spellings and silent letters etc.  Thus by the time we get to Geoffrey Chaucer we have something called Middle English - bits of which are understandable to us but the most part of which is a bit foreign sounding.<br>  <br>  So, here then is the Geoffrey Chaucer version of English as she is spoke. . .<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE0MtENfOMU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE0MtENfO...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not one hundred percent sure, but something along the lines of the March winds have blown away and now it's April [blah] time to head for Canterbury with lots of flaggons of ye ale etc.  whatever. and don't dilly dally ont the way etc.<br>  <br>  Even English of the 1860s [not all that long ago] sounds strange, the Gettysburg Speech by Abe Lincoln has got to be listened to and read very carefully indeed, otherwise it's easy to miss what's being said.  Of course, back then there were no PA systems and the method by which the speech was spread through the crowd was for men in the crowd to turn around and repeat whole sentences at a time.  Lost in translation etc.<br>  <br>  A little closer to the present we get this, from Mark Twain having listened to Charles Dickens.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/18680205.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.twainquotes.com/18680205.html</a><br>  <br>  Even more interesting, I found this most letter in the Daily Mail a few days ago.  It was written at the time by one of the men who witnessed the digging up of Napoleon's body for transportation and burial in Paris. [les Invalides, I think].<br>  <br>  Abbe Coquereau, gives a fascinating description of the exhumation: "The whole body seemed to be covered with a light foam [adipocere, a greyish waxy substance produced by the decomposition of soft tissue in corposes exposed to moisture] as if we were looking at it through a diaphanous cloud.<br>  "The head was unmistakeable, a pillow raised it slightly; we could distinguish his broad forehad and his eyes, the sockets of which were outlined beneath the eyeloids, still fringed with a few lashes, his cheeks were swollen, only his nose had suffered; his mouth, which was half open, revealed three remarkably white teeth; on his chin the traces of a beard were perfectly clear; his two hands in particular seemed to belong to someone who still breathed, they were so fresh in tone and colouring...his nails had grown after death; they were long and white.<br>  "One of his boots had come unsewn and showed four dull-whit toes."<br>  <br>  Thus the Emperior was transported to France from St. Helena.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember about the English language is that it is an entirely democratic language.  New words, which must come from the street in the form of slang, are added only after they have remained in popular use for about ten years.  Thus, from the 1960s we get words such as 'pinta' [pint of milk] and 'cuppa' [cup of tea]. . .it never ends the language is in a state of constant development and growth.<br>  <br>  My own race, the Welsh, long since abandoned their own language in favour of English, even though people want Welsh to become important, it cannot.  The truth is that it is a very narrow language unlike English, which is broad and widely spoken.<br>  <br>  One of the greatest poets of Wales and of the English Language, Dylan Thomas, knew that he had a world wide audience, not in Welsh, but in English.<br>  <br>  Under Milkwood by Dylan Thomas - Richard Burton [Mister Golden Tongue].<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3VJmQZ3l_I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3VJmQZ3l...</a><br>  <br>  English is a massive subject and well worth reading about, even in a trashy novel.  It's got a massive audience and everyone has their own opinion.  The age old arguments continue.  Where does the apostorphe go?  Damn the apostrophe! etc.<br>  <br>  Even in my own lifetime of a mere 68 years so far, the way we speak has changed considerably.  When did you last hear someone here in London say, "Watcha ducks?"  This is how a man would greet a woman or a girl he knew.  A rough translation reads|`|AA11323310	And after all that, we taught the world.|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	The invasion is generally seen as the dividing line between Old English and Middle English.

Notice these are the same celestial bodies that the days of the week are named after.<br>  <br>  If you look at an enneagram (online somewhere) you will notice that Saturn is directly across from Lunar. These are maximum attractions. I've verified LONG, LONG ago that as a Lunar, I am attracted  most to Saturnine women. <br>  Next, Jovials are across from Mercuries. That is, they are OPPOSITES. Thus, they are ALSO maximum attractions. Finally, Martial types are the opposite of Venusian types. That leaves one type without a maximum attraction. Solar types don't have maximum attractions. This tends to make them prone to suicide. Judy Garland was a Solar Type.<br>  <br>  The story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, which was collected by the Brothers Grimm in the early 18 hundreds had actually been around much longer (I'm obviously not talking about that idiot Walt Disney's mishmash of this wonderfully high metaphysical story) was about the seven basic body types (that we are born as) and what we  could become, with long and difficult psychological work (metaphorically  "Snow White").<br>  <br>  Modern "psychology" is not psychology in the smallest degree.  A degree in "psychology" as given by universities will maybe get you a high paying job but it doesn't mean you have the slightest understanding of what REAL psychology is. Real psychology can only be learned in conscious schools. <br>  <br>  And where a person might find a conscious school, that's anybody's guess.|`|yUudoO1Raa	I must say there is something to this so called "law" (which is not a law of anything.)<br>  <br>  Successful athletes describe how they close their eyes and run the scenario in their minds of swining the bat, or shooting the 3 pointer, and they claim it works. I'm sure it does, but what works better is actually practicing it. Imagining it is merely an exercise in repeating the mental patterns that have proved successful on the field or the court--or at the piano bench, etc.<br>  <br>  I have no doubt that thinking the scenarios through does help. But I have no doubt that you can't just set your mind on something and expect this "law" to come true.|`|NCuA2Cngaa	The law of attraction works on how you feel about the thoughts and experiences that you are having. Not the images or the experiences in and of themselves <br>  Everything you create in your mind breaks down to a feeling and it's the feeling that you resonate with that attracts the outcome you are moving towards. so pay attention to your feelings now and write down exactly how you feel about the reality you find yourself in now that feeling is made up of your personal history....?? This might help....    ?<br>  <br>  What is “personal history?” <br>         Personal history is the culmination of every        experience, thought, image, emotion, feeling, taste, sound or anything        else your 5 senses have encountered during your lifetime.? That means        every experience you have on the golf course or with money, failure,        success, rejection, love, pain it doesn’t matter whether it was a real        experience or something you imagined, it’s all part of your personal        history. It’s what makes you … YOU!<br>         Here are some common life &        money expressions that may make up your personal history.<br>       ?I didn't suffer enough...it has to be a        struggle. I don't deserve success. I'm not special enough to succeed.       I have to earn my way...I have to work        hard to be deserving. I feel like a failure. I'm afraid to be successful...it will        just be taken away. Conflict about being successful...I        don't get what I choose. I have problems receiving. I don't want to be like my successful        father. Fear of debt...Is there enough?        I don't put myself first. Low self-image. Too much stress...expecting problems.       Success would cost me too much.        Fear of shining...Can't be successful        because I'll be punished. Not enough time...am I enough?        People will leave me if I make more        money. I'm mad at people with money because        they don’t deserve it either. I must pay a price for achievement.       There was never enough...If I make        money, I'll have to leave. Good things never last for me.        I don't deserve to be successful        because I don't look good. I'm greedy if I have desires…afraid to        want more. I lack energy and confidence.        Unconscious blocks to receiving.        Negative focus. I need to be needed in order to feel        worthy. I'm too lazy...it's going to be hard.       Good things don't last for me.        Attracting        abundance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                These are but a small sampling of statements that may      make up part of your personal history. How many other phrases can you come      up with? <br>       Let’s      imagine a real life example:<br>       Imagine you are out on the golf course, you are      approaching a RATHER DIFFICULT putting situation and      you grab your putter and you feel that rush of adrenaline as your mind      instantly recalls the last 3 times you attempted this shot and missed and      those doubts begin to creep into your thoughts, that’s your Personal      History in action and that is what we are going to change!? By the way      how did you know it was RATHER DIFFICULT …. Personal      history in action yet again!<br>       Let’s briefly explore how this happens so that we can      control our personal history and use it to our advantage.? <br>       The latest research on how our brain works:<br>       1.?? Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), a way of looking at the      brain, Dr Larry Cahill in the Centre for the Neurobiology of Learning and      Memory at UC Irvine states, “when there's strong emotion attached to any of      the experiences in your memory both real and imagined, the stress hormone      response gets activated and essentially tells your brain, 'Hey, this is more      important than what was happening ten minutes ago or an hour ago, or      whatever, store this better for immediate access.” A good example of this      would be “PSTD or post-traumatic stress disorder, where people have      undergone some sort of horrific traumatic event. What you have is memories      that are just the opposite of repressed. They're way too accessible. People      have trouble not thinking about these memories.” Says Dr Cahill<br>       Conclusion:? The greater emotional response that you have to any      situation, the easier it is to access by your brain and the more important      it becomes. <br>       Which elicits a greater emotional response the 4 foot putt you are about      to attempt or the last putt you just attempted, missed and lost the bet??      your secret weapons will reduce the emotional response to losing the bet and|`|TcVqBS8kaa	This all happened bcuz you were too much aware of the positive and all that wishful thinking but in yur whole question U have never mentioned that u felt happy in doing the process u that went through and second U cant quit from LOA Its happenin all the time no matter if u're consious about it or not It doesnt matter It doesnt matter I guess for u its better to just be happy and go on wid lyf Afterall that matters is happiness and luv for yur self.....<br>  <br>  Luvd2help|`|e5tf423caa	The reason why the Law Of Attraction doesn't work is because it's only one part of the puzzle. I blame the movie "The Secret" for sensationalizing it and leaving out vital bits of information. <br>  <br>  You HAVE to back the positive thinking and visualizing with ACTION. Sitting around dreaming of success isn't going to work. YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION. <br>  <br>  The Law of Attraction is not a substitute for hard work, but simply a tool to train our minds to help us to reach our goals faster.<br>  <br>  One of the simplest ways to do this is to write your goals down on a card and then read them every single day - morning and evening. Try this for 30 days and you will be amazed.<br>  <br>  And lastly, get rid of that stinking thinking!! If you believe that you always have bad luck then that's what you'll attract. <br>  <br>  Be happy and focus on the positive aspects of your life and soon you'll have more to be happy and positive about.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more about the other 11 Universal Laws Of Success visit <a href="http://offto.net/11laws" rel="nofollow">http://offto.net/11laws</a>
l9uGrfSYaa	Those turned out pretty cool there amber. Good job. I like the first color template used though (pink hair). The blue background on the second one seemed to interfer with the front ground (the completely white clothing). The shading was awsome! <br>  <br>  For the original, that looks cool also. I did a portrait of a lady (in some '91 kmart magazine) with the exact same pose, wich caught me off guard! 8D I like the cartoon style put in with real features and shading. <br>  <br>  I do apologize if I sound rude because I'm really trying to be constructive, not mean.

yUudoO1Raa	Our bodies are "just vessels" for our soul? Well, yes, but the soul begins tabula rasa just as the mind does, it is a connection between the mind and our emotional cognitions, and when our mind dies, so does our soul. <br>  <br>  Love is not the most important thing.

Bh6NwFzeaa	Isn`t it funny that iano always thinks someone is talking about him? That`s cause he`s so guilty that he comes right out and does damage controll. It`s his big fat ego that always gets him in trouble. If iano never answered this then nobody would know who Andy was talking about. Iano is his own worst enemy. Amongst thousands of others. It`s too bad cause he claimes to be such a great person but sabotages<br>  himself every time he puts his fingers to the keyboard. He is so buried deep in the hole that he has made for himself. He grabs at little sticks to help him up, but because of his arrogance the sticks keep breaking. So he ends up back at the bottom having to start all over. If he was a nice person someone might reach their hand in and give him a pull up. <br>  But they are so used to him either biting the hand or pulling them in. He`s an untrained animal.<br>  iano, Why does  correcting people spelling and grammar makes you feel so good? Is that all you have.? That`s pitiful|`|e5f96ad47eff9e90b6ec54a31aca1bfcaa	And who might be he that you are talking about?  lol  He does provided a lot of comic relief as his arguments increasingly become more irrelevant.|`|9mv3XPeBaa	cool story, bro.|`|wWL934E8aa	Amazing what an idiot can inspire from us when he gets our dander up.<br>  <br>  Excellent write.

LOL  As for the poem, it is not punctuated correctly and seems more like a rant than a poem.  I couldn't get into this at all.  Rather than figurative language, you have a lot of cliches: 'stupid smart', street smart', 'Somewhere USA', etc.  Not your best work Andrew, and I can't condone the spirit in which it was written either.  By all means, keep writing, but give these things a little thought before your next write.|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	I don't have television and I've never seen a reality show but if you tell me when and what channel, I'll make a trip to Wal-Mart for a cheap telly.<br>  <br>  Nice write!|`|T0fwqL2baa	Olive branches do work Andrew, but BOTH parties have to be willing.If "he" was not....it is certainly his lose.

As you know absolutely nothing about me, I appreciate the stretch of your imagination in creating an imaginary background for me, but I live in one of the (if not THE) hardest cities in the world with more murders daily than your cosy neck of the woods. Sorry to disillusion your sad fantasy. As for 'olive branch', show all your pals All of the emails (and leave all the swear words in) which you sent me recently along with my responses and let them judge for themselves how 'reasonable' you were trying to be.<br>  <br>  Nonman...well done in finally being able to spell 'irrelevant' correctly. I'm so 'irrelevant' that you're STILL answering questions and responding to 'poems' that people are STILL writing about me. You all must love me so.<br>  <br>  Andy, your question would be better worded as "What of thinking aloud...?" (Despite the similarity of the title.) Glad to be of help. Oh, and no t/ds are from me.<br>  <br>  Idiots can and do inspire...I believe you inspired Semper Fi to write a few lines about you. Eh, 'giggles'? (And I believe idiots are well known for giggling incessantly.)<br>  <br>  As for JS...another deluded person mired in fantasy. Always trying to paint little scenarios about me that bear no relation to reality. How sad.

VP3AzKJKaa	I think we should have the choice.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Because we are illogical as a society. <br>  <br>  Also, there may be some belief by certain people that animals do not have souls and humans do, and therefore it is a more serious offense to end the life of a human, though if you believe that souls are immortal, then what happens to the human body really should be of no consequence.|`|AA12231462	Because people are frightened of our selves and our motivations for manipulating a person to die so they wont fritter away the inheritance - <br>  <br>  Also many people seem to take ownership of their family members dying process because it gives them their chance to be dutiful and express how much love they feel for this person no matter what. So it could result in damaged psyches all round.<br>  <br>  I am for it but then I am often blind as to how things might go wrong I tend to have an easter bunny view of humanity as a default setting - could be they are right to be afraid|`|7iiOJKILaa	In some places people do put other people down if they are in pain or have no chance to live. it is all up to the family. Besides putting a human down is considered murder.|`|AA10454805	We do. It's called abortion. Horses and dogs we already eat. Have you been to McDonald's lately?|`|AA12148387	Its humanely and morally wrong to kill people. It unethical also.|`|yudzhdU6aa	Because most religious people think suffering is a good thing|`|XtmPYHyJaa	people do i had to pull the plug on my granpas life suport and thats the same idea|`|AA11260017	Your question cut across two broad topic in Aesthetics,namely suicide and Euthenasia. For someone to ask willingly take his own life for whatever reason that might be is suicide.However a different twist to the issue is that of Euthenasia,This is a situation whereby the person involved is belived to be in pain that is too unbearable that he requested,or someone on the victims behalf requested to have the persons life terminated,this involves a legal backing.<br>  Animals cannot be compeared to Humans,Animals are lesser creatures to  Humans.So men seen as the more superior make their decisions for them,so some of these decisions may seem wrong,well in taking decisions affecting fellow Humans too,men are known to make wrong judgements.My summary to this is,someone has to take responsibility and Man seem the best option to take responsibility.<br>  Th reason why you would have abattle in your hands if you were to take your own life,is to determine wheather you have explore all known avenues to solve your problem.Again there is the need to check the trend of people taking their own lives. Dr death and his likes would have a field day if we do not have legislature that protects the society.<br>  Euthenasia,is avery sensitive topic,the topic has generated so much debate all over the world,with some calling for it's abolition,while others are in support of it.It all comes down to the school of thought that one belongs to,there are several school of thoughts when we talk about issues that affect Humans,simply because Humans are not the same and we have diversified views,either because of our religious background,Moral upbringing,World outview,etc,etc.|`|HaUXpyT6aa	Well if you put humans out of their misery like we do animals. Then this would be the result - Mass genocide in Africa resulting in the death of millions infected with AIDs. Suicides and murders would skyrocket.

People will live in the fear that they will be shot as soon as they walk out of their house (Like a Jew in Nazi Germany).

And it is probably true.|`|lK1VeYUiaa	Good question BTW.<br>  <br>  If you treat humans and animals alike then we are no better than the animals.  And ultimately what would happen is that it will be out of your hands.  Governments would tell you something like this.  Whelp...since you can't be cured we're gonna kill you.  You may not want to die yet.  But since your life was reduced to that of a dog's life then they will take it from you without your permission.|`|zzB90sQxaa	Well, people think humans are worth more than animals. <br>  <br>  Also, those who believe in God think that it's a sin to end one's life early, even if it's due to extreme suffering. <br>  <br>  Suicide has generally always been viewed as a shameful practice in the West, too.<br>  <br>  Stupid, really. As someone who has multiple chronic pain disorders, I can understand why someone would want to peacefully end their life early.|`|Eduyj1h5aa	Ending your own life is considered insane or inhumane, thus made illegal. When people try to kill themselves, we put them on drugs and give them counseling. Society hasn't yet realized what kind of suffering people go through and decide what's inhumane based off what they believe. A lot of it is because of religion, because most religions condemn killing yourself. But those same religions, when read in ancient times, told us i was ok to kill the dog or horse for food. We don't want to think of killing a being that can think for itself or allow a being to harm themselves. It's a complicated issue. When society finally grasps that death is just a part of life and stop trying to avoid it or evade it or prolong it, we will be able to implicate things like self-medications to end our lives.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	Humans are on the top of the food chain.<br>  So our lives are worth more.<br>  People who believe that human life is the same as an animal are idiots.

God gave us choice but the Bible wasn't written by God, it was written by man - like all ancient stories  - passed down thru generations and changed a little here and there before it is actually recorded in writing.  So man is trying to tell us what we can and cannot do - but God has given us the choice.  Yes, it should be up to the individual to choose whether to live or not, but man doesn't see it that way.  If God didn't want us to have a choice then he wouldn't have given us the choice to make - and that goes for everything in life....and death for that matter.  I mean, if you get here and you find that you just don't want to stay (for whatever reason) - well this life is only a transitional form to something else -my opinion anyway is that you (or your energy) will go on to whatever is next, regardless of how long you stay here in this relative state.....We are a species of scardy cats because we don't know what is coming next.  If we were caterpillars and knew that the next stage of our existence was to become beautiful butterflies, would we stop anyone from making the choice then? I wonder too....<br>  (Me the next day after reading answers by others...) I felt compelled to come back to this question to see what others have answered and just wanted to add that I think Happy (the one asking the question) is trying to say why can't we decide for ourselves about our own lives and not whether someone else has a right to decide for you whether you get to live or die - that WE should be able to choose for ourselves about our own lives and what to do (or not do) with it.  Tell me please Happy if I've misunderstood your question.....I don't think its a question of genocide or rampant murdering or anything of that nature- its just a question of each of us being allowed by our fellow humans to do what we want with our own lives -Man has arranged it so that society has taken away what God gave us - freedom of choice - we have a right to choose what we want for OURSELVES (not for anyone else) - be it life or death or the pair of pants we're wearing today (or not...) - OK, that's all I'm sayin' on that one....|`|7cM86oUBaa	Should we prevent tigers and tigers from killing zebras and antelopes for food?

Inhuman to have child marriages.<br>  <br>  In the civilised parts of the planet, it is inhuman to kick a dog in its stomach (unless you are in Saudi Arabia or the Taliban). If you see your neighbour doing it, you report them. It is inhuman to see whales beaching themselves and not doing anything about it. Therefore,  people fear their community being infected by a spirit of inhumanity by allowing suicide and not be able to do anything about it. Or, conversely, fear inhumanity if we compel a person to live in extreme pain.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the argument is over what humanity and being human is all about, not just on the part of the suicider or acomplices, but the community around them that wish or do not wish to do something about it.<br>  <br>  What is the value of human life? In some parts of the world, the value of human life is equal to settlement for religious dispute, canon fodder or combat shields.<br>  <br>  If someone commits suicide, or if we compel someone to continue living in tormented in pain, would that kill the value of humanity in the community - as much as a suicide-bomber would kill other human lives.<br>  <br>  We have not come to a resolution yet.

AA12343309	First of all you have to understand that Jews do not agree on what a Jew is.<br>  <br>  Reform Judaism sees a Jew as someone of the Jewish faith.<br>  <br>  Orthodox and Conservative Judaism defines a Jew by the mother alone, not the father or necessarily the religion.  As long as they have a Jewish mother, even though they no longer consider themselves part of the Jewish faith, an Orthodox Jew will tell you they are still a Jew.<br>  If they don't have a Jewish mother, the only way the can be considered a Jew is to convert.<br>  <br>  My maternal grandfather was a Jew and I had always stated I would not be considered a Jew by any of the 3 branches of Judaism.  I am not part of the Jewish faith.  I felt my maternal grandmother broke the female chain.  Then I took a Mitochondrial DNA test and found out I am in Haplogroup K1.  Thirty two percent of the Ashkenazi Jews belong to his Haplogroup as well as people around the Alps, particularly Northern Italy.  So there is a generic relationship between many Ashkenazim and many people of Northern Italy. <br>  <br>  The same DNA will frequently cross national, racial and ethnic lines.  In Europe Jews were a multinational ethnicity.  While  many of the Ashkenazims and Northern Italians are genetically related, they are different ethnicities.<br>  <br>  Jews and Arab are both considered Semites.  People whose origin were in North Africa are considered caucasians.   Jews themselves are not considered a separate race.  <br>  <br>  Actually genealogy DNA seems to indicate that the whole human race began in East Africa.  It is felt  our differences are due to mutations.<br>  Some people who could not survive in certain areas of the world.  Example: Sun is very rich in Vitamin D.  It has been found that the minimum amount of Vitamin D a black African should have is the maximum amount of Vitamin  D someone of Northern  European ancestry should have.  Today we have vitamin supplments and better protective clothing, sun screens etc.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Race is a sensitive subject. To use the word almost invites the charge of racism. Yet to understand the rise of Christianity one must come to terms the people who were its original authors – the Jews.<br>  <br>  The Jews claim themselves to be a race – but are they? <br>  The earliest reference yet found to this singular people is on a statue from the Syrian city of Alalakh, dated to about 1550 BC. The inscription refers to hapiru warriors in the land of Kin’anu – a presence confirmed by clay tablets from Akhenaten’s capital of Amarna, referring to marauders in the hill country of Palestine. The famous stele of Pharaoh Merneptah dated to 1207 BC records 'Israel is laid waste, his seed is not’. 'Israel' here is a reference to a people, not a territory.<br>  <br>  The weight of evidence suggests these original ‘Hebrews’ coalesced during the bronze age from successive migrations, some from the periphery of the Nile delta (in Egyptian, ‘Peru or apiru meant a labourer) but most from across the Jordan and Euphrates rivers. In their own semitic tongue, habiru meant ‘beyond’, suggesting an origin elsewhere. In Babylonian script khabiru referred to a class of slaves. As a people, therefore, the Hebrews combined Mesopotamian and Egyptian stock, almost certainly drawn from the lowest social order, conceivably including runaway slaves. One migration, at least, brought with it a mountain/sky god – Yahweh – destined for higher things.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Settlement in Canaan<br>  <br>  As barbarous newcomers to what was the land of Canaan, these semites (speakers of a tongue common to Syrians, Arabs and Mesopotamians) took up migratory occupation of the less fertile hill-country of the interior. Neither their limited sub-culture – an illiterate donkey nomadism; nor their social organisation – patriarchal and authoritarian – distinguished them from other tent-dwelling pastoralists. These early, polytheistic, Hebrews scratched an existence in an unpromising land on the fringes of the major civilisations, occasionally moving with their animals into the Nile delta in times of draught.<br>  <br>  It seems as if they were joined, over time,by outcasts or refugees from the more sophisticated Canaanite (Phoenician) coastal cities. ‘Israel emerged peacefully and gradually from within Canaanite society ‘ concluded Karen Armstrong, the noted religious scholar. (A History of Jerusalem, p23]<br>  <br>  The Canaanite migrants brought with them cultic practices and images of their traditional gods. A major Canaanite god was El, and the phrase ‘El has conquered’ gives us the word Isra’el. The Canaanite god El had a ghostly presence in a host of Jewish heroes: Dan-i-El; Ezek-i-El; Sam-u-El, Ish-ma-El, El-i-jah, El-o-him, etc.<br>  <br>  God-inspired names were common throughout the west-Semitic language region. Other Canaanite gods included Baal (a storm god) – also honoured in a host of Hebrew names, Asherah (a fertility goddess, consort of El), Shalem (a Syrian sun god – later to be honoured in the name Jeru’salem ), Milcom, Chemosh, etc. Ru’shalimum is mentioned in records of the Pharaoh Sesostris III (1872 - 1847 BC) – the settlement actually pre-existent long before the tribe of Hebrews made it their own. The site then appears to have been unoccupied for three hundred years until the Jebusites (otherwise known as Kereti or Peleti – Cretans or Philistines) arrived. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Blood Sacrifice <br>  <br>  Influenced by these Canaanite cults, but devoid of artistic or metal working skills of their own, the early Hebrews adopted a way of honouring their god of choice by genital mutilation. This sometime practice of the Egyptian priesthood became, for the ‘Jews’, a tribal obligation, part of the male regenerative organ offered as a blood sacrifice to the ‘jealous’ god Yahweh. Other gods were worshipped but Yahweh demanded precedence.<br>  <br>  Circumcision – a healthy option? <br>  Don't You Believe It!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For generations, millions of babies were routinely circumcised without anaesthetic – sometimes using a sharpened stone. Even today infant deaths result from this barbarous mutilation.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The unkindest cut.<br>   <br>   <br>  Thus though the Hebrews were not a race, the males at least acquired a distinctiveness from other Semitic tribesmen who did not practice circumcision. Women, regarded as mere chattels, were spared this mutilation. <br>  <br>  In this period of proto-Judaism, polygamous males acted as ‘priests’ for their extended families and kinship groups and exercised absolute authority over wives and children. At some point in the tenth century BC the Hebrews were completely overwhelmed by the more advanced Philistines, moving down from the north. Armed with iron weapons and deploying chariots the Philistines scattered the primitive Hebrew nomads into the hill country and a few austere places in the Jordan River valley.<br>  <br>  The various Hebrew clans had no single warlord but were led by tribal elders and shamans. The backward Hebrews remained under the sway of their shamanic ‘judges’ to a much later date than neighbouring peo|`|Eduyj1h5aa	Jease if you want a history word for word see first guy.

1TPGdaXJaa	I have recently been reading the book "Becoming Enlightened", and there is a Buddhist idea that somewhat parallels what you are suggesting. <br>  <br>  The way we perceive things as humans provides is considered a "conventional truth". For example, if you are looking at a large boulder resting on the ground, you see the boulder as large, solid, immovable, etc. You also see it as an object in and of itself. <br>  <br>  However, if you analyzed beyond your initial perception, you would be seeking "ultimate truth". A particle physicist may further analyze the boulder and see that, although it initially appeared solid and immovable, it is actually made up of tiny particles that are rapidly moving and changing each instant. Its being and its appearance are not in accord.<br>  <br>  The book goes on to discuss a concept that I can not yet fully get my mind around based on the info provided. But, the concept it says is that if this object were there in and of its own self as a solid object, then the more you analzyed it, the more clear it should continually become. But it doesn't. It instead becomes less clear, not existing in such a solid way. <br>  <br>  The initial concrete appearance of the boulder is a fault of our minds, both in perception and thought. Our perception of the boulder as a solid, immovable objects, leads our thoughts to accept this as fact, when it is in fact not the case upon further analysis.|`|LGkb4xibaa	ah. Ok.

No two people will have the same reality, so from a scientific or objective standpoint, it does not exist, as it is merely theoretical and fleeting.

For example, you and I may both look at the grass and agree that it is green, but you may have always seen all green things as red, only you've learned that is called green.  No-one will ever know.  I believe that other people exist, but I also believe that they are different in my reality than in my sister's for example, because e each perceive them slightly differently, and they may even look different to her than they do to me, as she may focus on different features.

I understand what you are saying.  Most people think too literal to understand the concepts they need to understand in order to reach the level your question is on.<br>  <br>  I have an exercise for you.  Find a mirror, get comfortable and stare at yourself.  Notice how your eyes water and dart away when you start seeing something other than what you think you should see.  My daughter and her best friend told me about doing this when they were 12.  When I did it, I started seeing my aura and I also saw faces cycle through.  I won't describe the faces because I don't want to influence what you see, but to really see something more that what you think you should see, you have to teach your eyes not to blink and reset the illusion of this life.<br>  <br>  My daughter has a natural ability in doing this.  She would have these episodes of what she would call the big head thing.  She would just stare at things, like your head and it would expand.  It started when she was very young.  I took her to doctors for years.  Finally when she was 12 she was diagnosed with Alice In Wonderland syndrome.  Look it up.  There are a lot of people with this.  But I don't think it is a disorder as much as it is a gift.<br>  <br>  One day I stood in her doorway with my hand on her door knob.  For some reason she was staring at my hand and what she described was mind-blowing.  She started seeing down past my skin all the way through to the bone.  It scared her, so she came out of it.  I saw the implications of what had happened, but she didn't like it.  She doesn't want to be special, so she suppresses her gift.  It is frustrating to know that people have the ability to do this, but fear stops them from utilizing it.  Think of the lives that could be saved.<br>  <br>  My point is that what we see as normal is just an illusion based on limited information.  What I see is a circular grid that is connected.  It expands and contracts.  Our existence represent each intersection on the grid.  We, as energy beings, are part of one large network experiencing this thing called life from different perspectives.  We create our perspective.  What we learn is filtered back into the gid, which enhances the whole.  This is evolution on a grander scale.

HxXduL1maa	East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste (officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste) is a country in Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and Oecussi-Ambeno, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island, within Indonesian West Timor. The small country of 15,410 km2 (5,400 sq mi) is located about 640 km (400 mi) northwest of Darwin, Australia.<br>  <br>  East Timor was colonized by Portugal in the 16th century, and was known as Portuguese Timor until Portugal's decolonization of the country. In late 1975 East Timor declared its independence but was invaded and occupied by Indonesia later that year, and declared that country's 27th province the following year. In 1999, following the United Nations-sponsored act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory and East Timor became the first new sovereign state of the twenty-first century on May 20, 2002. East Timor is one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia, the other being the Philippines.|`|Vd1OzUO8aa	East Timor was basically a Portuguese colony that was overrun by Indonesia in 1975 .  The people of that island never really accepted this and fought to have their rights listened to.  In 1999, the people of East Timor were allowed to vote on either or not they wanted independence.  They voted that they did want to be independent, which angered Indonesia.<br>  Indonesians believed that if East Timor broke away, than several other islands would follow and thus it would begun the fracturing of their country.  However, this never really happened, and East Timor became a free state in 2002

"To Kill a Mockingbird" cheers|`|mv9AZTdzaa	The important thing about these books is not necessarily reading them (but I do recommend reading them), it's knowing what people are talking about when they reference them.  If someone says "It's an Orwellian situation," reading Animal Farm and 1984 will help you know what they're talking about, but it still might not be clear.  If you're trying to prepare for being a lit. major, here's what I would recommend: <br>  <br>  Search the internet, and get a basic idea of what ALL of the books are about (except the last one).  Know what someone is talking about when they say: <br>  "He's got a bit of Captain Ahab in him"<br>  "It looks like a scene out of The Grapes of Wrath"<br>  "Wow, that's Kafkaesque" (although he's not on your list)<br>  "It's a Catch 22"<br>  etc. <br>  <br>  After that, read the 10 (or 12 or 15) that sound most interesting to you. Yes, literature is about learning from other people's perspectives of the world, but at a more basic level it's supposed to be entertainment.  I have no interest in reading Moby Dick. I know what it's about, I know how it ends, I know the overall lesson, and I don't feel like spending that many hours of my life reading it.  I have friends who love it.  That's no reason I have to read it. <br>  <br>  Just my two cents...

I already wrote a thesis in college.  <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, nationalism wasn't defined by the powers that be.  It was defined by the person who was born a Hungarian, a Check, a Slovak, etc.  So no, nationalism wasn't threatened by the consequence of the war's ending. In fact, I would argue it was more clearly defined because follwoing the war the various ethnic groups, with the exception of the Hungarians in Transylvania, the Kosovars in Serbia and the Moldavs in Russia were given their own national boundaries without an overriding power controlling their foreign policy.  Good luck with your paper.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Don't you mean, "Cite your sources so I can write them on my homework?"<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, absolutely. Ethnic groups, cities and countries were often split apart from each other, usually in no way that made sense to the people in residence. Citizens of one area might be told that they were suddenly part of a new country, but they rarely embraced this idea readily, and often yearned to return to the old borders. Part of Hitler's success leading up to (and during) WWII was the fact that he claimed to be annexing area on behalf of the poor citizens who longed to return to their motherlands.

XxtVwslraa	A writer's life is far from glamorous. I'm sure most have day jobs and just write on the side, even successful ones. In order to do writing full time you have to be big like J.K.Rowling, Stephanie Meyer, Stephen King. Or write many many books. The average writer makes only about $20,000 a year. So prepare yourself to have a second job and then if you become huge you can move on to writing full time.|`|HJXezEuLaa	Wow, sounds like me....<br>  <br>  All I could guess is that the life of a writer is composed of:<br>  <br>   Writing, speaking with your agent/publishing company, working to edit the story...<br>  <br>  Very few writers have a glamorous life, because everyone just doesn't recognize who you are, and you may be famous, though in public, no one will know who you are...<br>  <br>  My Opinion: No, a writer's life isn't glamorous-It's mainly about working towards a goal of making your own writing the favorite of your readers.|`|BdSqvOu1aa	Hi Dan,<br>  <br>  It all depends on where you are in the<br>  literary engine. There are authors who<br>  just write. <br>  <br>  For example, Walter Mosley writes every <br>  single. He's generating I'm beautiful royalties<br>  from his publishing company.<br>  <br>  Then there's an author whose first name<br>  is Francis. She has written a lot books.<br>  I'd say in the double digits. She continues<br>  to work as a nurse. Not sure what her<br>  contract looks like.<br>  <br>  Lastly, there are the independent, small<br>  press, and self published authors who are<br>  pushing to reach the level of Walter Mosley<br>  or even Francis because they are receiving<br>  royalties from a publisher.<br>  <br>  When I wrote my novel, my main goal was<br>  and remains... to get on the big screen. <br>  <br>  Dan, overall becoming a bestselling author<br>  is more than just writing. You're marketing,<br>  promotions, PR, branding and more. It's all<br>  fun as long as you come into it with the<br>  knowing.<br>  <br>  I say open you heart and write it.

Many are creative writing teachers or University professors. Wallace Stevens, one of the great American poets, was the vice president of a major insurance company and a lawyer. William Carlos Williams, another major American poet from the same era, was a physician/obstetrician. Herman Melville tried to support himself as a farmer as does Wendell Berry.<br>  Some writers break through and become independent of their regular jobs. Robert Parker the mystery writer. Ernest Hemingway did not have to take  job after he became successful as  writer. In the middle are writers who spend much of their time writing grants and other funding proposals. The Macarthur grants and the Guggenheim grants have been wonderful for literature. The famous writer's colony at Yaddo (I don't think it still exists.) was great.<br>  Wallace Stevens believed his first duty was to support his family. His second duty was to make what contributions he could to the advancement of literature. I think those are laudable goals.

AA11362424	You are drunk, aren't you?  At least you were when you wrote your question.  Now, come on, get over it.  There is more to life than women and sex.  I don't know what, but someone told me there is, and if you find it, please, post it.|`|c94b77938ba4f6010a266316b5f8a278aa	First of all, do you really want to be in a relationship with a girl who doesn’t share such an important value with you?  I am a Christian also, and I could never date a guy if we didn’t share the same views on something as important as sex.  You never said how old you are, but I’m going to assume that you’re fairly young.  No matter how firm your beliefs are the fact remains that people like sex, especially young people with raging hormones.  I’m a 19 year old girl, and I just started university this year.  The biggest change I’ve noticed is peoples’ attitudes towards sex.  I know exactly how you feel and I know how depressing it can be at times when so many people around you don’t take sex seriously.  At times it can feel like you’re the only person in the world that’s not doing it.  <br>  <br>  The first thing I can suggest would be to pray about it.  This may seem obvious, but a lot of times even Christians forget the amazing power of prayer.  Talk to God; share your feelings and concerns with him.  Often times he is the best shoulder to lean on.  “Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you.  He will never let the righteous fall.” (Psalm 55:22)<br>  <br>  The bible says that God has a plan for us.  I think that one of the biggest misconceptions among Christians is that marriage is the only way to a fulfilled life in Christ- it’s not.  Enjoy being single and embrace what life has to offer.  There’s nothing wrong with being single, so use it as an opportunity to understand yourself better and to grow in Christ.  <br>  <br>  Among Christian singles there will always be a battle for spiritual survival.  Hang in there and never ever compromise what you believe in for the satisfaction of others.|`|bbc1c8add16df222d747f9e584726a9faa	My answer is pretty simple, stay grounded in your Christian beliefs and don't give into the temptation. Satan would like nothing better than you to give up your virtues and become the sinner you're supposed to be. Don't do it, you'll end up regretting it in the long run.<br>  If all these girls keep running off, let them, you have to realize that they are obviously not for you if all they are interested in is sex. You'll come across the right one in time, pray ask God for the guidance and strength in those situations.<br>  Remember, satan is out there ready to destroy anything he can to pull you away from God.<br>  Sinning is easy, going out and having a good time with a girl takes no self control at all, but the guilty feeling you'll have afterward won't be worth it.<br>  Read the book- "Waking the Dead" by John Eldridge|`|dd380d844530c21fd9012fcfe4d00f3faa	You are obviously to focused on these women or girls. If you are a Christian and serious about your relationship with God then you need to get back on track and make that your priority right now. Its obvious you are making bad choices when it comes to who you are dating because a REAL woman of God will not cheapen herself and give away that which is precious and sacred in the eyes of God. Which is The one thing she can give to the man she commits herself to; Her complete self!  So don't "get over your Christian beliefs on sex" When God is ready he will bring into your life the one person who will complete you. Your rib! Your helper in this life! Get your focus back on your walk with Jesus and  when you least expect it to happen He will bring her to you! I would also question the values of a woman who claims to be a Christian and when you break up goes and sleep with someone else! Don't mourn over this be glad you didn't end up with her!!!!|`|e6d97922b69e8b90bf96e77ae9d9da8eaa	You seriously need to stop tugging your willie and realise that you have this life but once, get over it and get on with it..... the women in your life are.

ca5caa8c0a174fe45eee50a883df0d53aa	A girl in middle school writes in her journal about standing up to cliques.  She bases her book off her real life experiences and people she knows.  Her journal accidently gets turned in as an english assignment and get the attention of a publisher.  It is then published and she becomes famous and does all these cool things, but she becomes kind of stuck up.  Then the people at her school figure out she wrote about them (not always in a nice way!).  Then she apologises and writes a sequel.  Typical middle school stuff.  Disney channel made a movie of it called "Read it and Weep".|`|Kq0M3INaaa	Fourteen-year-old Jamie is tired of feeling insecure: at home she's barraged with media images of physically flawless young women; at school, she's hassled by a gang of catty, manicured classmates. Venting her frustrations in her diary, she chronicles the adventures of invented superhero Isabella (IS) who, with her signature wrist flick, sends "positivity rays" that destroy her nemesis, Myrna, and her "evil clique of Populars." Through a wild chain of events, Jamie's IS stories become a published best-seller, and Jamie becomes a teen celebrity. DeVillers' frothy, humorous first novel is a giddy fairy tale, written in a combination of diary excerpts, instant messages, and Jamie's spot-on narration. Readers may wish that the novel contained more of the actual IS story that inspires such uproar, but they'll enjoy joining Jamie as she experiences both highs and lows, copes with fame and fortune, and tries to maintain her IS-like sense of self-empowerment

2f018061b6759fc517399efa0b3517a7aa	***<br>  Lee esto y opina:<br>  <br>  Ni soldadera ni Adelita ni prostituta, sino posible cocinera de las tropas huertistas. Ni 1910, ni 1913, sino 1912. Ni Agustín Víctor o Miguel Casasola ni Abraham Lupercio ni Heliodoro Gutiérrez ni Fernando Sosa, sino Jerónimo Hernández.<br>  <br>  Así podría resumirse la azarosa historia de una de las fotografías más emblemáticas de la Revolución Mexicana y cuyo verdadero autor acaba de ser dado a conocer por el investigador Miguel Angel Morales en un artículo del más reciente número de la revista Alquimia, que dirige José Antonio Rodríguez.<br>  <br>  La fotografía de Jerónimo Hernández fue publicada por primera vez el lunes 8 de abril de 1912 en el diario maderista Nueva Era, y da cuenta de la partida, el sábado 6 de abril, de tropas del general Victoriano Huerta de la estación de Buenavista rumbo a Chihuahua. Las tropas iban a combatir al general Pascual Orozco, que se había sublevado contra el presidente Francisco I. Madero.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, en la mesa de redacción de ese diario, que tiempo después, en 1913, sería incendiado por seguidores del golpista Victoriano Huerta, un redactor le puso el inspirado título ''Defenderé a mi Juan'', de donde se derivaría la historia de desatinos que hoy concluye gracias a Morales.<br>  <br>  Fue así, cuenta Morales, que 48 a?os después, en 1960, la famosa imagen comenzó a reproducirse para representar a las Adelitas o soldaderas en publicaciones como las enciclopedias Historia gráfica de la Revolución Mexicana e Historia gráfica de México siglo XX, o libros como Las soldaderas, de Elena Poniatowska.<br>  <br>  Misterio por resolver <br>  <br>  Para Miguel Angel Morales, la ahora famosa mujer ''debió pertenecer al carro-cocina, es decir, formaba parte de las cocineras que iban en ese tren. No en balde sus compa?eras llevan canastos, seguramente con alimentos''. Y más adelante: ''No se conoce ni el nombre ni la trayectoria militar de esa mujer humilde''.<br>  <br>  De Jerónimo Hernández el investigador se?ala que ''quizá no sólo fue el fotógrafo oficial de Nueva Era, sino que también debió de ser jefe de fotografía de ese diario''.<br>  <br>  Cuenta que en octubre de 1911 Hernández formó parte de los fotógrafos de diarios y revistas que conformaron la Asociación Mexicana de Fotógrafos de Prensa, fundada y presidida en ese tiempo por Agustín Víctor Casasola.<br>  <br>  Hernández también es autor de la famosa foto del presidente Madero llegando al Palacio Nacional, donde estaban atrincherados los traidores, el 9 de febrero de 1913, cuyo crédito también se le había escamoteado.<br>  <br>  La tarde del martes 18 de febrero de 1913, día en que Huerta asumió la presidencia interina, seguidores de éste incendiaron la oficinas de Nueva Era, ubicadas en Balderas y Artículo 123. Después de esa fecha, la vida de Hernández se volvió un misterio por resolver.<br>  <br>  Les deseo a todos que tengan un super feliz fin de semana!!!|`|KjnDoFI3aa	se supone que si|`|b3568b53fe5ae83ba199c9405ce664d4aa	Si te refieres a la Adelita del corrido mexicano, no sé.- Pero la canción es muy linda, es alegre, tiene algo que la identifica  con una parte de la cultura mexicana que a todos nos gusta.- Un abrazo, desde uruguay.- Ad′más, si no existió, no importa.- La canción la creó y la mantiene viva.-|`|jm6bt1slaa	Si claro... esta en los libros de historia...  no se habla mucho de ella pero si se meciona|`|C3GDD0fVaa	?Si!<br>  <br>  Aunque no se refería en particular a una mujer que se llamara Adelita sino a todas aquellas mujeres que acompa?aron a la Revolución y junto con sus hombres (revolucionarios todos) cargaron armas, combatieron, hicieron comida y por supuesto.<br>  <br>  Las Adelitas fueron compa?eras en todos los sentidos de la palabra.<br>  <br>  Las Adelitas, figuras míticas, un tanto contrarias a la mujer mexicana del siglo XIX, valientes y obstinadas.

c2a333a88677786dd4e3c1495c05c22faa	I would suggest you go to your local library and look at the Poetry Writer's Market book. It will outline publishing companies and  what type of poetry they are looking for. Another good source is to check out Writer's Digest magazine; often they have information about publishers listed in it. If you've got a good regional bookstore, go there and check books on poetry writing and the same thing with periodicals. If you happen to be in a town with a college, you might talk to someone in the English Department also about how to get published. Breaking into the business is difficult, but if you don't keep trying, you won't ever make it. I wish you much success in your quest!|`|430c416d99e85d4052a9423e2dbcbaf1aa	I'm in the same situation. What I used is the magical book of Poet's Market (get the latest edition; this year's edition will be 2007). It has a list of probably hundreds of different publishers, from small chapbooks to online publishers, to large book publishers. They're also categorized into genres and states for your convenience. Poet's Market is the best place to start in my opinion.|`|AA10114813	The site <a href="http://www.iuniverse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iuniverse.com/</a> is for self publishing with a FEE.

And forget those so-called "free" online publishers.  These are cheesy and again, just appeal to your vanity.  Don't waste your time.  Anyway, no one really publishes poetry today other than vanity presses, as there is not much call for it.  If you are well known in the field (or EXTREMELY talented), you might have a book (chapbook) of poetry published but that is EXTREMELY rare, and only done through very small publishing houses.  There is simply not the monetary return for poetry books.  And believe me, really GOOD poetry is difficult to write and you need a flair for it.  I am not talking about verse or trite poetry, but really good stuff that is unique and shows a knowledge of your craft. I would suggest you turn to another style of writing.
fb735ba79376725108c611b12d935f0faa	Well, probably would start off with a large cardboard box (big enough so that I could fit it over me comfortably) and get it roughly into the shape of a monster truck making sure that there is a hole in the top and the bottom so that it will fit over my body(you could use rope or whatever so that it can hang on your shoulders). I then would get some craft paint and give it a nice and decorative paint job. As far as wheels you could just cut out circles and paint them black, though personally I'd try to find some of those long balloons, in black, and blow those up and attach them to my cardboard rims in circular fashion. Then I'd dress the top half of me as a race car driver and the bottom half in either solid black or brown.<br>  <br>  Now I'm ready for some car crushing! :)|`|d66456de08a63c0838a382b8daf1e801aa	I am thinking cardboard.....

azhmnAhzaa	frustrated and lesbian|`|4f6bfbb68b28201f75fa2be71c4271c8aa	Having not quite reached her fourteenth birthday, Juliet is of an age that stands on the border between immaturity and maturity. At the play’s beginning however she seems merely an obedient, sheltered, na?ve child. Though many girls her age—including her mother—get married, Juliet has not given the subject any thought. When Lady Capulet mentions Paris’s interest in marrying Juliet, Juliet dutifully responds that she will try to see if she can love him, a response that seems childish in its obedience and in its immature conception of love. Juliet seems to have no friends her own age, and she is not comfortable talking about sex (as seen in her discomfort when the Nurse goes on and on about a sexual joke at Juliet’s expense in Act I, scene iii).<br>  Juliet gives glimpses of her determination, strength, and sober-mindedness, in her earliest scenes, and offers a preview of the woman she will become during the five-day span of Romeo and Juliet. While Lady Capulet proves unable to quiet the Nurse, Juliet succeeds with one word (also in Act I, scene iii). In addition, even in Juliet’s dutiful acquiescence to try to love Paris, there is some seed of steely determination. Juliet promises to consider Paris as a possible husband to the precise degree her mother desires. While an outward show of obedience, such a statement can also be read as a refusal through passivity. Juliet will accede to her mother’s wishes, but she will not go out of her way to fall in love with Paris.<br>  Juliet’s first meeting with Romeo propels her full-force toward adulthood. Though profoundly in love with him, Juliet is able to see and criticize Romeo’s rash decisions and his tendency to romanticize things. After Romeo kills Tybalt and is banished, Juliet does not follow him blindly. She makes a logical and heartfelt decision that her loyalty and love for Romeo must be her guiding priorities. Essentially, Juliet cuts herself loose from her prior social moorings—her Nurse, her parents, and her social position in Verona—in order to try to reunite with Romeo. When she wakes in the tomb to find Romeo dead, she does not kill herself out of feminine weakness, but rather out of an intensity of love, just as Romeo did. Juliet’s suicide actually requires more nerve than Romeo’s: while he swallows poison, she stabs herself through the heart with a dagger.<br>  Juliet’s development from a wide-eyed girl into a self-assured, loyal, and capable woman is one of Shakespeare’s early triumphs of characterization. It also marks one of his most confident and rounded treatments of a female character.<br>  <br>  The Nurse - Juliet’s nurse, the woman who breast-fed Juliet when she was a baby and has cared for Juliet her entire life. A vulgar, long-winded, and sentimental character, the Nurse provides comic relief with her frequently inappropriate remarks and speeches. But, until a disagreement near the play’s end, the Nurse is Juliet’s faithful confidante and loyal intermediary in Juliet’s affair with Romeo. She provides a contrast with Juliet, given that her view of love is earthy and sexual, whereas Juliet is idealistic and intense. The Nurse believes in love and wants Juliet to have a nice-looking husband, but the idea that Juliet would want to sacrifice herself for love is incomprehensible to her.|`|46dda03855de9e690f0e8b65411b3dccaa	well first of all the nurse was more of a mother than juliets real mother, they seemed to get along really well. she would always give her advice and she would always try to protect and look out for juliet.|`|Z8tYVvsVaa	I feel that the nurse cared a lot about Juliet and was like a second mother to her.  They had a very good relationship and she tried to help her with Romeo.
c41f9c51909d6b0b093522c5a7b5a912aa	Lincoln was reluctant to issue an Emancipation Proclamation but you would have thought from what one is taught in class these days this was his primary concern.  He issued the proclamation to save the Union making impossible for foreign Governments to intervene on behalf of the Confederacy.  Even though the English supported (indirectly) slavery, they like other countries were officially against the practice.  By his actions, Lincoln was showing the US was against slavery but not the Confederacy.  If like the leaders of these countries at the time, you took the time to read and study the act you would see it does nothing and in fact, Lincoln thought that the Afro American was not the equal of whites and his plan was to resettle the slaves in either the Amazon or Western Texas.<br>  <br>  Most people are not aware that there was a series of action and even proclamations for instance Lincolns correspondence of October 14, 1862 to the military and civilian authorities of occupied Louisiana.<br>  <br>     “Major General Butler, Governor Shepley, & and [sic] all having military and naval authority under the United States within the S[t]ate of Louisiana.  The bearer of this, Hon. John E. Bouligny, a citizen of Louisiana, goes to the State seeking to have such of the people thereof as desire to avoid the unsatisfactory prospect before them, and to have peace again upon the old terms under the constitution of the United States, to manifest such desire by elections of members to the Congress of the United States particularly, and perhaps a legislature, State officers, and United States Senators friendly to their object.  I shall be glad for you and each of you, to aid him and all others acting for this object, as much as possible.  In all available ways, give the people a chance to express their wishes at these elections.  Follow forms of law as far as convenient, but at all events get the expression of the largest number of the people possible.  All see how such action will connect with, and affect the proclamation of September 22nd.  Of course, the men elected should be gentlemen of character willing to swear support to the Constitution, as of old, and known to be above reasonable suspicion of duplicity.  (CW 5:462-3, italics added).<br>  <br>  NOTE: The italic show that Lincoln rather then issue an Emancipation Proclamation or free the slaves was still willing to allow the Southern States back into the Union.  One will find this all the way up to the 1865 visit to Camp Lookout.<br>  <br>  At the same time Lincoln was issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he was petitioning his cabinet to negotiate and appropriate funds to force the Blacks else where.<br>  <br>  You asked when he announced it, here it is along with the preliminary proclamation and the actual signing.<br>  <br>  In July 1862, Lincoln read a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his Cabinet. Secretary of State William Seward suggested that Lincoln wait to issue it until after the Union victory, so that it would not sound like the last desperate act of a losing government. Lincoln agreed, and waited for his generals to win a battle.<br>  <br>  The battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862, was the bloodiest single day of the war. Robert E. Lee’s Confederate army retreated after the battle, allowing Union general George B. McClellan to claim victory. Five days later, on September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.<br>  <br>  The preliminary Proclamation announced that slaves in rebel states not under Union control would become free on January 1, 1863. Lincoln thus gave the Southern states one last chance to end the war before losing their slaves, which they did not accept. The Proclamation did not affect slaves in the Union states; Lincoln still needed the allegiance of the border states in order to win the war. It was clear to all, however, that slavery would not long survive anywhere once the Proclamation took effect.<br>  <br>  On January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the final Emancipation Proclamation. <br>  <br>   In 1864, Jeff Davis and other Southerner leaders would contemplate outlawing slavery and probably would have if the opportunity had arisen.<br>  <br>  God Bless You and The Southern People.|`|AA12200754	1863<br>  <br>  Emancipation Proclamation, September 22, 1863<br>   <br>  <br>  While Lincoln is known for many things, such as guiding the nation through four years of war, the Gettysburg Address, and the famous debates with Stephen Douglas, perhaps his most crowning achievement was the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.<br>  At the beginning of the war Lincoln had one singular goal: to preserve the Union. Slavery was a secondary issue, with the President fearing that some or all of the border states (Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri) may also secede if he made any move to free slaves.<br>  <br>  In July, 1862 Lincoln proposed to his cabinet that all slaves in the rebellious states be set free. Secretary of State William Seward convinced him to wait until a better time. The Union had been taking a beating at the hands of the Confederacy, and Seward reasoned that changing the thrust of the Union's goals from preservation of the Union to freeing slaves would have little impact.<br>  <br>  Lincoln writing the Emancipation Proclamation<br>  <br>  The Emancipation Proclamation had limitations, to be sure. It only freed slaves in the rebellious states, and even exempted those parts of the Confederacy which were already under Union control. Perhaps most importantly, unless the Union won the war,the proclamation would be worthless. It had immediate impact politically, however. The war was now about freeing slaves, transforming the entire focus. Countries such as England and France, considering aiding the Confederacy, now took a second look. Rejoining the Union was one thing, but now the war had a moral tone. Without the assistance of the European powers, the Confederacy was doomed to carrying on the battle alone.<br>  <br>  The Emancipation Proclamation also declared that " . . . persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States . . . " Nearly 200,000 black soldiers and sailors would fight for the Union before the war was over, with several being awarded the Medal of Honor. <br>  <br>  For many years the Emancipation Proclamation was kept bound into a large volume with other proclamations and maintained by the Department of State. At some point the number 95, signifying the number of the proclamation, was written on the top right corner in red ink. <br>  <br>  The original of the Emancipation Proclamation, consisting of five pages tied together with red and blue ribbons, is now housed in the National Archives, having been transferred from the Department of State in 1936. The pages are fragile, the ink fading. The condition is so delicate that it is only placed on public display on special occasions. Despite its condition, the Emancipation Proclamation occupies a lofty position among the greatest documents in history.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Emancipation Statue in Washington, DC<br>  Following is the full text of the Emancipation Proclamation.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the President of the United States of America:<br>  <br>  A Proclamation.<br>  <br>  Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:<br>  <br>  "That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.<br>  <br>  "That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States."<br>  <br>  atp|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	sometime this week, all I know is that I don't think that those slaves should be freed, my slaves definitely won't be.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nah, I am just joking didn't mean to offend, I really don't know.

a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	Mohandas Gandhi did many significant things in his life. He led many strikes and was arrested many times. He changed laws by going on food strikes until the British changed the law he wanted. In 1930 Gandhi led a strike on salt. After 10 years of limited compromise and repression by the British. Gandhi decided to lead a 24-day march to the sea to protest the British monopoly on salt. Soon millions around the country began to ignore the law banning home made salt. Gandhi was soon arrested as he so often was. On April 16, 1919 Gandhi lead another strike that lead all stores, shops, factories, offices, farms, railways, and 300 million people in India to a screeching halt.<br>  After such a long time the British finally gave in granting India their independence.<br>  <br>  Gandhi had many interests, but his favorite thing to do was spin.

He walked on foot to villages in rural India & instilled the fervour & passion of 'freedom' in the heart of the masses. <br>  <br>  According to Gandhi-ji (as he is respectfully referred to), the poor, rural India was the 'real' India.

It left millions dead and shaped the modern world.<br>  <br>  The Allied Powers, led by France, Russia, the British Empire, and later, Italy and the United States, defeated the Central Powers, led by Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire.<br>  <br>  Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the Western Front, within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by an unoccupied space between the trenches called "no man's land") running from the North Sea to the border of Switzerland. On the Eastern Front, the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large. Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and — for the first time — from the air. More than nine million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and millions of civilians perished.<br>  <br>  The war caused the disintegration of four empires: the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian. Germany lost its overseas empire, and new states such as Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Yugoslavia were created, and in the cases of Lithuania and Poland, recreated.<br>  <br>  World War I created a decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the Napoleonic Wars, which was modified by the mid-19th century’s nationalistic revolutions. The outcomes of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II 21 years later.<br>  <br>  On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb student, shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie Chotek, in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, which had been annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908. Princip was a member of Young Bosnia, a group whose aims included the unification of the South Slavs and independence from Austria-Hungary (see also: the Black Hand). The assassination in Sarajevo set into motion a series of fast-moving events that escalated into a full-scale war. Austria-Hungary demanded certain actions by Serbia to punish those responsible for the assassination. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia when it was deemed that Serbia had failed to fully comply. Many major European powers came to be at war with each other within a matter of weeks. This was due to overlapping agreements for collective defense and the complex nature of international alliances at that time. However, the conflict also had deeper causes which were multiple and complex.|`|HbFdXvMZaa	It finalized the reshaping the world in a political sense by dividing the east from the west.

olvidado.<br>  Traté de escribir un cuento y me salió un dibujo…<br>  Traté de volar y descubrí que estoy plantado, que soy un árbol muy fuerte.<br>  Quería estar melancólico y triste para escribir un poema, pero la felicidad de mi alma me hizo cantar…<br>  Quería mirar televisión, tenía mas de 100 canales para escoger, pero no había nada que ver… salí a caminar y te conocí a ti<br>  Quise mojarme en la lluvia, pero la luz del sol me quemó la cara<br>  Quise dorarme al sol, y el frío de la lluvia hizo que nos abrazáramos<br>  Traté de huir, pero te quedaste dormida frente a la puerta y no quise despertarte.<br>  Quería quedarme adentro contigo, pero cuando no veías me asomé a la ventana… caí al jardín y la brisa fresca del día me arropó.<br>  Quise odiar tu silencio, pero recordé que no hablabas porque estabas dormida frente a la puerta.<br>  Traté de hacer un dibujo, pero me salió este escrito... definitivamente nada me sale como yo quiero… pero todo me sale bien.<br>  <br>  OTRO<br>  <br>  Me pregunto por qué te empiezo a querer? y mi respuesta se aloja en tu sinceridad. <br>  Me has hecho llorar pensando en el susurro de tu voz cuando me dijiste que me quieres... <br>  Sí, princesa, estoy dispuesto a aprender a quererte... tan sólo tienes que venir aquí, mirarme y decirme algo así como te quiero. <br>  Y después... todas las noches serán besables y amables... y tus manos serán las mías, como esta tarde... y lloraremos juntos para después mirarnos y sonreír.|`|jm6bt1slaa	"DICES QUE TIENES CORAZóN,<br>  Y SOLO LO DICES POR QUE LO SIENTES,<br>  ESO NO ES

If it is done to an affected and suffering person it is counted as a virtue and if it is done to please a wrong doer it is an act of cowardliness and a sin and you are considered to be with him in wrong doing.|`|tGZd6ef0aa	appeasement means someone pleases another to avoid conflict, passify would be another way to say it.......it was cowardly because the allies chose to appease hitler rather than ruffle his feathers by confronting him over the genocide of the jews.........eventually appeasement was gone........hitler invaded european countries starting in 1931 and it took the us getting bombed by the japanese before they showed any public interest in the war in europe...............i suppose they would have let hitler run wild -- no one wanted to face him, so he fueled the fire himself, then all appeasement was gone

( ? ) <br>  <br>  Finalmente se le da la puntilla, con la intención de seccionar la médula espinal, lo que provoca la inmovilidad del animal pero continuando consciente de lo que ocurre mientras agoniza. En muchos de los casos se les destaza (descuartiza) aun vivos. <br>  <br>  ???POR FAVOR!!!, no acudas a estos ritos ancestrales, macabros donde se tortura a un animal y menos con ni?os.

4rno1KEDaa	Bobby Pendragon by D.J. Machale<br>  Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer( my ID actually, love the series)<br>  Faerie Wars by Herbie Brennan<br>  <br>  Well and a few others but as I am French, they are in french so oh well.|`|DLXg1gJRaa	How about the The Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper, the Young Wizards series (So You Want to be a Wizard... is the first) by Diane Duane, the Pit Dragon Trilogy by Jane Yolan, and Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C. Wrede.  The Pit Dragon series is my favorite of the four.  I also definately recommend Tamora Pierce's books so don't put those off too much longer.  <br>  <br>  As an afterthought, there's also Just Ella by Haddix, The Squire's Tale and other stories by Gerald Morris, and the series beginning with Of Two Minds by Matas and Nodelman.  Those three are as good as the Pit Dragon series in my opinion.|`|VnANJK0vaa	Wow! Is there any book u HAVEN'T read?|`|1e7fb0af90965b6ded6e6b1133daa408aa	Based on your previous book list, you must try the following series:<br>  <br>  1. Tales of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin<br>  2. Dark is Rising Sequence by Susan Cooper<br>  3. Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen by Garth Nix<br>  <br>  Absolutes for fantasy lovers. :)|`|5VCelql2aa	there are two fantasy line of books that made me love fantasy fiction!<br>  <br>  the first is the  Seventh tower series (there are seven small paperback books).......it can be read very fast!<br>  <br>  the second is Redwall series (they have like 13 to 15 books)<br>  its a series that streches ur imagination!......look on the net (they have an official wbsite.......i think its redwall.com...) and find which redwall book to read first so u can have a good start!.............enjoy!|`|BimP4u8Zaa	Wow. You must be a really avid reader.... You should check out Jim Butcher's Codex Alera Series. I love it and so does my kid sister. Also Lorna Freeman's Borderlands series.<br>  <br>  I second the Patricia C Wrede and Susan Cooper recommendations. I cut my teeth on those books and I was hooked from the start.<br>  <br>  Another interesting read is Diane Wynne Jones. Her Wizard's Castle Series is pure fun. Another author you should take a look at is Terry Pratchett. His Discworld books will make you rotfl.<br>  <br>  Then there's Peter Beagle's Last Unicorn. It's considered a fantasy classic. <br>  <br>  Roger Zelazny's Amber Chronicles. Those books rock.<br>  <br>  Ilona Andrews' Magic Bites. That's Urban Fantasy of a sort I guess.<br>  <br>  Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson books are more in the same genre.<br>  <br>  Karen Chance's Cassandra Palmer Books are good too.<br>  <br>  Raymond Feist's Riftwar books are engrossing. I especially loved "Daughter Of The Empire".<br>  <br>  The "Recluce" books are kinda philosophical I guess but interesting reads if a bit dry.<br>  <br>  Alice Borchardt is one of my favorite authors. I dunno if I've spelt the name right though... She's Anne Rice's sister but you can't see any hint of similarity in their writing styles. I don't like Anne Rice that much but I love Alice Borchardt. Might be a bit too vivid for you though. It's not exactly YA reading material. Got too much Sex n Violence in it... Not gratuitous though.<br>  <br>  Kelley Armstrong's "Women of the Otherworld" Series is a bit more graphic than any of the other books I've suggested. So choose with caution.<br>  <br>  Another of my favorites is David Weber. His Honor Harrington Series is just too good. N if you like "Fantasy" you should check out his Bahzell books. I cant wait for the next to come out. It might be considered "Not Christian" though cos it's set on a planet with a whole new theological system n some of the statements made by the Gods in the book make it sound like they r the true Gods and ppl jus call them by different names or somethin.<br>  <br>  Then there's David Eddings. His Belgariad and Malloreon Series are pretty good but his later books are just altered and weaker clones of his earlier ones.<br>  <br>  And finally, Mercedes Lackey. I like almost all her books from the old "Diana Tregarde" books to her latest "Fairy Godmother" Series. I suggest you read her collaborative "Heirs of Alexandria" Series. But you should take a look at book summaries and make your choice. Some of those books aren't to everyone's taste.|`|ECKveaZOaa	Try the "Sword of Shanara" series (over 20 books, but it's split into trilogies) by Terry Brooks if you're into the whole Elf/dwarf/human/troll type thing.<br>  <br>  But if you're more interested in a human/magic/real world genre, try reading "Running with the Demon" and the rest of it's trilogy by Terry Brooks. It's fantasy that takes place in the United States, and has amazing plot lines.|`|c615503653fda7362c6d8da1de96fcf2aa	You might like Ursula K. LeGuin and her "Tales from Earthsea."

I really enjoyed her Crystal Singer trilogy and would highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  John Wyndham is also wonderful. Try 'The Trouble With Lichen' very thought provoking and a great read.<br>  <br>  Charlaine Harris writes the really fun 'Southern Vampire' series; a blend of fantasy/humour/romance/horror. They really are great fun!|`|g8DlSpmmaa	these aren't really fantasy, but very good books:<br>  <br>  -rhymes with witches (sort of fantasy)<br>  - feeling sorry for celia<br>  - the year of the secret assignments<br>  - the murder of bindy mackenzie<br>  <br>  :]|`|p31UMVyEaa	Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King is a fun book...very fairy tales-ish, but still has elements of Horror.

Se nos dijo hace mucho tiempo que el género humano fue castigado porque sus primeros padres comieron una fruta sabrosa, fruta prohibida; una manzana, creen algunos, y de ahí que muchos en Hispanoamérica, inspirados en la expresión inglesa  Adam's apple, designen como manzana la "nuez" de los hombres. También las nueces se comen, y se atragantan. ?Y aquella Manzana de la Discordia!.<br>  Paris fue el encargado de adjudicar la "manzana de oro" a la más bella de las diosas que ante él desfilaban desnudas. Juno le prometió al juez un reino; Minerva, gloria militar; Venus le prometió amor y pasión; fue ésta quien se llevó el premio.<br>  Fuera manzana la fruta prohibida, fueran dulces uvas, creía el pueblo de Israel, y se hizo creer a toda nuestra civilización, que el efecto de la ingestión de esa fruta fue lamentabilísimo para toda la humanidad. De ahí procedió el pecado original de herencia universal. De la masticación de esa fruta de Adán,  procedía esa dentera con que todos sus hijos nacían. Ese comer de Adán y Eva fue una acción tan reprobable y nefanda que, tras la comida, se les "abrieron sus ojos y, viendo que estaban desnudos, cosieron unas hojas de higuera y se hicieron unos cinturones" (Gén 3, 7).|`|4ce2f4a6739f2caff7c931925ddc4667aa	la fruta prohibida fue la manzana, recuerdas la historia de adan y eva<br>  |<br>  ||`|65a6554a829ff27a9e378722148ecdc7aa	No creo que sea el aguacate, tenemos que pensar que en el lugar donde se cree que estuvo el edén, en la confluencia del rió Tigris y el eufrates, que frutos podría haber o hay hoy en día.<br>  También te cuento que por algunos estudios que he realizado por mi cuenta, en el génesis donde figura el tema de la manzana, fue escrito en arameo, idioma muy hablado en esa época, pero donde no hay una palabra para definir a la manzana, fruta que si existe en el mencionado lugar, es mas no hay ninguna palabra para definir a ninguna especie de fruta, a todas se las llama igual.<br>  Por lo tanto, el profeta que escribió el génesis, escribió fruta y no manzana, el problema esta en las traducciones e interpretaciones posteriores realizadas a las sagradas escrituras donde cambiaron fruta por manzana, estas traducciones e interpretaciones difieren bastante de los textos originales.<br>  Igual esto carece de sentido, ya que el tema de la fruta es solo simbolico, metaforico, como esta escrito todo el evangelio.|`|6BdWe8ZCaa	perdon pero la manzana esta en todos los paises no tendria mas sentido que fuera la manzana|`|Av69AGo9aa	otra razon para que aumenten tus sospechas:<br>  la palabra aguacate viene del nahuatl "ahuacatl" que significa "testiculo" <br>  ami me gusta el guacamole|`|TnY3akHNaa	no se si estara prohibida, no se puede determinar hasta que se ubique al jardin del eden|`|iMIfp6Xfaa	en realidad no lo sé.<br>  hay quien dice que era el damasco.<br>  da igual. lo que fuera seguro que estaba buenísimo porque todo lo prohibido es deseable|`|qLbloAgPaa	la fruta prohibida era la manzana no el aguacate, el aguacate es la palta.|`|wmBXpOrPaa	Espero que te sirva de ayuda, saludos<br>  <br>  La palabra aguacate viene del náhuatl ahuácatl, lo que también significa testículos.

Also Fredricksburg and Bull Run were also a big turning point of the civil war!|`|tGZd6ef0aa	sure it was a turning point for the entire u s but i would not say it was "the" turning point in the war......they are the union troops seizing the mississippi river at the outlet, vickburg, the blockade of all confederate sea lines, the battle at shiloh, and antietem, however economics was the reason the confederates surrendered to the union|`|872d5e7c115978540052b672e4c757e4aa	Yes.|`|319e672bb7d1fc4c106452bf653d4115aa	First dude is right on.<br>  <br>  Gettysburg decided nothing except when Lee's 2nd Invasion would end.<br>  <br>  Vicksburg, which fell at the same time as Gettysburg was taking place, was THE turning point of the war.<br>  <br>  What it did was separate the rest of the Confederacy from their only non-blockaded ports (for a reason I have yet to fathom, the blockade did not cover much of Texas) and cut off their access to the Mississippi River system- not just the Mississippi itself but all of its tributaries north of Vicksburg as well.<br>  <br>  After this point, the Confederates will never have enough supplies to conduct proper operations and the rebel armies will eventually whither and die.|`|5890d2376c393292b88b2d9e0c4d40ebaa	Absolutely.

It was the beginning of the end<br>  <br>  While the Union had victories in the west before this, this was the first loss for the ANV (Army of Northern Virginia)|`|UXcElwSiaa	It was the first battle since the beginning of the war where General Lee took the offensive. If the South won the battle in Gettysburg they would continue on going North, as well towards the capitol. But with the North winning in Gettysburg, it sent the Confederates packing back to the South where it became a defensive battle from then on for General Lee and his troops. Basically it was General Lee's last big attempt. It really decided if the South could win or not. Upon losing that battle it was the beginning of the end for the South. From then on it was defending their land from the inevitable win for the North. (Granted those who grow up in the North hear it one way and those who hear is in the South hear it another. Ever war/story has two sides to it.)
AA10736802	You don’t say, but I looked at your profile and assume that you are asking about Singapore.<br>  <br>  From the way that you phrase your question, it seems that you may think that the Japanese occupiers intended to be helpful to the people of Singapore.  That wasn’t true.  Despite being fellow Asians, despite the propaganda about the “Co-Prosperity Sphere”, the Japanese behaved very badly to the people of Singapore.  Their only objective was to exploit Singapore to provide maximum benefit to Japan.  They were much more brutal than the British had ever been.  They ruled by terror.  <br>  <br>  Here is a quote from the Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew:<br>  “During the 3? years of the Occupation, whenever I encountered some Japanese tormenting, beating or ill-treating one of our people, I wished the British were still in charge.  As fellow Asiatics, we were disillusioned; but then the Japanese themselves were ashamed to be identified with their fellow Asiatics, whom they considered racially inferior and of a lower order of civilizaion.”<br>  <br>  Talking about Japanese propaganda, here is what Aisha Bee has to say:<br>  “We listened to all these promises with interest but without real hope, unsure of where our next meal was coming from.  Our friends were disappearing one by one, and despite promises of a better life, we had no reason to believe that it would ever materialize.”<br>  <br>  As time passed, food became more and more scarce.  The Japanese were unable to organize a sufficient food supply for Singapore, because Allied submarines sank so many of their cargo ships that could have carried rice and other food to Singapore. <br>    <br>  The people had to queue for everything.  Whenever a queue began to form in front of a shop, people would rush to join it.  It did not matter what was being sold, whether it was cigarettes, coffee, sugar, salt, fish or ragi: whatever it was, even if you did not want it for yourself, it had a value that you could use to trade for food.  Read about Geoffrey Tan’s recollections of queuing at link [1] below.  <br>  <br>  Prices for everything soared every day, and the Japanese made no attempt at all to try to control the situation.  In fact, many of the Japanese were heavily involved in the Black Market, making huge profits for themselves.<br>  <br>  Read the interview at link [2] below for the experiences of a fishing family.  How they had to hide (because otherwise they would have been killed) whenever the Japanese came to their village. <br>  <br>  More and more it became essential for the people of Singapore to supply their own food, by growing crops on every little scrap of land; by keeping chickens; and by fishing.  The Japanese encouraged this with their “Grow More Food” campaign.  But fishing became more and more restricted, because the Japanese feared that the local fishermen were helping Allied spies and saboteurs to land near Singapore.<br>  <br>  Finally, read the oral history recollections of Wak Mah at link [3] below.

140c0f1b332de295f8a3563c23af4fadaa	Alex Spider.  Martin Lutero se expreso asi con respecto a la iglesia catolica. No es mucho lo que tengo que decir... Tienen ojos, pero no ven, tienen oidos pero no oyen, tienes boca pero no hablan, tienen pies pero no caminan... <br>  Solo conosco 4 Evangelios y  son suficientes para conocer la obra del Se?or Jesucristo en la tierra, su autoridad, <br>  su poder, su mision exitosa.  Ahora NO creo que Dios se contradiga tanto, Los estigmas muestran que si me hacerco a Dios mayor es mi tormento... Pero Dios dice: Venid a mi los trabajados y cansados, porque Yo os hare descansar... <br>  La santidad no tiene nada que ver con la virginidad carnal <br>  sino espiritual de un ser, O eres de DIOS o eres del diablo <br>  O pones por obra la palabra de Dios o la tergiversas como <br>  el diablo... recuerden la tentacion de Jesus en el desierto... satan inspira falsas doctrinas ya que conoce el reino de Dios (de haya se callo)... Entonces, solo hay que entregarse a Jesucristo y no a la Iglesia... Porque el Se?or te hara su templo posando su espiritu Santo quien nos llevara a toda verdad y toda justicia... y la "iglesia" institucion creada por el hombre, quien todavia adora al hombre solo ha errado...<br>  El luteranismo o Iglesia Luterana es el movimiento religioso cristiano protestante (protestar contra lo que lo que consideraban erróneo en lo que estaba establecido) fundada institucionalmente por el monje alemán Martín Lutero (1483-1546). El luteranismo cree en Jesucristo como su fundador espiritual, Dios uno y trino (Santa Trinidad), es decir: Dios Padre, Dios Hijo y Dios Espíritu Santo. La certidumbre bíblica que tuvo de que Dios no nos juzga por nuestras obras buenas, sino más bien por nuestra fe, proporciona a Lutero la base fundamental de su pensamiento.  El pensamiento de Lutero se basa en el concepto de justificación por la fe, que negaba toda teoría romana sobre los méritos de la salvación, la mediación de los santos y el culto de las imágenes. Denunció la venta de indulgencias y la obtención de los perdones a cambio de bienes, así como la venta de cargos eclesiásticos.  El luteranismo rechaza la primacía y autoridad romana del Papado. Niega la tradición dogmática de la existencia del purgatorio. El movimiento protestante iniciado por Lutero afirma el valor único de las Escrituras y la supremacía de la fe en Jesucristo. Lutero desarrolla la doctrina del Sacerdocio Universal, en donde afirma que las Escrituras son inteligibles para todos los creyentes y que cada uno, libremente, puede examinarlas.

ZOifSvNhaa	Yes! You can see all sorts of examples talk to photographers and exif datashows you the settings used by digital photographers so you have a lot more information to base your trial and error efforts upon to develop a technique or style. It also helps you not to get pigeon holed into doing what ever kind of photography that is trendy at the time since you have somany examples you have thousands of teachers to build your style upon|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	the web has helped me: the on line tutorials, and i've met some really sharp shooters on the web.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	No! It speeds nothing up. Gotta get out take photos. Make mistakes? Fine learn from them. With $600- you just can't say order me up a basic DSLR and expect not to make numerous mistakes. Too many people I feel get the idea that so many people are recommending this specific camera that I'll go ahead and buy it and all of my shots will look professional.    So, it's getting out there and doing it by which you'll learn. One can't learn lighting from a computer.|`|2f3f9068d7f4d4acd330c2510f225b40aa	I do. I've been trying to teach myself through online materials and of course old fashioned trial and error.|`|dbfb8185661f046a9017398b63ebcc44aa	Interesting question !  I'm not sure that it can actually speed the learning  process.  It does make information more available but an individual can only learn at a certain speed, each individual being different.  Now saying that I think what the web has sped up is the amount and quality of photographers as not only learning tools are readily available but it has also increased the availability of equipment.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	The quickest way to learn photography is by doing it with a good tutor right there with you, particularly for getting the basics. You'll learn more in one day than in months of trying to sort it all out on the web.  Remote learning is no better than book learning here.    Once you have the basics and are comfortable with your camera then expanding on your knowledge and introducing you to new techniques is something the web can do very well.    Chris|`|FeUmyxqqaa	yes i do, to a point, i do still believe live humans that you can ask questions and can show you things hands on are the best, i do use the net as a resource quite a bit, all options should be used i think    i still believe in hands on teaching like a tutor and the classroom as the best learning source,|`|dai4nP0yaa	I figure it does, but perhaps not as much as people think. If you have anything approaching a decent library in your neighborhood, or had one in the last 30-40 years nearly all the photography information (especially stuff like positioning subjects, lighting, the harsh realities working photographers face and how to find models for you experimental portraiture) is pretty much the same as you find on the web and often much better explained and better illustrated (probably owing to the fact that editors have to go over it and make sure it's reasonable enough to sell). Most of the technical information (both the machine stuff like film-types and camera mechanisms, and the art stuff like lighting) is pretty well covered in older print editions. Sad to say there seems to be a lack of publicly available printed info as far as digital photography is concerned. Newer publications about photography seem not to pick up much attention from whoever's in charge of stocking libraries. I think minus the web we would still have alot of this information very readily available and I personally find it more comfortable to read a book written as a technical guide than browsing many web-pages (most of which represent a single (and not necessarily correct view) and aren't even responsible enough to mention that there are other views and methods to achieve the same effects. And don't get me started on the forums where everyone imagines their opinion outweighs anyone else's.    On the other hand the web facilitates a lot of other things that influence the speed at which we learn and some of these would not be possible without the web. A couple of examples are;    The sheer amount of interactivity and user feedback offered by the web means that you're quite likely to find a number of alternative methods, options and solutions for all kinds of situations.     The extent to which users are involved also means a very rapid and healthy exchange of ideas (and copyright violation but...), minus the web you often know at most 5-6 other photographers well enough to have long serious discussions about photography with them, often you'll see maybe 3-4 of those on a reasonably regular basis and the rest once in a long while. The result is the amount of stimulation, ideas, advice and abuse (even that can be positive provided it doesn't get too personal) you receive from people who understand photography is rather limited, with the web, well the possibilities are limited only by the number of photographers on the internet.    For info on digital photography and processing, nothing beats the web. Yes I know many books that have very useful info and are easier to read that browsing the web, but they also usually take more than 5 minutes to read when you want to learn to achieve a specific goal or effect, and none is as up to the minute as the web. We can learn all the quirks of photoshop, we can study all the algorithms used and understand exactly how they work, but ultimately we simply want to get the end result and there's no faster way to do that than open a new tab and type google.com     Also the quantity of images displayed on the web is in my opinion very useful, admittedly alot of it is horrible, most of it is mediocre (but I have no problem with mediocre it's the horrible that hurt) and some of it is fantastic. The point is people are exposed to a much wider range of other people's photographs in a wider range of styles than anywhere else. And we learn just as much from others mistakes as we do from our own.    Finally my "webfriends" can generally give honest comments about my photography without any fear that they may be denied beer, coffee, tea, (enter_your_personal_beverage_of_choice) at my house since they have never been and often don't plan to.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	I believe it can - IF people actually read the innumerable on-line tutorials available and then use them.|`|AA12323486	It sure does!  Now you can get other people to do all the learning for you.|`|k8AcVixTaa	No.  The only way to truly learn is to be out taking the photos and learning from your mistakes.  The web is good pointing out mistakes or exposes the photographer to a higher level of criticism but that is as far as it goes.  Real world is the best teacher of all.

Pero rápidamente comprende que una rata culta es una rata solitaria. Marginada de su familia, busca la amistad de su héroe, el librero, y de un escritor de ciencia ficción fracasado.

m1oEGlnmaa	You know, I read about this in Psychology. Listen to this scenerio: There were two groups. Group A is hooked up and everytime they do something, Group B will push a button to give them a shock. Now the shocks started out little and not as much, but as it progressed so did the shocks. Group B was STILL shocking the people, even though the people in Group A were screaming. They did what they were told. What's ironic about the whole thing is that Hitler gets most of the blame, as though he himself hadn't killed a single person (order, yes. But personally put a gun to someone's head and fired? No). It was also Himmler who took control of the Concentration camps and respoinsible for the extermination of thousands of Jews, etc. I, personally, think he was worst then Hitler. It's not just black and white. It's really all a gray area. Hitler became in favor with the German people because 1. He promised to end their Depression. In which he did come through. He gave the people jobs, gave them food. In return, they listened to him. But there was some people who did question, but they're often overshadowed.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Other countries have had soldiers who do evil things, people are brainwashed in the military to take commands no matter what.

My grandmother, for instance, used to know a German aristocrat from Prussia in the time short before the war. Back in 1938 he was already deeply convinced that Germany would start a massive war soon and that Germany would surely loose it. Still, he was a German aristocrat and duty was more important to him than anything else! So no, he did not rebel or anything like that. In fact he followed all his orders to the letter and that against his better judgement simply because he believed that obedience was more important than victory or even his own or his country's survival. That was the way how he was brought up and that was the way how he lived.    Be that as it may, I also think that it is very important to persecute such people after all! I do not necessarily condemn them on a personal level, but their persecution sends an important message to everybody who admire this way of life. Besides, what about their victims? Dont they deserve the feeling that people/the legal system acknowledge(s) the fact that their suffering was undeserved and simply wrong?|`|77NzfiVkaa	You might be surprised what you would do in the face of almost certain death if you don't obey orders.|`|AA12071655	Read up on the Nuremburg Trials.

If you didn't belong to the Nazi Party you were risking you and your family's lives so I can't blame the Troops too much. They had to follow orders. Some of his Officers were truly Evil whereas some despised Hitler and even tried to assassinate him. Atrocities happen in every War on both sides.  Take the American Civil War for instance. The Union won so they got to write History. Lincoln was a horrible President who started an illegal war that got over 600,000 Americans killed. You've probably heard about the atrocities at Andersonville but never about the worse conditions Confederates faced at Elmira.  US Grant owned Slaves but Robert E. Lee did not. The Confederate Constitution outlawed Slavery.  If the Axis powers had won WWII History would have shown the Allies were the Evil ones and the horrible things Nazis did would have been forgotten.  The USA is the only country to use Atomic Bombs on another country but we won the War so it is all a matter of perspective.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Your Idea of what is "Evil" and what is not begs the question:How can you be so judgmental about things you don't understand.  One thing that you have no Idea about is patriotism  Here is a good example of what it means to be patriotic and follow orders.    I didn't vote for President Obama-I thought he needed more experience. If he came to me and said "Guess what I need you to leave your big house and land and go overseas and kill some people. I know you personally don't have any argument with these people but trust me in the fact that I need you to do this. And, Oh, by the way your more than likely to get killed so get your affairs in order before you leave"    Would I do what he ask me? Of course I would. I would get a gun and some bullets and do "blindly" what I was told. This is what is called "Patriotism"     It was the same way in the Reich so long ago and what you need to remember is "The organizing principal of any-and all society is for war It has been that way ever since our long lost cousins in the Neander river valley started throwing rocks at each other.       s_e_s
ATDi8qLoaa	Existentialism, simply stated, is the study of existence for the individual writ-large. To begin, two general schemes should be viewed that are temporally constructed. Firstly, existence is dually a matter of Being and Becoming; and secondly, Existence precedes Essence. Regarding the former, We perceptually live in a world that is changing as we do through time. However, our perceptions are inadequate to "know" as we would like to in an effort to proceed in life at any given moment--that is Being. This could be the momentary (time span specific) experience of joy, sorrow etc., or it could be a moment(s) of action both mental and physical. Becoming is the state that allows for the understanding of our changing through time. We are always changing, from the different air we breath with each breath to the focus of our consciousness, as time goes by. Therefore, we are being and becoming at once in the present. Regarding the latter, in the real physical world Existence must be realized and accounted for and then over time Essence can then be illuminated. The essence of your life is not preordained, we must exist first and then contemplate essence later on once Becoming over time elicits enough change to recognize the difference in ones life, or in the collective life of the world. World war II was a horrific time in world history with civilians targeted by bombing and Holocaust, and all of that was very difficult to understand.(How could the progress of the Enlightenment lead to such tragedy.) The growth of Existentialism was a response to these difficulties because other philosophical systems did not address the ethical and explanatory dilemmas endemic with those times. Upon viewing the world today, Existentialism is still very important which may be why it is still formally studied. I did not give the complete answer here, however, the nuts and bolts have been presented to contemplate, it takes work. Good Luck|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Basically the world is too confusing to be tied down to any belief. ANY belief. The confusion is the recognition of our indifferent world and it changes us. The reality of anything being the projection of you in relationship to it. Which becomes confusing when our indifferent world changes without us. Resisting that change = conflict.    I threw in the last sentence that might or might not have anything to do with existentialism because I like it.|`|HbtWJPzuaa	i dont think anything on earth matters at all. in the end you will die and all is the same, you are dead. nothing will bother you nothing will satisfy you there is just NOTHING which is ultimately the end and everything|`|1xcfGHCNaa	I'm not too sure, but since no one has answered you yet, ill give it a go.

The people who deny the holocaust ever happened are claiming that the whole situation is a hoax perpetrated on the public to discredit the axis powers after the war, and they have no evidence to prove that point.    I can speak from personal experience.  It definitely happened.  I'm Jewish and am fortunate enough to have relatives who survived the holocaust in a nazi concentration camp.  Six Million (+) others were not so fortunate.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Holocaust deniers point to things like large numbers of displaced people always go missing in wars; the gas chambers have similar designs to showers or normal crematoria; most of the Nazi paperwork talks in careful euphemism (the "final solution" rather than "destruction of the Jews", etc); and they say the death camps were concentration camps where disease epidemics happened to break out, or where food shortages led to starvation due to the allied bombing campaign.  They also say that there was a conspiracy after the war to make Germans look worse than they were, possibly in order to justify the destruction of German cities in bombing raids.

HwTMMVd7aa	It is nearly impossible to say who's fault the deaths of everyone involved really is. Tybalt and Mercutio probably would have died eventually anyway, and if not them, then someone else.You could make a pretty good argument for any of the cast members, I think.  You could say it was Lord Capulet's fault for forcing his young daughter into a marriage with Paris that she had no desire to be apart of because of Romeo. Lord Capulet wasn't thinking of his daughter and her feelings until after her death.  You could blame Romeo for being fickle and going from Rosaline to Juliet without a second thought, and who's to say that he couldn't just drop Juliet in a week's time?  You could blame Juliet for being a young girl easily persuaded by the people around her, and believing that she was so deeply in love with Romeo that she couldn't stand to live without him.  You could blame the Friar for marrying them in the first place when everyone could see that it wasn't a good idea.  You could blame Lady Capulet for pushing Juliet to marry Paris because she thought he was an attractive man and it would be good for their status and not really thinking of her daughter's feelings in the same fashion as her husband.  You could even blame Paris for wanting to marry Juliet.    I think without everyone's involvement, the deaths simply would not have happened. There is no way to say it was one person's fault alone. Nearly every character had some involvement in the deaths.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	It is the "fault" of no one individual in particular; that's the thing. The story of Romeo and Juliet is based on missed communications, miscommunication, missed opportunities, and misunderstandings from the start. The root of all of it is the ridiculous feuding between the two families. Were it not for that, R & J would not have taken the path they did. The feuding had instilled hatred in the members of one family for the other family since before Romeo was born; that's all he'd heard about. Instead of seizing the opportunity for the love of these two young people to smooth over the years of feuding, it caused only more problems, mostly because people are stupid and arrogant. If you recall, in the story, you never really find out WHAT exactly the feuding was about, because that matters very little. The result is what was important.|`|hgdixjzRaa	It's love's fault because love can be stupid, confused, and without communication, it kinda sucks.     |`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Tybalt...Juliet's nephew.

I think it's the parents fault (both Capulets & Montagues).  They started the feud, and passed the hate on to their family and friends.

Had he refused to have married Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio wouldn't have died as Romeo refused to fight Tybalt after her married Juliet as he saw them as cousins now and then they broke into a fight in which Mercutio died. If, Mercutio hadn't died, then Romeo wouldn't have gone after Tybalt and killed him. Then Romeo was exiled, so Friar Lawerance devised a plan to help get Juliet out of Verona to be with him, but when that went wrong, Romeo, Juliet and Paris ended up dying, so you can link it all back to Friar Lawerance. If you go back even further you could blame it on Lord Montague and Capulet for refusing to get along, but they didn't now that Romeo and Juliet would fall in love. So I would blame Friar Lawerance.|`|Z5A33IR3aa	it was an easy 2 tho|`|grTFRJVjaa	i think that it was the parents fault becuase they wernt alowed to be together so they got the monk to help them, but i also think that the blame falls on romeo for playing dead which caused juillet to kill her self with the posion|`|dyeIsOLpaa	It's the chorus' fault.

AA12339318	Professionals use references all the time, whether from life, or from photographs.  Yes, with practice, a good sketch artist can create images out of their heads, but this only comes after countless hours of practice drawing with the subjects in front of them.  Even then, we still go back and continue our practicing from live sketches.    But when accuracy is critical, we WILL work from reference material.    I am lucky enough to be able to do much of my illustative work from memory, especially my cartoon images.  If someone asks me do do a dog, I can make reconizable collies, cockers, poodles, pugs, labs, setters, greyhounds, St. Bernards and many other breeds.  I can even do these at various stages of growth, from puppies to adult.  But, if someone wants a portrait of THIER dog, with enough realism for them to know it is THEIR dog and not someone else's, I'd BETTER have that dog in front of me, or, at least, a series of good photos of that specific individual dog.  Pet owners will KNOW.    If you have a book editor that wants you to illustrate a Percheron, you'd better not draw them a Clydesdale, or worse, a Shetland.  Believe me, they will KNOW and you won't get paid for your work.  Only a very foolish illustator would think it "cheating" to work from reference.  Do you think that da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa from memory?    In school, I used to know many young artists who could draw pretty little pony heads all day long.  Their friends would "ooh," and , "ahh" over these drawings and paintings, all with different colored halters and reins, long, short, curly and straight manes with big blue, or brown or green eyes and blushing cheeks.  These people could even do such a drawing with their eyes, literally closed.    But ask them to draw the rest of the horse, or do the  head at a different angle and they's stare blankly.  Most of them couldn't do it even if they DID have references in front of them.    A real artistic talent is not one who could draw from memory.  A truely talented artist can draw ANYTHING he or she sees.|`|fwoj4VIFaa	There is a book that can help you with illustration in general. Creative Illustration by Andrew Loomis.  You also might want to learn using adobe photoshop, because it's pretty good with finishing up the colours and the lines. Also, what are you using in colouring the cover? Best colours are oil colours.   I hope I helped. If you can't find the book, you can look for many other illustration books or maybe get it online.|`|CCN2PneTaa	There's no shame in using an aid (re: bowl of fruit). Try practising over and over, and maybe once you're used to an object and see it frequently, you'l remember exactly how it looks. Also try using representations to visualise things and shapes; a hand could take the form of sausages with the palm being the plate, you can use triangles to help draw torsos. In addition, using gridlines help you to get proportions right.|`|23F70N1Raa	It sounds like you need insperation.  Attempt to come up with a childrens story in your mind... and then draw that story.

kfOpbbCyaa	The humility and the brotherhood are shown by the same actions, in my opinion. Hester, first, holds her head high as she braves the stares of the crowd and courageously stands on that scaffold. Afterward, when she is living alone with Pearl and separate from the town, Hester begins to do charitable deeds and help those needier than she. Even though they disdain Hester and Pearl and their children revile them, Hester forges ahead and never flinches in the face of the scorn. She keeps on doing good deeds and never snaps at others in either anger or frustration. She practices patience in a situation which would fray most people's nerves. Frankly, I think this shows both her humility and her brotherhood. The humility keeps her doing good and taking no offense at the terrible way she is treated. The brotherhood, also, keeps her trying to help those less fortunate than she, despite the rebuffs. Perhaps if you think about it in this way, you will be able to come up with a couple of paragraphs.<br>  <br>  If you need more help, I would highly recommend that you read through the very good information to be found on <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_scarlet_letter/">http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help...</a> Yahoo Education.<br>  <br>  You can search for words or phrases in the story, itself, here <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/hawthorne/scarletletter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-literature.com/hawthor...</a> - at The Literature Network.<br>  <br>  This is just one section of chapter 5, which might show you what I mean:<br>  "Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple abundance for her child. Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue, with only that one ornament--the scarlet letter--which it was her doom to wear. The child's attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we may rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter. Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor."<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.

dbfb8185661f046a9017398b63ebcc44aa	Unfortunately everything David said is true.   That being said, I remember when I started, I took photos that I was proud of only to be told the same thing. But I was also told the positives about them and I learned from that more.  So let's look at the positives in your photo and what could have made it better.   First dogs do make for great photos, so saying "come here boy (or girl) " would have given a frontal shot. Face shots with animals give more emotion than just laying.  Second, I absolutely love the angle and that you got down and dirty for the shot , great !!   Third , the blur of the toy/rope works for me especially if the dog was running towards it and the dogs face was in focus.  Fourth , the fence,  it wont work in this type of photo as the sheer size it takes away from your subject which is the dog and his toy. But, and big but here, that fence is a goldmine for photography practice. You can practice DOF on it, try shooting from the bottom up to work on color contrast between old wood and blue sky etc..    So Mrs. you have every right to be proud, yes technichly flawed but a great shot that you can work from. And I hope to see more from you !!|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Love it.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	It's definitely an interesting angle.

You're not going to like this, and I don't expect anything for my pains except a thumbs-down at best, so if you are of a sensitive disposition, don't read on. OK? Still with me? Welllll......sorry and all that, but it's really quite poor. Problems: Large, out-of focus thing (skipping rope?) in the foreground dominates the shot. Since it's badly o-o-f, it distracts from what I think is supposed to be the main subject: a medium sized black dog in the middle distance which is either asleep or dead. Then there's an untidy fence and a redundant but distracting strip of washed-out blank sky. All of this in dull, flat light, lacking any contrast. To be blunt, it looks like you've dropped the camera on the ground and the shutter's fired accidentally. I think that you really need to ask yourself what you were trying to achieve with this shot. What are you telling us? What's the subject? There's no structure, no story, nothing to please the eye. Oh dear, you're probably quite upset by now, but really, you need to seriously consider where you're going with your photography. Look at some books, or take a course. Concentrate on lighting and composition.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	its a good idea fo a shot, might want to try it on a sunny day in the summer for a bit more color.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Yessssssss.....David F. and Clueless are correct. I would have focused the attention on the foreground and NOT the background. The rope could have had more detail by using a smaller aperature opening and refocusing the shot on the rope. The foreground is the usual preferred point of attention in a photo....if the foreground is out of focus it tends to be "distracting".|`|YvvajmxJaa	its cool but tanner looks dead.....|`|tR36oILvaa	that is quite cool

Then, once you've taken a break, go back and start reading again. If you can't sit for hours reading a book, just take breaks like those every hour or half hour.

AA11981114	It's difficult to define who was a king of England in the earliest years, because there were numerous individual kingdoms on the present territory of England.    Ethelred II "The Unready" became king in 978 but was forced out by the Danish invasion of Sweyn in 1013.  He regained the throne in 1014 and died in 1016.    Harold II Godwinson wa defeated and succeeded by William I in 1066.    Matilda, daughter of Henry I was deeded the throne of England at his death in 1135.  Although she fought for it against her cousin Stephen, she was not enthroned.    Edward II was deposed by his Queen, Isabella, and Roger Mortimer in 1127, to be succeeded by his son, Edward III.    Richard II was deposed by his cousin Henry IV in 1399.    Henry VI was deposed by his distant cousin Edward IV in 1461, eventually regained the throne and was deposed again and killed by Edward IV in 1471.    Edward V was placed in the Tower of London in 1483 by his uncle, who succeeded him as Richard III.    Richard III was killed and succeeded by his distant cousin Henry VII in 1485.    Charles I was deposed and executed by Oliver Cromwell in 1649.    James II was overthrown, deposed and succeeded by his son in law, William III in 1688.    Edward VIII was compelled to abdicate in 1938 and was succeeded by his brother, George VI.

It is approximately three miles from the City center. Fishponds is mainly a residential area. Housing is typically of the terraced Victorian variety. The high street comprises many local shops such as greengrocers and florists. The name of this area of Bristol derives from when it was a quarry district. The empty quarries were then filled and there were many large fishponds in the area which have since been filled in. There was one pond remaining which was, until the mid-1970s when it was officially closed, a popular swimming area, named "The Lido" by locals. It is now owned by a private angling club.<br>   Fishponds is bordered by five suburbs: Downend, Staple Hill, St. George, Eastville and Stapleton, and has a population of approximately 20,000.<br>      Fishponds railway station was open from 1866 until closure in 1965 and included a shunting line for Fishponds- built locomotives of the Avonside Locomotive Works to join the main line.<br>    <br>  Barton Hill is an area of Bristol, just to the east of the city center and Bristol Temple Meads railway station.It includes residential, retail and industrial premises and is crossed by major roads, railway tracks and the feeder canal leading to Bristol Harbour.

0KDwifgGaa	I see this as an allegory for the difference between resolving differences in an adult way, discussion, openness, honesty and agreement, and the perils of harbouring grudges.<br>  <br>  In the first stanza he has a problem with his friend, he is angry. He tells his friend and the problem is solved, the anger dies.<br>  <br>  He then has a problem with his foe, he is angry again. This time however, he does not go to his foe and discuss the problem, but instead harbours the grudge, cherishes it and feeds it on resentments and fear and ignorance. The anger grows and grows until such time as it poisons his thinking.<br>  <br>  The image here is that the anger attains a life, a momentum of it's own. It is out of his control and will attack or destroy his enemy without his input. Sure enough, in the poem he finds his enemy dead as if killed by an outside force, his 'anger' .  <br>  <br>  It is as if he is saying "It wasn't me, it was that anger thing over there that did it!"<br>  <br>  The message is that anger, hidden, will grow and become a poison within you, bearing poisonous fruit and resulting in consequences outside of your control.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|219467a6a6cd9560f6a090b03ea6875faa	it's a representative metaphor, a simple description that gives more clarity to an evolving process, a simplified basic frame of reference. in this case, it is a process of a growing corruption, from the roots of ignorance, misunderstanding, illusion, bad influences, misconception, deceit, deception, greed, avarice, disadvantage, restricted choices, false promise,etc. all of these motivators, desires for money, success, power,status,and control (roots),ambitions, entwining into a sturdy growing form,, character and structure shape, out of the founding earth of human activities, hopes dreams, desires, self interest, and human efforts, a trunk raises upward out of the melee, branching and spreading outward. seizing, parasiting, draining the rewards of others hard labors, for it's own self interests, profit, power, and strength. the harvest or results from such  a creation are called the  fruit of a poison tree.. in scriptural reference to the tree man should not partake of the fruit there of. to partake of the poison tree, is to eat poison fruit and therefore be corrupted spiritualy. god gave us a tree that was not corrupt in the m the gardens of our eden, and by spiritual corruption we lost it over time in the past. the parable is a cautionary warning for all generations to learn from.as adam might have remarked later: don't swallow everything your handed, examine and think before you bite. digg !!!|`|AA11346583	I can't better this explanation from a person called Vivian given on a poetry website:<br>  <br>  "Taking off from the subject of friendship, Blake goes into the nature of<br>  enmity.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Winter is a tough one for me. The longer I live the more winter depresses me, and winter is very long here in Minnesota, USA. I agree with a fire being a comfort. I haven't had access to an indoor fire for a long time but I grew up with them and there was nothing like cozying up to it on a gloomy day. Add a good book and a cat on your lap, maybe a cup of spicy tea, and all was right with the world. Of course I had footie pajamas back then too ...    Snow, though, I don't like snow. I used to like sledding and coming in from sledding to a fire and the smell of dinner was another thing that always cheered me immeasurably. Now I don't sled and I have to make my own dinner, not to mention all the other practical disadvantages of snow so snow is really a nemesis. Now that I live in the city where it isn't even pretty my dog is the only thing that can make it look good. She's so goofy she can make anything look good.   Here she is, with a little photoshop magic thrown in.  http://s145.photobucket.com/albums/r212/...    In fact, pets, even other people's, are one of my most reliable sources of comfort and good cheer. I guess it doesn't even have to be a pet. It can just be any old animal, going about its business. I have a love/hate relationship with the squirrels in my yard. Hate because they are very hard on my gardens, love because squirrels really are very amusing critters. Brave and bold and way smarter than they look. Also silly as all get out.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWU0bfo-b...    The rest of the year my garden is the one thing I can count on to always make me feel at peace with the world. Whether I'm working in it or just wandering around enjoying it I always feel that the world can't be so bad if it allows for gardens. From the insects to the birds to all the amazing stages of the plants themselves I'm never bored and the universe feels in balance to me. The first tiny shoots in spring, with snow still on the ground, are the most astonishingly beautiful things I've ever seen, and I feel that way year after year, just as if I'd never seen them before.  (Not mine, but pretty anyway.)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvr9GPjv...    Year round I have books and music. I can't live without them. Some songs just always make me happy, no matter how lousy I feel. Here are a couple of examples, in case you need a shot of melodic good cheer.

Db1Bj3uzaa	Okay, that's a complex question.  The colonial witch persecutions in general were very much about punishing women who stepped out of line.  (There's an amazing book called "The Devil in the Form of a Woman" about this.)  Victims of accusation were almost always women, they were often misfits of some sort (religious dissidents, tramps, or uppity women) and a huge percentage of them owned or had inherited property, at a time when laws largely excluded women from ownership.  <br>  <br>  However, the people accused in Salem did not fit the normal profile of accused witches (with a couple of exceptions).  There were respected town and church members, male and female, accused and executed.  It has to be one of the great mysteries of history--what made a previously peaceful villagers execute their neighbors on the say so of hysterical children?  Another book worth reading, Salem Possessed, posits that it was a power (and land) struggle between Salem Town (rev. Paris being a leader there) and Salem village, and that he may have told the girls who to name.  Arthur Miller's play, the Crucible (which was accurate in many particulars) blames the whole thing on a teenaged girl having a crush on a married farmer, and wanting to be rid of his wife.<br>  <br>  That's about all I can remember.  The paper I did on Salem was long ago!  |`|NYU37jfGaa	No.  The trials were caused by a fear of witchcraft.  Although more women than men were accused, there were men tried and executed too.  Women were thought to be more susceptible to the influence of the devil than men were, being spiritually weaker than men, but men could fall under suspicion as well.  Altogether, at Salem, fourteen women and six men were executed, which is fairly typical of the numbers executed overall during the centuries of witchcraft persecutions.<br>  <br>  Withcraft trials tended to be triggered by tense social situations, wars, epedemics, and bad harvests were all events that could trigger persecutions.  And Salem in the 16090s was in a perilous situaiton, poised, so the inhabitants felt, on the very edge of civilisation, with Indians liable to attack at any time.  A war with the French and their Indian allies wa sin progress at the time of the Salem hunt, and there were epedemics of disease as well.  It was at times like these that people tended to listen to accusations of witchcraft most readily.<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget that, although the majority of the accused were women, so were the majoirty of the accusers (this too is typical of witch-hunting in general).|`|nKlnAQLWaa	no. they were hysteria caused in religous colonies. it was not a fear of women, some men were executed as witches too. salem was a religous colony, and they feared demons and evil spirits. so no, not women, satan.

46zxsu1haa	I am afraid you are going to find most of the modern companies in NY with dancers with a strong ballet background. It is just at that level. We have Paul Taylor, Parsons company, Nathan Trice, Alvin Ailey, the list goes on. You could try Sidra Bell, but she expects her dancers to have a strong ballet background too even though she is not balletic in style. The same with Mark Maris. You could try Doug Elkin, or Merc Cunningham.  Of course you also have Martha Graham. That is a lot of contraction/ release and floor work. It takes years of training to learn her style.    Really, I don't know what else to tell you. If you want to dance in a modern company in NY, you better have a strong ballet background.      I am assuming you are looking for work??? If you are just looking to watch check out Martha Graham or Doug Elkin.      *If you are looking for "Modern" as it is called in competition dance, you wont find it any place outside of the competition world, and definitely not in NYC.
ZDrXFS2daa	They were huge monstrous machines that ran on punch cards. People did not have personal computers yet. I worked at a TV station during the early 70s and we had a machine called an MT/ST. It had a tape similar to VHS movies that recorded everything we typed on the electric typewriters that were hooked up to it. We were still considered a sort of "typing pool". All the sales people phoned us with their letters and memos recorded on tape and we listened to them with earphones and they typed up whatever it was they wanted done. We took them the copy and they either signed it and sent it out or made corrections and returned them to us to redo. When dictating, sometimes we had a problem figuring out what they said so this was a precaution against misspelling or a wrong word or whatever. If it was a company memo they usually called us back and said make "X" copies and send them to so and so. We saved the tapes for a week and then recorded over them.     The actual computer was a huge giant machine that operated on punch cards. A person would type information on a keyboard and the machine would punch out holes in the cards. Then they were entered on the machine and it would read the holes in the cards to obtain the information on the cards. Our computer was about the size of a 6 person dining table and solid. It took several strong men to move it.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Well all the British ones had been broken up for scrap in 1949 and as for the rest well they had yet to be invented.|`|ccXJo7xUaa	Old computers were just black screens with green text, like seen in many movies etc. This was the first generation of programming, called machine code were users entered commands by a series of 1's and 0's (binary code). They basically told the computer what data to execute.    Since then, Operating Systems (such as Windows XP) have provided interfaces to allow the users to communicate with the computer. So, instead of manually entering data and locations, we can now click on buttons and icons which contain the path we want to go to. This means even really novice users can use computers, not just experience programmers.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	First of all the ones in the 50's were huge! And in the early 60's they made them a bit smaller. They paved the way for what we use today, which is a miracle if you think about it! The actual computer is not the bottom line, the programming is the key! There were probably millions of experiments with the old type computers, and I guess there were many people who laughed at the concept. That's just my view, as I'm not an electronic or science person.
ZDrXFS2daa	To push for the formation of a Palestinian state.|`|O9FojdEMaa	he PLO was set up in 1964 by an Arab League decision in  response to growing signs of Palestinian unrest. The  Palestinians desired to reclaim the lands occupied by  Israel, which they felt belonged to them, as said in the  Bible. In 1964 the Arab states created the Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO). While it was supposed to  represent the Palestinians, in reality it represented the  views of President Nasser of Egypt, who guided the  formation of the PLO. Its first leader made wild and  irresponsible threats to drive Israelis into the sea, and  had little support among Palestinians for he was seen as a  puppet of the Egyptians. In the 1960s Palestinian students  began to form their own organizations independent of  control by Arab governments (although the Syrians, Libyans,  and Iraqis continued to fund and control particular  groups). Yasser Arafat founded an independent  Palestinian-run party called Fatah. He is said to have the  backing, for most of the recent past, of about 80% of the  Palestinian people. The position of the Arab governments  was that a PLO under Arab League supervision would be the  best way of satisfying the demands made by an emerging  Palestinian national consciousness. Also, it was felt that  through such an organization Arab governments could control  Palestinian political activities.     Ten years after its founding, the PLO was raised to the  status of government. And in 1988, the PLO's status was to  be raised again, this time to a state in exile. After  several negotiations, Arafat became a Terrorist leader and  administrator of self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip.     In the 1967 Six Day War, the Arab armies did very badly  against Israel, losing 67,000 square kilometres of land.  Palestinians came to believe that if they were ever to have  their land, they would have to do it themselves. After the  1967 war, the situation changed drastically. The resistance  activities of various guerrilla organizations, in  particular the Al-Fatah and the PFLP, gained the increasing  support of the Palestinians. With Arafat at the helm from  1969 and a resistance-oriented leadership, the PLO was more  effective and played a central role in mobilizing the  Palestinians and in expanding its basis of support both at  the local and international level. The PLO became an  umbrella organization for the various guerrilla groups.     This increase in support was made possible because of the  Al-Fatah's ability to access to the growing numbers of  volunteers from refugee camps which were freshly swollen  due to the 1967 war. Most of these refugees suffered the  frustration of having been displaced twice in a lifetime.  This generated, especially among the young, a mood of  defiance, as they were ready to question the credibility of  the idea of relying on Arab governments to liberate  Palestine. Furthermore, as a consequence of the war a large  proportion of the Palestinian community became  territorially united. This brought the possibility of  direct interaction between the various sections of the  Palestinian community that had previously remained isolated  from each other. On the other hand, the inability of the  PLO's conservative leadership to promote any effective  resistance operations culminated in the eventual transfer  of power to the armed-struggle orientated guerrilla  organizations. Thus initially, the PLO had a broad base of  support and represented the desires of the majority of the  Palestinian people.
Q4HfFawFaa	The battle become another instance of Generals fighting current battles with old tactics at horrific losses. <br>  More than any other battle, Passchendaele has come to symbolize the horrific nature of the great battles of the First World War. In terms of killed, wounded and missing, the Germans lost approximately 260,000 men, while the British Empire forces lost about 300,000, including approximately 36,500 Australians, 3,596 New Zealanders and 16,000 Canadians — the latter of which were lost in the intense final assault between 26 October and 10 November; 90,000 British and Dominion bodies were never identified, and 42,000 never recovered. Aerial photography showed 1,000,000 shell holes in 1 square mile (2.56 km2).<br>  "I died in Hell <br>  (they called it Passchendaele); my wound was slight <br>  and I was hobbling back; and then a shell <br>  burst slick upon the duckboards; so I fell <br>  into the bottomless mud, and lost the light" <br>  ― Siegfried Sassoon <br>  <br>  <br>

Básicamente, en este capítulo se discute cuando sería trasladado Harry Potter de la casa de sus tíos. La Orden del Fénix debe trasladarlo porque al cumplir 17 a?os el encantamiento que lo protege en esa casa por la muerte de su madre dejaría de tener efecto y sería blanco fácil para Voldemort.<br>  El Se?or Oscuro tiene dos informantes, Severus Snape y Yaxley. Yaxley dice que sabe de buena fuente que será trasladado el 31, día de su cumplea?os 17 y Snape dice que será trasladado el sábado al caer la noche. Voldemort le pregunta la fuente y Severus se limita a indicarle que lo sabe de la fuente que habían discutido.<br>  <br>  Una vez aclarado el punto del traslado de Potter (Voldemort procura atraparlo) el “Dark Lord” pregunta a Yaxley (funcionario del Ministerio de Magia) si el Ministerio habrá caído en poder de los mortífagos para el sabado. Yaxley le indica que sí, que consiguió encantar a Pius Thicknesse con un “Imperius” (permite al atacante darle órdenes al atacado). Voldemort no se sorprende y le indica que Thicknesse sólo es uno y mucha gente rodea al ministro Scrimgeour. Yaxley le dice que no se preocupe, porque Thicknesse es el Jefe del Departamento de la Aplicación de la Ley Mágica, por lo que tiene contacto directo no sólo con Scrimgeour por lo que será más fácil trabajar juntos en contra del Ministro.<br>  <br>  Luego pide una varita prestada, pide voluntarios pero finalmente se la pide a Lucius Malfoy, éste no muestra una actitud de agrado y es humillado por Voldemort.<br>  Finalmente Voldemort habla sobre “purificar” la sangre de los magos, como muestra mata con el encantamiento “Avada Kevadra” a Charity Burbage, quien fuera profesora de asuntos “muggles” en Hogwarts y recientemente publicara un apasionado ensayo en defensa de los mudbloods (sangre-sucia) en el diario el profeta. Finalmente Nagini, la serpiente de Voldemort, cena el cuerpo de Burbage.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Capítulo II – In Memoriam<br>  (En Conmemoración)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Todo este capítulo se localiza en el cuarto de Harry Potter en el número 4 de Privet Drive, casa de sus tíos, los Dursley (Vernon y Petunia). Este capítulo es como un paso muy rápido (que sólo será apreciado por quienes hayan leído los 6 libros anteriores) a lo que ha pasado Harry desde que Hagrid lo introdujo al mundo mágico. El único personaje del capítulo es Harry.<br>  <br>  Primero se lamenta por una cortada que recibió luego de un “accidente” (él piensa que fue una broma pesada de su primo Dudley). Al tener esa cortada en el dedo, se lamenta no poder usar magia todavía (por ser menor de 17 a?os las leyes mágicas lo prohiben) pero se alegra al pensar que faltan sólo 4 días. Aunque confiesa que no sabría que hechizo usar para sanarse, decide preguntarle a Hermione.<br>  <br>  Lo siguiente es una escena nostálgica, Harry debe vaciar su equipaje casa de sus tíos por primera vez y luego decidir qué llevará cuando sea trasladado por la Orden del Fénix. Se topa con objetos como la divisa que muestra “Support Cedric” (Apoyo a Cedric) y cambia por “Potter stinks” (Potter apesta), un viejo chivatoscopio (sneak-oscope), un relicario de oro dentro del cual había una nota con las iniciales R.A.B. y finalmente vio lo que le había causado la cortada: un pedazo del espejo encantado que si padrino Sirius le había dado. Observó el espejo y vio sus ojos reflejados en él.<br>  <br>  Ya había vaciado completamente su baúl, ahora debía elegir qué iba a necesitar y qué dejaría en aquel cuarto que nunca le dio grandes recuerdos. Descartó muchos artículos y empacó de nuevo su ropa muggle, la capa de invisibilidad, algunos libros, un pu?ado de cartas y su varita. En una bolsa de afuera guardó el relicario y el mapa del merodeador.<br>  <br>  Luego vio que junto a la jaula de Hedwig (su lechuza) había toda una pila de diarios “El Profeta”, llamó su atención una mención en la portada de un artículo sobre Dumbledore. Era un homenaje póstume escrito por su amigo desde la adolescencia Elphias Dodge. En él hace un recorrido por la vida del Dumbledore, destacando su gran humanismo, habla sobre su familia y sus logros, también menciona la batalla que le ganó a Grindelwald en 1945. Escribe sobre cómo Albus nunca asumió el puesto de Ministro de Magia, pese a las oportunidades que tuvo.<br>  <br>  La lectura hace llorar a Harry, además, se siente mal consigo mismo, ya que él creyó conocer a Dumbledore y ahora se daba cuenta que no sabía nada de su familia. Se cuestionó su narcisismo en relación con el fallecido exdirector. Luego de muchos pensamientos al respecto, tomó la parte del diario que contenía el artículo y lo guardo en un libro.<br>  <br>  Luego vio el diario del día y notó una entrevista a Rita Skeeter (del diario “El Profeta”) donde hablaba el libro que publicaría pronto, se titulaba “Albus Dumbledore, Life and Lies” (Vida y mentiras de Albus Dumbledore). En la entrevista se cuestionaba a Dumbledore crudamente, Harry sintió furia al leer la entrevista, en la cual, se mencionaba su relación con Albus. Hizo una rabieta que hizo que el pedazo de espejo saltara lejos de él lo levantó y pudo ver en él un ojo azul, que reconoció de inmediato como los ojos de Dumbledore, sin embargo, concluyó que debió imaginarlo.<br>  <br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  <br>  No lo voy a negar... Me dio pereza terminarlos... Así que lo retitulo, el resumen inconcluso de Harry Potter and the deathly hallows en espa?ol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Harry despierta de un sue?o, en le que Voldemort y Colagusano, hablaban sobre algo, y que debían utilizar a Harry, más tarde, después, asesinan a un muggle llamdo Frank Bryce.<br>  <br>  Ron Weasley invita a Harry a la final del mundial de Quidditch, para lo que la familia Weasley va a ver a Harry personalmente a la casa de sus tíos. Harry llega a la casa de los Weasley mediante la Red Flu.<br>  <br>  Pasado el tiempo, Harry, Hermione y Ron asisten a los mundiales de Quidditch junto al padre de Ron, Fred, George y Ginny. Una vez que están allí, Harry conoce sobre el mejor buscador del mundo, Víctor Krum.

992fc191de4a2463b2403a19c84fa07baa	A sonnet is easy to define.  It's a 14-line poem that follows one of a group of specific rhyme scemes.<br>  <br>  A poem is almost impossible to define, because there are so many different styles and structures.  It's almost easier to define a poem by what it's not: it's a written work that's not prose, and not technical, designed to make you think or feel.|`|60a6741a7df43666d1b9a674aa5becadaa	Definition of a sonnet? Well, that's easy. It's a 14-line poem, usually written in metered verse, with a rhyme scheme according to the type of sonnet (either English or Italian style, alternately called Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnets). Defining poetry is a little more open to opinion, but the important part is representative language -- that is, the poet chooses words to say what he means, rather than what the words themselves mean. A poem is not necessarily (and usually isn't) literal in meaning.
zDBGLp3vaa	In genealogy, without sharing a common ancestor, you have NO relation.  People can call each other anything they want, as honorary titles if they are close to that person and have some loose family ties, like referring to that person as your cousin.  But in genealogy circles, you have NO relationship with that person.  Genealogical relationships are blood-bound and cannot be created by or severed by marriage.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  There is NO term for this, general term or otherwise.  There is NO relation.  This is NOT even a relation by marriage.  Relationships by marriage are limited to the following, and no longer exist once there is a divorce.  Those relationships are: aunt/uncle, step brother/sister/mother/father, and brother/sister/mother/father in-law.  Please stop trying to come up with a relationship where none exists.|`|rzDbR1Yiaa	y'all are not related to each other. you can call them your cousin if you want =]|`|ch4qOcCVaa	It's like my favorite Uncle having another niece that I didn't know about until he went into the hospital. Since my Aunt is the blood relation, any other relatives of my Uncles would take explaining if I had to.  Now that I know she exists, I would call her my Uncle's niece or my Uncle's sister's daughter, if I had to provide an explaination as to why she's calling my Uncle, Uncle.<br>  <br>  So calling them your cousin's cousin is appropriate. Or to belay any questions, my cousin's cousin on his father's side.  You must have a friendship with this person to want to connect to them but normally you wouldn't even list the relationship.|`|992fc191de4a2463b2403a19c84fa07baa	Well you're not technically related to one another.  There's no shared blood between you.  For simplicity's sake though, it's probably easiest to refer to this peron as your cousin, or even your cousin through marriage, if you want to be anal about.|`|txIulrEvaa	I agree with a couple of the other posters,  based upon the drawing you supplied;  While you are related to your First Cousin (Aunt's Children) - You are not related to your Aunt's Husband's - Sisters Child.<br>  Hope this helps...|`|v2wS76Kkaa	Simply look up the English word “cousin” in any good, modern dictionary, like Websters, American Heritage or Cambridge International Dictionary and you will find the following definitions of the word. <br>  <br>  Merriam Webster Dictionary = Middle English cosin, from Anglo-French cusin, cosin, from Latin consobrinus, from com- + sobrinus second cousin, from soror sister — 1 a: a child of one's uncle or aunt b: a relative descended from one's grandparent or more remote ancestor by two or more steps and in a different line c: kinsman, relative  2: one associated with or related to another : counterpart 3—used as a title by a sovereign in addressing a nobleman 4: a person of a race or people ethnically or culturally related <br>  <br>  Cambridge International Dictionary - 1. a child of a person's aunt or uncle, or, more generally, a distant relative. <br>  <br>  American Heritage Dictionary - 1. A child of one's aunt or uncle. Also called first cousin. 2. A relative descended from a common ancestor, such as a grandparent, by two or more steps in a diverging line. 3. A relative by blood or marriage; a kinsman or kinswoman. <br>  <br>  |`|ToKEdF4Naa	You are not related as far as you can document. Of course, we all have shared ancestors if we trace back far enough. I have the same situation. When people ask how we are related, I say, "We're really not related, but we are related to the same people."

Too many poems are written from a purely emotional point of view and surely a poem isn't just something we real off, it should be a distilled emotion. If it is just written quickly, then it might as well be the lyrics to a song or a greeting card message, but a poem, if it has any meaning, should be the crystalised essence of a thought or feeling.

TOi1P15Saa	Because he had to be careful because Dumbledore was keeping a very good eye on all the staff.<br>  <br>  He was also probably acting on Voldemort's orders, and Voldermort would have to him for wait for some reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  But yes, he was unable to have just taken Harry while he was at school and given him a portkey, someone would have seen it was him.  He just had to offer to put the Cup into the maze, turn it into a portkey (which would have also been risky) and then Harry would never have returned.  He also had to gain people's trust a bit more, so making people think he was just helping Harry out would make people not think it was him that gave him the portkey.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?  Well, it was my view anyway.|`|D0SK7Dlfaa	Probably Madeye or should I say Barty Crouch Jr. wanted to wait for a perfect time to do it cause there are a lot of witnesses and Dumbledore is there. I think its somewhere in the book or movie.|`|AA11303574	timing <br>  <br>  |`|9SXnUOb3aa	The fake Mad-Eye Moody, ( AKA Barty Crouch JR. ) plotted everything out purposely. He had to wait for the TriWizard Tournamant because of one person: Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. AKA Dumbledore.<br>  If Mad-Eye Moody had just given Harry the portkey any time, everyone would have been very suspicious. He was also planning with Lord Voldemort; and that was the night he HAD to do it. It was a special curse that required that time.|`|mdfKV703aa	This had to be done in a way that Mad Eye/Crouch could get into the school and place the port key where no one would suspect...It would have been very difficult to put it somewhere where only Harry would touch it, and no one else is around/would get help/tell Dumbledore.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, what fun would the story be otherwise? Every story has a catch like this--some things you have to let go, otherwise there would be no story.|`|UXuGCgo3aa	Because it was less suspicious that way, and no one would notice until after.  And because Voldemort and the Death Eaters had to be ready.<br>  <br>  Answer my question?|`|rUx0QOmlaa	I agree that it was probably timing.  Maybe Voldemort was not ready to have wormtail perform the spell yet.  At that point no one believed that Voldemort was back so to have Harry suddenly come up missing would have been suspicious.  Also, it comes down to what Voldemort wanted, if he did not want Harry until the end of the year and he showed up early, there would have been hell to pay.|`|kOrErZvcaa	Would have made for a really short book.  Kept the suspense alive.  J.K. Rowlings wrote each book to be LONGER than the previous book.  If Harry found the port key right a way, end of story, shorter book, no suspense and not much material for the movie either.

6KaMW1Vzaa	Jeans and tennis shoes are out. <br>  The shoes should not have a rubber sole: they set you up for injury. Likewise, they need to have a back or at least a strap, so you won't dance out of them (or spend the hour scrunching your toes to avoid it!). If you have something with a leather sole, that'll do nicely. If you stick with it, of course, there are specialized shoes for dancing ballroom, but you needn't go there yet.<br>  You can wear slacks, a skirt, or a dress, but it should not be restrictive to movement. You'd be surprised how many ladies I dance with who wear skirts that won't allow them to take a full stride. In beginner classes, you may get away with that, but I'll tell you: for a more advanced guy, it's really annoying when I run into an obstruction in a skirt every time I take a step forward with my right foot. Choose an outfit in advance, and see if you can take a long step comfortably.<br>  Also, a minor word of warning: it's autumn, and that sweater may look really cute, but keep in mind that dancing is pretty athletic, so choose clothes that won't be too hot with activity.|`|50Ty7VRYaa	I took ballroom dancing classes for 2 years and when you're first starting out you need not to wear anything except clothes you feel comfortable in (Ex: sweats/yoga pants and a baggy t-shirt or something similar).  Also, if you decide to continue with these classes you'll probably want to invest in some good dancing sneakers (yo';ll be surprised at what a difference these make).  <br>  <br>  Just have fun with it :)|`|VaT1Pd0Laa	Yeah !!! I've been dancing for about three years !!!<br>  1. Don't get nervous <br>  2. Have fun <br>  3. <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hma-bdc/etiquette.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hma-bdc/etiq...</a><br>  4. Wear comfortable cloths. I wear a nice shirt and Flexible jeans. <br>  5. Shoes- Don't wear anything with rubber. Do not !!! The rubber will make you stick on the dance floor and you can pop an Ankle of ACL. On your first night dance with your socks on. You need something that will slide on the dance floor. Leather or Swede. But don't dance with high heels on unless you have danced with them before. I mean real dancing. Not at the club. People who can't dance with heels hurt others feet. I had a huge swollen bruise from a woman who stepped on me while dancing. <br>  6. Brush your teeth and have mints !!!!<br>  7. Be ready to learn ... but don't try to rush learning !!! I am still learning new moves !!! It took me half a year to get really good at dancing. <br>  8. Ask questions. <br>  9. If at a public lesson don't be sad if you don't get a partner every dance.<br>  10. Have fun and be yourself. Don't give up !!!<br>  <br>  *Feel free to ask me any more questions !!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Ballroom+Shoes" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-York-T-Strap-Character-Shoe/dp/B0002RRRC0/ref=pd_sbs_a_njs_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/New-York-T-Strap-C...</a>     <br>  <br>   I have a pair of these ... they are strong and last for a long time. <br>  |`|QPiwb7hKaa	i'd go with something uber-comfortable for my first class, like sweatpants and a shirt and some good sturdy sneakers, too. if you want to you can ask your instructor on the first day, they'll know more than anyone.|`|ukN0Gr7aaa	Slippery Shoes!

DHgrgnUUaa	I do suffer from clinical depression, and I know EXACTLY what you mean.  I have been on the top of the mountain, and I have crashed down it right after.  Coming down hurts a lot more than getting up, which only adds to the pessimistic attitudes.  The past 5 years of my life have been absolute hell, full of things I have tried to rid myself of that same feeling you were talking about, and I've finally realized that there isn't anything you can take to make it go away.  <br>  This will seem weird, but I think I cured myself by becoming "enlightened."  I have finally learned that the world is going to constantly suck, but I don't have to accept it.  I can make it better.  I can make it stronger.  Now, everyday, I find a way to do exactly that.  It has really improved my moods, it's helped me start to care about people again.  I know it sounds stupid, but it worked for me.|`|AA12223961	Seek the peace and solitude you need within yourself. Be at peace with the world and know that while you have a place and a function, it may not be anything great, but should a chain be missing a link, it cannot reach the shore. Life will only yield the joy and beauty you find there. Look deep! For it is always there. Strive to be happy that you do not find the world to be a dull and dreary place.|`|8Rs4ES6Haa	more brown rice|`|uS491JFXaa	Yes! As we grow older we realize things thaatwe never realized wen we were young i guess tahts called getting mature and having mroe responsiblbilty. and we all have our ups and down. As i get closer to living and facing the real world in this harsh reality of the world I myself feel down and feel so scared thinking that i hvae to fight to gain what I want and need for my loved ones and for me, and I also go down as i realize that one day eveyrhting will be over i mean the people you love willlsoon be gone and you urself will be gone. all we can hope for is to live in such a pure life so we can enter the kingdom of heaven which is ricdiculosy hard. BUt at the same time experienceing all this emotions of sadness we must maintain the mentality to fight for the ones we love or for your dreams. |`|wO1IDJ6Laa	Ups and downs are a regular part of life.  You can't be crazy stupid happy all the time or you'll never appreciate it.  It's when the gaps between up and down get larger, and longer.  When the depression is severe, and the up/manic feelings are uncontrollable or cause you to do things you normally wouldn't - that you should worry about.  It might be temporary, it might be an effect of what's going on in the world right now, it might be that you need to work harder at being happy as you get older.  Could be genetic.  Could be environmental.  Heck, it could be that you've developed a sensitivity to sugar or wheat or something as you've gotten older.  Keep a journal, track it.  See if you can find a pattern.  That's what I've done.  Good luck.  |`|FoIxsunVaa	When I was a teenager, the emotional swings were more than I could handle. I chose to view the world in a sardonic and cynical manner to keep myself from those sickening highs, and as for the lows, well they are actually easier to handle in some ways.<br>  <br>  But as a person who has dealt with crushing depression for most of my adult life, I can hardly hold myself up as an exemplar or anything. But I can avoid feeling good better than almost anyone!|`|mXUKca6naa	...how true...the true test is...do you let it get you down or do you change it...<br>  <br>  ...the secret is to change your situation to a positive...<br>  <br>  ...how do you change...just knowing it will end is a positive and how to make it end faster is constructive thinking to a positive end...<br>  <br>  ...good luck...

Although using that alone colours the entire picture. I can't find an easier way to do it, but my workaround solution is this...<br>  <br>  1) Duplicate background layer, then select the new layer.<br>  <br>  2) Use ellipse select to select the eye and then cut it out.<br>  <br>  3) Return to background layer and select the "Fill with a colour gradient" tool.<br>  <br>  4) Set it to approximately 10% opacity (or whatever you prefer), mode: normal, offset: 0, shape: radial, repeat: none, dithering true, adaptive supersampling false. Use whatever gradient you like, but if you want a rainbow, it's called full saturation cw or ccw. Clockwise and counter-clockwise.<br>  <br>  5) Click and drag cursor from centre of eye to eyelid (it works best if the eye is wide open and pupil centred). Wait for it to process the command. The eye should be covered by a rainbow effect, and the rest should look normal.<br>  <br>  6) Flatten the image and save to a new file.<br>  <br>  If you click the layer visibility buttons (the eye) to make the background invisible, you'll see through the eye to the checkered background. If you make the duplicate layer invisible, you'll see that the background layer was covered by a band of colour. Though only the eye (because it was cut out of the duplicate layer) shows through when you have both layers visible, and the rest of the duplicate layer is unaffected by the rainbow gradient. There is possibly a better way (without using layers), but I couldn't figure one out.|`|Tnt4aGU1aa	How are we meant to answer, if we cant see your eyes
qxxjXaWEaa	First, I think it's fantastic that you're already so dedicated :) I suggest you just add details and depth to your characters. Maybe add a few scenes (sorry, don't know if that's the right word for a book) to add some realism and opportunities for your readers to connect with the text. However, make sure you're not just filling up space! It's okay to write a novella, which would have about 20,000-40,000 words. <br>  Good luck and keep it up! Hope I'll see that book on the NY Times Bestseller list! :)|`|sBQvubj5aa	Describe feelings, places, etc..|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Don't add descriptive words, just add more actions. More things that have happened. I'm not even finished writing my first chapter and i'm on 7,000. I did it by asking people who read it what else they wanted to know about the character. The first chapter is mostly presenting the plot, the main character, and setting the scene for the book. Just think about those things.|`|kTBE4dYEaa	you don't need to change your idea or draw it out longer if you don't want, you can just call it a short story instead! |`|PAYpAZkKaa	That's not bad for someone's first book, you have a really great writing skill if you already about 6,000 words and a detailed story outline!  Don't add too much detail for everything to avoid info dumps and purple prose, which are typically looked on quite poorly.  That is one of the biggest mistakes young writers make is that they add so much description, the story because redundant.  I would possibly add a couple of scenes that you may have skipped over, add a couple of extra diaglouges in order to do a 'termperature reading' for the emotions of the other characters in the book.  Really, I think you have a fantastic outline and will do great!  Good Luck!|`|cBltTxPyaa	ooh i'm excited for you! I was about 14 when I developed my first story that I'm adapting into a screenplay now.  I'm 18 now, so you can only imagine how far writing will take you. I'm happy that you found such a great passion so early! u'll go far.  :)<br>  <br>  as far as the word count goes, word count is nothing if it compromises your story.  write as much as you think will get the story told. any more or any less than that will leave your readers with a comment to say about it.  if there's too much "fluff" (overexaggerated, wordy, long descriptions/ things that readers don't really need to know or care about...) then their attention will wander... (such has happened to me when I read some of the twilight series) and yes the vampire theme is a bit worn out because of those books, but honestly, I'm tired of hearing about the Cullens! give me some new vampires to read about! You go girl!<br>  <br>  ok, so u've typed the first four chapters? good. did you make an outline so you know where your story is headed? that's your next step if you haven't done that. make sure you have a "map" of where your story is headed, otherwise you'll have a lot of bumps in the road and you might even hit a dead end. not fun. been there, done that... lol.<br>  <br>  also, what i liked to do, was gather pictures from the internet that represented my story, ex, people that looked like my characters, places that the story took place in, and i made a cute little background for my laptop. so whenever i got on to add to my story, I'd see my background and get the "writing vibe."  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK GURL!!!!!!<br>  <3  i'm rootin for ya!|`|R2hpggk0aa	Writing a book isn't about word count. It's about a story, beginning, middle, end. Good characters. Good plot. It sounds like you're jumping too far. I'm not sure how long you've started but you may have jumped in too soon and just jumped into the sea instead of a pool. <br>  You can make a basic outline of each chapter, a summary of it, then an outline of each chapter before you start them. <br>  <br>  Read up on writing books. |`|6kIc2bSEaa	try to add as many details as possible. chances are that if your book is that short than you don't have very many. i would just try to be very specific in your writing. hope that helped. =]|`|2b937e3b14c54ef36515398319dc5a2daa	Some novels have paragraphs and even pages of material that are not constant with the plot, and I skip over. You don't want to add useless information. Go over your plot, and see if it follows the general cycle of a good story. Flawed main character, empathy and connection is possible, and sometimes if you add another twist to separate it from archetypal themes can make it longer and better.<br>  <br>  Other scenes that aren't directly connected with the plot but still interesting can introduce sideline characters and show more depth and random quirks of the mains.<br>  <br>  What I do is read through my writing as if I have never seen it and see if I can picture settings and characters clearly. Other people can help you with that too. <br>  <br>  If the plot is set, and you don't want to change anything, there is nothing wrong with having a shorter novel or a novella. |`|aRoU5NyGaa	with each thought you are putting down on paper, expand it with description.  More adjectives.  Create a picture in your mind when you read back what you wrote.  For example "it was a sunny day" could be ... "the sun shone brightly on the fresh snow, sparking like crystals where it hung from the branches of the trees" or perhaps ... the sun was so hot I could feel the sweat beading up beneath the brow of my ball cap ... steam rose from the sidewalks as I traveled down Main Street headed for the park.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself questions about each scenario you write about so that the picture you describe is more detailed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps even a little.  I think it is great that you are inspired and already at your age working so dilligently on a passion of yours.  You are asking the right questions and doing the research about what you have set out to do, and at the same time you are actually "doing" it!!!  Keep it up, and Way to go!!!

C9EUrLzlaa	This is true. People were suffocating, and dying right and left. Panicked people, in pain, unable to breathe, tried to escape. Obviously, they couldn't.

In this poem you over-determine a lot, meaning you tell the reader what is going on instead of portraying actions and letting the reader come to their own conclusions. Instead of saying you cannot see a face, describe what you do see and leave the face out. Or describe what is there instead...a blur, darkness, maybe it is shadowed out, which would go with your shadow theme. Also, abstract words like your heart should be avoided. In contrast to these suggestions, you use very nice verbs that I would not change such as lurking, ripped, and clutching.|`|py6eMG7Vaa	Only you know when its finished. My kind of poem...dreary and sad. A little too much love neediness for my taste a little too much desperation, but that is what makes us human.
