SVeLk0lYaa	Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of the known universe (others are strong/weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism). basically, gravity exists everywhere and on the planet earth it pushes objects downwards.  However, in space gravity is not as (ughh how can i put this in layman's terms lol) powerful as on earth so things "float".           Prior to popular belief, gravity is not what makes planets orbit the sun and moons orbit planets...this is actually the cause of curved spacetime but i dont want to confuse the heck out of you so ill just end there.|`|AA11616563	GRAVITY IS NOT A FORCE.  there are four forces friction, natural, weight, and force which makes objects move.  Gravity is acceleration due to the mass of the earth.  Everything has its own gravitational pull but since the earth has a greater pull is why you don't fly through the air into your house when you get close enough.  acceleration og gravity (gravity itself is 32 feet per second)  it is composed of a relation ship of the change in divided by change in time therefore acceleration or in your case gravity.|`|YRHLMfzDaa	explain evrything about gravity http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation|`|ASSbLOk6aa	mezame has the right answer|`|h2bGyi8Uaa	What goes up, must come down|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Gravity is a force. It is a force produced by an attraction between two masses. Being a force, gravity causes acceleration. The acceleration between Earth and objects on Earth's surface happens to be 9.8 m/s^2, meaning the objects tend to move toward Earth with a velocity that increases by 9.8 m/s each second. Gravity is only noticeable when either one of the objects is very, very large - the size of a planet.|`|AA11423026	Gravity is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass attract one another. In everyday life, gravity is most commonly thought of as the agency which lends weight to objects with mass.|`|CotWcTI0aa	Gravity: The attraction due to gravitation that the Earth or another astronomical object exerts on an object on or near its surface    Gravity: Sh*t that keeps you on the ground|`|ghItgMZxaa	well why don't you throw a apple up in the air than see if it hits you in the head. if it does, well its gravity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SsOSTcS4aa	Gravity is the magnetic force that keeps things down on earth while the earth is flying through space around and about the other planets.|`|oM7P6pMgaa	some scientist believe gravity is a weak force that has spilled over from another universe, that is why simple magnets can defy it so easily even though they are on a planet billions of times their size, if you are willing to believe that|`|6ea37103f798fb5e6d654e41c88be37aaa	all mass has a pull.  every planet has it, even people have it.  i guess you could say that everyone in the world is attracted to everyone else :)  anyway, the force of the pull between two objects depends on the mass of those objects.  since people have very little mass, and there's not much of a difference in the mass of two people, we don't have such a pull on each other.  but planets are huge, and the earth specifically is very large, especially compared to humans.  so naturally, it pulls us towards it.  that's what gravity is: it's negative acceleration (-9.8 m/s^2).|`|lLs8tcU4aa	I am 90% certain about this theory.    Under the earths crust is magma (melted rock) as you probably know, but in the very centre of the earth is what we refer to as a core.    This core spins.  It is spinning all the time and is constantly pulling everything towards it.  Obviously it doesn't pull you straight through the earth, but it's force basically keeps everything on the ground.  This force is gravity.    It also creates our atmosphere barrier. (the bubble like force-field around our planet keeping our planet's atmosphere separate from space).    Hope this is right. I think it is.|`|AA12337052	Gravity is a force of attraction.     Think of 2 magnets. Magnetism is also a force, but it is stronger than gravity, so when you hang a magnet on the fridge you can actually see & feel the force.    Gravity is the same thing except that it is harder to visualize because it is a weaker force.You may see a vase sitting on a table, but it is actually gravity that is holding it there. The mass or weight of the 2 objects are attracted to each other.|`|NrMqiXVPaa	*****mass actually bends space-time*******,  gravity is a force well uh sort of, it follows the equation anyway     g(force)=m(mass)a(acceleration)    so things are..uh well attracted or flow toward a mass :D :D  ouch an apple just fell on my head!!!! XD|`|KfBWOvf3aa	according to Newtonian theory, gravity is some kind of attractive force that always presents between 2 massive bodies. But, according to General Theory of Relativity, gravity ISN'T a force. it is just manifestation of curved space-time. here is an analogy:    imagine there are 2 boats in equator, heading north. suppose initially they are 10 km apart. because they are heading in the same direction, their boats are PARALLEL, right? now, slowly they drift their boats. as time advanced, they noticed that their boats get closer and closer, until finally the boats touch each other exactly on North Pole. How the passengers of these boats explain this phenomena? Now, if the passengers on both boats DON'T know that they live on curved space like the surface of the earth, then they will conclude: there is A FORCE that attract their boats each other; otherwise, how can be their boats get closer each other when they were parallel in the beginning? (this is Newtonian view of gravity). However, if they realize that they live on the surface of a sphere, they will conclude that: THERE IS NO FORCE. their boats get closer because the CURVATURE of space that they live on (this is General Relativity point of view).    according to General Theory of Relativity: the presents of mass-energy curves space-time around it. so, the presence of the sun make space-time around it curved, so that planets that travel in its vicinity don't travel in straight line, but circular trajectory.    a very nice view of General Relativity: space-time tells matter how to move (because it curves space-time); energy-matter tells space-time how to curve
7cHatXQVaa	a) since the data is normally distributed the number of scores above 110 is 50% of the population    b) 160 is 2 standard deviation's from the mean. 95% of the data fall inside this mark. that leaves 5% outside but, half of those are lower and half higher. so it would be 2.5%    c) from b) 95% is within 2 standard deviations from the mean. so the high would be 110+25*2 = 160 and the low would be 110-2*25 = 60. thus, 95% is between 60 and 160|`|cwXsXhnyaa	a) the 68-95-99.7 rule tells you that 50% of the people are above the mean and 50% below.  b) 160-110 =50/25 = 2 2 standard deviations means it is 5% but there can be 2 SD's away(1/2 will be) on the bottom side(lower half) too so it is 2.5%.    c) go 2 SD's away on both the bottom and top (just use the rule)  110+50=160  110-50=60  so the range is 60 to 160|`|uUdWf0cKaa	a) 50% of the people will have IQ scores higher then 110 since 110 is the mean, which is the average so that means 50% will be higher.    b)This one is more fun, but since your sd=25 you add (25)(2) to 110 to get 160. which gets you to the 95% rule, but you have to remember that the rules apply to both sides of your distribution. So you take 100%-95%= 5% but you have to divide that by 2 which gets you the answer of 2.5%. So only 2.5% are higher then 160.    c)For this 95% is 2sd's from the mean which means you take 110 and add and subtract (25) times(2) which gets you 50. Takes thatt 50 and add and subtract it from 110. So your range is 60-160  110-50=60  110+50-60    Hope all this makes sense for you :D

If the endpoints of the diameter are (3,8) and (-7,4), the distance formula gives us    sqrt((-7 - 3)^2 + (4 - 8)^2) = sqrt(116) = 2sqrt(29) for the diameter, so the radius is half that, sqrt(29).    We can also use the endpoints that are given to find the center.  It will be the midpoint of the diameter, so just apply the midpoint formula:    x = (3 - 7)/2 = -2, y = (8 + 4)/2 = 6    So, the center is (-2,6).  Now, plug all this information into the equation for a circle:    (x + 2)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 29
AA10654797	A tether in space would produce its own electricity. This experiment was tried on one of the shuttle missions with a quarter mile tether and the energy it produced was phenomenal. The tether alone would produce more energy than wind generators attached to it.  I'm not quite sure but it has something to do with the difference of speed of one end of the tether and the other. Somehow it produces a large difference in charge from one end to the other. They said a tether so many miles long itself could easily power the city of new york if I remember correctly. Do a search for the term "shuttle tether".  As I remember, it was a mishap with an experiment and when they found the flaw, it was some form of hi electrical current that burnt and melted the tether while testing a satellite.    http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/...|`|NZ5Oj415aa	Balloons raised up to one kilometer make more sense than elevator towers.

The major problem will be storms.  The stress on the tether would be enormous in a tornado.  Who want's to be responsible for the damage caused by a falling windmill?

PSiNv7gUaa	It's difficult for me to face some truths because I love whales so much, but I must admit that I had to stop watching 'Whale Wars' after two episodes, for the simple fact that I'm not entertained by watching people be ridiculous.  There is no sense in putting people's lives on the line trying to stop something that is completely legal, whether it is through a loophole or not.    The International Whaling Commission has specific guidelines for lethal rersearch involving whales, and it also sets limits for how many whales can be taken for research.  Member nations, of which one is indeed Japan, are allowed to issue their own permits, although they are subject to review by the entire commission.  Ultimately, the decision is that of the member nation's, so you could say that yes, Japan is serving it's own purposes under the mask of research, but do your own research and you will find out some interesting things...    For one, even though whale meat/products are a big part of the Japanese economy/culture, Japan DOES do research with the whales they take.  The commission has acknowledged A LOT of very important findings from Japanese whale research.  They could not simply pretend they are doing the research, because they are constantly under review by the commission, and while lethal methods will never be unanimously agreed upon within the commission, there are plenty of members who are not against it.    Also, while I don't enjoy seeing whales be killed, I am glad that the commission requires every part of the whale to be utilized, and Japan does this.  Sure, you can say it's all about the money, but you're totally naive if you think that Japan's the only nation that might do something controversial for the sake of making money.  Plus, what seems cruel to people of one country is completely accepted in another, and who are we to say what's right for another culture, when we have our own that is sometimes offensive to others?    Yeah, it's sad, but whale populations aren't suffering for it, and to be completely honest, I'd much rather see people laying their life on the line for the sake of PEOPLE, or at least a TRULY threatened species.  There are millions of children starving worldwide, but there's not a single show about saving them on the Discovery Network.|`|EQydFhzmaa	It's about time "somebodies" did something.

cDtC6a9Paa	The ocean floor forms at mid-ocean ridges. These are places the mantle is upwelling and partially melting. The mantle is mostly made of lherzolite and harzburgite. When this material convects upwards, the pressure drops and it begins to partially melt. This partial melt forms  a liquid that is a basaltic composition. When it cools at the surface you get a basalt. The resulting residum is a dunnite or harzburgite, depending on how much material is removed (generally around 15% melts at a MOR)|`|BAfWSflraa	because basalts are sediments of corals and harden through water pressure and thermal current.

9iutgEYAaa	Most people think that evolution has a plan, when really its just a bunch of semi random events that build on each other like a game of "Guess Who?" or a Jackson Pollock painting.     Furthermore, it is a common misconception that evolution is forward thinking, or that it creates adaptations to deal with possible future conditions. Nothing could be further from the truth, it only takes what worked in the past and tests it against the present.     One of the most common misconceptions about evolution is that "its just a theory, not fact." In science a theory is one of the strongest truths that can be stated, second only to laws. Gravity, relativity, electronic bonding all these are theories yet no one disputes their validity. Actually, most of science today is theory, with only a few laws, mainly in physics and chemistry, such as Newton's 3 laws of thermodynamics.     Also people think things like "if people evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?" This is a misconception commonly held by very uneducated and ignorant people who don't really know anything more about evolution than the name. The idea of descent with modification is what these people are unaware of. On the bright side, this can be corrected with the most basic biology classes, (with the exception of stubborn individuals unwilling to accept modern scientific reality).|`|XN0cYCATaa	Consider this      Mysteries In Science  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zTXxpXOo...

mvgfatSNaa	Colossal Squid  A species of squid reported to be significantly larger than the giant squid, is called the Colossal squid, officially named Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni. In February 2007 a live colossal squid was brought to the surface in Antarctic waters by a New Zealand fishing boat. This enormous squid, which was determined to be a male of the species, was 10 meters (32.8 feet), and weighed 450 kilograms (992 pounds), making it the largest squid (the largest invertebrate) ever captured. What is even more astonishing is that, from what scientists know about squid species in general, there is great sexual dimorphism in squids, with females being significantly larger than the males. If that holds true for the Colossal squid, this male specimen that was captured could very well be dwarfed by a much larger female of the species.

They ask if you got a tattoo in the last year, if you have had unprotected sex within the last year, if you have engaged in male homosexual sex, if you have prostituted yourself, if you have used intravenous drugs, and if you know of any diseases that you may have.  If you answer yes to any of those questions then they will not let you donate. Oh yeah they also ask if you have had any surgeries or blood transfusions.  If you answered no to all those questions then they will allow you to donate the blood, but they ask you if when they test it if they find anything wrong with the blood such as AIDS, HIV, or Hepatitis do you want to be notified, so you can say yes or no, and then they go and test it thoroughly, and they take the blood that they can use and the blood that they cannot use is disposed of properly.  If there was something wrong with the blood and you elected to have them let you know then they will call you and let you know, or they will send you a letter im not sure I have never had anything wrong with mine so I never had to go through that part but I do know they are very careful and the blood goes through the best testing possible.|`|VOccyg7daa	Each unit is run through a battery of tests.

CRFLKFenaa	1. In plants, photosynthesis usually occurs in the leaves. This is where plants can get the raw materials for photosynthesis all in one convenient location. Carbon dioxide and oxygen enter/exit the leaves through pores called stomata. Water is delivered to the leaves from the roots through a vascular system. The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts inside leaf cells absorbs sunlight.   2. The process of photosynthesis is divided into two main parts: light dependent reactions and light independent or dark reactions. The light dependent reaction happens when solar energy is captured to make a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The dark reaction happens when the ATP is used to make glucose (the Calvin Cycle).   3. Chlorophyll and other carotenoids form what are called antenna complexes. Antenna complexes transfer light energy to one of two types of photochemical reaction centers: P700, which is part of Photosystem I, or P680, which is part of Photosystem II. The photochemical reaction centers are located on the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Excited electrons are transferred to electron acceptors, leaving the reaction center in an oxidized state.   4. The light-independent reactions produce carbohydrates by using ATP and NADPH that was formed from the light-dependent reactions.    Hope this helps!|`|eRYXUlHNaa	photosynthesis really did help to plant, so as to people..By means of this, plants produces foods that helps them grow and obviously, almost half of our daily foods we get from plants..Photosynthesis works this way, sunlight and water works together to provides mechanisms to helps plants produce foods, joined by the carbon dioxide which in turn excrete by plants as oxygen which people breath.
CCeRdaoLaa	I don't think it negates the possibility of an afterlife.  It just shows that, as profound and strange as near-death experiences are, they aren't actually a glimpse at an afterlife.      One could argue that near-death hallucinations were the original source of the concept of an afterlife.  This is too shaky a connection for a definitive answer, though.  One could just as easily argue that, since a person can survive a near-death experience, it's just that - near death - and since they are not truly dead, they haven't actually experienced the afterlife yet.  That, for one to experience the afterlife, one would have to be fully and irrevocably dead, and therefore would be unable to come back and tell the tale.      Like I said, the afterlife is a supernatural concept, and therefore outside of the scope of science, be it for proof or disproof.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	The one thing all near-death experiences, natural or drug-induced, have in common is that the observer has not, in fact, died.

Disclosure note:  I'm a skeptic.|`|F6IOLf3Aaa	I've had an out-of-the-body type experience, just one time some 25 years ago.  It was an experience that was simple burned into my mind. I will never forget what happen there.    I do not believe in gods and devils, heavens and hells, or judgments. Nevertheless, I do believe that something happens to the "essences" at death. However, it has more to do with quantum mechanics and quantum consciousness than with any religious based outcome.    But what I experienced could not be induced or simulated by drugs or mechanical device.  The only thing that I can say about this experience is that it was truly remarkable.|`|zd9dotWHaa	They also did a test in a centrifuge and got the same results.    http://www.near-death.com/experiences/tr...|`|g1ubNxpRaa	good point...I never thought of it that way.

UFteXlqwaa	In the past, seafarers were navigating mostly after the compass. This was a very important piece of equipment on board and the ship master always carried several needles and several lodestones on board.    The needles are made of soft iron and it is magnetized by rubbing a lodestone on it. The operation was often repeated, hence to need to carry lodestones on board.    Today, an electrical coil is used to do that. But what is more needed today is the opposite: to remove the magnetism induced in a metal frame when welding it. This is the case, e.g. for aircraft frames that can affect the compass on board, if magnetized.

AA10067101	Evaporation is the process of converting molecules from a liquid state (water, for example) into a gaseous state (water vapor). You see, all states of matter---solids, liquids, and gases---are made up of molecules. The molecules in solids are stable for the most part, while the molecules in liquids move about more freely, and the molecules in gases are the most active.     Heat (energy) is necessary for evaporation to occur. Energy is used to break the bonds that hold water molecules together, which is why water EASILY evaporates at the boiling point but evaporates much more slowly at the freezing point. Net evaporation occurs when the rate of evaporation exceeds the rate of condensation. A state of saturation exists when these two process rates are equal, at which point the relative humidity of the air is 100 percent. The process of evaporation removes heat from the environment, which is why water evaporating from your skin cools you. Rate of evaporation depends on many factors like temperature, air-pressure etc. Evaporation is a continuous process it never stops at any temp.|`|gM03eKTJaa	Evaporation occurs in an attempt to reach an equilibrium or steady-state balance between liquid and gas. In doesn't have to be in direct sunlight, just in a less humid place.|`|6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	Because the energy contained within the water is great enough to cause it to change forms from liquid to gas.  That's why warm water evaporates faster than cold water, and why water in sunlight will evaporate faster than water in shade.      The rate at which it evaporates depends on a lot of things, including air pressure and humidity.  No, it does not need to be in direct sunlight (you can test this yourself by smearing a drop of water across your desk and watching it evaporate).|`|qveeTggpaa	The sun is a huge factor in the process of evaporation. Well, it just goes to show that it has to be in direct sunlight in order to vaporize/evaporate. The sun usually reaches a certain temperature wherein it is enough to change liquid molecules into gas(evaporation).
D5QgyGbXaa	The diagram is drawn on a flat sheet of paper.  The moon and earth and sun are in 3 dimensions of space.  The moon's orbit is tilted slightly (9.2*) from the plane of the earth's orbit.  It is rare that the moon passes directly behind or in front of the earth so that sun, earth and moon are in a perfect line.  That happens when there is an eclipse and those are rare.  Lunar eclipses on average about once or twice a year, and solar eclipses much less common.  But most of the time the moon passes either below or above the line of the earth and the sun.  There is no eclipse then, so we have a normal full moon, and two weeks later, a new moon, also with no eclipse.

Environmentalism is a convenience of being rich, something the US is becoming less and less of.  When people are poor, they don't bother themselves so much with these issues.  If you are going to get an engineering degree, leave the politics aside and get a degree in something practical.

BDKqYOSraa	Two different conditions, SF.    Ecthyma is deep skin infection, a more severe and deeper form of the Staph infection impetigo.     By proderma I assume you mean pyoderma gangrenum, a non-infectious necrotic skin condition.  Pyoderma gangrenum is not infectious (although it may look like an infection). It is probably an autoimmune reaction like rheumatoid arthritis and chron'c disease. (In fact, it sometime appears along with autoimmune diseases).|`|RgSCstkAaa	Ecthyma is an infected ulcerated condition of the skin differing from impetigo by being caused exclusively by beta-hemolytic streptococcus and by being rather deeper in the tissue.    Pyoderma literally means pus under the skin, but this can be misleading. Dogs and cats appear to get a true bacterial pyoderma, but in humans the word is a shorthand for pyoderma gangrenosum (I think it should be gangrenosa, but doctors don't learn Latin these days), which is not a bacterial infection at all. It appears to be a disorder of the immune system.

Everything we know comes from observations with light (telescopes) , math and some theories or assumptions that are supported by experimental evidence.    Surveying and star observation to get the size of the earth.  experiment and theory to get the speed of light.  Parallax or position shift and geometry to get planets and the nearest stars. Brightness of stars to get some distance. Red shift, discovered by the astronomer Hubble to get the expansion of the universe.  The hidden assumption that we can in fact know something about the distant universe because we believe, but cannot be sure, that the laws of physics are the same in all places and for all time. If that was not true we could not know anything.    We may have learned a lot in the last few hundred years, (before about 1400 there was no "scientific thought" ).    What we do NOT know vastly exceeds what we do know

No answer is applicable|`|GAel6aReaa	correct ---- the universe is finite.   it did have a beginning, but might not have an end.     the big bang released the matter/energy to make everything in the universe.    all that energy has already be converted into new forms of matter.    we don't see new energy entering the universe from the source of the big bang, so there is not more building blocks for new stars, galaxies.    now stars can explode, and their gas can collect into say two groups, making now, two smaller stars.    this goes on and on... until stars cannot be made since the matter is too spread out.     BUT the problem is we can only see certain parts of the universe. beyond that its just to far to see. is there something else there?  could there be no end to the universe.    probably not.          depends on how you define and use the term infinite.    in response to the thumb    if it had a beginning it can't be infinite.   if the universe is expanding and nothing can stop it, then it goes on infinitely.     these are confused terms.    yes. we can really only for sure, speak about the observable universe.... thats why I brought it up earlier.     but, as far as we can see, we're not making new galaxies.  for the most part, galaxies get collected by other larger galaxies.    "Its mere speculation to begin with" this is true.

4J8X1aKkaa	The 1st, 2nd, 3rd world categories are no longer used by geographers or social scientists, although the labels seem to be sticking around in common vernacular.    The definitions were established during the Cold War. The 1st World were Industrialized Capitalistic nations.  The 2nd World were Industrialized Communist nations. The 3rd World was non-industrialized nations. This is why Jordan was considered 3rd world.  At the time they were mostly non-industrialized.    Today the system used is a sliding scale defined on the brackets by more or less developed.  A nation isn't one or the other but lays somewhere on a scale between the two.  A more developed nation has certain statistical and demographic characteristics like high life expectancy, low infant mortality, lower reproductive rates, higher literacy, and higher access to goods and services.  A less developed country would be just the opposite. Countries in the middle that are experiencing a change are generally referred to as developing nations.  This is based on the assumption (for right or wrong) that countries undergo a natural evolution towards development.|`|py57svUyaa	I guess somebody somewhere came up with a table of requirements to be a developed country or not.

UkjnSyAvaa	This is a myth based on the irresponsible, (and repeated) airing of a ridiculous pseudo-documentary on the History Channel. That network, and the Discovery Channel and Fox, will air anything they feel will get a bigger audience. Sometimes, their shows are good and worth watching. Other times, they are foolish, sensationalist, tabloid-style hype. It is often difficult to tell which is which, unless you know about a subject. I know about the history of doomsday predictions, pseudoscience, and astronomy.     The Mayan calendar does not predict the end of the world. They did keep an accurate calendar, but contrary to popular opinion, never predicted any world event accurately. They couldn't predict their own demise; why should they be able to predict ours?  The alignment with the galactic center is not going to happen. It comes fairly close to happening EVERY year on Dec 21, and will be exactly the same as it always is, in 2012. Even if some perfect alignment did occur, there is nothing about it that could affect the earth. It's like saying, "When these three parking spaces are occupied by three red cars, the world will come to an end."    Doomsday prophets have always been around and they are always wrong. Every 5 to 10 years, some prediction catches the public's attention and scares a lot of kids...usually thanks to irresponsible media decisions. Dozens of different doomsday scenarios have been piggy-backed on to this date since the show aired. Go to this site to see how many predicted apocalypses we have already missed.    http://www.abhota.info/index.htm    All that Nibiru stuff is bunk, too. No such planet has ever been discovered.

For example, today's date, January 28, 2009, at 12:04 is the equivalent of 12.19.16.0.18 in Mayan Long Count. The first number corresponds to the b'ak'tun cycle. The Mayans say that each world consists of thirteen b'ak'tun cycles.    December 20, 2012 is the last day of the thirteenth cycle, or the long count 12.19.19.17.19. This means that the next world would in theory begin on December 21st, and somewhere between the 20th and the 21st, this world would end.    This concept entails to many people that there will be some sort of event that will cause the end of this world and bring about the beginning of the next, which is supported by the fact that the mayans were very accurate when it came to astrological and other events. But there is evidence that things will continue without much interruption by the fact that the Mayans believed that we are currently in our fourth world, implying that there will be more. There is more evidence against the apocalypse theory in the ancient past, demonstrated by the apparent end of the last world, on August 10, 3114 BCE, which is not linked with any particular world event.    While it is a nice concept for fiction writers, there is no evidence that there will even be any disruption of every day life at all in 2012.    -giusti|`|zd9dotWHaa	Predictions on when the world will end have come and gone for thousands of years.

However, the soot is not from burning air or from burning the balloon.  It's from incomplete combustion (burning) of the candle and wax.  Let's think about this, if it's from burning of air, then why don't we get soot from a gas stove top?  There's definitely a flame there and it's burning in air.  You don't get soot because the air/fuel ratio is quite good resulting in a blue flame.    The soot is also not from burning the balloon, because if it was, then that implies bits of the balloon is being burnt and as such the balloon would burst after you hold the candle flame in the same spot for a while.  You will find that until all the water is boiled off, that balloon will not burst from a candle flame.    You can get a water balloon to burst if you use an extremely hot flame such as from a blow torch.  That's because the heat being supplied by the blow torch is too high for the water to carry the heat away quickly.  This causes a localized heating and will burst the balloon.  In that case, you would be burning away parts of the balloon.|`|NAh9XhWLaa	the balloon didn't pop because there wasn't sufficient energy... i.e. there was no sufficient heat,,    the soot forms from the burned balloon..|`|3ba1cfb6f1e2efe26bbdc86a8515e2fdaa	Its thermodynamics.

AA10332086	Minimum recirculation lines are typically used for multistage pumps that need a minimum flow rate to prevent damage to the pump. I believe it has to do with maintaining thrust balance and possibly flushing the clearances between stages. The reference below refers to a magazine article that addresses this in more detail.     In any case the minimum flow recirculation needs to only be open when the flow rate drops below the recommended minimum. This is usually an automated systems using flow measurements and controls valves.

Because they have a limited amount of mitochondria that can only work so fast, only a certain amount of glucose can be processed at a time.  1)If there is an excess of glucose, the mitochondria will work as fast as they can to create ATP (energy) from it- think sugar high. The bad part about this is that if they work too hard for too long, they will wear out. The cell can make more mitochondria, but if it is having to make mitochondria really frequently, the cell machinery will wear out too. (This is why to much sugar can cause your pancreas - made of cells - to malfunction, leading to things like diabetes)  2)If there isn't enough glucose, the cell won't have energy, and won't be able to carry out cellular processes, and die.

UFteXlqwaa	This is an interesting winter question: When it snows, are the clouds made of snow flakes? Ice? Water? The answer is: All of the above.    In order to go from gas to liquid, liquid to solid, or gas to solid (sublimation) water needs to give away energy in form of heat.    The inverse is also true and that is the reason we perspire; the evaporation of the sweat cools down our skin.    But tiny water molecules has nearly no mass and they can hardly change state without being in contact with something - anything! A corn of dust, pollen, smoke particle, will do.    I read that, theoretically, tiny water droplets can be cooled down to -45 degrees Celsius before freezing by itself.    I own and fly a light aircraft and when I read the weather forecast for aviators, I see e.g. 0-isoterm FL 35. It means that I can expect to meet temperature 0 C (Celsius. Sorry, I live in Europe! :-) at 3,500 feet.     And that is a warning that if I am to climb in a cloud, I can expect to see undercooled moisture above that altitude. Since I don't have de-icing devices like big airliners have, when that undercooled water meets the leading edge of my wings and propeller, it freezes instantly as the mass will dissipate at once the heat. That will create a fast growing ice cap on the surfaces and bring the plane down in a matter of minutes, if not seconds.

LVEDLcObaa	if two resistors are connected in series with each free end connected to the +ve and _ve poles of the battery or power source the two free free ends cud be denoted by th + or - sign to indicated the potentials at the two free terminals. depending on the value of the resisteors, their common [connected] ends could carry a potential which is zero volts [if both resistors are of equal value] or either +ve or -ve in value with respect to the -ve or the +ve poles of the powers supply/ batt. This is the only way a schematic cud indicate a +ve or a -ve value accross a resistor or at the common ends of the resistor. Such schematics are found in circuits using op amps where a voltage comparator has been used to trigger a switching device. Other wise as already mentioned resisors are polarity indipendent.|`|pInY6rYqaa	Resistors are polarity insensitive.    What you have is not a resistor.|`|wVkJ5jTfaa	There's a voltage drop across the resistor.  Depending on how you look at it, current flows from positive to negative or vice versa.   The convention I learned is that it flows from negative to positive in a DC circuit.   In a simple circuit the side of the resistor on the same side as the negative terminal of the battery in the circuit would have a negative sign on that side in the diagram.   Battery negative -> negative sign -> resistor  -> positive sign -> positive terminal of the battery.
2YkEQrmvaa	It depends on who you talk to.    Many scientists (me included) acknowledge the fact that throughout the earth's history, climate change is totally normal.  The past 20,000 years have been an anomaly in that the temperatures have been pretty stable.  Climate change is NORMAL for the earth, regardless of human activity.|`|hq80t0NJaa	The suns rays come down to earth as short wave lengths and normally reflect (not perfectly, especially if the surface it hits is dark) back into space as long wave lengths - aka heat. As this heat goes back into the atmosphere, however, it hits molecules there and leaves some heat behind. The more molecules in the air, the more things for the long waves to hit, and the more heat that will be left behind.  Also, as temperatures raise in the air because of higher CO2 content, temperatures in the oceans can raise. As temperature raises in water, it loses its 'ability to hold' solutes in concentration. Basically what this means is that the warmer the water gets, the more it will release the gases dissolved in it. The oceans also hold a lot of CO2, among other things. As this CO2 is released,  it goes into the atmosphere, raising temperatures more.  And as temperatures raise, the permafrost (ground that is frozen really deep) on earth begins to thaw out and not refreeze as well. Permafrost contains organisms that release a lot of greenhouse gases when they break down organic matter. This means a lot of methane (which has a bigger effect on global heating than CO2 does) is released, helping the climate change more.  There are a lot of other interconnected things like this. An important thing to note is that this release of CO2 happens naturally on earth over the course of thousands of years (we have ice samples that show CO2 levels in the atmosphere varying between 120 parts per million and 300 parts per million), but humans have significantly sped up the process (we can see that since the industrial revolution - when we started burning fossil fuels, CO2 levels have skyrocketed. The last time I checked, the CO2 in the atmosphere was at 384 parts per million).  :) sorry for being long winded

XHSl0wKzaa	one way to model this is:  s(t) = 112 (1/2)^(t/4), where t is time in days    5 weeks = 35 days, so you're finding s(35)  s(35) = 112(1/2)^(35/4) = 112(1/2)^8.75 = .260    .260 mg will be left after almost 9 half-lives    or, using s(t) = s(0)e^(kt)  we first need to find k using the half-life  56 = 112e^(4k), since after 1 half-life, half the material will be left  .5 = e^(4k)  ln .5 = 4k  k = (ln .5) / 4    now we have s(t) = 112e^(t (ln .5) / 4)  s(35) = 112e^(35 (ln .5)/4)  s(35) = .2601  so again, .26 mg left after 35 days (5 weeks)    quick sanity check  1 half-life  56  2 ==> 28  3 ==> 14  4 ==> 7  5 ==> 3.5  6 ==> 1.75  7 ==> .8525  8 ==> .42625  9 ==> .213125  since 35 days is not quite 9 half-lives, we should have a little more than .213 left... yep, it makes sense

C4k4Tcmjaa	Humidity is playing an important role in how good you're able to handle high temperatures. In Arizona, it's dry, so you can have much higher temperatures than in Florida, where it's wet. Dry heat doesn't mean you're not going to sweat, but less than what you would do in Florida.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	It is hard to say what your body would do within the heat. Every person is different.

You will also sweat in dry heat. Another advantage of Arizona climate, it gets cool at night|`|Vnoifl1jaa	In terms of pure temperature, in degrees fahrenheit/celcius, Arizona has MUCH hotter actual temperatures in the summer than Florida, and considerably colder temperatures in the winter than Florida.    In July-August, Tucson often gets above 110 fahrenheit, and Phoenixoften gets above 115 fahrenheit.    You aren't going to find temperatures anywhere near that in Florida.    And in the winter, the entire northern portion of Arizona, and any elevated areas, even in south Arizona, can get very cold, and dip below 0 fahrenheit, which you aren't going to see happen in Florida.    As far as wet vs dry, this isn't referring to you and how much you are sweating.  It is referring to the humidity of the air.  As in, how much liquid moisture there is floating around in the actual air.    Arizona is a huge desert, so it is known for having typically very very dry air, with very low humidity, and Florida, is a swamp area, so it is known for the exact opposite, being very wet, with tons of humidity.  In hot temperatures, the more humid it is, the hotter it "feels".  So sometimes even if it is 105 fahrenheit in Tucson, and only 90 in Florida, it can feel hotter in Florida, due to the dramatic difference in humidity.    I hope that helps.

qtuaCHetaa	Raj,    If you compare the increases of concentrations with the rates, you will see that hte reaction is first order in both reactants:    The first and second sets show that holding I^- constant, as S2O8^2- goes up 1.5 times, the rate went up 1.5 times.    The first and third sets show that as I^- is doubled, and S2O8^2- goes up 1.5 times, the rate went up 3 times.  But since the reaction order is first order in I^- (which then was doubled), then the reaction id first order in S2O8^2- (2*1.5 = 3).    So, the rate of the reaction is    Rate = k*[I^-]*[S2O8^2-]; k = Rate/[I^-][S2O8^2-]    Lets step through these:  k = Rate/[I^-][S2O8^2-]  k1 = (2.6 x 10^-6)/((0.018)*(0.036)) = 0.00401  k2 = (3.9 x 10^-6)/((0.027)*(0.036)) = 0.00401  k3 = (7.8 x 10^-6)/((0.036)*(0.054)) = 0.00401  k4 = (1.4 x 10^-5)/((0.050)*(0.072)) = 0.00389    The average value is therefore (0.00401 + 0.00401 + 0.00401 + 0.00389)/4 = 0.00398 = 0.0040 M^-1s^-1 (two sig figs)    Hope that helped!

1Q9ldcWSaa	Recall that the hypotenuse of a right triangle (the side opposite the right angle) is the longest side.  Therefore, the two shorter sides of the triangle are the width and the height.    Let x = width and 100 - x = height.  This works because width + height = x + (100 - x) = 100.    The area of a triangle is .5*base*height, or .5*width*height, in this case.    f(x) = area = .5x(100-x) = 50x - .5x^2   f'(x) = 50 - x = 0 --> x = 50 is the critical point  f''(x) = 50    Since f'(x) = 0 and f''(x)>0 at x=50, the area is maximized at x=50.    Therefore, the largest possible area is .5*50(100-50) = 1250 in.^2 (we are multiplying in. by in., so we get in.^2)|`|RrvJ99uaaa	A right triangle has maximum area when the legs are congruent. If the sum of the legs is 100, then to maximum area, each leg would be 50. Given that the area of a right triangle is .5 times the product of the legs (the legs are "ready-made for base and height), the area =   ,5 (50) times (50) = 1250.  ---    As an extension, the rectangle which maximizes area for a given perimeter is the square and the plane figure which maximizes area for a given perimeter is the circle.
c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	You can theoretically fit a curved surface represented by a polynomial to run through all of these points.  A first order surface (solution of the form f= ax + by +c) would be planar (flat or linear) which is clearly not suitable here (your boundary values - they are not variables - do not line up and there are 4 of them, the solution only needs 3) so it would be desireable to try a second order polynomial expression to exactly fit the points.    This takes the form f = ax^2 + mxy +bx +py^2 +qy + c  where a, b, m, p, q, c are all constants.    To determine these 6 constants requires 6 independent  boundary conditions and you have only 4.  Can you find another two?  Otherwise in looking for an f(x,y) we will be confined to a best-fit flat plane (see above) which cannot pass through all the points.

Balance by the total money,   x + (3/4)x + (1/2)x = 900000  Multiply by 4,   4x+3x+2x = 4*900000  9x = 4*900000  x = $400000, inherited by Scott  (3/4)x = $300000, inherited by Alice  (1/2)x = $200000, inherited by Tricia|`|XHSl0wKzaa	let S be Scott's share  so A = (3/4)S and T = (1/2)S    together: S + A + T = 900000  S + (3/4)S + (1/2)S = 900000  (4/4)S + (3/4)S + (2/4)S = (9/4)S = 900000  multiply both sides by 4/9 to give:  S = 400000    so Scott get 400000  Alice gets (3/4)400000 = 300000  Tricia get (1/2)400000 = 200000  yep, it adds up to 900000|`|u2H68wiaaa	900,000 = S + 3/4S + 1/2S, where S = Scott's share  900,000 = 2.25S  400,000 = Scott's Share  400,000 * 3/4 = 300,000 = Alice's Share  400,000 * 1/2 = 200,000 = Tricia's Share|`|RMdKNJWtaa	It should be something like this:    Scott receives x.  Alicia recieves 3/4x.  Tricia gets 1/2x.    So the problem would look like:    1x + 3/4x + 1/2(3/4x)= 900,000  1x + 3/4x + 3/8x = 900,000    Add the x's up... = 900,000 so:    17/8x = 900,000    Divide both sides by 17/8 and you'll get x.

TMB4d3FAaa	Africanized bees are a problem. If you live in their range I beleive your local government has a procedure to protect the populace. Call city hall for their solution. If you are having swarms now, you evidently live in the Southern hemisphere or in a warmer area of the northern one. Call your county extension agent.  In our county I am one of the registered beekeepers that remove swarms. When I arrive to remove swarms, as high as 75% are wasps/hornets instead. This causes a significant increase economically for each real swarm I extricate. Like a lot of others, I am going to have to charge a show up fee starting this coming summer.  Swarms in the Northern hemisphere are generally not an economical gain for the beekeeper until the next year if collected atter the middle of June., if they survive.  In the Southern hemishpere I would interpolate it is the same after Christmas is true down there?  There should be local beekeepers clubs near you.  Call your entomology department of your nearby University they should know who to contact. With the Colony Collapse Desease wiping out such a major portion of our bees, you should not have difficulty finding someone to remove your swarm. If they are already in your walls decide before hand what you will remove to access the swarms. Who repairs the damage? I see pictures in the papers that in areas like Los Angeles the fire dept. removes bees.  Around here in Indiana they'd just laugh at you.  We don't have the "Killer Bees". yet.  Bees will only attack if they feel the hive is in danger. Some like the Africanized Bees are a lot quicker to respond to even minor disturbances. Without knowing what kind of bees you have and. where you are located it is extremely difficult to give you a definitive answer to your questions..|`|um6rmdegaa	see if there is a bee keeper in your area--i think he would be glad to get them.  if not in phone book call the zoo and mabe they know of someone, also  possibly fire department

e1b7fa175ee86774c026fbd4b9b163a4aa	B hydrogen fluoride...in D the dipole moment cancels out....  and fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine having a value of 4.0 compared to chlorine having a value of 3.5  hope this helps;)|`|FgoII4aAaa	B:  The answer is B because fluorine is the most electronegative element on the periodic table.   Electronegativity goes hand in hand with polarity.  Fluorine bonded to itself is not polar because the electrons are being shared equally, so there are not any partial charges.   tetrafluoromethane is not polar because since the carbon is surrounded by all fluorine, the electrons are being equally shared and there are no partial charges.   Hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride are the only two left, and since you are now aware that Fluorine is the most electronegative, which means it pulls electrons to itself, the fluorine is more partially negative than the chlorine is (which is also electronegative)

CM1dfztQaa	First of all, I never listen to stats like that. They aren't very scientific because they are based on human emotion... Follow your heart. The medical field is very demanding mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically. It requires on-going education throughout your career, and the loans in crewed from grad school are usually extensive and take years to pay off. Know in your heart that this is your passion before you start on that path.    If you're passionate about the medical field but not sure about becoming a physician, you may consider looking into other aspects of the medical field first. It's okay to get your feet wet in the shallow end of the pool before jumping off the high dive. Good Luck!|`|AA10481903	The Health care system is definitely in crisis.  Government interference will worsen as politicians try to solve the crisis they created by doing more and more of the things that caused the crisis!  So, health care as a career will become more and more challenging (and more frustrating).    So, should you enter the health professions?  Yes ... if you are highly motivated to serve people as a healer.  No ... if you are only looking for a high-income career.    Best wishes and good luck.|`|3b71155316600300855e8677f67125edaa	Absolutely.  My advice is to make an educated decision.  You can gain a lot of experience by volunteering, working part time, etc. in the medical field.  This will give you valuable experience which you can use in your career, AND, it will help you to evaluate your decision.  I think that some of these physicians saw their first patient in medical school and then realized that the job was not for them.  Find out first.  You may love it!

I have had people buy things from overseas and think they were getting something like an antibiotic and died from it.  So I dont reccomend it.
oUjuw66uaa	Only way to INSURE that you don't have any progeny with albino genes if you are in a relationship with her is :  Don't have any kids.  Other wise, there is a possibility she will pass her (non-dominant/repressed) albino gene on to your children, though they would also be non-albino in either case. (Unless either of YOUR parents were also albino). If neither of your parents where albino, then what's the difference if they carry the gene (repressed)??|`|8wpav3nwaa	Ok, here's how it works. There are two kinds of albinism: OCA and OC1. You need to find out which one her father has to get your answer.     OCA is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This means two things of importance to you: your future wife could be a carrier of the OCA gene, even though she is unaffected, AND it means that in order for your children to express albinism, you must *both* be carriers of the OCA gene. The solution for this problem is to obtain counselling from your health care provider to determine if you are at risk for passing on this gene to your offspring. (If you are both carriers, you will have a 25% chance of having an albino child. If she is the only carrier, none of your children will express the OCA gene.) If any of your wife's brothers or sisters has albinism, she can probably obtain genetic analysis to determine if she herself carries the gene.     As for the other type, the gene for OA1 is on the X chromosome. Therefore, if your wife's mother is not a carrier of OA1, your wife does not have it and none of your future children are at risk. So, if her father has this type of albinism, he has not passed it on to her.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	let an african american inseminate her?|`|2rSZZvyEaa	you correct, it would be very indescant to have albanian childran. my suggest is investment in colouring-pigmants.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Adoption.|`|niVtwCCVaa	marry her but have kids with some other woman, and just tell her that the kids are hers.

NwbgvzfXaa	First we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance.    R5 is in series with R6  R5 + R6 = 500 + 500 = 1000 ohms    R4 is in parallel with the above resistance  The symbol || represents "in parallel with"  R4 || 1000 = (500)(1000)/(500 + 1000)  R4 || 1000 = (500000)/(1500)  R4 || 1000 = 1000/3  since the quotient is a repeating decimal, I will leave it in fraction form to maintain greater accuracy in the calculations to follow.    R3 is in series with the above resistance  R3 + 1000/3 = 500 + 1000/3  R3 + 1000/3 = 1500/3 + 1000/3  R3 + 1000/3 = 2500/3    R2 is in parallel with the above resistance  R2 || 2500/3 = (500)(2500/3) / (500 + 2500/3)  R2 || 2500/3 = 1250000/3 / (1500/3 + 2500/3)  R2 || 2500/3 = 1250000 / 4000  R2 || 2500/3 = 312.5    R1 is in series with the above resistance  R1 + 312.5 = 500 + 312.5 = 812.5ohms  So the total equivalent resistance = 812.5ohms    Knowing the source voltage and the total resistance, we can calculate the total current.  Total current = It = 9v / 812.5 ohms = 11mA  This total current flows through R1, so It = I1.     V1 = I1 * R1 = 11mA * R1 = 11mA * 500ohms = 5.5volts  V2 = E - V1 = 9volts - 5.5volts = 3.5volts  I2 = V2 / R2 = 3.5volts / 500ohms = 7mA  I3 = I1 - I2 = 11mA - 7mA = 4mA  V3 = I3 * R3 = 4mA * 500ohms = 2volts  V4 = V2 - V3 = 3.5 - 2 = 1.5volts  I4 = V4 / R4 = 1.5volts / 500ohms = 3mA  I5 = I6 = I3 - I4 = 4mA - 3mA = 1mA  V5 = I5 * R5 = 1mA * 500 = 0.5volts  V6 = I6 * R6 = 1mA * 500 = 0.5volts    The voltage at node X (with respect to ground) is the same as V2.  The voltage at node Y (with respect to ground) is the same as V4.

8wpav3nwaa	This is a complicated question in disguise! It turns out, the usage of the common names 'frog' and 'toad' have no real taxonomic basis. (Both frogs and toads belong to class Amphibia, order Anura. All members of Anura are frogs, and family Bufonidae('true' toads) is a member of Anura.) Therefore, all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.     That information is practically useless to someone who is just curious about the creatures in their garden, though. So, the general rule of thumb is: toads have the bumpier, drier skin, less webbing between the toes and tend to prefer land habitats. Frogs are the smooth, wet/slimy/sticky guys with the webbed feet that tend to be hanging out really close to the water. (There are many, many different species of frogs and toads, so there are sometimes exceptions to this rule. )|`|ku2tP4eEaa	They are different enough to be classified in to different Families.  Frogs and toads are in the same Order, Anura.  But then frogs and toads are separated further in to Families.  So yes they are separate species, but species within the Family.    The most obvious difference between frog and toad is the skin, smooth for frog, rough for toad and the feet.  Webbed for frog and not webbed for toad.  http://allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/f...|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Frogs live in and around the water as where toads live in fields and woodlots.|`|VFx4YHFEaa	Toads have warty body's and thick for arms, were as frogs have smooth skin and a more slender type body's.
805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Ever hear of a magnifying glass? Get a large magnifying glass and focus the sun on a spot in the water. In 15 minutes you'll have your heated pool. <br>  <br>  Then go and find some ants and focus the sun on them.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I assume you can use any small bowl or dish as the pool, and you just have to add something to it to make it heat in sunlight and add a thermometer to see how well it works.<br>  <br>  If those assumptions are right, then here are things for you to think about.  Light has to reach either the water or something in contact with the water, so that light that gets absorbed and turned into heat heats the water.  Dark colors absorb light better than light colors, so if you can find a dark colored bowl, the light could shine through the water and heat the bowl under the water.  A larger bottom area (shallower pool) absorbs more light than an smaller area (deeper pool). So a soup plate may be better than a coffee cup.<br>  <br>  But the heating process is racing various cooling processes.  One big cooling process is the evaporation of water.  Another is heat leaking out into air around the water.  You might reduce evaporation by stretching a piece of saran across the bowl to trap water vapor near the surface of the water.  Light can still shine through the film and heat the water.  <br>  <br>  Heat also leaks out of anything that is warm and uninsulated, so adding a layer of insulation (styrofoam or cotton wool  or knitted bulky cloth) under the bowl will slow the heat leakage from that surface.  You can't put this stuff over the saran layer, because that would block the sunlight from getting in to make the heat.  Bit, if you can add a ring spacer over the edge of the saran covered bowl that makes a slightly higher edge, you can put a second saran layer over the first to make something like a double pane window that has a thin layer of trapped air between the saran layers, and that will act as transparent insulation for the top.<br>  <br>  Then you need to either punch a thermometer through the two layers of saran (difficult to do neatly) or slide it between the bottom of the bowl and the lower insulation.  Either will let you see if you are getting the required temperature rise.<br>  <br>  Now all you have to do is find a spot with bright sunlight to let it heat.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish

4maLlESdaa	You can't just divide the area of the earth by 500 meteorites because that doesn't account for the possibility of more than one meteorite hitting the same area.    The probability that a single meteorite will hit a person is (6.7*10^6) / (5.1*10^8) = 0.013137    And of course you can't just multiply this by 500. Instead figure the probability that none of the 500 meteorites hits anyone. This is:    (1 - 0.013137) ^ 500 = 0.0013439    So the probability that at least 1 meteorite hits is:    1 - 0.0013439 = 0.9986561    (however, that area covered by people figure seems awfully high, so I don't think the real probability is that high)

zCHnMeXbaa	The greatest influence on ice sheet size is Temperature.  High and low temperatures affect ablation and insolation rates.  Thus, I believe the correct answers are ablation and insolation.     Accumulation in the winter can be minimized or negated by high temperatures leading to a small gain or zero gain of snow.    Density of Ice Crystals implies density of Ice Pack.  The overall effect of density is still debatetable in reference to sheet size.|`|sX9Ilrpxaa	According to my climatology textbook:    "Continental ice sheets exist in regions where the overall rate of accumulation across the entire mass of is equals or exceeds the overall rate of ice loss or ablation." p. 156    "The Milankovitch theory proposes that when summer insolation is strong, more radiation is absorbed at Earth's high latitudes, making the climate in these regions warmer.  Warming accelerates ablation, melts more ice and snow, and either prevents glaciation or shrinks existing ice sheets."    A) Areas were ice sheets accumulate generally get very little accumulation anyway (the antartic is considered a desert and is still covered in glaciers), so this is definitely not the most significant factor.  B) Ablation in the summer is clearly very important, as stated above, because it either prevents or shrinks glaciers.  C) Density of ice increases as you get deeper into a glacier, but does have much affect on the overall size.  D) Though insolation is an important control factor for ablation, it is summer insolation and not winter insolation that matters.  It will probably be cold enough in winter to form a glacier regardless of winter insolation strength if you are in a climate cold enough for glaciers to form at all.    Long story made short, I'd say 3) Ablation in the summer.    Hope I helped without boring you to death :)

Hw5xFK0qaa	Since k = A e^(-Ea / RT), when comparing two rates with the same frequency factor, A, we get:    k1 / k2 = e^(-Ea1 / RT1) / e^(-Ea2 / RT2) = e^[(Ea2 / RT2) - (Ea1 / RT1)]    For Q1, we have T1 = T2 = -42 C = 231 K    So, k(cat) / k(uncat) = e^[(Ea(uncat) - Ea(cat)) / RT]    (Ea(uncat) - Ea(cat)) / RT = (14.0 kJ mol1 - 11.9 kJ mol1) / (8.314 J K1 mol1 * 231 K)  = (14 000 J mol1 - 11 900 J mol1) / (8.314 J K1 mol1 * 231 K)  = 1.09344...    So, k(cat) / k(uncat) = e^[(Ea(uncat) - Ea(cat)) / RT] = e^1.09344... = 2.98454...    Thus, the catalysed reaction occurs almost 3 times as fast as the uncatalysed at the same temperature.  ___________________________________    For Q2, we have T1 = T2 = -32 C = 241 K    And, k(cat by Cl) / k(cat by O) = e^[(Ea(O cat) - Ea(Cl cat)) / RT]    (Ea(O cat) - Ea(Cl cat)) / RT  = (11 900 J mol1 - 2 100 J mol1) / (8.314 J K1 mol1 * 241 K)  = 4.891015...    So, k(Cl cat) / k(O cat) = e^[(Ea(O cat) - Ea(Cl cat)) / RT] = e^4.891015...  = 133.0886...    Thus, the availability of chlorine free radicals as catalysts increases the rate constant of the reaction by a factor of approximately 133 (3 sig. fig.) at -32 C.  For equal catalyst concentrations and comparable mechanisms (ie Rate = k[O3][caatalyst] for the rate equation in each case) the reaction rate is 133 times faster with chlorine radicals available.    NB... bearing in mind Q1, this means something like 400 times faster than the uncatalysed reaction...
qtuaCHetaa	heyheyfuff,    This is a bear... stay with me; I'll try to keep it clear:    The first equilibrium involves two reactions:    The forward reaction of Cl2 --> 2Cl, with a rate constant of k1; rate (step 1, forward) = (k1)[Cl2]  The reverse reaction of 2Cl ---> Cl2, with a rate constant of k-1; rate (step 1, reverse) = (k-1)[Cl]^2    At equilibrium (fast), these two reaction rates are equal, so (k1)[Cl2] = (k-1)[Cl]^2 (so far so good?)    ******    The second equilibrium also involves two reactions:    The forward reaction of Cl + CO --> COCl, with a rate constant of k2; rate (step 2, forward) = (k2)[Cl][CO]  The reverse reaction of COCl ---> Cl + CO, with a rate constant of k-2; rate (step 2, reverse) = (k-2)[COCl]    At equilibrium (fast), these two reaction rates are equal, so (k2)[Cl][CO] = (k-2)[COCl]     *****    For the purposes of this problem, the questioner poses the third reaction to go in only one direction (but in fact, it probably has its own equilibrium):    The forward reaction of COCl + Cl2 --> COCl2 + Cl, with a rate constant of k3; rate (step 3, forward) = (k3)[COCl][Cl2]    This is the rate-determining step since it is slow.  However, since it involves a "transient specie" (COCl, which is quickly generated, but then goes away in this step), we want the rate expression to not involve it.  It should, instead involve only the species involved in its formation in the second equilibrium:  CO and Cl.  Note that Cl is involved in the first equilibrium -- this is where it gets hairy, so stay with me!    ** (k1)[Cl2] = (k-1)[Cl]^2; so [Cl] = {(k1/k-1)[Cl2]}^1/2  ** (k2)[Cl][CO] = (k-2)[COCl]; so [COCl] = (k2/k-2)[Cl][CO]    So, rate(step 3, forward) = (k3)[COCl][Cl2] = {k3*(k2/k-2)*(k1/k-1)^1/2}[CO][Cl2]^3/2 = {k}[CO][Cl2]^3/2    NOTE:  this last equation tells you the answer to the second question:  the overall constant k = k3*(k2/k-2)*(k1/k-1)^1/2 ===> this is the same as choices 1, 3, and 4 (something to the 1/2 power is the same as SQRT); the second is wrong, as is the fifth:  >  k = [k(2)k(3)/k(-2)][k(1)/k(-1)]^(1/2)    >  k = [k(1)^(3/2)+k(2)+k(3)]/[k(-1)^(3/2)+k(-2...    >  k = k(3)[k(2)/k(-2)]sqrt[k(1)/k(-1)]    >  k = {k(2)k(3)sqrt[k(1)]}/{k(-2)sqrt[k(-1)]}    >  k = [k(-1)^2k(2)k(3)]/[k(1)^2k(-2)]      *****    OK, to the last step:  which of the rate equations is right?    d[COCl2]/dt = k[Cl2]3[CO]  *** No, since the rate of appearance of COCl2 is dependent on Cl2 to the 3/2 power, not 3***    d[COCl2]/dt = k[Cl2]3/2[CO]  *** Yes, this is correct for the appearance of COCl2, since this fits the overall equation we got above for step 3, forward***    -d[Cl2]/dt = k[Cl2]3/2[CO]  *** Yes, this is correct for the disappearance of Cl2.  This is reflected in the third step, which was rate-determining***    d[COCl2]/dt = k[CO][Cl2]2/3  *** No, this is not correct for the appearance of COCl2, since we just saw the dependence of Cl2 is to the 3/2 power, not the 2/3 power    d[Cl2]/dt = k[Cl]2  *** No, this would have been correct for the appearance of Cl2 in the first reaction alone, but the first step and third step, forward reactions are also depleting the Cl2.  The appearance rate would therefore be d[Cl2]/dt = k1[Cl]^2 - k-1[Cl2] - k[Cl2]3/2[CO], etc.***    -d[CO]/dt = k[CO][Cl2]3/2  *** Yes, this looks correct for the disappearance of CO; it depends on the same factors (i.e., through the rate-determining step) as the disappearance of Cl2, and the appearance of  COCl2.    Hope that helped!

The complexity of bridge design increases very rapidly with the required span.<br>  <br>  So far as I can tell from what you write in your question, the span of your bridge is unspecified.  This gives you the opportunity to make a bridge to cross a very small span - choose for example 5 mm span.  Then simply place one of your balsa strips across the 5mm gap (a simple plank bridge) and start hanging weights on it.<br>  <br>  You also don't mention that any material other than balsa strips is allowed so I must assume that no glue or bolts (for examples) are permitted, otherwise where does the use of other materials end - I could use an aluminium bar!<br>  <br>  With the above restrictions the very short span plank bridge will beat anything else hands down - and that is strictly according to the criteria of your specification!!

vqS7zSsGaa	Energy in the system before the collision = mv^2 from the block + mv^2 from the bullet.  Since the block was at rest, this is just mv^2 from the bullet.    Energy in the system after the collision is the same (conservation of energy).  Subtract the energy from the bullet after the collision, and the rest must reside with the block.  Divide that by the mass of the block to get v^2 for the block, and finally take the square root of that for the velocity of the block.

DdnyatRraa	When you poor water into a plastic bag and nothing can escape this represents how water will be kept in or outside the cell membrane. This is because the membrane is made of molecules that are O= =O all around. So the head (O) is hydrophobic (hates or is afraid of water) and the tails (= on the inside) are hyrophylic (water loving). Now the "fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane" also notes that the membrane is semi permeable, meaning some things can enter, but not leave. Or leave and not enter. The sand is kept in/out and can only be removed by active transport, and cannot diffuse out like the water.|`|1tRAmnnuaa	The water would move over to the bag with the sand. This is due to the tendency of water to want to reach equilibrium. This is important to cells because they need to have the proper pH to survive. But if a cell takes in too much water it can burst and die, and vice versa.

The number 16 can be written 2^4.    We now have the following exponential equation:    2^(3x - 1) = 2^(4)    Since we have the same base 2 on each side of the equation, we simply equate the exponents and solve for x.    I will equate them and you solve for x.    3x - 1 = 4    Can you finish now?|`|P1H5RCZDaa	Your equation does not seem to be quite clear. Hence I shall assume that your equation is this :    (2^3)(x-1) = 16    Firstly, we solve the first bracket to the left.  2^3 = 2 X 2 X 2 = 8  Substitute that back into the equation.    Now we have : 8(x-1) = 16  We shall expand the variable on the left first.  8(x-1) = 8(x) - 8(1) = 8x - 8  This is because all the terms inside the bracket are multiplied by the number 8.  We substitute this back into the equation.    Now we have : 8x - 8 = 16  We need to separate the variable (x) from the numbers.  Hence we shall move -8 over, leaving us with :  8x = 16 + 8       = 24.  From here, it is very easy to solve the variable.  8x = 24  x = 24/8 = 3    I believe that the answer is x = 3.

This is ok because when you have a number to a power to a power (2^3)^2, you just multiply the two exponents and the end result is the same. Here we've done that backwards.    8^x=17    Next, I would recommend taking the natural log (commonly displayed as ln) of both sides of the equation.    Your equation should look like:    ln(8^x)=ln(17)    By doing this, you give yourself access to one of the great properties of logarithms, which is that you can pull the power of the stuff inside the log (like if you had ln((x^3+2)^2) you could bring the 2 down to in front of the log).  This gets the x on its own in a way that it can be solved for (basically out of that pesky power spot.  Your equation should now look like xln(8)=ln(17).  Now just divide both sides by ln(8) and you'll have    x=ln(17)/ln(8).    It is this answer because this is what the math lead us to by following the rules of math.  That sounds like crap I know, but really is the most honest way of putting it.|`|NAMAv4Jkaa	2^3x-1 = 16    2^3x-1 = 2^4    (to solve this you have to make the bases the same)    3x-1 = 4         (these are the powers)    3x = 5    x = 5/3     THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE THE GUY ON TOP SAID 3/5 which is WRONG    You can check by subbing x into the original equation

k5Ece8BTaa	When you look at the sky on a clear and starry night, you would find millions of stars blinking at you in colors of blue, red and yellow. Have you ever wondered why stars twinkle and also why they have different colors? Twinkling of the stars are caused by the turbulence in the earths atmosphere. Remember, the atmosphere of the earth is made up of several layers and each layer has different temperature and density. Twinkling of the stars is caused by the refraction when the light passes through each layer.     The different colors of the stars are white, red, yellow and blue. The color of a star determines the temperature of the surface of the star. You need to know that a star emits light in various colors of wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The surface temperature of a star determines the wavelength of the star. If the surface temperature is around 3,000 K degrees, then the color of the star is red and it is orange if the surface temperature is 4,000 K degrees. The color of a star is yellow when the surface temperature is 6,000 K degrees. When the surface temperature is above 8,000 K degrees, the color emitted appears white and if the temperature ranges between 20,000 K to 50,000 K degrees, then it is blue.     The wavelength of blue color stars is short and it is an indication that these stars have higher surface temperature. While, the colors such as red, orange and yellow have longer wavelengths of light indicating that the star's surface temperature is low. The stars such as Antares and Betelgeuse are orange in color, while the star Rigel is blue in color. The astronomers can determine the surface temperature of the stars by looking at the colors.|`|6v1LIdcaaa	Cool stars (i.e., Spectral Type K and M) radiate most of their energy in the red and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus appear red, while hot stars (i.e., Spectral Type O and B) emit mostly at blue and ultra-violet wavelengths, making them appear blue or white.|`|W2suykEtaa	its complicated.    there is a wide variance in surface temperatures for stars.    most likely, if you are trying to understand this question for a High School class, that will pretty much peg it.    if you have a really nerdy and touchy prof in college, you are going to need to know more.  (probably not)    at temperatures lower than the surfaces of M class (red) stars, on Earth we call that "white hot"... as objects in the 2800 F + range tend to over-stimulate the receptors in our eyes and all we get is white.    try not to think about it too much, unless Mr Smarty Pants Prof requires you to.|`|E0U2yII3aa	First, it's all because of their mass and age which in turn relates to their temperature.

oaJcgz3uaa	a) "P" is the dependent variable because it depends on the age of Americans in 2005.  An easy way to look at it is that "a" is part of the actual calculation - you have to manipulate "a" to get "P", meaning if you change "a", "P" changes.    b)  When it asks you to evaluate P(20), it's asking you to substitute 20 for "a" in the equation:       P(20) = 0.015(20^2) - 4.962(20) + 290.580     P(20) = 0.015(400) - 4.962(20) + 290.580     P(20) = 6 - 99.24 + 290.58     P = 197.34 (in millions) or 197,340,000    This means that the population of 20 year old Americans in 2005 was 197, 340,000    c)  Again, the question is asking you to substitue 0 for "a" in the equation:       P(0) = 0.015(0^2) - 4.962(0) + 290.58     P(0) = 0 - 0 + 290.58     P(0) = 290.58 (in millions) or 290,580,000    This means that the popluation of people age "0" (newborns) is 290,580,000

gCn6bXAFaa	Hate to be redundant but;    There are lots of beekeepers who will take them away for free, in fact its often a race to get there first.  if you don't know any beekeepers call the entomology dept. at the nearest university, they can put you in touch with an extension agent who should be able to pass along your request to a beekeeper.    This is usually true. however, if you live in an area that has been colonized by africanized bees than beekeepers wont come get a swarm because of the likelihood they are at least some africanized genetics. (check out the map on wikipedia, but the map doesn't include florida for some reason; they have AHB) Even if the bees must be killed your extension agent should again be able to solve this problem for you.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	I'm thinking a beekeeper might take them away for free.

Unfortunately, I suspect that the fire department will send you a bill, even if they do remove the bees themselves.|`|UQTktOw3aa	don't call the local fire department because they put out fires not bees. all yu have 2 do is leave them alone.and if not hose them away|`|2rSZZvyEaa	mr. chlo who answer above is correct, fire department only is fires. you must call bee department.
4CMENEKnaa	Roman engineering was far more impressive than Aztec engineering.  The Aztecs, Toltecs, Olmecs etc. built pyramidal structures 2000 years after the Egyptians, so it wasn't like the Central Americans were well ahead of the old world there.  The Roman roads, aqueducts, sewers, and temples were all far more complex and impressive engineering feats than the American pyramids.  Aztec roads, in contrast, were glorified footpaths which were developed only because walking took so long you had to have inns and facilities at regular intervals.  I don't see the engineering superiority of the Aztecs.      In terms of technological development, one better question is whether we would have touched the sky by now had not Rome been sacked by the barbarians, leading to the Dark Ages and stagnation of technology until the Renaissance.  A second one is how far would we have progressed had the ancient Chinese not stopped exploring the world in the early 1400's.  The Chinese technology at that point surpassed anything in Europe.

98NzArC9aa	"Not correct because the universe has *no* center of mass. There is no center of the universe. No matter where you are in it, that point appears to be the center."    Not 100% correct aswel, although what you said is in fact the most plausible possibility the big question is, since we can only see around 13 billion years in all directions, does the universe end at that threshold? The most obvious thing that comes to mind is, NO, is just that further light has not reached us yet. But will an observer at that 13BLY threshold only be able to see a 13 billion light years radius aswel?

Which makes sense to exist, why wouldn't energy from the big bang clump together and not keep going, something had to get them to patch up in some parts. This "rough pic" was rough because of our gravity messing with the waves. Using the space station, they made a clear map of part of our universe.

Not correct because the universe has *no* center of mass. There is no center of the universe. No matter where you are in it, that point appears to be the center.    The farthest we've been able to look into space so far is 13.7-billion light years. That's just about as far as we'll ever be able to see because not far beyond that horizon space and everything in it is receding from us faster than light (..that's allowed by relativity because it's space receding FTL and not any mass within it moving *through* that space faster than light..)|`|AA10654797	Of course it is! Dont you think we would know what was out there if we could see forever?|`|JwPu0XbIaa	You can't use the point-mass assumption unless the orbital radius is large compared to the object being orbited.  And when the object being orbited is all of the mass in the universe, you have the added complications of the mass expanding outward in all directions, and possibly of the universe curving back on itself in a fourth spatial dimension.    I think an orbit is too much to hope for under these circumstances.    However, light can orbit a black hole, going in endless circles.  I suspect this would occur at a radius equal to that of the event horizon, but I could be wrong.

eiim3tJuaa	http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t...  White with black stripes or black with white stripes?    This is one of the most-asked questions about zebras. So what's up with the stripes? Zebras are generally thought to have white coats with black (sometimes brown) stripes. That's because if you look at most zebras, the stripes end on their bellies and toward the insides of the legs, and the rest is all white. However (there had to be a catch, right?), some zebras are born with genetic variations that make them all black with white stripes, or mostly dark with the striped pattern only on part of their coats. And as it turns out, zebras have black skin underneath their hair. So it kind of depends on how you look at it!|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Black with white stripes.

Here's why: while it may be true that certain animals display a skin pigment beneath their markings which matches the color of the fur on the marking, zebras are not one of those animals. If you shaved a zebra, it would be solid black. Like most African equids(horse relatives), zebras exhibit a common evolutionary adaptation to living in the hot equatorial sun: black skin. Animals with white skin don't survive very well in the hot, sunny climate(amongst other things, white/pigmentless animals in such an environment are highly susceptible to hypercalcemia and skin cancer). Additionally, certain morphological similarities between the modern zebra and it's extinct and domesticated relatives support the case for the zebra to be described as "black with white stripes"--both the quagga and the modern Arabian horse have black skin.|`|kSlycVwnaa	white with black stripes|`|OOTYgIpHaa	neither, it's a unicorn with no horn...ok ok, I always believed it was white with black stripes|`|2gn5Z6Ppaa	I say is white with black stripes cause the chest is white and if you can measure the skin in cm2. you can look they have more percent of white skin than black skin.

nhwvYAJ6aa	Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-size mineral or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, gray and white. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.<br>  <br>  Some sandstones are resistant to weathering, yet are easy to work. This makes sandstone a common building and paving material. However, some that have been used in the past, such as the Collyhurst sandstone used in the north of England, have been found less resistant, necessitating repair and replacement in older buildings.[1] Because of the hardness of the individual grains, uniformity of grain size and friability of their structure, some types of sandstone are excellent materials from which to make grindstones, for sharpening blades and other implements. Non-friable sandstone can be used to make grindstones for grinding grain, e.g., gritstone.<br>  <br>  Rock formations that are primarily sandstone usually allow percolation of water and are porous enough to store large quantities, making them valuable aquifers. Fine-grained aquifers, such as sandstones, are more apt to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices, such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity.
AA10921480	Wow!  What a great career goal, good luck to you!<br>  <br>  A quick search of a few vet schools revealed some interesting information.  Some of them require a certain number of pre-vet hours and some of them require a degree for admission.<br>  <br>  Check the admission requirements for the schools you wish to apply to.  If they only require hours, ultimately the vet school will confer your degree.  If they require a degree, then your current program may not be adequate for admission.<br>  <br>  Understanding the requirements of the school you wish to attend will ensure that you are properly prepared when application time rolls around.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|AA12186643	The best advice is to get a degree because you may not get in to vet school right away.

So when we say the nth term, it's like say the "fourth" of "fifth" term, except we give a letter n to represent any number- which can be useful.    For instance, in our sequence above: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...  The n=1 term is 2  The n=2 term is 4  The n=3 term is 6  etc...    So to describe each number in this sequence, we could say every number is twice its "n", or twice the page number. So we say the nth term is 2n.  This allows us to answer the question of, say, what is the millionth number in the sequence?  2*n = 2*1000000 = 2million.|`|jh4gw3O8aa	In polynomials the nth term... is the nth term. lol  Example:  5x^3+6x^2+2x+1  1st term: 1  2nd term: 2x  3rd term: 6x^2  4th term: 5x^3|`|RLesi9dkaa	there is usually a sequence of numbers and the n in nth tern just means the number thet is in the nth position for example, if they said find the 10th term in 2;4;6;8;10; then 10th term= nth term=20

Hw5xFK0qaa	For recrystallisation, you want the solubility of the substance to be high in the hot solvent but low when it is cooled, so that the desired product will crystallise whilst impurities remain dissolved.  The most likely reason for poor recovery in this case is that the solubility of biphenyl is too high at room temperature, and so most of the biphenyl remained dissolved.  In order to increase the yield, the student could try cooling the benzene solution in the hope that the solubility of biphenyl at the lower temperature is sufficiently low for a substantial amount to be recovered.  Another approach would be to add a second miscible solvent that alters the solvent polarity sufficiently to decrease the solubility of biphenyl - as the second solvent diffuses into the mixture, the biphenyl should crystallise out.  A third approach might be to remove some of the benzene with a rotary evaporator so that the amount of solvent in which the biphenyl is dissolved is reduced.

While the number in decimal is greater than 0, divide it by two over and over again.  Each time you do (and once before you divide it), prepend a bit to your accumulator from right to left.  Prepend the bit '1' if the decimal number is odd, and the bit '0' if the decimal number is even.    So, start with 26 and an empty accumluator  26 => '0'  13 => '10'  6 => '010'  3 => '1010'  1 => '11010'  0 -> We've reached 0, so we're done.

9Wi2eNInaa	Fractional distillation can be used but there is no advantage.    Simple distillation is used because it is simple and it boils and separates quickly. But that's why they only use it on a two component nonvolatile chemical and one volatile chemical.    When you boil rapidly you put in a lot of heat and if both components were volatile and had a close boiling point then they both would evaporate together and would be condensed together.    So in other words you would get no separation and the distillation was for naught.    That's why they only use a nonvolatile chemical and a volatile with at least 25 C temperature between their boiling points ( the more spread on the boiling points the better candidate for simple distillation)    That way when you start to boil it only the volatile chemical boils and leaves the nonvolatile behind (actually depending on it's vapor pressure , a small percentage still gets boiled and condensed)    So if you have very wide boiling points you will get a clean separation with simple distillation. The closer you get in boiling points the "dirtier" the separation and then it becomes a candidate for fractional distillation.    Fractional distillation is the same as simple distillation except when you boil the closer in boiling point ingredients  components boil out, but when you condense it you don't just leave it.     You return the components back to the boiler and keep reboiling and condensing until the purity of the product is acceptable.    So like I said, simple and fractional are the same boiler, they are just different in what they do with the condensate. With the reboiling, the fractional process usually takes much longer and more energy than simple distillation

Wrf5orAuaa	A normal light bulb has a tungsten filament in argon or nitrogen gas. A halogen bulb also has a tungsten filament, but in a small globe with halogen gas. The halogen gas and high temperatures generated by the small globe makes the tungsten evaporate. If the temperature is high enough, the halogen gas will combine with tungsten atoms as they evaporate and redeposit them on the filament. This recycling process lets the filament last a lot longer.

SYSCiRhsaa	The 12 is the mass number, the number of protons plus the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus.  It is often written 12C.  To find the average atomic mass, you would multiply the mass number by the percent composition, add up the values, and then multiply that by the number of isotopes.  For example if 99% of earth bound carbon is 12C and 1% is 13C, then the average mass is (120.99) + (130.01) which equals 12.01.  You would divide this number by 2 and you get 6.0050.  These are not the exact compositions, but that is the method you use to calculate it.|`|AA10116627	Carbon-12 is the most abundant of the two stable isotopes of the element carbon, accounting for 98.89% of carbon; it contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons.    Carbon-12 is of particular importance as it is used as the standard from which atomic masses of all nuclides are measured: its mass number is by definition 12.
HQZsotL7aa	lack of double bonds between the carbons of each fatty acid. so instead of having double bonds that would require less hydrogen atoms in each molecule, you have fatty acids that are saturated with many hydrogen atoms.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	It contains as many hydrogen atoms as possible.|`|SYSCiRhsaa	Fatty acids are made up of primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  some oxygen atoms at the acidic end.  Carbon forms four bonds, either four single bonds or some combination of single and double bonds adding up to four.  Carbon forms stable bonds with hydrogen, and under normal conditions the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can bind to a single carbon atoms is four.  When carbon forms the maximum number of bonds we say that it is saturated.  A fatty acid in which the carbon chain contains only CC and CH single bonds is called a saturated fatty acid.  Here is a simplified depiction of what would be a very short fatty acid:    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v201/t...    Note that the central carbons are not shown, so    H  |  H    represents    H  |  C  |  H    This is a common convention in organic chemistry.      In order for carbon to form a C=C double bond it would have to give up  one of its other bonds.  This would be an unsaturated fat, because the carbon chain is not "saturated" with the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms that it could hold.  Instead, two of the carbon atoms have given up a hydrogen to form a double bond, like this:    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v201/t...    Note that there is a C=O double bond but this is not considered part of the "carbon skeleton" or "parent chain" of the molecule and so does not affect the assignment of saturation or unsaturation.

This would obviously impart the same energy to the arrow.     s=1/2. at^2 so t = sqrt(4/8000) = 22.36ms  v =at =8000 x 0.02236 =179 fps.

FCPD6ShOaa	Before I start, keep in mind that everyone is different.  What works for me might not work for you.  There are lots of methods out there, but i'll only share a few that have worked for me.  Let's begin:    Most techniques involve entering into a state of deep relaxation or trance.  Personally, I don't have the patience for those techniques.. as they typically require extensive practice and effort.  But, there is a way around it....    When we sleep at night, we enter a trance state twice; during the "sleep-awake" borderline... once when falling asleep, once upon awaking.  Do you know that groggy feeling you get when you wake up?  Yeah, that's cuz you're in a trance.. your mind is fuzzy, and you can easily fall back asleep.  This is the mind state you want to be in.    So the trick is to set an alarm before you go to sleep... have it set so it will go off after you have been asleep for 4~6 hours.  Now, you want to try falling back asleep, but try to keep your mind awake... keep your mind focused on something... an object, possibly the last dream you remembered before waking up, etc.  The more vivid you can imagine something, the better... otherwise just concentrate on the darkness and emptiness you see.    As you drift off back to sleep, you might start to feel vibrations or hear a ringing in your ears; you might even get sleep paralysis... these are symptoms of an OBE... you may or may not get them.  When you get vibrations either keep concentrating on the object, place, etc.... or just try to get out of bed as you normally would.    If you chose to focus on an object or place, you might find yourself out of body in some strange place.... try to be aware of whats going on, as it is easy to "lose" it and slip into a dream... our minds think differently while having an OBE... hard to explain, but you are more "gullable" so to say... irrational things become rational, and you can become easily mislead into believing that you are really awake.  So just try to pay attention to your surroundings.    If you chose to just get up out of bed, same thing applies... pay attention to your surroundings... it is VERY REAL.  I suggest looking around your room for objects that dont belong, etc.  You can try jumping, but that doesnt always work... you can also try looking at your hands... you'll find they might start to disintegrate, or look different than your physical hands.    That's all the time i have for now... i might post more techniques here later.  It does take some time to practice.. don't lose hope.    Good luck.|`|4zspYrGXaa	The Monroe Center out East has an excellent program on OBE.

ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	I have some knowledge of drugs like this and I have never heard of it being sold as a lithium salt.  It contains no lithium itself, being merely carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.      Most likely, if sold as a salt it would be the one of the sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts.  It does increase blood levels of lithium if lithium is co-administered, this is a known drug interaction.    You may be thinking of ibuprofen lysine, in which the lysine increases the solubility of ibuprofen.|`|SYSCiRhsaa	Ibuprofen does not contain any lithium.  It's molecular formula is C13H18O2.  Lithium is a naturally occurring mineral so I suppose it is possible that specific batches are contaminated with very small amounts of lithium but I cannot think of any reason why that would be.      I think you may be confused because ibuprofen can increase the concentration of lithium in the blood.  This is a warning for people who are taking prescription lithium and who may be considering taking over the counter ibuprofen.  Lithium is a very effective and relatively safe medication, but the difference between the therapeutic dose and the toxic dose is very slim.  People who are on lithium usually have to get regular blood tests to make sure that their blood lithium concentration is in this normal range; not too low to relieve symptoms and not high enough to cause liver damage.    Ibuprofen increases the concentration of lithium in the blood not by adding more lithiumit does not contain anybut through some other biochemical interaction.  If you are taking lithium I would not recommend taking ibuprofen without first speaking to a health care professional such as a physician or pharmacist.  If you are considering starting lithium therapy be sure to tell your prescriber about all of the medications that you are taking, including over the counter meds like ibuprofen, other prescription medications, herbal supplements and vitamins.

kQbd57tqaa	the theoretical concept of the ability of reindeer to fly clearly exemplifies that the earth is round.  Reindeer operate like a planet orbiting around the sun, reindeer appear to be flying when in actuality they are falling around the earth.  How exactly that they gain the propulsion to be able to fall around the earth?  The answer lies in the cocoa.  Santa Claus, aka "Satan Claus" drinks the cocoa that Mrs. Satan makes for him.  This is composed of a complex mixture of beans, cheese, and chocolate powder.  This mixture produces extremely forceful farts from big jolly Satan Claus.  You ask why it is that he never sharts?   The secret is in the chocolate.  anyone who eats chocolate with foods that cause bad gas will be immune for the proverbial shart.  So as Satan Claus rips butt, the sleigh along with the reindeer leave the north pole with such force that they fall "AROUND" the earth.  how could they fall around the earth if the earth wasn't round?

So there was only one day when the sun was exactly overhead for a while.  He sent a servant to a place a hundred miles away, and at the exact time that the sun was shining to the bottom of the well, the servant saw that the sun was not overhead at his location, and he measured the angle of the shadow that was made by a vertical pole.  From that angle Eratosthenes figured out how big the diameter of the earth is, and his calculation was pretty close to what we know now.

f9iKFMCHaa	We use integration by parts where we INTEGRATE the x and DIFFERENTIATE the arcsin5x.      the new term under the integral sign becomes (x^2/2)5/(1-25x^2)^0.5.      Now we substitute x = sint/5, such that dx/dt = cost/5.  That way, the denominator becomes cost.  The numerator becomes (5/2)(sint)^2/25.  We are left to integrate (1/50)(sint)^2, because dx/dt cancels out the denominator.      The integral of (sint)^2 is (t+sintcost)/2.      Therefore, putting our answer together, we have the x^2 arcsin(5x)/2 which did NOT appear in the integral sign, then we subtract (arcsin5x)/100 + (5x)(1-25x^2)^0.5/100    Hence, x^2 arcsin(5x)/2 - (arcsin5x)/100 + (5x)(1-25x^2)/100 is the antiderivative.      Simply substitute x = 0 and subtract this (0) from F(1/5) = (1/25)arcsin(1)/2 - (arcsin1)/100 = (arcsin1) (1/50-1/100) = pi/100.      This is a fairly long problem, so feel free to point out any errors.

AA10244921	There are actually a few different methods that are used.  Redshift is one method.  This makes use of Hubble's Law.  One guy already mentioned parallax.  The idea behind parallax is this:  hold out your finger in front of you.  Close one eye.  Now close that eye and open the other.  You'll notice that your finger shifts compared to stuff in the background.  The closer your finger is to your face, the more it shifts.  Using geometry we can calculate the distance to nearby stars using this method.  The Earth's orbit acts like the distance between your eyes.  We look at the star in summer and then look at the same star in winter and see how much it has shifted compared to "background" stars.  The shifting is really small because the stars are so far away, so this method is only really accurate for nearby stars.  Here is another method thats used for stars that are further away: Imagine you have a candle that shines with a known brightness.  You know that same candle looks dimmer when its further away.  If you know what the brightness is, and you know how far away one candle is from you, then you can calculate how far away a second similar candle is by measuring its brightness.  There are certain kinds of stars that burn with a predictable luminosity.  We can figure out how far away some of these nearby standard candles are using parallax.  We can then use these special stars to figure out how far away other galaxies are by measuring their brightness in those galaxies.      To NIK|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	There are different techniques used to determine distances of astronomical objects.  The red-shift or blue-shift can tell us an objects velocity away from (red) or toward us (blue), this relationship to an objects distance only works for distant objects like galaxies or quasars, it is due to the expansion of the universe in between us and the object.  So it does not work for individual stars, we can not see individual stars at that distance.    At 1 million light years you are about halfway to the next large galaxy, Andromeda.  That puts you in intergalactic space where there is not much in the way of stars.    For closer stars, the parallax technique works.  For more distant stars, they use a "standard candle" technique: comparing observed brightness to absolute brightness.  Absolute brightness of certain types of stars is pretty well established, like Cepheid variables.  This works if you can observe these individual stars, which can be done for the closer galaxies.  Beyond that distance is where the red-shift is used to gauge distance.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	As we believe the universe is expanding then the further away a star is from earth the faster it is moving away from us.As the speed of light is constant the light from distant stars has a shift in its light bands towards red ie red shift.The more red shift the further the star is from earth. Its hard to prove these theories by verifying the distances involved but the physics seems to add up to a sensible theory and with space probes and telescopes like hubble astro physics is very advanced however we are still learning and yes it is possible that some factor of error will exist in our calculations however i believe we have a good guess even though we may not know everything.  The shift is in the spectoral bands which are vertical lines.These lines can be compared with lines obtained from our sun or other stars known to be closer to earth and a difference is obsevered in their spectoral lines and is related to the distance from earth or so the theory goes !|`|LepOqaN4aa	Scientists know everything,  But tbh, how do we know if they;re wrong, we dont.

Yes you are right, it is very difficult to predict the the age of a star just by looking at its colors, as you have only said after many years traveling the age & color of that star changes. But for that light of the star to be visible to us Its size should be hugely big! because it has to be visible to you from one-million light years away. Hence I conclude that those stars are not visible & you cannot see their light either!|`|lO0keUAUaa	The particular distance you have chosen is a bit of an "in-between" range.  The Milky Way is around 100,000 to 150,000 light years across so a star a million light years away is not in our galaxy.    The other large galaxy in our Local Group, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light years away, thus a little further.  It's distance was originally determined by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s by measuring the period of Cepheid Variable stars, the 100-inch Hooker telescope being the first to be able to resolve the nebula sufficiently to study these individual stars.  One could also do a rough reality cross-check by assuming Andromeda was roughly the same size as the Milky Way and thus inferring its distance from its apparent angular size as viewed from Earth.    The Large Magellanic Cloud is on the other size of your chosen range, at about 160,000 light years away.

But this is what teachers want, so let us try and satisfy them:   Think about what is meant by the statement that 1 atmosopher = 101.3kPa  Imagine a table exactly 1m x 1m which has an area od 1m2. There is a force of 101,300N pushing down on this area. Now calculate the mass that would ahve to be evenly distributed over the area to generate this force due to gravity: We know that F = m*a, so the mass would be   101,300 = m *9.81  Mass = 10,326.2kg  If you convert this to pounds, multiply by 2.2045, you get 22,765 pounds  Now 1 square meter = 1 550.003 1 square inch  So divide 22,765 by 1,550 and you get = 14.68 pounds per square inch    So 1 atmosphere, 101.3kPa = 14.68 pounds per square inch.

wSUouQO1aa	the 2+ on the Barium isn't an exponent, it's just the charge. So the carot symbol is unneeded. Now, if you look at a periodic table, you'll see that Ba is on the left side, second column. That means it has a charge of +2, whereas elements in the first column have a +1 charge. the first four columns starting from the left are positive (consecutively) except for transition metals. They have multiple charges. Starting from the right, consecutively, are negative charges. SO4 2- is a polyatomic that you're supposed to memorize. SO4 is called sulfate and when you see them together like that, you know that it's charge is -2    therefore, for part one, you would write the formula, so balance the charges. Ba has a +2 charge and SO4 has a -2. So if you add the two charges together they equal zero, therefore the formula is BaSO4  Check solubility rules, sulfate should be soluble except when combined with a few elements, i forget if Ba is one of them. If the coumpound is soluble, then it's aqueous (means it dissolves in water)    for part two, you just need to know the names of the elements and polyatomics. Ba is barium and SO4 is sulfate. Therefore the name is Barium Sulfate|`|hQvpRIBkaa	1) BaSO4 , solid  2) barium sulphate

PrarLmbxaa	Like the person above stated, there isn't any conclusive evidence to either one, which most likely leads one to think that it must be some of both.  That's why the question is always presented as "Nature or Nurture?"  Because people are still trying to figure it out.  If you think about it, in my opinion it HAS to be some of both, maybe one more than the other at times, but still BOTH.  Not all people who are abused as children become killers, but there is a connection.  Not everyone who grows up rich is greedy.  I think the utopian society is not possible.  I think a small utopian community of a VERY small number of people would work, but what would be the point if the rest of the world were in chaos?  Anyway there are plenty of arguments to each thing you listed and for either nature or nurture.|`|ToztjpAsaa	I don't know of any conclusive evidence, but simple observation shows that children do tend to grow up like their parents and I think a lot of what you describe is learned behaviour.

The Jesuit maxim "give me the child until he is seven, and I will show you the man" has a lot of truth in it.|`|42tTsVuxaa	This is a age old question, there is no conclusive studies.

TIvdCg2taa	In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio between the sum of those quantities and the larger one is the same as the ratio between the larger one and the smaller. The golden ratio is an irrational mathematical constant, approximately 1.6180339887498948482    At least since the Renaissance, many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio - especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio - believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio because of its unique and interesting properties.    The golden ratio is often denoted by the Greek letter ? (phi).    Relationships:    1.  The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the Fibonacci sequence are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987,      2.   Fibonacci sequences appear in biological settings, in two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, such as branching in trees, arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruitlets of a pineapple, the flowering of artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone. In addition, numerous poorly substantiated claims of Fibonacci numbers or golden sections in nature are found in popular sources, e.g. relating to the breeding of rabbits, the spirals of shells, and the curve of waves. The Fibonacci numbers are also found in the family tree of honeybees.    Hope this helps :)|`|M3k9GOSsaa	Fact 1:  "At least since the Renaissance, many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratioespecially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratiobelieving this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing."

Pictures using this ratio will be very pleasing to look at, hence it is "golden")    Fact 2: The golden ratio has fascinated intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years.    Fact 3: First Appearance of The Golden Ratio: Phidias (490430 BC) made the Parthenon statues that seem to embody the golden ratio.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	The golden ratio is approx 5 to 8, which is roughly like a DVD case.    It seems that the human brain is "pleased" by things that have this proportion, and the strange facts are that it appears a lot in nature.    The arrangement of sunflower seeds in the head of the flower, and the way that bees build their hives is also linked to this proportion. This ratio is also in evidence in tree branches and the veins of leaves.    Architecture and painting also feature the golden ratio very often.

D0znfBeXaa	You are almost done.    First of all, the dimensions of U  W and U + W satisfy        dim (U+W) = dim U + dim W - dim (U  W).     You got that  dimU = dimV = 2, dim (U  W) = 1    and dim (U+W) = 4.  Let's verify :  4 = 2 + 2 - 1  wrong...    So where is mistake? Actually you made a mistake checking   independence of all 4 vectors together. The base of U+W is,   for example, {(1,1,1,0); (-1,2,0,1); (1,0,1,1)}, dim(U+W) = 3.    Now you can find  a vector other than the zero vector which is   orthogonal to all the vectors in U+W.    I think you will solve it successfully :)    The answer: (3, 1, -4, 1)

This one allows you to add an amount to several tests with one fill of the pipette.  For example, some tests require acidification with one ml of acid for each sample.  You can then put one ml of acid into 10 different samples before you refill.  Starting with zero can be easier this way.  I have done this while analyzing dozens of sulfate samples at a time.
TmKNObTZaa	Organic Farm Business Planning   A successful business always includes a good business plan. A new agricultural enterprise needs to produce profits to be worthwhile for the farmer. In order to assess if a new crop or product, like organics, will work for your business you'll need to "run your numbers" and flush out the details by preparing a sound plan. The process of developing a business plan allows entrepreneurs to spot risks and pitfalls in a new idea and determine the profitability of that idea. In addition, lenders and funders may require a business plan prior to financing your operation.    Agricultural enterprise budgets act as a financial decision-making matrix wherein the farmer inputs all costs and returns to determine the profitability of a crop or livestock enterprise. Although enterprise budgets are only estimates, they provide an idea of what a farmer can expect to make when producing and selling a new crop.

Zero tillage is difficult in an organic system - tillage is the best way to control weeds in an organic system.    You need to contact an organic certifier recognized by the USDA if you want to be certified organic. There is an expense associated with this.     Your local extension office may be able to put you in contact with a USDA recognized certifier.|`|FxWppY7Baa	There is a whole lot more to organic farming than not using chemicals (and as another answerer pointed out organic farms do use chemicals, just not synthetic ones). the basis for a well managed organic farm is the soil. if you cannot build healthy fertile soils than you might as well throw in the towel.     from your question it sound like you do not farm and do not have much experience with farming. So you need to get a job on at least one organic farm as this is the best and fastest way to learn the ropes.     You should also plan on attending some sustainable agriculture conferences as this is another excellent way to learn a lot quickly. Feb and march are the top months for such conferences    http://www.rodaleinstitute.org has about the best information on the web for organic farmers.

If you don't want to use any chemicals then that would be chemical free farming which is different than organic.    With organic, you would believe a molecule is good because it is natural, the same molecule if made artificially is bad.  You don't have a problem using the molecule only if it is made artificially.    Chemical free, you wouldn't use chemical at all, whether natural or synthetic.    So let's say you have diamonback moths eating your cabbage.  The chemical free farmer would have to find some nonchemical way to control them.  The organic farmer would likely use pyrethrin an insectice extracted from chrysanthemums.  A farmer who was not bound to either of the philosophies would likely use a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide.    Terms are kind of fluid for instance the chemical free farmer might use and insect growth hormone even though it's a chemical, the organic farmer might use the insect growth hormone even though it's synthetic and so on.    Anyway, other than following organic methods, you start an organic farm like any other.  You should look on the USDA website and contact a certifying agency that's in your area and you pay them each year to certify you are following proper organic practices.  They should visit your farm a couple of times, take a look around and check things like your books to see you aren't buying semiloads of urea from Saudi Arabia.    There have been some funds to help small farmers with the cost of the certification, I'm not sure what the status of that program is.

bKYAj1v8aa	The answer is 14.     First remember your order of operations:  p -please--parenthesis  e -excuse -- exponents  m -my -- multiplication  d -dear -- division  a -aunt -- addition  s -susan or sally or whatever you want -- subtraction    The above is used to remember what order to follow when doing problems such as the one you are faced with.    9-2(10+(-5) + (-3))    1. As suggested by the order of operations, do the math that is found in the parenthesis. Remember, that you also need to follow the order of operations when doing the math that is found in the parenthesis.In this case, the math has to do with the addition of positive numbers and negative numbers  .                              9-2(10+ (-8)) --> 9-2(2)    2. Now that you have rid yourself of the stuff nside the parenthesis go back to the order of operations to see what is next. As you can see, multiplication is next BUT in this case we must pay special attention to see what else can be simplified. Simplify the  9-2 and then go on to do the multiplication.                                      9-2(2) --> 7(2)    3. Finish it off                                        7(2) = 14    EXTRA: Notice  that if you would have gone through with the multiplication before the simplification of the 9-2 back in step 2 then you would have gotten the same answer.                                 We had this: 9-2(2) --> it could have been written 2(9-2)    We distribute the 2 to the stuff inside the parenthesis:                            2(9-2) --> 18 - 4 = 14    Hope this helps.|`|JGQsowK9aa	First you do 10+(-5)+(-3) which is 2.

ossCVxPqaa	What you are doing is in complete compiance with the gas laws:   P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2  Think only of the air in the bottle. As you heat the air which is trapped inside the bottle, this volume of air expands. In doing so, it is forced out of the mouth of the bottle because its volume is now gretaer than thevolume of the bottle..   Now the heat source is removed ( the flame inside the bottle is extinguished), What would be expected to happen? The air outside the bottle should move back into the bottle as the volume of air inside decreases due to cooling.   But you have sealed the mouth of the bottle with an egg. What is now the pressure position? Below the egg, that is inside the bottle you have a low pressure - below atmospheric pressure. Outside the bottle and above the egg you have the pressure of the full force of atmosphere. The higher outside air pressure forces the egg into the bottle.    Do not get complicated and confused with any theories about CO2 and H2O having less volume ....... etc etc. This is technical nonsense. This experiment will work no matter what gas you put into the bottle. If you wish you can fill the bottle with pure CO2, with pure nitrogen, or even steam and the experiment will work equally well.    Do not think of the bottle sucking the egg in. It is far better and technically more descriptive to talk of the higher external pressure pushing the egg in against the lower internal pressure.       .....( )   ....    I hope the above transmits OK. Ask your Class what they think would happen, which way the object, my () to represent the egg, if they had 7 people pushing down and only 3 pushing up, which way the egg would move? The answer must be down.

bxxmaycraa	Coating glass with reflective materials definitely can lower the heat transfer from outside to inside, and lessen the burden on interior air conditioning.  Whether that keeps room temperature low or not depends on the outside temperature, the strength of the air conditioner, and what is considered "low."    The solar-factor is the performance measure.  The higher it is, the lower the heat transfer and the better the protection.     Problems with high protection materials are the way the glass looks.  Tinting, reduction of visible light, and so forth.      You can safely compare g-values and the way the glass looks from different manufacturers, and decide for yourself if your air conditioning load will be reduced enough to keep room temperature "low."  You can get a lot more information by googling for "solar factor"

Just take the momentums before and after:    M*40 - M*20 = 2*M*V  (M is mass of each ball, V is the final velocity)  V = 1/2(40-20) = 10 f/s  ie velocity is 10 in the direction the blue ball was travelling.    The second part cannot be answered unless you know how much heavier the blue ball is.|`|AA10481903	The first question is a momentum issue.  The second question is a kinetic energy issue.  Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved in the collisions.  So, use the definitions of each to solve the problems.    Momentum = mass X velocity    Kinetic Energy = 1/2 (mass) (velocity)^2    Best wishes and good luck.    remember: the total momentum and/or the total kinetic energy of the two balls is the same before and after the collisions.|`|FTnIapSbaa	Momentum is always conserved. Even in the real world away from physics text books. In the real world of macro collisions Kinetic Energy is rarely conserved.    In school physics the two extremes of Kinetic energy are explored : where the two objects stick together and where they bounce perfectly with no energy loss. Blue tack vs Snooker balls. :)    The reason for exploring these two extremes that we don't generally experience first hand is that a lot of microscopic objects do behave that way, for example gas molecule collisions are elastic.    So in your question are you exploring the extremes? Can you identify your problem with the extreme cases? What assumption do you have to make to identify your problem with the text book extremes?

pInY6rYqaa	No.    Light velocities are not additive.|`|nVQtiU5baa	option 1  We determined all the independent components of the acoustical physical constants (elastic constant, piezoelectric constant, dielectric constant, and density) of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 crystals grown from the melts of three different starting materials with the Li2O contents set to 48.0, 48.5, and 49.0 mol %, and obtained the chemical composition dependences of the constants of each single crystal around the congruent composition. All the constants as well as the measured longitudinal, shear, and leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) velocities varied linearly with the composition ratios in the experimental range. The composition dependences of the LSAW velocities for the 128YX-LiNbO3, X-112Y-LiTaO3, and 36YX-LiTaO3 substrates, previously obtained by line-focus-beam acoustic microscopy, were well matched with the calculated ones using the constants determined. Therefore the data of the composition dependences of the determined constants enable us to easily prepare the calibration lines for evaluating the crystals for any arbitrarily cut specimen surfaces, wave propagation directions, and modes by numerical calculations.   option2  Temperature and flow fields are mapped with the help of TLC particles.  Advertisement:  A three-dimensional (3D) defocusing liquid-crystal-particle thermometry and velocimetry (3DDLCPTV) system has been designed and constructed (but not yet operated) for use in measuring the 3D velocity and temperature fields, respectively, in a volume of interest in a possibly turbulent flow. As its name suggests, the system utilizes defocusing digital particle-image velocimetry (DDPIV) for obtaining velocity data and liquid-crystal thermometry for obtaining temperature data.    The system includes a total of three monochrome charge-coupled- device (CCD) electronic cameras and one color CCD camera, all aimed at the flow volume of interest (see figure). During operation of the system, the flow would be seeded with thermotropic liquid crystal (TLC) particles, which reflect light predominantly at a wavelength that varies with temperature. The flow would be illuminated by use of a high-intensity xenon flashlamp, and the cameras would acquire sequences of images of the illuminated TLC particles.        The 3DDLCPTV System Includes Four Cameras  one at the center and three at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. In operation, the system would acquire images of flash-illuminated TLC particles.The three monochrome cameras are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle that lies in a plane perpendicular to a common optical axis, which passes through the centers of both the triangle and the volume of interest. The digitized outputs of these three cameras would be processed to extract data on the positions and velocities of particles according to the established principles of DDPIV. The color camera lies at the center of the triangle; the digitized output of this camera would be processed to extract data on the temperatures of the illuminated particles.    The geometric arrangement of the cameras is such that in superposing the four camera images as part of the processing of image data, one would obtain, for each illuminated particle, a composite image that could be readily and uniquely identified as a combination of four blurred spots located at the vertices and center of an equilateral triangle. The 3D velocity of each particle could then be calculated by correlation analysis of the blurred spots at the vertices of the triangle in two consecutive images, while the temperature of the particle would be calculated through analysis of the hue of the central spot. Thus, the system should be capable of resolving the temperatures and velocities of all particles within the volume of intere

It is an extremely small portion of the wavelength spectrum, i.e. it is only a fraction of what it could be. Our poor eyes can only take in so much, therefore our vision limits us to what we can experience of the natural world. Visible light just isn't the whole story.    ...now where are my shades?|`|vuKD7je1aa	It promotes anti-social behavior.  People do not like to go out when the sun's a-blazing--in hotter states, that is.  When avoiding the light, sunlight cannot enter the retina and that energy cannnot be transferred to the brain and body to activate and enhance vitamin D.  Sunlight also plays a large role in mood stability, depression, mania, and other mentally affective states--sunlight is vital to us.  Without the energy from the sun, people's personalities would become more depressed and apathetic.  They could also turn aggressive, kinda paradoxically.

shHmR6iCaa	because the fertilization and development of the FROG takes places outside the body of the female frog.....    the female frog lays eggs in the water which is immediately fertilized by the sperms, this process is called external fertilization....After fertilization, the development of zygote( egg+sperm) also takes place in the water, and finally the frog is formed....    in humans,..the fertilization takes places inside the body, exactly at fallopian tubes...and the zygote develops in the uterus...So as zygote develops inside the body, humans( ie all mammals) become pregnant........|`|Cl2is5hYaa	Because they lay their eggs which are later fertilized by the males after the fact.|`|JKs0lkRgaa	Reproduction of frogs    Once adult frogs reach maturity, they will assemble at a water source such as a pond or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water where they were born, often resulting in annual migrations involving thousands of frogs. In continental Europe, a large proportion of migrating frogs used to die on roads, before special fences and tunnels were built for them.  Male and female Common toad (Bufo bufo) in amplexus    Once at the breeding ground, male frogs call to attract a mate, collectively becoming a chorus of frogs. The call is unique to the species, and will attract females of that species. Some species have satellite males who do not call, but intercept females that are approaching a calling male.    The male and female frogs then undergo amplexus. This involves the male mounting the female and gripping her (sometimes with special nuptial pads) tightly. Fertilization is external: the egg and sperm meet outside of the body. The female releases her eggs, which the male frog covers with a sperm solution. The eggs then swell and develop a protective coating. The eggs are typically brown or black, with a clear, gelatin-like covering.    Most temperate species of frogs reproduce between late autumn and early spring. In the UK, most common frog populations produce frogspawn in February, although there is wide variation in timing. Water temperatures at this time of year are relatively low, typically between four and 10 degrees Celsius. Reproducing in these conditions helps the developing tadpoles because dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water are highest at cold temperatures. More importantly, reproducing early in the season ensures that appropriate food is available to the developing frogs at the right time.

Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. Marine biology differs from marine ecology as marine ecology is focused on how organisms interact with each other and environment and biology is the study of the animal itself.    Marine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.    Marine biology covers a great deal, from the microscopic, including most zooplankton and phytoplankton, where zooplankton can be as small as 0.02 micrometers or as big as 2 meters in the case of the sunfish to the huge cetaceans (whales) which reach up to a reported 48 meters (125 feet) in length.    The habitats studied by marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the abyssal trenches, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. It studies habitats such as coral reefs, kelp forests, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean (pelagic) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary.    A large amount of all life on Earth exists in the oceans. Exactly how large the proportion is still unknown. While the oceans comprise about 71% of the Earth's surface, due to their depth they encompass about 300 times the habitable volume of the terrestrial habitats on Earth.    Many species are economically important to humans, including food fish. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean). Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.|`|WFxVuM1Laa	Hey that's what i love too, texas a&m in galveston is where i went and you have to take a lot of different classes. vert and invert bio. micro bio, etc.. you do get to go out in the ocean when you either get your masters or phd. just getting you b.s. you get to go but have to do all the dirty work. however if its what you love and want to do go for it i couldn't be more happier.

In a solid state CO does not form a crystalizing structure like water, therefore the volume has to be less than its gas phase.     In a gas phase the particles are not compressed between each other and move freely about being able to take up more space.

nTKuRFlKaa	*International standard IEC 60364 distinguishes three families of earthing arrangements, using the two-letter codes TN, TT, and IT.    The first letter indicates the connection between earth and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer):  T   :   direct connection of a point with earth (French: terre);  I   :   no point is connected with earth (isolation), except perhaps via a high impedance.  The second letter indicates the connection between earth and the electrical device being supplied:  T   :   direct connection with earth, independent of any other earth connection in the supply system;  N   :   connection to earth via the supply network.    *TN?S   :   PE and N are separate conductors that are connected together only near the power source.    *TN?C   :   A combined PEN conductor fulfills the functions of both a PE and an N conductor.    *TN?C?S   :   Part of the system uses a combined PEN conductor, which is at some point split up into separate PE and N lines. The combined PEN conductor typically occurs between the substation and the entry point into the building, whereas within the building separate PE and N conductors are used. In the UK, this system is also known as protective multiple earthing (PME), because of the practice of connecting the combined neutral-and-earth conductor to real earth at many locations, to reduce the risk of broken neutrals - with a similar system in Australia being designated as multiple earthed neutral (MEN).

4fWZL4TRaa	Not sure what you mean by pcs, is it pieces?    The battery is normally rated to suit the load. The current from the panels determines how long they take to charge the battery, especially considering they may also be contributing to the load while charging takes place. In a small way the panels determine battery size, in that the battery should be able to accept the charge from them (not too small). However that problem rarely arises.    There are things to consider first:    1) I am not sure what panels give 24.5V at 8.16A. These seem intended for some other voltage, rather than a 12V battery per panel, or perhaps to work without batteries. A 12V battery takes 36 cells in a conventional panel. When working in strong sun the voltage drops, as the temperature approaches 60C. These panels probably deliver over 32V at low temperatures and load currents. (Need the Open Circuit voltage spec.)    2) Do you really need the batteries? The grid provides a way to export the excess power using grid connect (grid tie), and you don't need batteries then. In most places you get paid for the exported power at premium price. When there is no sun you use the grid power.    3) What voltage will the batteries or panels be? It is normal to connect panels in series for higher voltage and so higher system efficiency. The inverters I know of work with 200 to 500V (look up Sunny Boy grid connect inverters), and I have read about some up to 800V. With 50 panels you may be talking of 32V x 50 with light loads and cool panels, so that would be around 1600V in series. You therefore need several strings, perhaps 4 strings of 12 (48 panels). The Vmax would be around 384V in each string. The working voltage for maximum output would mean 24.5V x 12 = 294V. This is probably at 25C, so at 60C what is it? Need the specs. It may be 65% of the O/C voltage so 20.8V (maybe) so 250V.    Now for a grid connect system this voltage needs to go to an inverter. The inverter is specially intended for grid connect systems. It also accommodates a wide range of input voltage, and has an MPPT controller for Maximum Power Point Tracking. The sizes I am aware of are up to 5kW. WIth panels 50 x 200W there is 10kW. There is also the question of how do you join them up. I expect that with a grid tie there would be an inverter for each string, with them connected in parallel, but some sort of load sharing arrangement. You need an expert to determine how this is done.    Battery Sizing:  First determine the load in Watt hours per day. Consider the worst time of the year (for the heaviest load). You should know how long you are likely to have overcast weather that inhibits charging. Calculate the battery size in Wh by the Wh per day for the number of days of no charge. Lets say you are happy with 5 days and the load is 3kWh per day, so 15kWh for 5 days. Divide by the battery voltage to get Ah capacity. For a 12 panel string with minimum of 20V per panel, the battery voltage is 240V, which is convenient because that is 20 x 12V batteries in series. You can have higher battery voltage if the charger can increase the voltage. Divide 15,000Wh by 240V to get 62.5Ah. Go for 80 or 100Ah therefore, as batteries are less with heavy loads, as they get older, and with cold weather. You have to recalculate with your own figures.    Charging:  In principle you need a charger that can regulate the current to the 240V battery. A 100Ah battery shouldn't be charged much faster than 10Amps (the 10 hour rate). The panels are capable of producing the equivalent of 10kW x 5h per day in full sun in a good location like the tropics. The current would be 25A. Obviously just two of your strings is potentially enough for this situation, but it depends on the load during those charging hours, which is more like 12h (not the 5h full sun equivalent mentioned).  You use a figure called equivalent full sun for your locality. This is often found on the internet. It is probably less than 5h a day. The charger itself should use MPPT so that it maximises the energy going into the battery. At this size I am not sure where you get one. Basically, specify for a 240V 100Ah battery, with 3 strings with voltage from 250 to 390V. It should have an MPPT controller.    How long to charge?  For the situation described above, we need 3kWh per day. Increase this by 1.5 times for losses in charging = 4.5kWh. The panels can do that in 0.5h or less, with no load. You can see from this that your 48 panels are for a much bigger load than we have defined. Perhaps from 12kWh to 33KWh per day depending on location.    Other points:  You need a big enough roof, with no shade. Any shade even on one cell can inhibit output.    The system needs to be designed by an expert. The expert needs to be aware of your local conditions like wind loading, rain, snow, dust, and how to build a 10kW sysem with components that are available in your region, and meet the safety needs.    The grid connect system is much more simple and straight forward to implement if poss|`|pInY6rYqaa	You need a battery capacity that can store several days of energy for when the sun does not replenish the charge.    Battery capacity is usually measured in amp-hours.    How big the battery bank is depends on your desired power usage.

qveeTggpaa	The cilia of a cell, paricularly eukaryotic cells, are the hair-like structures extending 5-10 micrometers from the cell body. So basically, it's located just around the cells body.     The flagella, on the other hand, is the tail part of most cells which enables locomotion for the cell. A common example would be a sperm cell, known for having a tail to enable it to move fast in order to initialize fertilization.     With the use of a good microscope, you may see for yourself where these organelles are exactly located in the cells.|`|gjxUwmtWaa	It all depends on what cell. For the lining of the nasal pasages, cillia are located on the outside, for flagellates, it is like a rudder on the end.

Flagella are tail-like structures that propel the cell.. i.e help it to move. Flagella are only on one end of the cell whereas cilia grow all  around the cell.

So no, they are not close to travel to even if we could go at the speed of light.    Yes if there were inhabitants of globular clusters (and many such clusters are poor in metals so this is unlikely), they would have a rather spectacular sky with no real darkness to speak of at night.

If so, then theoretically it would be possible given that the density of the core is believed to be at least dozens of stars per cubic light year, and it would be still be quite dense for some distance from the core.    Trouble is, the stars of globulars are generally extremely old, and many are at the red giant stage, meaning that any once-habitable planets are dead. The concentration of stars also means that gravitaional interaction would make planetary orbits unstable.    But I suppose those factors themselves could be useful, such as a young civilisation realising something was wrong with their planet's orbit, etc.
4wexENccaa	Q1) Assume Chandan's statement is true  Chandan has the 2nd least money as he had more than John  according to his statement. So, John is a truth teller.  According to John Chandan has more money than Vineet, which is false as Chandan has 2nd least, So, Chandan's  statement  is false.    Assume Erik is saying the truth, so two people are richer   than him. sum of 3 persons whose amounts greater than 170  is always greater than 510 > 500.  So, Erik's statement is also false.    Vineet and John has lower amounts of money and hence  they are the truth tellers.    Vineet: 108  Chandan:112  So, John has Rs.109.  If John has Rs.111, this makes Chandan's statement true.  If John has Rs.110, Erik will have Rs.170 which can't be true.    Q2) Abhishek's statement is tricky and after lot of headbanging   finally found out that Dinesh is the one who was kicked out.

913fb8ceffd6a8e7aea30ec81720fd2eaa	For the question involving Rohit --    Call the height, width, and length of the box in question H, W, and L respectively.    Since the volume equals the surface area (without their units), we must have:    H*W*L = 2(H*W + W*L + L*H) where H, W, and L are all whole, composite, and unique numbers.    Divide everything by HWL:    1 = 2(1/L + 1/H + 1/W), or    1/2 = 1/L + 1/H + 1/W    Offhand, I can see that    1/2 = 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 works, as 4, 6 and 12 are all unique, composite, whole, and most importantly, the solution checks out:    volume = LWH = 4*6*12 = 288  surface area = 2(H*W + W*L + L*H) = 2(6*12 + 12*4 + 4*6) = 288.

5dndoudoaa	The ACTIVITY of a protein can be regulated in various ways without changing the EXPRESSION of that protein.    This is process called post-translational modification, it can involve proteolysis, phosphorylation, translocation and other interractions that alter the protein's tertiary structure (and hence function).    So a protein can be effectively "downregulated" in the short term by posttranslational modification or downregulated in the long term by altered expression.|`|LVJjGaJ3aa	first of all, there is no such thing as expression levels for proteins, and it should instead read expression level of genes because if genes are expressed, there always are proteins and the only choice proteins have is to choose or not to act on a substrate. and if genes are not expressed, there is no protein. hence, you might be able to say that there's down regulation of protein when the expression level of a gene is low or nil.    now, coming to your question, down regulation of protein means by a cascade event or some regulatory elements or some kind of gradient (ion, hydrological pressure and so on), the amount of protein that was previously acting on a substrate is lowered. Upregulation means exactly the opposite.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    A system of equations is usually 2 equations for which you are looking for their point of intersection, if it exists. An example would be:    3x + 2y = 24 and x - y = -2  This has its solution at (4, 6).    A system of linear inequalities is looking not for their point of intersection, but for their common shaded area. An example would be:    y > x - 2 and y  -2x + 6    These lines cross to form an X in which the common shaded area is the part to the left.    I hope that helps!! :-)

P544Sbmqaa	You should really only use it if you actually have a melatonin deficiency.    Have you tried other things?  We tacked up big black trash bags on the windows in the bedroom.  It took two layers, and cut card board strips to tack on the edges over top of the bags so light wouldnt leak through.  Actually works great, the bed room is pitch black during the day with the lights off.      Also, sleep the same time every day.  My husband has a hard time sleeping during the day primarily because he tries to sleep at night on his days off.  He works 12 hour shifts from 8p to 8a, and works 4 days a week.  On the day he gets off, he will take about a 3 hour nap, then stay up and be so exhausted that he falls asleep as soon as I feed him dinner and then gets up the next morning and sleeps at night on his days off.  Then, the day he has to go back to work he gets up at like 7a, stays up until about noon and then sleeps til he has to get ready for work.  That back and forth completly screws with his sleep cycle and he stays exhausted.  You will sleep much better if you go to bed and get up at the same time (give or take 30 mins or so) every single day.    Also, try having the same hour long routine before bed.  Do whatever relaxes you...  tv, puzzles, hot shower, etc. but try to keep it a routine.  If you cant do a full hour, try at least 20-30 mins.    This will only work if you are sleeping the same time every single day, but...  if you lay awake for more than 20 mins, get up and do something relaxing and low key.  After about 20-30 mins lay back down.  If you lay awake for 20 mins again, get back up..  Same thing until you fall asleep.  You are basically going to be exhausted for a couple days, but it will reset your sleep cycle.      Do NOT compensate with naps during the day, that will totally throw off your sleep cycle.    Playing a movie that I know works well sometimes.  If you are going to do this, make it an old favorite that you know by heart.  For example, I use Apollo 13.  Its actually one of my fav movies, and I know every single line by heart practically.  But its so familar that I dont feel like I have to stay awake to watch it, and I fall right asleep.  I also have a cd that I do the same thing with that plays relaxing music.    White noise helps for some like a fan or something like that.|`|abx5VNsOaa	It is true that melatonin levels affect our sleep and wake cycle,generally we operate on a circadian rhythm.Sleep at night and wakeful in daylight.|`|RgSCstkAaa	It is sold as an aid to sleep, and has been used to combat jet lag, on the basis that the body naturally produces different amounts of melatonin in relation to sleeping and wakefulness.

lhiS83ojaa	Dairy cattle have been selectively bred for centuries for excessive milk production. Both dairy and beef breeds have been bred for small or absent horns (polled) to make them safer to work with, though in some breeds the horns are physically removed at an early stage of development.     The wild cattle from which domestic breeds descend had/have horns in both sexes and didn't produce milk in such excessive quantities or for longer than the calf needed it. For a modern example, look at beef breeds - the cows have small udders and are never milked.|`|SvmZlLdaaa	Before humans, cows as in domestic cattle did not exist. There were never herds of Jerseys or Friesians roaming the wild. Thousands of years ago, the wild ancestor of domestic cattle, the aurochs, was domesticated by humans. Generations of selective breeding for the characteristics we favoured - such as docility, lots of meat and excessive milk production - resulted in all the breeds of domestic cattle we have today, whilst the aurochs became extinct. An aurochs cow would not have produced more milk than her calf could drink, and lactation would have ceased once it was weaned. Also, both sexes had horns, and indeed many breeds of domestic cattle still do, though some have been bred not to have them, and some have them surgically removed for safety reasons.|`|AA11673762	Sat around playing cards and drinking beer. Darn humans!|`|spNcZAidaa	cows have recently adapted as early as the humans... if your thinking they would burst? No, not burst or explode exactly, but rip apart from the weight of the milk and pressure in their swollen glands since they are given so many hormones to keep the cows producing far more than they naturally would, it would be seriously painful for the cow who would suffer from engorgement and likely infections. It could lead to a painful death.    When any mother - human or animal - nurses their baby, enough milk is produced to satisfy the baby. As the baby gets older and slows down from nursing, the milk begins to slow in production until the glands stop producing milk.    People forget that cows are not a piece of machinery but rather are animals who have been forced to live in confined worlds and are totally dependant upon those keeping them in confinement to provide for their needs.      cows also understand where to graze themselves...normally in meadows or hills...far from predators. we all know the dinosaurs would of long died.      the main weapon of cows were numbers...predators, depending on what animal can easily trample a predator.|`|8wpav3nwaa	Cows are a domesticated animal; ancient humans created cows through selective breeding of wild ungulates. There was never a wild animal that exhibited all of the characteristics of the cow we know today.     It follows, then, that hornless cows are also a thing created by human existence; we either breed cows to be hornless or we cut their horns off during development. In short, wild ungulates never faced any of the dilemmas that domestic cattle would face if released into some hypothetical wilderness.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I would imagine that like humans and other animals that when weaning stops the milk production dries up.

We'll be what's called a Type III civilization.  You can categorize advanced civilizations into three types: Type I, II and III, according to the level of their energy production.     A Type I civilization can harness the power of an entire planet, utilizing 100% of the sunlight that falls on the earth. The world of Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers might be a Type I planetary civilization.     A Type II civilization can harness the power output of an entire star, as in Star Trek.     A Type III civilization can harness the power of an entire galaxy, like the Borg on Star Trek, or the Empire in Star Wars.     Each type will harness 10 billion times more energy than the previous type.    By contrast, we are a Type 0 civilization, i.e. we get our energy from dead plants, oil and coal. But we should become a Type I civilization within 100 to 200 years. (It will take several thousand years to become Type II, and perhaps 100,000 years or so to become Type III).  But once we're a Type III civilization, humans will be living on thousands of planets throughout this and other galaxies.|`|MHAPOrziaa	no a better idea is to study the natural mechanism of plants and how they get energy from photosynthesis from the sun and try to replace the need of light energy in photosynthesis with energy which is readily available like electrical energy. but when the sun dies it may turn into a red giant killing all possible life but would not turn into a black hole as it isn't heavy enough.

PrarLmbxaa	Bane is a Modern English word meaning "that which causes ruin or woe",   Some people consider technology bane because it is making people lazy.  Kids that used to go outside and play stay in and play video games and go on the computer all day.  People tend to forget how to do things for themselves, even using a calculator just to do simple math that you could easily write down and figure out.  Instead of exercising our minds we just use a calculator.  While technology is great and helpful and a HUGE part of modern society if one day it failed, we'd go into chaos.  No bank, no super information highway, no radio, no computer, no telephone, our missiles and dangerous things like that would be compromised.  If you haven't, watch the movie Wall-E.

It can be addictive, to a point where one no longer has normal human interactions like sitting around listening to people talking.  Some people start to see normal interaction as a burden.    6.  Its another sphere for elitism. Some people like to make fun of people who can't use computers, don't have internet access or have older models of stuff.    7.

wSUouQO1aa	It's temperature because you can heat the solution and even if the solution is already saturated (reached its limit on how much solute can be dissolved), more solvent can be dissolved and the solution will become supersaturated (over the supposed amount of solute that is dissolved at STP). Example would be when you put sugar into boiling water. It melts pretty quickly, and you can put a string in it and rapidly cool the sugar water. The result? Rock candy! the excess sugar clings to the string and forms back into a solid when kept a while at STP    And I'm pretty sure the second one's solubility. If the substance isn't very soluble, not much of it will dissolve. For example, when you put sand into water, it won't dissolve. It's not soluble becuase of what it's made up of.

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	If the dewpoint temperature increases while the dry bulb temperature remains constant,it means moisture is added to the air.If the moisture is thus continuously added till the dewpoint temperature rises and becomes equal to the air temperature,saturation occurs and condensation begins.At this time the relative humidity will be maximum(100%).Thus if the evaporation is returned as condensation,then the air is said to be saturated  So,condensation begins only when the dewpoint temperature becomes equal to air temperature .  Evaporation of water means escape of water particles from the surface as water vapour.This evaporation can occur at any temperature.But evaporation almost stops when the dew point temperature becomes equal to air temperature in which case the air becomes saturated.Because, in a saturated condition ,the evaporated water particles are not allowed to leave the surface(particularly over a water surface)for the free space.  In short,if the dewpoint temperature increases and reaches the air temperature,condensation begins and the evaporation almost stops.|`|UFteXlqwaa	If the atmospheric temperature for a give place remains constant but the dew point temperature for the same place, increase, then the relative humidity increases too.    The difference between atmospheric and dew point temperature is often called, the spread. When it is zero, i.e. both temperature are the same, then the relative humidity is 100 percent and evaporation doesn't occur any more because the air is saturated.     Condensation will then occur if the atmospheric temperature sinks as the air just can't take more moisture, it must condense into droplets.    Evaporation happens all the time at any relative humidity below 100 percent. But condensation occurs only when there is a difference of temperature in time; namely, it must sink for condensation to occur.

Bm42jAnVaa	Well imagine a ball at the end of a string. If you swing the ball around it pulls at your hand, put is prevented from leaving because of the string. The ball pulling away from you represents the momentum of the moon, while the string represents  the force of gravity, which keeps the moon from flying away. The only difference between the ball and string analogy and the actual thing is that the force of gravity and the forward momentum of the moon are almost the same, with the force of momentum having slightly more force. As for removing the moon from its orbit, it would only take a something  a fraction of the moons size. The initial pass would disturb the moon's natural orbit, so it would slowly deteriorate until it would be released.

If an entire galaxy cannot pull other galaxies to itself, then a super black hole, with the mass of the collapsed galaxy, cannot do it either. The mass is the same. What you will end up with is billions of black holes, widely dispersed in the universe, occasionally colliding and forming larger black holes. These will eventually dissipate as Hawking Radiation, over a trillion years, so that eventually the universe will be a soup of evenly distributed energy at a temperature of about 3 Kelvin.  If the universe is due to collapse in on itself, maybe we will see them coalesce into one big black hole, but maybe not. But even this will dissipate eventually.  .|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	lotsa blackholes don't collide they swing by and throw each hole away from one another at great speeds,most are to far away for two to ever meet|`|FIrFKNUBaa	you are not asking the right questions take a close look around on the internet

While I agree with the few who said joy is a human emotion not to be ascribed to animals, dolphins absolutely kill other animals with no intention of eating them.

Here is a link about two very specific cases of repeated dolphin "murder."  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthne...|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Well joy is the wrong term.  Only a human would really enjoy killing.  Most animals kill for food, predation or defense, mating.  However, research on chimpanzee behavior has revealed chimps kill for reasons other than food or protection.  They seem to actually go to war, all be it more like a rumble, with neighboring troops.  There is film footage of a troop involved in such activity.  They kill one of the opposing troop.  Then make a kinda spectacle with the body.  waving it around, dragging it, kicking, beating, etc etc.  Much like Islamic extremest do to Americans they capture then kill.    Domestic animals, pets, like dogs and cats often kill for what seems to be fun.  Actually they have not a clue.  They are chasing or playing with the other animal.  When it stops the play is over.  The cat or dog have no clue the animal is dead.  They have lost that most important part of being a predator, eating the prey.|`|AA10248966	Humans|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	big game hunters or any one who hunts|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Human NRA members usually get an erection by killing stuff.|`|AA11058044	Humans have a tendency to ascribe human emotions to the actions of animals even when they aren't warranted.    We can't really know whether the animals feel "joy" when they kill.  Without being able to read their minds or communicate with them, we can't really know what emotional state they are in.    Pet animals, like cats or dogs are often singled out for the "killing for pleasure" tag - but it's more likely that the behaviour is due to their domestication and instincts running into each other.    Our cats are well fed, and nowadays are rarely even called upon to kill mice, rats or other vermin.  However, they still have the hardwired hunting instincts to chase and attack something that's small and moving.  When they encounter something like that - a mouse, bird, or fuzzy thing on a string - they pounce.  But they don't really know what to do when they catch it.      Wild cats are taught to kill the prey by their mothers, but that rarely happens any more with domestic cats.  The cats are bewildered - and often the injured animal tries to get away - which triggers the chase behaviour again.  Because they aren't hungry, and it doesn't come out of a can, they don't see it as food either.  Most wouldn't have the first clue how to eat a bird covered in feathers either.    The bringing "gifts" is also a holdover instinct, in which the cats will bring food back to their family to share.  It's not that they killed it for fun, they're trying to provide for the family.    Other critters, like badgers, foxes and weasels are known to go on killing sprees, killing more animals than they could ever eat (i.e. "a fox in a henhouse").  Again, this is due to hardwired instinct.  When faced with captive prey, their instincts tell them to kill as much as they can, since in the wild you normally don't know if you're even going to find another meal, let alone hundreds of them all lined up and held in place.    So in general, most of the instances of animals killing "for fun" are usually because humans have screwed with their natural instincts somehow.|`|yDuNd9wmaa	Dogs, as this one book said they'll run after sheep and bite them.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	man|`|AA11840819	Humans kill and do not eat the animals such as war times.|`|ade435bb94d7c8d5aef9f6bca9f55a19aa	Cats.

I read that an African farmer had lost many chickens to a honey badger. He watched his barn all night, and when the chickens made a commotion, he ran out with his shotgun. He shot but missed. Then, his terrified wife heard him screaming for about 1.5 hours before he died at last from the torture. A hunter reports seeing a male honey badger courting a female. To impress her, this 40 lbs. animal attacked a Cape buffalo weighing a ton. It sank its teeth into the buffalo's genitals and hung on until the huge beast died of shock and blood loss. Another man saw a honey badger attack a six ton elephant. That was too much, so the badger was stomped into the ground.

You need a good electronics technical dictionary.  The one I use is called, "Modern Dictionary Of Electronics" by Rodolf F. Graf.  Graf is somewhat of an electronics God.    I'll tell you one definition for Robot and one for Computer.    A robot is a programmable, multifunction manipulator designed to move materials, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks.  Their are 5-distinctly different definitions for robot.    Their are 8-distinctly different definitions for computer.  All of them have a certain context inwhich they are relevant.  A computer is any device capable of accepting information, applying prescribed processes to the information, and supplying the results of these processes; sometimes, more speciffically, a device for performing sequences of arithmetic and logical operations; sometimes, still more specifically, a stored-program digital computer capable of performing sequences of internally stored instructions, as opposed to calculators on which the sequence is impressed manually (desk calculator) or from tape or cards (card-programmed calculator).    Don't feel overwhelmed by the ambigity (how much they are the same).  They are all clearly defined in a good technical dictionary.  They might not have them in schools, because psychiatrists are in the schools now and can't have people looking up words - they might be tempted to look up some of the stupid crap these people make up to sell their psychotropic drugs.|`|f4948af1972489366cde074ab64b0d89aa	A robot is a combination of hardware and software where there is a structure that can do one of a couple of things.  It can 1) obey inputs given to it by a controller, it can 2) respond to its surroundings, or it can 3) only be able to do one thing over and over again. (assembly lines).    A computer is basically an information station.  It processes information without any mechanical moving parts.  A mechanical device doesn't necessarily have any software making it different from a robot.    I was in robotics.  Robots are sweet

Going back to your problem:  Given:   the ratio  zinc:copper = 7:9  Weight of copper = 11.7kg    Since you are looking for the weight of zinc you need the density of both materials because the ratio does not directly relate to the weight of the materials:    Density of Zinc: Dz = 7.1 g/cu.cm        or            0.0071   kg/cu.cm  Density of Copper: Dc = 8.92 g/cu.cm    or          0.00892 kg/cu.cm     Vc = Wc/Dc = (11.7)/(0.00892) = 1311.659 cu.cm (rounded)    Using the ratio:  Vz/Vc = 7/ 9  Vz = 7(Vc) / 9  Vz = 7 (1311.659) / 9  Vz = 1020.179 cu.cm rounded    now compute for the required weight of Zinc    Wz = (Vz) x (Dz)  Wz = (1020.179 cu.cm) x (0.0071kg/cu.cm)    Wz = 7.243 Kg........

mdzIjOqaaa	An albumen pH of 8.2 seems to be optimal for embryo development. Albumen pH may influence embryo viability, but embryo viability may in turn, affect albumen pH. It has been hypothesised that an embryo in which the hypoblast is completely formed is better able to provide an effective barrier between the internal embryo and the exterior (yolk and albumen) and/or is better able to produce sufficient amount of carbon dioxide, which will reduce the pH level in the micro environment of the embryo to the optimal pH of 8.2. It appears that, to maintain hatchability and chick quality after prolonged storage periods, embryonic development should be advanced to the stage in which the hypoblast is completely formed or the atmosphere during storage and early incubation should be altered in such a way that albumen pH is maintained at the optimal level of 8.2.|`|4WbYCWbCaa	please give a details more.

We have found many planets, but none have been hospitable. The Big Bang is mainly a mathematical problem. The search for planets is astronomical. Different scientists would be working on either area. So they are not mutually exclusive.  .
lsuVEx0Faa	In an industrial accident it is more likely to be a forensic engineer that carries out any investigation.|`|PrarLmbxaa	A forensic scientist is like CSI.  They would be asked to investigate the scene, look for the clues and evidence of what really happened.  There are even forensic accounters, they follow the clues of money people's money trails, that's how in shows the police are always like "We caught him stealing money from here and putting it here and using it for whatever."  The forensic scientist will study the accident scene to see what caused it most likely.  Whether it was just an accident, an accident due to negligence, or (hopefully not), on purpose.  And they will be able to tell exactly what happened and why, and because of what circumstances.

But earlier people prefer not to waste time because they're curious about a gazillion things so they ended up formulating solutions to such questions then eventually became founders of algebra, biology and astronomy and etc. One friend of mine said that intellectual people are more bored due to the fact that they already know most of the answers to their questions. In application to your question, people of the early days don't know much so they didn't waste time but instead invested knowledge in time^^|`|NnFWMyJiaa	watching the fire... backcountry TV|`|7lszIKs6aa	nothing whatsoever TV and a lot of SEX....eheehehehheh...LUCKY THEM!  :D

(he is a lot easier to understand than Thor, who has a lisp)    the planet always stays near the Sun as seen from Earth and at midnight, the Sun is usually well below the horizon...     NOW, if you were up near the Arctic Circle... all bets are off.|`|0x7TYAqsaa	nahh|`|B6NMzKaGaa	Mercury is so close to the sun that the only times it is possible to see are just before sunrise,and just after sunset  It may be possible to see it at midnight on certain days in the far northern and southern lattitudes  where the sun shines 24 hours a day in the middle of summer|`|un0C52G8aa	You could see it if you are above the Arctic Circle or below the Antarctic Circle during the summer. In those places, the sun doesn't set for months at a time so it is possible to be able to see it at midnight. I just don't know if it's bright enough to be seen in the sun's glare.|`|DBIgAIBZaa	SInce we are farthur out from the sun than Mercury, we can only see the inner planets murcury and venus if we look towards the direction of the sun. At midnight, the sun is nowhere close in our sky.|`|vwDsYFIxaa	no|`|XzsvBhJWaa	It is possible to see Mercury, but I don't think it's possible at midnight. Tends to be just after sunset or just before sunrise.    From National Geographic:    "Mercury is the innermost planet to the sun, and it travels around the sun in only 88 days," Byrd said. "What that means in our sky is that Mercury moves from the morning to the evening sky six times a year. Most other planets don't do that."    "The planet also never rises far above the horizon and does so only near dawn and dusk. Most of the time the sun's glare obscures Mercury to the naked eyes of sky-watchers. "|`|tBO56G4laa	When you are at local midnight you are facing directly away from the Sun.  Mercury is, more or less, directly toward the sun in its orbit (+/- a few degrees to account for said orbit).    That being said, yes YOU CAN see Mercury at midnight, but only if you were at one of Earth's poles (north pole in the summer).  Here, the sun is still out because the Earth is tilted towards it.  So even though it's midnight, you can look towards the sun and see Mercury.  Tell that you your teacher, he/she will be very impressed!|`|SsgrR9ptaa	No. Because of its near distance to the Sun, so it will appear when the Sun is there. It's more like a dog is following your feet. Ideal times to see Mercury are before sunrise and after sunset.

She did this with every member of the choir until she had the PERFECT order for us.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	Yes. I was tested once for something and part of the that was to test my laterility...hmm is that a word...but to see my preferance in left/right. I am left handed, mixed footed ( kick a ball....when i stand i balance on my left foot and kick with my right but when i sit down i kick with my left!) , left eyed ( to test this put your finger over a point ( make it small eg a door knob,) using BOTH eyes so you kind of see the object THROUGH your finger...they are on top of each other. THEN close one eye and see your finger move, open both eyes and then close the other eye.....the finger that moves the LEAST is your dominant eye ( eg you use it to focus on things)  I was also left eared. I was made to face away from the person taking the test and then she told me to turn towards her when she clapped. I turned towards my left which indicates I am left eared. You can do these tests as well to determine what you are.....

The total length of the river is 3,180 kilometers (1,976 miles). The river has a total drainage area exceeding 1,165,000 square kilometers (450,000 square miles). The river's estimated annual flow stands at around 207 cubic kilometers.

a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	The rule of thumb is that Tylenol is safe UP TO 4,000 mg a day.  That's 8 extra strength or 12 regular strength.    I worked with the FIRST documented patient who died of a Tylenol overdose.  Everyone thought this was a joke. Tylenol was supposed to be better than aspirin.    The minute it got into his blood stream, he was essentially dead.  It killed his liver over the course of a few days until he bled out.  This sort of thing was not even noted in medication journals at the time.    As for Advil, or ibuprofen, enough will eat a hole in some part of the stomach.  Very painful way of bleeding to death.

It is always best to skip this drama.    If you suspect your friend of being suicidal, call someone to help you.  She NEEDS your help.  She is probably not going to comply with going to a hospital, but if you truely care for her, you need to call the police or a few trusted friends to help you.

wSRHWpItaa	Yes the answer is (b), but the reason that water is such a good solvent is because water molecules are dipolar. This means they are negatively charged at one end and positively charged at the other end.

In reality, as many people do, you can hold both a belief in a creation and accept the validity of evolutionary theory.  There need be no contradiction.    An important difference between evolutionary theory and "literal" biblical creationism is that the first is based upon lots of evidence, has been tested now for around 150 years, and happens to account for the evidence extremely well.  The second, on the other hand, rests upon the belief that a particular interpretation of an English translation of an Ancient Greek (via Latin) translation of one version out of various originally Hebrew versions* of a book called Genesis, suffices to demonstrate that evolutionary theory must be wrong and the Earth must be less than ten thousand years old although, as a matter of detail, the English translation of the Ancient Greek (via Latin) translation of that particular Hebrew version doesn't actually say any such thing.    * Versions of Genesis dating from before the 5th century BC don't say anything about a 6-day creation.|`|rM6gBb2baa	Evolution is a valid scientific theory with tons of observational and experimental evidence and is supported by every field of natural science.

PcJodTZzaa	Initiation of DNA synthesis requires an RNA primer.So it is used in DNA replication.|`|jKvA9jwzaa	A primer is a strand of nucleic acid that serves as a starting point for DNA replication. They are required because the enzymes that catalyze replication, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to an existing strand of DNA. The polymerase starts replication at the 3'-end of the primer, and copies the opposite strand.    In most cases of natural DNA replication, the primer for DNA synthesis and replication is a short strand of RNA (which can be made de novo). This RNA is produced by primase, and is later removed and replaced with DNA by a repair polymerase.    Many of the laboratory techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology that involve DNA polymerase, such as DNA sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), require primers. These primers are usually short, chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, with a length of about twenty bases. They are hybridized to a target DNA, which is then copied by the polymerase.|`|fb147c526be7a794421739da365dba79aa	DNA polymerases cannot begin a new DNA chain from scratch. They can only attach new nucleotides onto 3' OH group of a nucleotide in a preexisting strand. Therefore, to start the synthesis of the leading strand and each DNA fragment of the lagging strand, an RNA polymerase complex called a primase is required. ......continued in the website        http://student.ccbcmd.edu/~gkaiser/biotu...

Consider   5  9  1  2    We know the inverse is     2  -9  -1  5    If we use a column operation on the original matrix, say swap column 1 and 2 we have  9  5  2  1  The inverse of which is   -1  5  2  -9    This is not the inverse of the original matrix.     It's a bit like saying why can't we say that  log(2+5)=log2+log5; the answer being it just isn't true.

The most famous is the Australian duck billed platypus, but there are also two types of echidna. The short-beaked echidna lives in Australia and New Guinea. Its larger, long-beaked relative is now known only from New Guinea, though fossil remains have been found in Australia. As with all mammals, monotreme mothers feed their babies with milk.    As well as laying eggs, these animals share further characteristics in common with each other, but which are different to all other living mammals. For example, the upper bone of the front leg sticks out sideways from the body, and even the inside of the ear is unusually built. Such details show that monotremes form a natural group of closely related creatures.

I don't think there is just a one, however, I really have a lot of respect for "Ken E" when he answers in great detail on occasion some of the 2012 questions.  I often only click on those questions these days to see if he has answered them.    2.  Any of the questions that can be answered by typing the subject line into wikipedia search index.

Other than there are so many resources on the internet to easily debunk these absurd, poorly thought out, unscientific claims, it is also a great disrespect to the many individuals' hard work on making the moon landing missions successful, not to mention the bravery and courageousness of those who actually went on those missions.    4.

If you do it for the past 100 years then the weather is normal: this year, we got the storm that comes only once every 100 years!    And that's how people use statistics to show whatever they want. My point is: No one can answer your question without first defining a set of data. And defining that will always be subjective.    Consider this: If you put in a room people who toss coins, and the room is big enough, someone will get ten times a head or tail in a sequence.

KfBWOvf3aa	I dunno what potential energy do you mean.

We know that a neutron does have mass, and in nuclear reactions, it is moving, most likely at the speed of light.  therefore the neutron has energy that we can harness for everyday energy.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Why do the planets rotate around the sun?    The basic reason why the planets revolve around, or orbit the sun (rotate actually is used to describe their spin, for example, the Earth completes one rotation about its axis every 24 hours, but it completes one revolution around the Sun every 365 days), is that the gravity of the Sun keeps them in their orbits. Just as the Moon orbits the Earth because of the pull of Earth's gravity, the Earth orbits the Sun because of the pull of the Sun's gravity.     Why, then, does it travel in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, rather than just getting pulled in all the way? This happens because the Earth has a velocity in the direction perpendicular to the force of the Sun's pull. If the Sun weren't there, the Earth would travel in a straight line. But the gravity of the Sun alters its course, causing it to travel around the Sun, in a shape very near to a circle. This is a little hard to visualize, so let me give you an example of how to visualize an object in orbit around the Earth, and it's analogous to what happens with the Earth and the Sun.|`|AA10274801	Spin is not quite understood. All that is posited is based on Newton's first law of motion. But why should an object perpetually continue motion in space is basically not explicable  in Newton's 1st law of motion.  Einstein law of motion posited that motion takes place in space time ,and objects follow its curvature.  As its noticed these explications are not easily conceived by beginning students.|`|VG7Q1BLPaa	Well, the Earth does pull on the sun, but only slightly. That makes the barycentre (the point the two bodies orbit around.) of the two bodies slightly away from the sun. If they had the exact same mass then the barycentre would be directly in between the two bodies, and they would revolve around each other equally.    Centripetal force comes into the picture when deciding what shape the orbit is. All orbits are elliptical, meaning that they are slightly oval shaped.    Think of it as a bit of food  or something in water spiraling down towards the drain. It gathers momentum as the suction (gravitational force) pulls it towards it, but that momentum overtakes the suction (gravitation force) slightly and it starts to get further away from the source. It slows down as the two forces reach equilibrium, then the process is repeated as the suction (gravitational force) overtakes the momentum.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	If two objects are both in the gravitational fields of each other, their gravity does not cancel out.  It is just very strong, a combination of the two objects.  A lot of times, if the two objects are similar in mass, there will be a common center of gravity that both of the objects orbit around.    This is demonstrated in binary stars.  Binary stars are star systems where two stars orbit each other.  One star may have a small orbit around the center of gravity, while the other has a very elliptical one around it.  Both orbits are influenced by the combined gravity of the two stars.    Gravity is a function of mass.  The more mass an object has, the more gravity it will have.  The Sun makes up 98% of all the mass in the solar system.  Even when you add all the gas giants, the asteroid belt, and inner planets, the Sun is still a staggeringly large part of the solar system.  So, naturally, the Earth will have little to no effect on the Sun by its gravity.    Centripetal force is what keeps the planets from falling towards the Sun.  The gravity keeping the planets in place is balanced by the speed at which the planets are moving.  If you've ever spun a yo-yo around your head, you can get an idea of how centripetal force tries to pull the yo-yo away from you.|`|AA10008098	If you swing a pail full of water around on a rope it will circle you.  The rope pulls as hard on you as it does the pail (rope tension is constant).  Instead of a rope the earth orbits the sun using the gravitational attraction that the two bodies exert on each other (as you suggest).  In fact the earth is falling toward the sun just enough to compensate for the fact that it wants to follow a straight line out into open space (similar to the pail on a rope, if you let go).    For every action there is an equal and opposite action.  Centrifugal force is an outward force (due to the revolving mass of the earth) and centripetal force is a balancing inward force (center seeking) due to the attraction of gravity.    If the earth had been formed eons ago from billions of 'marbles' circulating in the space surrounding the sun, those traveling too slow would have fallen into the sun while those traveling too fast would have traveled further from the sun.  All the pieces of the earth were traveling at the correct 'average' speed and in the same direction to collect and travel around the sun together.  The original momentum keeps the collective earth orbiting the sun, because there is nothing (no air resistance, etc.) to slow it down.|`|1RFf8nQeaa	There is a theory that the planets don't actually "revolve" around the sun.    According to Einstein's theory, any mass warps space around it. (Imagine a heavy lead ball placed on a bed. The surface of the bed will bend/sag below the ball and the ball will sink into a depression. The ball represents the mass, and the bed represents space.)    Therefore, the planets, relative to themselves, are actually following a straight line. But since the sun (a mass) warps space around it, the planets appear to follow a circular path around the sun.

AA10008098	All matter inside a black hole has collapsed into a singularity (about the size of a period following this sentence).  As such you can approach the center of gravity without limit.  On earth we can not get closer to the center of gravity without drilling a deep hole, and then some of the earth's mass will be above us canceling some of the earth's gravitational attraction.  At the earth's center of gravity attraction is zero and balanced in all directions.    Because the black hole has tremendous mass and you can approach it without limit it exerts enough gravitational force (due to the inverse square law as you suggest) that the speed of light does not exceed the necessary escape velocity (within the event horizon) and no light escapes (rendering the body as black as the absence of light).|`|jjKCjWzZaa	Definetely yes so that even light cannot escape from it and hence the name.|`|msMWLnknaa	it has something to do with the law of gravitation. when a star is evolving to become a black hole it's mass remains constant while its diameter decreases, thus giving more gravitational force. look for the equation for the law of gravitation.|`|3afb1a9998ec7ae77d5dc07fa7abfe2aaa	A bb has gravity - billions upon billions of bbs multiply the gravitational force enormously attracting or pulling in even more matter to increase the size of the mass until it collapses in on itself.  The gravity overpowers the atomic structure of things - electrons, protons etc. don't have enough room to orbit.  Photons (light particles with mass) simply cannot overcome the force of the gravity created by all this material.  So it is the continual addition of mass that forms the black hole generating sufficient gravity to capture particles of light and pull in even more matter.

How?    Lets say you have 4 mangoes.  You want to divide it to two people.  We can know through practical "experiments" that each person will get two mangoes each.    Now lets assume you have none of the mangoes left.  And lets say "zero" men came and ask you for the mangoes.  And lets say, I ask : How many mangoes will each of them get?  Doesn't this sound stupid?  Such questions have answers which are called "non-determinable" or undefined.  Only the limit of this 0/0 is infinite. The real 0/0 doesn't exist.  The answer cannot be zero, because basically that's not the amount which "zero" people equally get.  The answer cannot be infinite, because there can be no way in which the quotient becomes bigger than than the numerator when there is a whole number in the denominator [ try it experimentally if you want ].  And zero is a whole number.    Yeah a test to prove it in the same way that some answerer proved that 0/0 is infinite.  Don't we observe that when 4/2 = 2  we can multiply 2 and 2 to reach 4?  So we can say that 2*2 = 4    So similarly, lets assume 2/0 = infinite  So basically infinite * 0 = 2  BUT HOW is that possible?  Isn't multiplication adding the number the given number of times?  So if we add infinity to 0, 0 times, then we are supposed to be getting 2.  Mathematics was "invented" to make experiments easier.

Q0jUU7A5aa	HINT: Write what you know.    Variables:  L = length  W = width    Given: the length of a rectangular plot of land is 55 feet more than width  Means: L = W + 55    Given: the perimeter is 320 feet  Implied: You know the perimeter formula.  Means: P = 2(L + W) = 320    You have 2 equations.  L = W + 55  2(L + W) = 320    Substitute L with W + 55 in the second equation.  2(L + W) = 320  2(W + 55 + W) = 320  2(2W + 55) = 320    Distribute.  2(2W) + 2(55) = 320  4W + 110 = 320    Subtract 110 from both sides.  4W + 110 - 110 = 320 - 110  4W = 210    Divide both sides by 4.  4W / 4 = 210 / 4  W = 52.5    Plug this into the first equation to find L.  L = W + 55  L = 52.5 + 55  L = 107.5    ANSWER: The length is 107.5 feet, and the width is 52.5 feet.    CHECK:  2(L + W) = 320  2(107.5 + 52.5) = 320?  2(160) = 320?  320 = 320?

Length = 55 + x.   Given that the perimeter of the plot is 320.  Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w)  2(l + w) = 320  2(x + 55+ x) = 320  2(2x + 55) = 320  2x + 55 = 320/2  2x + 55 = 160  Now, you can simplify and find the value of x.   x is nothing but the width of the plot.   From that we can find the length of the plot.|`|RLesi9dkaa	let width = x  therefore length = x + 55    2x + 2(x + 55) = 320  2x + 2x + 110 = 320  4x = 210  x = 52.5   therefore width = 52.5  length = 52.5 + 55            =107.5 feet|`|8R2aDPXOaa	2(W + 55 + W) = 320 whence W = 52.5 ft and L = 107.5 ft

AA10655250	The Inuits of Canada, Alaska and Siberia.    People have lived on Greenland for about 5, 000 years, the earliest belonging to what are called the Independence I , Saqqaq, and Independence II cultures. They migrated from North America, used stone tools, and were the first to successfully adapt to the island's severe conditions.     Following the Independence II migration, a people known as the Dorset arrived, and it is from them that the oldest myths and legends of Greenland's modern day Inuit people are derived. The Thule, who are closely related to the Inuit, arrived in about 900 AD, just before the first Norsemen began settling on the eastern and southern coasts.

Initial velocity is 488 m/s, acceleration is negative because it is slowing it down and we have to solve it for 's'.    Substituting the values we get,     0 = 488*488 + 2*(-9.8)*s     s = -(488*488) + 9.8*2   s = -238124.4 meters   Because the distance cannot be negative, take its positive equivalent.   Thus, the shell will reach max height of 238124.4 meters        for finding the time, use the formula     v = u + at   0 = 488 - 9.8t   t = -488/9.8 = -49.79 sec     Because time cannot be negative, take its positive equivalent.   Therefore, the shell will reach its max height in 49.79 sec
MLN2tJuyaa	A few reasons:    PAGE has sufficient resolution to allow separation of DNA fragments with just 1 base difference.    The gel needs to be denaturing (usually with urea), and PAGE is just easier to set up as a denaturing system than agarose.    Can't pour thin agarose gels very easily as it would set unless the apparatus is warm - polyacrylamide much easier as you can control the gelling time by controlling the amount of catalysts (AMPS and TEMED) added.    Thin gels of polyacrylamide are much easier to handle than agarose which is just too brittle (especially when thin).      Note, most sequencing is now performed using capillary gel electrophoresis. Agarose can't be used for this type of electrophoresis.
CCeRdaoLaa	False.  Energy can't be created or destroyed.  It can be stored and transferred from one form to another, but you can never get out more than you put in.  If you're talking about an internal combustion engine, it runs by burning gasoline - the energy stored in petroleum's chemical bonds is liberated and channeled into motion, heat, and sound (the heat and sound are unintended byproducts and use up energy that could otherwise be used for motion - this is why no engine is 100% efficient).    So where did the energy in gasoline come from?  It's from biological matter that decomposed under the right conditions, turning into oil.  That original biomatter got it's energy from the sun, which generated it's energy by fusing hydrogen into helium, which was fueled by gravitational and magnetic forces, and so on and so forth back to the Big Bang (or whatever created the universe).  Beyond that, we don't know.    But in an engine, or any other physical process observed in the universe as we know it, energy isn't created, only converted.|`|AA10008098	False.  An engine transforms one form of energy into a more useful form.  For example the engine of a car delivers a fuel/air mixture to the cylinder where it is compressed (using up flywheel energy), heated due to compression and ignited by a spark (from energy stored in the battery or consumed by the alternator).  This causes the fuel to burn (hydrocarbons are chemically combined with oxygen) resulting in a vast increase in cylinder pressure that performs work on the drive shaft propelling the car through its wheels.  If instead of a fuel/air mixture a water/air mixture was delivered to the cylinder there would be no chemical reaction available to drive the engine.  Because no conversion of energy is 100% efficient much of the chemical energy is lost due to engine friction and as heat rejected through the tail pipe.|`|5VeXOv5Aaa	energy can neither be created nor be destroyed it can only be transformed from one form to another.|`|jjKCjWzZaa	False.

6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	It seems to be practical from a physics standpoint.  And it would almost certainly be more cost-effective than our current use of the space shuttle, which costs around half a billion $ per launch.    One of the answerers above mentioned the energy cost.  It should still be feasible in that respect, because a space fountain would be much more efficient than a rocket.  Most of a rocket's energy fuel is wasted as heat rather than thrust.  Also, a space fountain would be reusable whereas most rockets are one-shot uses, and even the space shuttle undergoes extensive maintenance and part replacements between launches.    Still, building a space fountain would be quite an engineering challenge.  There would also be a substantial up-front cost to building it, though that is present with any new launch system.    You may want to check out the Wikipedia article on space fountains, below.  Also of interest, check out the link to "Launch loop" at the bottom of that page.  A launch loop may be even more advantageous than a space fountain, including lower costs and being easier to build.|`|jSPj3S6faa	What you smokin' thar, Clem?|`|zQiwHJV6aa	No, it's not practical at all.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	There is just the tiny problem, that keeping the fountain stable requires more energy than shooting the possible payload directly into space.|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	sure it would be ,for the same principle that keeps the sun from imploding ,the energy is there just have to collect it from the sun but shoot down to make a vertical motion|`|H4ITuOURaa	Nobody really knows whether a Space Fountain is practical or not, since there's been no serious attempt to build one.    As I understand it, there's been one tiny model/prototype built, (by Roderick Hyde I believe) but it used none of the major technologies like maglev, vacuum that would be needed to make it practical and was used purely to demonstrate the theoretical possibility; it worked.    There was also a tiny model of the related launch loop concept made by Keith Lofstrom and Paul Birch; and it was rather wobbly, but then again, the wobble was a known issue and there was no attempt to remove it.

v4yQlq8oaa	1) The Electron Transport Chain   The electron transport chain consists of 3 complexes of integral membrane proteins   the NADH dehydrogenase complex (I)   the cytochrome c reductase complex (III)   the cytochrome c oxidase complex (IV)   and two freely-diffusible molecules   ubiquinone   cytochrome c   that shuttle electrons from one complex to the next.   The electron transport chain accomplishes:     the stepwise transfer of electrons from NADH (and FADH2) to oxygen molecules to form (with the aid of protons) water molecules (H2O);   (Cytochrome c can only transfer one electron at a time, so cytochrome c oxidase must wait until it has accumulated 4 of them before it can react with oxygen.)     harnessing the energy released by this transfer to the pumping of protons (H+) from the matrix to the intermembrane space.   Approximately 20 protons are pumped into the intermembrane space as the 4 electrons needed to reduce oxygen to water pass through the respiratory chain.   The gradient of protons formed across the inner membrane by this process of active transport forms a miniature battery.   The protons can flow back down this gradient, reentering the matrix, only through another complex of integral proteins in the inner membrane, the ATP synthase complex (as we shall now see).    2) Electrophoresis is a technique used in the laboratory that results in the separation of charged molecules. In this CyberLab we are separating molecules of DNA that we got from Restriction Digestion. DNA is a negatively charged molecule, and is moved by electric current through a matrix of agarose. Click on the image to the left to see a larger image of typical equipment used in electrophoresis.    Im not sure if the second question fully answers it! I hope i helped =)
