So he went to the pet shop and told the owner that   he wanted to buy an unusual pet.   After some discussion, he finally bought a centipede which   came a little white box to use for his house.   He took the box back home, found a good location for the box,   and decided he would start off by taking his new pet to the pub to have a   drink.   So he asked the centipede in the box, "Would you like to go down the   Queen's Head with me and have a beer?" But there was no answer   from his new pet.This bothered him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and    then   asked him again, "How about going to the pub for a drink?"   But again, there was no answer from his new friend and pet.   So he waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation. He decided to   ask him one more time; this time putting his face up against the centipede's   house and shouting, "Hey, in there! Would you like to go to The Queen's   Head and have a drink with me?"      Scroll down!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS!                                                                        A little voice came out of the box:...........   "I heard you the first time! I'm putting my F***ing shoes on."

They will be going to a competition in a couple months and will play a combination of fast songs and slow songs.i will not be playing but i will be trying to teach them to sound better. every player is fairly talented as an individual but i feel that there is no unity and that everyone is kinda playing their own things as long as they follow the chords. their dynamics (volume) seems to be a problem..         there will be a drummer (who is pretty loud) 1-2 electric guitars(lead and rhythm) at least one acoustic, keyboard and lead singer with a couple backup singers and someone will play bass in my abscence(probably one of the guitarists).      i know a big thing is for everyone to scale down as an individual player and stay outta the way of the others. but also add some flare at good times and stuf.f            ANY TIPS???

20090223080325AASvNom	Entertainment & Music;Movies	(Spoiler) What do you think about the extra scene added in the Harry Potter movie?	(**Spoiler**) Ok I know nobody has seen the 6th movie yet but they added in a scene in the beginning in which Ginny and Harry have to fight of the Death Eaters. This sort of gets me a little mad because I think the people making the Harry Potter think we are retarded or something and just want to see action. I want to get to more dialogue and just more of the book. My opinion is- don't add in extra scenes in movie unless somehow you already got all the parts of the book in.      I'm still going to watch it however since harry potter is the BEST, I just want to know what other people think.

20090223083722AADstnU	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Was anybody else disappointed in the Academy Awards?	First off, I think they over did the whole thing of giving that crap movie Slumdog Millionair , so many awards. I did not like the whole non english India hindu music they had playing! I did though enjoy Hugh Jackman, he was good and did not try to be too over the top funny! This year they moved the stage closer to the crowd and celebs. It was a little weird. The Academy Awards this year just seemed a little un-american. What happened to all the good movies like Iron Man,Batman,WallE, Forgetting sarah marshall(great comedy), MamaMia,,... I dont know there is a long list of great movies from 2008,,Sorry Slumdog just dont fall into the category of a great must see! I think and feel that it got so many awards just to boost the moral of the people of India. I mean they brought the whole damn cast and families! Im glad angie did not win cause Changeling was not great. I think it should never been nominated. Pitts, Button, was great did not get much respect.  I dont know,,,the Awards just dont seem the same as they did a few years back!

20090223085145AAQEQ6K	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Four questions about the 'Watchmen' story?	I'm a big fan of the 'Watchmen' graphic novel, look forward to the film, but I have a few questions-         *In the world of the Watchman, was Richard Nixon a dictator? Somehow he was on his 3rd or 4th term...How did he overcome term limits? No doubt Watergate never happened on that Earth...   Actually if the story was set in 1985, and Nixon was elected in 1968, then he must have been in his 4th term of office. What a nightmare!      *I just watched a Japanese trailer of the Watchman film, and it turns out the Comedian was the shooter on the grassy knoll in Dallas, who shot JFK. Who exactly did the Comedian work for?      *What was the point of the story withing the story in the Watchman about the shipwrecked sailor on the raft supported by corpses?      *And lastly, did the Comedian kill Hooded Justice? Hooded Justice beat the crap out of the Comedian when he stopped the rape- I thought perhaps Comedian tracked him down 'off camera' and killed him.

20090223082650AA540S5	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Can you recommend some great new songs?	Hello, I'm an avid music listener and I enjoy listening to music that's unique and isn't the generic "music" on the radio. Lately, I've been busy with school and friends and haven't had the time to discover new music and I was hoping some yahoo answerers could help push me in the direction of good music that fits my tastes.      Here are some examples of my favourite genre of music:      "With a Heavy Heart(I Regret To Inform You)"- Does it Offend You, Yeah?      "Nobody Move"- We Are Scientists      "The Geeks Were Right"- The Faint      "Guilt by Association"- Louis XIV      "Hang Me Up To Dry"- Cold War Kids      "Private Affair"- The Virgins      "Midnight Show"- The Killers      "Bring It On"- Goose      "Relax(Take it Easy)"- Mika      "Like Knives"- The Fashion      "The Rejection"- Dangerous Muse      Those are some examples of the type of music i absolutely love....thanks!!!

20090223082501AAaHzap	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you think this is true about men having periods?	If Men Had Periods...   Since history was recorded, male human beings have built whole cultures around the idea that penis-envy is "natural" to women - -though having such an unprotected organ might be said to make men more vulnerable, and the power to give birth makes womb-envy at least logical. In short, logic has nothing to do with it. What would happen, for instance, if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate and women could not? The answer is clear - menstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy, masculine event:         Men would brag about how long and how much.         Boys would mark the onset of menses, that longed-for proof of manhood, with religious ritual and stag parties.         The US Congress would fund a National Institute of Dysmenorrhea to help stamp out monthly discomforts.         Sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free. (Of course, some men would still pay for the prestige of commercial brands such as John Wayne Tampons, Muhammed Ali's Rope-a-dope Pads, Joe Namath Jock Shields - "For Those Light Bachelor Days," and Robert "Baretta" Blake Maxi-Pads.)         Military men, right-wing politicians, and religious fundamentalists would cite menstruation ("MENstruation") as proof that only men could serve in the army ("You have to give blood to take blood"), occupy political office ("Can women be aggresive without that steadfast cycle governed by the planet Mars?"), be priests and ministers ("how could a woman give her blood for our sins"), or rabbis ("Without the monthly loss of impurities, women remain unclean").         Male radicals, left-wing politicians, and mystics, however, would insist that women are equal, just different; and that any woman could enter their ranks if only she were willing to self-inflict a major wound every month ("You MUST give blood for the revolution"), recognize the preeminence of menstrual issues, or subordinate her selfness to all men in their Cycle of Enlightenment.         Street guys would brag ("I'm a three-pad man") or answer praise from a buddy ("Man, you are lookin' good") by giving fives and saying, Yeah, man, I'm on the rag!"         TV shows would treat the subject at length. * "Happy Days": Richie and Potsie try to convince Fonzie that he is still "The Fonz," though he has missed two periods in a row. * So would newspapers.(JUDGE CITES MONTHLY STRESS IN PARDONING RAPIST.) * And movies. (Newman and Redford in "Blood Brothers"!)         Men would convince women that intercourse was more pleasurable at "that time of the month." Lesbians would be said to fear blood and therefore life itself - though probably only because they needed a good menstruating man.         Of course, male intellectuals would offer the most moral and logical arguements. How could a woman master any discipline that demanded a sense of time, space, mathematics, or measurement, for instance, without that in-built gift for measuring the cycles of the moon and planets - and thus for measuring anything at all? In the rarefied fields of philosophy and religion, could women compensate for missing the rhythm of the universe? Or for their lack of symbolic death-and-resurrection every month?

Unfortunately, the only word I can remember from it was "something, something...soldiers ...something, something." The song started slow with just instruments and a powerful repeating melody and slowly built up. If it helps, the song was played (at least a portion of it) while sweeping over the audience with a high camera angle. Anyone have an answer for what song it was (based on my vague description)?

20090223090944AA4lCqm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Who was the best Bassist in Megadeth?	The guitarists of megadeth seem to get all the attention...and for good reason,but what about the bassist?  I've always thought of the bass players in Megadeth as being the weakest point for Megadeth....with average players just doing their part      Dave Ellefson    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rd4q6EeK...    James MacDonough (not much on him online, he has also played with Iced Earth)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9iNWOIOT...    James Lomenzo (has played White Lion, and Black Label Society)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFi9NlxAJ...        At the Megadeth forums, in the musicians section, I hear them say James Lomenzo is technically the best...but to be honest, I'm not that good at telling the difference between them      So, who is the best bassist of the group?

20090223094117AAmTM4k	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The Curious Case of Benjamin Gump?	While this was a beautiful movie, it reminded me of Forrest Gump and that was BEFORE I knew Eric Roth (Gump writer) was involved. Now that I know that there is no doubt he wrote a Gump 2. Here are some comparisons:   -Both are from the South   -Both had struggles with walking when young, only to break out and shake off the bulky metal leg contraptions   -Both had single mamas that were strong role models   -Both had childhood sweethearts that they got together with later in life and had a baby with   -Both went to war to become "accidental" heroes   -Both lived colorful lives and met colorful people while traveling   -Both love interests in the movie lived crazy/interesting lives until "the hookup" when they realized the main charactor was their true love   -Forrest Gump had a feather, BB had a hummingbird   -Gump had Lt. Dan, BB had Capt. Ron   -Both stumbled into wealth   -Both of their lives brushed against important parts of history   -Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get- Gump mom   -You never know what's coming for you- Button mom      Please feel free to add on. These are what I could remember of the top of my head.       Anyone else feel this was "The Curious Case of Benjamin Gump?"

She gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately. When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face closer to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy.      "Are you the Manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face now with both hands.      Actually, no" he replies.      "Can you get him for me -I need to speak to him?" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and his full head of hair.      "I'm afraid I can't" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there anything I can do?"      "Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues seductively, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. She slowly continues, "Tell him,... that there,...is no toilet paper in the ladies room

Does anyone think that some of the awards won were fixed?   I mean, for instance, Kate Winslet, her performance was great but I really do think Merly Streep deserved it more. I mean I know she recieved many awards & nominations but her performance in Doubt was just too powerful.   I also think that Slumdog Millionaire did not deserve best picture. I mean hey, the movie was great but not best picture worthy. I'm glad for Sean Penn, but I was rooting for Mickey Rourke |:   What do you guys think?

The father had woken up late, looks in the refrigerator, and bellows down the hall, "All right, who ate the last piece of chocolate cake last night? That was MY piece!". No answer.   "Grrr, I'll get to the bottom of this."      He calls his wife, son, daughter, and Helen (the maid) into the den.   "Okay, one of you ate my cake that I was so looking forward to enjoying this morning with my milk. Where were you guys last night?"      WIFE: Honey, How dare you ask me that. You know I went to Walmart to get a few groceries and also to see my sister about that fund raiser next week. Look, here... I got what everyone wrote on my list... you, some golf balls - Tiffany some makeup - Bobby some Snickers bars - and some magazines for Helen. And all of it is still right there on the counter. See! (pointing) So, anyway, you look cute when you're angry.      TIFFANY: Come on, Dad, I was in my room all night doing homework. Those A's don't just happen by themselves, you know. Our Literature teacher, Mrs. Jenkins, is loading us up on Greek Mythology, and I have to write about Prometheus. That's the Titan who gave fire to mortals. Dad, can I go see Brad Paisley in concert?      BOBBY: Nuh-uh, no way. I was playing World of Warcraft 3 and talking to Jacob on the phone. I think he was using some kinda cheat codes. I'm still new at it, but I'm learning. I did get hungry, but I ate chips and dip. Besides, I don't like chocolate! Are we going to Disneyworld this year?      HELEN: Sir, I really am sorry, but I was relaxing with a glass of tea and a few old Woman's World magazines on the back porch. I'd had a rough day, you know with the holidays, birthdays, and all. I just needed to put my feet up, take a couple Doan's and lay back a little. Can I go now? I really need to check the laundry. It's laundry day, you know.      Right then and there, he knew that three told the truth, and one lied.   Who was it, and how could he tell?

20090223095853AAnAJ0D	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Changing teachers without any hard feelings..how?!?	Hello,      I have a fantastic teacher. I love her with all my heart and she's done so much for me already, but I went to a soiree last night where she played. As an accompanist, her playing was immaculate, but she played La Valse and Ma Mere l'Oye with her husband and I am beginning to realize that she doesn't have my technical prowess, so she cannot realize my full potential.      I played at a competition today and some of the comments I got from the judge were so fresh that I had never got them from my own teacher. I really need a change to understand new perspectives on the pieces I play. Also, I watched masterclasses on YouTube. Overall, there's so much detail that my teacher and I are not going through.      I live in Toronto and I thought of Ms. Orlov or a U of T professor with a very strong background. I can give them a try before I cut off my lessons with my own teacher. Should I do so? And if yes, how should I go about telling her?       I have potential to win international awards. I do not want to get bogged down despite all my teacher's help so far.      Any ideas are welcome!

20090223085718AA9HPrI	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What is the easiest way to make rhyming lyrics?	I've heard most people giving me advices about "just let it flow when writing lyrics, let it flow out of ur emotions" , but unfortunatelly I often still find it hard to create a 'beautiful' lyrics then, since i can't make it rhyming.. so often, afterwards, i have to 'force' myself to find the rhyming words.   but what i want to ask is, how usually is the easiest way for lyricists to make rhyming lyrics?  is it by:   1. go sentence-per-sentence , while finding the rhyming words, or   2. find the rhyming pair-of-words 1st, and then work 'backwards' to think of the sentences ?      for example, in the famous lyrics "Bubbly" by Colbie Cailat,   when the chorus goes like:      "They start in my toes   make me crinkle my nose   wherever it goes   I always know   that you make me smile   please stay for a while now   just take your time   wherever you go"      how do you think she (Colbie) gets the rhyming words "toes - noes - goes" ?  does she MOST likely brainstorm & freewrite 'rough draft' 1st, and then work sentence-per-sentence (1) , or , find those rhyming words first (2) ?      which one do you think is more likely, and easier, (1) or (2) ?

I'm watching American Beauty which I can only say is marginally better and is the academy award winning equivalent. These movies are inconsistent. The main characters are one dimensional most of the time and then it sounds ridiculous when they say something pseudophilisophical. The supporting cast consists of stereotypes. Really how can people not see these movies for what they are?

Well, since we're still in the Oscar mood, I wanna ask about the Oscar nominations. We're all already familiar with Oscar's 5 nominations per category. Sometimes the nominees can be reduced until only 3 (such as the case of Best Original Song category this year), but I don't think I ever heard the Oscar with more than 5 nominations per category.. ever (am I right? correct me if I'm wrong here!).      Do you think that the Oscar should have more than just 5 nominees for every category? I'm asking this because there were many talks/controversies surrounding several movies and/or actors that were snubbed this year, such as Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino", Sally Hawkins in "Happy-Go-Lucky", Ralph Fiennes in "The Duchess", Kristin Scott Thomas in "I've Loved You So Long", Kate Winslet in "Revolutionary Road", not to mention the exclusion of "WALL-E", "The Dark Knight", and "The Wrestler" from the Best Picture category, to name a few. Based on that reason, do you think it would be better for the Oscar to increase the number of nominations in every category? Well, just to bring bigger opportunity for many movies and actors to be nominated, and eventually it would make everybody pleased to say the least.      Oh and btw, supposedly Kate Winslet's performance in The Reader was nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category instead of Best Actress, who do you think would win Best Actress then? I was actually expecting Meryl Streep would win in "Doubt" as Best Actress and Winslet in "The Reader" for Best Supporting Actress because I love Streep. (I initially thought Winslet would be nominated in Best Actress category for "Revolutionary Road"). But when the nominations were out and both Streep and Winslet's "The Reader" were nominated in the same category, I knew by then that Streep could stand no chance against Winslet's "The Reader". I wonder what would happen if Winslet's "The Reader" was NOT nominated in the same category with Streep. Could it be Streep who wins?

20090223010555AATTAdH	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you know this movie?	I saw this movie on Fox at like 12 in 1998. The plot, a guy in college has a long distance relationship. He calls his girlfriend her roommate picks up and say shes out with (guys name). The (Guys name) is really a dog that she got and is walking the dog. The boyfriend goes to a strip club, When leaving he see's a guy being rough with a stripper he helps her. The boyfriend tells the stripper about what happened and she tells him that they should get naked and take pictures and send them to his girlfriend. (i know by now that this sounds like the movie Road Trip, but its not.)  So they take the pictures and send them through a postal service. The guy gets a call and the girlfriend explains that the guy was a dog. Then he and the stripper, strippers like a student, try to stop the mail from being delivered. They first meet a postal worker who has the parcel but he wont give it back and is hell bent on delivering the parcel. So the guy and the stripper are making their way and trying to stop the postal service worker from delivering it. They do stop the postal worker but the boyfriend figures out that the stripper likes him and he likes her and so he breaks it off with his girlfriend due to the distance thing. He chases the stripper/student and tells her he loves her. OK one more thing I have always thought that the title had the word postal in it. but I've checked IMDB and couldn't figure it out. The movie was a comedy and a romance it was a B style movie but a good one at that.

But some of my fave things to eat are: salads with chicken, chicken alfredo pasta, dark chocolate, carrots, Hot Pockets, Flatbread Melts, Lean Cuisines, chicken wraps, etc. The only bad things I like are Hot Pockets and dark chocolate.       I am not an adventurous eater, though I am willing to try a new place to eat. I like Thai and Mexican food. I really like anything spicy or garlic, too. I won't eat slugs or a snake or anything like that so that is why I don't consider myself an adventurous eater.       I'm not a big fan of beef.

20090223105507AAh8a1T	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Miley Cyrus is an idiot!?	I mean honestly, I don't know her or anything, but what I see of her, on like TMZ.com and stuff, she is horrible! I know people make mistakes, and you shouldn't make a big deal about it, but she is so horrible! Reasons why I hate her:      First of all, she can't sing whorth crap. It is the worst nasally sound ever!      Next, her 'side boob' pictures, what was she thinking wearing that dress?      Bra flashing pics, are you serious?      Making fun of Asians! Ughh! I am so happy they are suing her!      Pictures of her and numerous guys, making out, drunk etc.      Her latest 'shower pics'      And those are only some.      Naturally I come with a point. I do NOT want my little sister, and all my younger cousins looking up to her! All these little girls do, and she is a horrible role model. I mean, sure when she was like 12, she was okay. But, now she is ridiculous!   I do not want my little sister to grow up to be a skank.       Don't you agree?

The other day I got really drunk and cut down the avocado tree in my neighbor's backyard.  I actually barely remember doing it, and I'm not sure what reason I may have had for doing such an act.  Anyways, he's been over at my house the last few days expecting me asking me to pay for the clean up and generally acting like a big jerk about the whole thing. I tried to explain to him that I was DRUNK at the time.  It's not something I would normally do.  So why does he expect me to be responsible for this?  It's HIS tree after all.  Why can't he understand that people aren't responsible for the things they do when they're drunk?  It's like you're not the same person, but he just doesn't get it.  What can I do to get him to leave me alone?

Is it a cockatiel?" I am sure people would just hand over $35 for that service. I can hang at the dog park and make a mint.      What other new jobs can you think of?

20090223052030AAr5Qwp	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	HELP: What am i doing wrong ... I cant get a job?!?	PLEASE stay with me if this seems a little long.      I have recently left University 3 weeks ago where i studied medicine as i did not want to be a doctor anymore (long story). I am now 19 (birthday yesterday) and jobless.      I am really keeping on top of getting a job. I am with 4 agencies, I search 7 job sites a day and have applied for 15 jobs.      Now i dont want to seem like i am bragging but i have good grades... 4 A's at A level 5A's at AS level and 3A* and 6A at GCSE as well as a merit in IT GNVQ and varioius achievements including Gold award duke of edinburgh, LOTS of voluntary work and selected to represented county both for school competitions and sports.      Of the 15 jobs I have a pplied for, 9 have not got back to me after over 2 weeks (and i dont think they will) and i have had 3 phone interviews. I prepared lots and lots for the interviews researching the company, the job itself and lossely planning answers to possible questions. My dad actually interviews people as part of his job and helped me with this and also sat with me whilst i did the phone interview so he could tell me where i was going wrong afterwards (feedback). I just had an interview today for work in a call centre and when they said 'please hold while i check the results of the interview' he said 'you did really well there thats your best interview yet i would be very very suprised if they did not take you on as thats a lot better than the most people i see'... i had good examples and good answers...but didnt get the job.      Why can i not get a job?! What am i doing wrong?! Is this all due to the credit crunch?!

This reminded me of a story I read in elementary school where a woman had beautiful hair and her husband had a timepiece. They were really poor, but the woman cut off her hair and sold it to get a nice wrist strap for her husband's watch, and he sold his watch to get her this comb set for her hair.      Anyway, I want to know what the story was? I loved it, but I can't remember the name.      Thanks!

20090223062456AAyC6mG	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you watch philosophical movies?	I like movies that make you think, have deep philosophy,so called "elite movies", "movies not for everybody", like:      1. Julio Medem - a Spanish Basque writer and film director (my favourite): "Caotica Anna", "Lucia y el Sexo", "Los amantes del círculo polar ".       2. Darren Aronofsky: "Pi", "The fountain","Requiem for a Dream"      3. Lawrence Donald Clark: "Kids", "Wassup Rockers", "Ken Park"      4. Brett Wood and his "Psychopathia Sexualis". The movie dramatizes case histories of turn-of-the-century sexual deviance, drawn from the pages of Richard von Krafft-Ebing's notorious medical text. Among the cases are a sexually repressed man who discovers an unhealthy appetite for blood; a homosexual man who submits himself to a doctor who promises to 'cure' his condition; and a masochist who hires a pair of corseted prostitutes to enact a most peculiar performance. In the final chapter, a woman who has spent her life suppressing her lesbian desires is hired to tutor a sexually curious young woman. These stories are bound together by the thread of an ambitious doctor who not only studies the patients, but uses them as pawns and playthings.      5. Richard Linklater and his "Waking Life". The film follows its protagonist as he initially observes and later participates in philosophical discussions that weave together issues like reality, free will, our relationships with others, and the meaning of life.      Please, tell me what philosophical movies you watch??? and please add more phylosophical movies that you think is worth to watch!!!

20090223065546AAHP3U9	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What should I do? Please answer :(?	Hi      This is a pretty long story but please read it and give me your opinion.      Ok so I am 17 and I was very depressed for a long time. I tried to kill myself 4 times and I was in a psychiatric hospital for 3 months.   I decided to give life another shot on my terms and I dropped out of school and I was starting a boarding kennels. I wanted to put them at my dads house but it needs a lot of work, and my mum who is able to afford it wouldnt pay for it to be done there. My mum said she would pay for wooden kennels and runs in her back garden, which I sort of agreed to,even though I wanted them to be done properly. Then she said she would built really good indoor kennels and pay for it to be done properly. We had builders organized and they were supposed to start the day after tomorrow, but this morning she said she changed her mind and said if I wanted a boarding kennels it would just be the runs and outdoor kennels and we could keep extra dogs in cages in the shed. I would never keep someone else's dog or any dog for that matter in a cage all the time so I said no, that I would not do that. She said she would do it herself and I could do whatever I wanted. I did so much work around her house, it looked like a landfill before and now it is like this perfect little house in the countryside. I know she only let me think she would build the kennels so I would do all this work. I feel so used.   And she stole my business plan. I cant even set up a kennels at my dads house now(like my dad thinks I should do) as the two houses are directly across the road from each other and she would be set up long before me, and I would get no business. I dont know what to do.      What am I supposed to do?   I have no way of making money because the only thing I am good at is looking after dogs.    I cant go back to school, and I really wouldnt want to anyway.      I just feel so betrayed.

(until I switch to another tab) Happens to me ALL the time!      I study for a test and blank out come test time.      A racist denies being racist.

20090223102940AAdolD8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should I give Charlotte the benefit of the doubt?	SHould I give her the benefit of the doubt and if so why if not why not      Today I went to the thrift store. I was purchasing a few blouses for the summer    as well as a few sweaters - totaling nine items. All the cashiers know me and    when I was at the register Charlotte (one of the cashiers who was behind the    counter) was sitting down and Rhonda (the other one was helping me) was at the    cash register. I decided to charge the purchases. Rhonda held one sweater up to    show Charlotte as Rhonda was packing my items in the shopping bag. Rhonda had to    step away for a second and I thought that all my purchases were in the shopping    bag, but I was wrong. Charlotte said "You are giving me this" as I had my head    down to sign the receipt. I looked up from my signing the receipt and I saw    Charlotte holding the gray sweater that I had purchased. I said wrong that is    mine and about two minutes later Charlotte put the sweater in my shopping bag.    Now if she did not say anything I would have walked out without that sweater      PS: CHARLOTTE IS THE SAME ONE WHO SAYS TO ME "I DONT KNOW WHY YOU BUY SO MANY    CLOTHES HERE, YOU NEVER WEAR THEM"   THE TROUBLE WITH THIS STATEMENT IS THAT IT    IS WINTER SO WHEN I COME IN I HAVE MY LONG WINTER COAT ON SO ONE DOES NOT SEE    WHAT I AM WEARING.  SO I REPLY "YES I ALWAYS DO WEAR WHAT I BUY HERE, YOU JUST    CANNOT SEE WHAT I AM WEARING BECAUSE I AM WEARING THIS WINTER COAT" WHERE    CHARLOTTE REPLIES "TRUE"

I can't decide what to do with my vampire character. It's for a comic book I'm planning on doing. Say you're my character--a Vampire. Then, you meet a girl. But she's no Mina Harker (or Lucy).

Now, you know vampires and werewolves have been at war for centuries. You know her clan is looking for her. Would you use this knowledge to curry favor with the werewolves and appease them? Betray her, in other words...   Or would you befriend her and carry her secret to the grave?   Which path would you take?      NOTE ! ! ! ! !

Does anyone believe that his conversion was the result of a brainwashing? That would explain how Dorian could slither in and change his way of thinking to the point of making everyone else paupers. It seems that he can't really keep his own thoughts. One moment, he's defending his 'brothers'. The next moment Dorian is right...they're no good. So, Has Evil David returned without Good David, or has David been further brainwashed by Dorian? If either, how long do you think it will take for Good and Sane David to return??

20090223110453AAQd4xt	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Do you think the flying thunder god technique was/is the greatest technique ever invented in Naruto?	In the manga the 4th created the flying thundergod technique where he wiped out 50 enemies on the battefield instantly, earning him the name the Konoha Yellow Flash.  Ninja from the rock village were told to retreat if they were every to see him on the battlefield.  Is this supposed to be the greatest technique ever invented in Naruto, and if Naruto were to surpass his father, aka the 4th, do you think he would have to also master this technique?  What's your opinion?

20090223110423AAOYBdZ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	In singing, is it better to sing with your talking voice?	I'm in a rock band as a vocal, but my skills are limited.    I went on stage and the performance felt great. That night we had a special guest come up on stage and sang with me. It felt great and i thought it was one of my best performance. After the show, I watched the video recording of the show, and was shocked. I missed every note possible!! And according to the audience feedback, they had trouble hearing my voice. I first thought it might have been the mic or the PA failure, but again i got a feedback that the audience side could hear the guest singer's voice, but couldn't hear my voice. And I was screaming really loud, because I was trying to hear myself on the monitor, over the instrument sounds (guitar, bass, drum).    This is when I started to research myself on how to control and project my voice, so it will sound accurate and more clear to the audience. One thing that came up was that the mic projects my voice better when I'm singing in my "talking voice" rather than what I use to call my "singing voice."    I need to know if this is the best way to sing, and if this is the solution to my voice projection problem.

20090223110643AAs4lCf	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Why didn’t Coldplay win any Oscars last night?	I think Coldplay is the best band in the entire world. Judging by the success of their tours, records and merchandise sales, so do a lot of other people. I was really surprised that they didn’t win any Oscars last night since they are such a great band. They played their music a lot during the ceremony but they didn’t give the band any awards. Any reason for this? A friend of mine said they are the second best band to ever come out of England right behind Aha. I think Coldplay is better than Aha, although I do like their “Wang Chung” song. That is a cool one!      My high school band plays their music all the time and everyone loves their records. Why doesn’t the Oscars love them back?      What do you think?
