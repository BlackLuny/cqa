In the last year or so, I put on about 15 lbs. I'm normally around 125 and currently I'm approaching 140! I'm graduating from college in June, (about 5 months from now), and want to lose about 15-20 lbs by then. I would hate to look back on pictures from then and think "damn, I look fat". I'd like to know if 15 to 20 pounds is a realistic/safe weight loss goal for a person my height and age.       By the way, how I started gaining weight and have already began making changes diet and exercise wise. I just need a reasonable goal.      Any advice is truly appreciated. Thanks!

20090128184146AAHS8pW	Health;Other - Health	Coumadin and alcohol?	I am very confused about whether or not you can drink/or get drunk while on Coumadin.  My doctors did not forewarn me about drinking while on Coumadin and its something I think they would have mentioned if it was a serious threat to my health.       I am 21 years old and just got my heart valve replaced with a new mechanical valve.  I have heard nothing but mixed reviews about drinking while on coumadin.  My aunt is on coumadin and she said her doctor said it is fine to drink while on it. (In fact I have seen her get really drunk while on it and nothing obviously happened.)  Every nurse I ask says no but, I feel they are always taking the over precautious route.  I consulted nursing's guides to drugs and the three different one I looked at all said something different.  One said extreme caution to drinking while on Coumadin, one said try to avoid drinking while on coumadin, and another said avoid alcoholism while on coumadin.         I am in College and this operation has changed my life. I have always been a very healthy person and now I am even more healthy than ever.  I do not drink every night or even every other night.  I drink on the weekends and very very very rarely during the week.  I am by no stretch an alcoholic and I having drank to the point of throwing up in about 2 years now.  In all honestly I would like to go out and get drunk once in a while.  Is this such a bad thing?  If it is I would like to here an answer from a medical profession and how risky it actually is.   Can anyone give me actual medical texts where people have died or been seriously hurt from drinking while on Coumadin?

20090128185735AAQsKGD	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I Need a way out of Trigeminal Hell?	5 years ago, I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia - TN. At the time, I took the medication and the pain went away. I took myself off the medication because I didn't like how it made me feel. Now my TN is back with a vengeance. I've been in constant pain since the week before Christmas.      Last week, I went back to the doctor and am back on medication. However - I'm not getting the same type of relief that I got the first time around. The medication works, but it's almost like its on a timer and if I don't take that next pill soon, the pain will follow.      Now, my question is this - I'm trying to get information on alternative pain management options. I'm currently on 200 mg of Carbatrol and my doctor wants me to up the dose in a few days. The Carbatrol brings relief, but it makes me feel extremely foggy and again - it is a short term fix to a long term problem.      I've googled different options, but there is a lot of contradictory information and the bottom line is - no one seems to know squat about the disorder. If anyone has any leads....or even a website or resource for me to research, it would be greatly appreciated.

20090128194815AAsXDN8	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I de-stink stinky exercise clothing?	It all comes down to the return of polyester!  Yes, ever since polyester left the Leisure Suit realm and made its way into performance fabrics (microfibers, yo!), I have been experiencing stinky, stinky workout clothing.  I have a hiking shirt, a few of those Nike dri-fit running shirts, and cycling jerseys that retain (and seemingly amplify) odor in the armpit region.  My sister has the same problem with her running stuff (we thought her cats were mad at her...well, they are, but they hopefully didn't do this!).  I'm fairly certain it's not a genetic thing because I've read pros&cons on cycling jersey fabrics and this is one of the drawbacks of the polyester stuff (i.e. they retain odor).  So...if my sis and I are not alone, how have people combated this?  Add vinegar to the washing machine?  Rub their pits with baking soda??  In all seriousness, if someone has found a way to rid the stench of excellence (not that it smells good...just that it is there because I'm taking steps to improve myself) from their clothing...I'm all ears.

20090128193616AAS6K5Q	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Can someone tell me if this is a pinched nerve?	Well, I use the computer about 15 hours a day, gaming, or using Userplane Chat.      About two weeks ago I noticed the left side of my left hand was numb.      Now, over the last week or so, the numbness has subsided, for the most part.      But I shrugged my soldier earlier tonight, and it felt like I had hit my elbow, or "funny bone".      I can only assume it's a pinched or agitated nerve.      Just a few questions.      Could this also be a sympton of carpal tunnel?      Could using the computer/typing so much cause a nerve to pinch?      Will this subside?      I'm not having any major pains or discomforts.      And the only time I get the slight jolt is when I shrug my shoulders.      The numbness is going away, slowly.      Is this anything to be worried about, or should I just give it time?

20090128190513AAffJkQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Uterine Cancer or Ovarian Cancer?	Hi everyone. I have missed my period for 7 months and I finally went to the gyno. She sent me for an ultrasound and they checked me out with an internal camera thing too. I asked the lady doing the ultrasound if everything was ok and she said she would let me know after she does the internal camera thing. After she did that, she didn't say anything so I asked her if everything was ok and she said they have to look at something and my doctor will get back to me. So as I was getting dressed, I look on the computer screen and one of the images has a red X on it. (I didn't touch anything) The next day my doctor called and left a message that she needed to talk to me, but when I called her back she was in delivery. I am freaking out and am scared I have uterine cancer or ovarian cancer. Pregnancy is ruled out and I am 24 years old. Has anyone had any experience with any situations like this? I also think it is bad because someone told me a doctor only calls if something is wrong and the red X on the image scared me. Any help from anyone would be appreciated or if anyone is in the medical field. Thank you.

I have been told that if ever I had one of my contacts fall out or become too dry to stay in, that I could clean or re-moisten the lens by placing it on my tongue. The basis for this being that the pH of your mouth is the same as the pH in your eye. I was also notified recently, through a friend, that he was told not to do so because of the presence of a bacteria in your mouth that may make you "go blind in 3 days."       I personally am critical of this last statement because of its source being word-of-mouth and may be just an urban Legend.      I do ask of anyone who supplies an answer to please supply references.

I'm talking about regular tea; hot water with a tea bag and low calorie sugar.       I stopped drinking soda because I decided that I drank way to much of it and it's not healthy for me. So, I planned to just drink water with juices sometimes but It's hard to drink water - doesn't taste good at all!!! And so I became addicted to drinking at least 3 cups of tea everyday instead of water.          What are the bad effects of drinking tea? Does it cause wrinkles, do anything to the skin?

20090128180304AAg5bHC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Need Help With Plantar Warts?	Hello. About a month ago I got 1 plantar wart on the side of my big toe. I ignored it for a bit, thinking it would go away. I went to the doctor about 2 weeks ago and he said to either use duct tape (which I read about) or he can cut it off after giving me an anesthetic. I said I'll think about it. I went on the internet to search for home remedies and found one using white vinegar (at the time I didn't have apple cider vinegar at home). So I followed instructions and put white vinegar on a cotton ball and taped that to my wart using a band aid. After a couple of days the wart didn't change in size but instead of the lump being there, there's now a hole and I can see the roots much clearer. Should this be happening? And once the roots are all gone what happens, do I just have that hole or? I'm going to buy apple cider vinegar tomorrow and switch to it instead of just plain vinegar.

20090128164902AAJgRY4	Health;Women's Health	Why have I been losing weight without trying?	I'm 16, female, 5'7" and I used to weigh about 130lbs.      The last couple weeks I was sick, I was dizzy all the time and lightheaded, but it went away. In just about 2 weeks, I lost 7 lbs. I went to the doctors to see if anything was wrong with me being dizzy, they said it was a virus (which I believe because I'm not dizzy anymore) but they weighed me and I was 123.      This week I weighed myself again and I'm 120. I still eat the same as I did before, I'm not exercising at all, so I don't know why I'm losing this weight.

Okay, I just got my cartilage pierced on the 17th of February (this year), and when I went to go clean it about 20 minutes ago there was blood on the back of the piercing and just a tiny clot of it, and then there was no more. I don't know if this is normal or not! It's been 8 days now and around the 23rd of February I woke up and found that same area with the cartilage piercing swollen and red. However, when I sleep, I do turn and roll around A LOT. Yesterday the swelling went down and ALMOST back to normal, and the redness went down, too. Today the swelling should be just about back to normal in a couple days, (or it looks like it), and the redness had also gone down a lot, too, but it's still a shade of red and there is still just a little bit of swelling. Anyways, is the bleeding normal because I slept on it and it's just now letting it all out? Because it's irritated? or is it infected? I don't know what to do!! Please help!! Also there is little tiny yellow-ish looking stuff that comes out from the piercing but it's barely anything. and it only comes out when I clean the piercing. PLEASE HELP!!

Ive been wearing a training bra since I was 10 (this is when I hit puberty btw) and a real bra since I was 12. When I was wearing my training bra I would always sleep with it on. This has happened to me with the real bra too. I can sleep with a bra on and not feel uncomfortable. It actually makes me MORE comfortable.       My mom thinks that since I wear my bra on to sleep, that my breasts will stop growing and they will shrink. Ive tried many times to sleep without a bra on, but it is very hard for me to fall alsleep.       If I wear a bra to sleep, does this make my breasts stop growing? What can this lead to? Should I stop wearing a bra to sleep?

Well, I've been sulking around acting like a lonely emo because I don't have many friends. and I'm not the "prettiest" person in the world.   But I really have NO problems compared to other people.   :/      For example, I remember a few years ago when I was 10 I was at one of my cousin's weddings.   a year later, they found out her husband had cancer, and he just died today, 4 years later.       There are even worse things than that, like being terminally ill..      But for some reason, even though I realize all that, I find ways to feel bad for myself.    Don't say anything like I'm selfish- I'm really not...

20090128184516AAWSM3W	Health;Women's Health	I have clear-white discharge.. it's a bit "fishy" smelling.. Please Help.?	I'm 14. I started having my period when I was almost eleven. Since that time, I've had clear discharge that turns white when it dries on my panties. It is sometimes white-ish, but not very. It smells a tiny bit "fishy", but this seems to only be the case 75% of the time. I am not itchy, I am not red, and I am not sexually active at all. I wear cotton panties and keep clean and I do not douche. I know that everyone has some discharge, but I have quite a bit sometimes, depending on the time of the month, and it's a bit "fishy". That's the reason I'm worried. I don't want to have to go to the doctor because I'm very shy... that's why I'm asking on the internet.       THanks in advance

I take 800mgs of ibuprofen every night so i can sleep cuz I have a lot of aches and pains that keep me awake otherwise. I am staying with my older sister and she freaked when she found out.

20090128190814AAOoVP5	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with my sister?	my older sister is 20 years old.  she has been manipulative, and a liar as long as i can remember.  she will lie to get herself out of things, or even lie to make a good conversation.  she lives with my mom and i, and her boyfriend and 7 week old baby live with us as well.  she won't do dishes, or even wash her son's bottles, my mother has to do it.  it's not that she outright refuses to do it, she just leaves the things next to the sink for my mom to deal with, or just asks my mom as sweet as possible to do it for her.  she is a part-time student, and she takes care of her baby, and that's about all she does.  but she tells my mom and i that we're lazy, because of something simple like the trash can being full.  my mom had 2 young kids at the same time, kept her house clean, cooked for all of us, took care of us and our dad, washed the dishes, and had a full-time job as well.  she is by no means lazy, and she did twice as much work as my sister does, and didn't have complaints, or three other adults in the house to help take care of her kids.    i am only slightly worried for my nephew, because i don't know if his parents will stay together, or what his mother will make him think about us.  she loves him unconditionally.  she has always loved kids, and she's really great with him.  but it's scary to think of how a kid will be able to understand how his mother can be completely fine with her family one day, and the next day, degrading us and telling us we're worthless.    it's hard to live with her, because if we don't give her what she wants, she yells at us and starts a fight.  the smallest thing can make her yell.  i'm not sure if it's because she's actually angry, or if it is because she wants to hurt us.  just an example of how she can be:  tonight the baby was crying, and she was obviously frustrated and tired.  she didn't know why he was crying, so she sent me downstairs for a bottle.  when i came back, i handed the bottle to her.  a few minutes later she yelled at me for bringing the bottle, because she found that he's not hungry.  and that i'm a "fat piece of ****" because i didn't get the mail today.  all my mom said to her was "tara, that's ridiculous, she didn't do anything.  you're tired, let me have the baby" and she continued to give my mom an attitude.  my mom told her "you have a problem" and she said, "you two are the ones with the problem, i'm leaving." and went downstairs.    to summarize (i should have done this in the beginning, lol.)    - my sister lies constantly, sometimes for no reason.    - she manipulates (for instance, getting my mom to cosign her truck loan, and refusing to get rid of the truck after she lost her job and couldn't afford it)    - she doesn't seem to appreciate people close to her.    - she has a short temper.    - she is insecure about her boyfriend being loyal, and i don't think she has a reason to.    - she uses terrible language constantly, which is embarassing, and it makes it seem like she was raised in a house that used bad language.    - she doesn't have a problem degrading her family members.    - she asks for favors from her family, even after she fights with them.    - she doesn't think she has a problem.    - she confides in her boyfriend's aunt like a mother, and i've heard her tell lies to her, so we seem like terrible people.    - she is NOT an alcoholic, or drug addict.    - she is very stubborn.    - she would never shoplift, but she takes things from my mom and i because she can, not because she needs it (such as an entire week's pay from me when she had a better job than i did)    my mom has researched narcissism, and thinks that is my sister's problem.  however, my sister refuses to think there is anything wrong with her, so she won't get help.  living with her is taking its toll, and if i were a weaker person, i would have broken years ago.    what can i do about this?  does anyone know what might be wrong with her?  i know that in a lot of cases, people like this won't get help so what can we do about living with her?  i seriously can't take it anymore, we need help.

20090128192856AA6X3jg	Health;Mental Health	Am I bulimic? Is this normal?	First of all, I'm not a stupid 12 year old who thinks its a good idea to go starve herself or whatever these kids ask on this site.      So here it goes: Starting from when I was 15, I started throwing up to lose weight. I'm 20 now. I would only really do it when I'm conciously trying to lose weight and dieting. Sometimes I do it several times a day, but there have been months where I don't do it at all and when I don't care what I eat. But whenever I diet, I always end up eating like crazy and throwing up.      I've read the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa and it says that to be considered bulimic, a person has to binge and purge on average around two times a week for three months.      So, am I bulimic, or is there another term for this behavior?      And secondly, is this normal? Are there people who throw up while dieting and aren't mentally ill? I've heard of that. I'm not sure if this is actually a problem or if its normal behavior.

My partner is 12 years older than me and although i wouldn't consider him as being old, the sex is much different than I would expect from someone my age. He really makes sure he takes care of my needs but I often feel like he wears himself out too much before he has an orgasm. Last night he didn't even have an orgasm during sex but I could tell he wanted me to think he did so I didn't mention it. He just seems so worn out when I am just getting started and around 4 am he finally was reenergized enough to give it another go.    Anyone have a similar issue? I just want to make sure he's as satisfied as I am.       P.S.- not sure if this is the right category but maybe someone is having this same problem with a younger girlfriend or wife

20090128185506AA7mUAq	Health;Men's Health	How can I fix this "body shape" or w/e (read the question, it'll make sense) Thanks!?	Alright. I'm 14 years old [this is a repost, the last question thought I was a girl until they saw my name was colin. anyone, I'm a male] and for the most part I think I've reached my max height at 5' 9", because my mom is 5' 4" and my dad is 5' 7.5" and my doctor agrees with me. I have no problem with this at all.      My big question is about my body shape and structure. I wear 30-30, 32-30, and 32-32 in the way of pants sizes, and I wear pants pretty low but not obscenely low. Anyway, I wear a Mens Small in shirt sizes, but it is too big. I have a few Boys 16/18 shirts, and they fit well.      I exercise alot, probably once every two days, and I workout for a little over an hour on a muscle mass building routine for upper body. My lower body is naturally built big, and strong, so I don't need to work on it. My upper body now is very strong, but not very big.      What I want to do is kind of, even out my body so to speak. I want an even, if not bigger upper body. I was considering steroids as an extreme but I don't want to do that, because I have (some) acne.      A little more about my body shape, I have a little bit in the way of fat handles above my waist, not much though. I don't do weight loss working out, I do muscle building so, I still have some body fat, unfortunately. I have a lot of body fat on my legs (I think). When I stand up, where I think there is body fat is hard, but when I sit down and the skin/fat/muscle (I don't know) shifts around, it gets kind of loose so I'm not sure about that. I have a little bit of fat around my shoulders, pecs, but not enough to speak of. I have some on my abs area, but not much. I have a huge butt, like a huge deposit of fat there. But a big thing is bone structure I think, I could be wrong though.      How can I increase upper body size, and lower lower body size? If anyone has any tips or tricks or ideas or something, let me know. If not, refer me to your nearest neighborhood steroids dealer.

I am not having these now but instead, i have been feeling really bloated with stomach cramps and gas. I have been getting irregular bleeding a little when i am not menstrating.

20090128201212AAoihO6	Health;Women's Health	Are mood swings normal for female puberty?	Yup, I've hit puberty. Fun, right? A few things are freaking me out, though.      Now right now, I'm pretty calm. But five minutes ago, I was pirouetting around my room, loudly singing a song in Japanese. (I'm a major anime fan. And a shoutout to all my otaku out there: if you wanna know the song, it was Tsumasaki, the 11th ending for Bleach! Really fun to sing.)     And I'm not the stoic kind, but spinning around in tune to a song, pretending I'm on stage isn't really my thing.      Here's another example: One moment, I'll be happy and peppy, the next I'll sober up and stay that way the rest of the day- for pretty much no reason. I just won't feel like smiling anymore. I'll snap at people when they call my name, and sigh.       Either I'm going crazy, or I could just blame it on puberty. Someone please tell me I can blame it on puberty?            ~ANOTHER QUESTIOIN!~   Don't worry, it's relevant. Does puberty come late for girls with ADD?

20090128195751AAoEApK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	I'M NEVER ALLOWED TO BE SICK?	My mum has had fibro myalgia for years. I have also not had the best health, I often have aches and pains and a lot of fatigue but my main uncomfortable thing I always have is motion sickness. I have it on and off regularly, and have had it non stop for about 2 weeks. Just feels like I am riding on a boat or in a car, even when I lie in bed I feel like the room is swaying and like I'll vomit. The doctor says it's from sinusitis and there's really nothing they can do unless I take antihystamines (that give me panic attacks and bad side effects). My mum does not take pain killers or any major medications to 'help' with her issues, yet she yells at me if I will not take antinausea or antihystamine medications, and says I just want to be sick and won't do anything to help myself. But I have told her several times that they don't help the nausea, but give me other bad symptoms on top of it. I also had an abnormal EEG, can this cause my symptoms? They are trying to tell me I have epilepsy when I have never had any kind of seizure, not even as a baby, or fainted, or had any kind of strange or blank episodes or any of the symptoms they claim I should have. I'm feeling frustrated about my health, my mum's reaction to it and the doctors that keep telling me I have something that I don't...      any advice or similar experience?

They removed a lot of tissue from both armpits. My right arm no longer hurts and I can move it freely. However my left arm is still sore but no where they did surgery. A little higher then my incision site a hard has appeared and the under side of my whole upper arm is sore and when I stretch out my arm I have a pain in my elbow area. It is not my elbow that hurts but feels like a sore muscle. It has felt like this for 3 days or so now. Could this be a blood clot or is it just my arm healing because to sew me back together the had to remove some skin from my armpit so I wouldn't have a lot of skin hanging. Could it just be because my skin has been stretch tight?

Ok, so about a month ago I had sex/ received oral several times in 2-3 days, after doing that the skin on the head of my penis became very dry and somewhat itchy.  Then about a week later, while it was still a dry, I had unprotected sex.  After that it became red in the places it was once dry and was sensitive, and even swollen for about 2 hour after.  I figured that it was just dry skin, so I left it alone for a week and lotioned it well, but it is still dry and itchy.   Everything i did has been with the same girlfriend i have had for almost a year so its not gunna be some bad STD or anything im pretty sure about that.  Maybe the vaginal liquids are getting in my dry skin and causing irritation.  Do u think i have to see a doctor or do u think it will get better in time if i leave it alone and keep lotioning it daily. plz help and ty

20090128193947AAYCuaI	Health;Men's Health	Having problems leaking after urinating, Please Help!?	I am a 24 year old male, and for about 2 years now, and the issue has gotten worse over time, every time after I urinate I leak small drops for about a good hour. Whenever I sit, bend over, cough, sneeze and such that also triggers urine to release. Also once and awhile I have a discomfort/burning feeling around the head of my penis after I urinate and during the same time I am leaking. It has gotten to the point where I have to wear a pad in my underwear all day long so I do not worry about leaking urine all over my underwear.  I have been to a urologist for this issue and he did a Cystoscope and found nothing wrong. He did not put me on any medication and suggested I go to a Neurologist. Well I did go to the Neurologist and he said this issue has absolutely nothing to do with nerves or muscles. So he stated I go back to the urologist or another urologist.    Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong with me and what I should do? Any possibility this could be sexually related in any way? I am a sexually active person.

So, I was chewing gum two days ago and when I first bit down, something popped on the right side of my face. Ever since then, my jaw feels slightly funny, like it's been pushed out of position. There's no pain, just mild discomfort if I open my mouth all the way. The day it happened, there were smaller pops whenever I chewed, but by the next day, even those sounds went away. I'm not sure if my jaw's getting better or if something happened to it that requires a visit to my doctor. Any help would be appreciated.

They steal and lie. This person has stole off of me and they owe me money right now. They say they will pay me back but that's not the point. I don't want to fight with this person. I've already said that I don't like what their doing and that they are going to be nothing in life if they continue to do heroin.They said that they knew that they would be nothing in life. I even broke down and balled my eyes out. When that happened they said "now I feel bad" but they are still doing it. Im pretty sure that I can't make them stop, they can only stop if THEY want to stop. I actually sometimes hide the fact that their doing it from other people. And I hate it, I feel like I have to because I love this person and feel like I should protect them. But it makes me feel like sh!t. what should I do?

I plan on seeing a doctor soon but I was hoping someone out there could give some insight and even maybe advice to what is wrong with me. I feel wound up tight inside and feel like crying most of the time. I don't think I am depressed since when I answer those questionaires I don't really have a lot of the symptoms. I just feel so stressed out I can't think straight and this has been going on for months, so much so I had to quit my job. I can't concentrate, I keep a headache nearly all the time,  my sleep is very broken, and I just feel like if I could control these physical symptoms I would be ok. I am normally a very optimistic positive person. I feel so weak though right now. If I can just stay home for the most part I am fine but whenever I am asked to be in a responsible position the fear and anxiety comes out. I learned the hard way I cannot work in a high pressure environment which my job very much was. (on for several hours, no breaks, dealing with many things at once etc)    I am ok financially for a few weeks and I have a temp agency working on finding me something else, but I do eventually have to go to work.  What can I do to work on what is wrong with me, and what do you think it is?

20090128203923AAGSrcU	Health;Dental	How long does the tingling and numbness last?	Mid-November... drunk and dancing... face meet Mr. Door Frame. Wheew! I already had beautiful porcelain veneers on my front teeth but that fatal night, I broke one (it looked like puzzle pieces, but still attached), the other jammed upwards and broke the bone. I went to my dentist the next day. He removed the one broken veneer and process began for a new one. No problem. The other "bunny tooth" had no visible crack signs and when x-rays were made, we really couldn't detect any cracks in the tooth. It was very loose though and the bone was definitely broken. My dentist, who I trust completely, said that we needed to play the waiting game. Since all this went down, I now have a new veneer on the broken tooth (everything is lovely there!) but the other tooth is still kinda...numb...and kinda still feels loose. My question is, how long does it take for the bone to heal and the tooth to feel a little more normal. It's not sensitive to hot or cold, and it doesn't hurt, and it looks right, so.... somebody talk to me. I feel like it's going to drop out if I use it to tear food...say a country ham biscuit! But, I can (slowly...maybe cause I'm so sensitive to it falling out or something) (gawd!) bite into softer things with my front teeth. Like I said, the other tooth is now fine. Can someone give me some kind o time-line here? Thank you in advance.

20090128204628AAwhMI3	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart palpitations-professional medicos please?	Hi...I've had heart palpitations for about a year now, just randomly, when I sit down or stand up suddenly.   Last night I didn't have anything for dinner and had a large coffee and nothing else.   I was going to sleep and there was a rather large pain in my chest. I ignored that and went to sleep.   So this morning I woke up and my heart is going crazy and I feel like I'm having palpitations all the time and just really not feeling well.   My problem is that I am only 18.   Do you think it is possible that this could be caused by a combination of caffeine, not enough water and perhaps a hole in the heart?   My father only just found out he had a hole in his heart last year and had surgery to fix it, we aren't sure if it's a hereditary thing, do you think it's possible for me to have that also?   I would appreciate professional answers from people who actually know what they are talking about, thanks.   I also know that this question isn't very useful and you will tell me to go to a doctor, but I feel I am making a fuss out of nothing and I need my worries justified, haha. Thanks
