20090223163459AA53lPf	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Would S-video coupled with an S-video to composite video adapter be better than straight-up composite video?	Okay, so I have a DVD player that can output both composite (RCA) video and S-video. I know that S-video is better because it avoids crosstalk and transmits luminance and chroma separately in the cable. However, I have a CRT television whose lone input is composite video (it's about a year old).      Would I achieve a higher picture quality if I used an S-video cable connecting to my DVD player on one end and ran the other end through an S-video (female) to composite video (male) adapter on the TV end than if I just used composite video on both ends? (You know, instead of running the video signal through the lower quality composite video 100% of the distance, I would run it through the higher quality S-video, say, 98% of the distance and composite video the remaining 2%.)      Would this help to reduce crosstalk and/or make for better picture quality (even just a little bit)? Or would it not really matter?      Thanks for your thoughts.      FYI: I already have the S-video cable. And I'm not planning on spending more than, say, three or four dollars for the adapter, should I choose to buy one.

20090222142616AAepDCR	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	My PS3 connection is all or nothing!?	I have DSL with a Linksys wireless router but the problem I'm often having was happening even before my wireless, when I used to have my ethernet directly from the DSL to my PS3. LOL I too am a COD4 and World at War head and when I go into a lobby that has already started or directly into a game, my connection will always be orange while everyone else's are atleat yellow but usually three to five bars in the green. BUT! If I go into a match and end up being the first player to enter the lobby (making me the host) I will always have five green bars and EVERYONE else will have one orange dot the entire game.     Now, honestly this is kind of great in a way. Because when I am the host I can just be running, see somebody just unloading on me and simply just pop them a couple of times lol. But none the less, it is really getting old, not to add that my couple personal friends that have PS3's do not like playing with me due to the terrible connections they will have for being in my party. Does anyone have a clue as to what I should do?    Ps. This happens when my PS3 is directly into my modem, my connection speed on the connection websites is always past the 2000 mark, I can always browse online etc. It's just when I'm on the Network that I go through this. But after a few days or weeks I usually end up back normal then it will start having this problem which also lasts for days or weeks.

20090222143215AA0md6o	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Light Saber Wii Remote Details?	I have a few questions about Light Saber Wiimotes, specifically Thrustmaster Glow Sabers. How close are they to standard Wii remotes? Can they be used for any games (Some things I've read say they're specifically for sword games - which would make sense) and do they also have an insert for nunchuck controllers? (I think it there should obviously be one, but at least one source actually denied that. I find that hard to believe, but I feel I should ask anyway.) I've done my research, but I've found a bit too many conflicting details, and I thought I could find definite answers here. I'm a newcomer to the Wii, so I'm a bit too ignorant for my own liking at this point.

Better than the first one? What should they put to make it a huge improvement? Anything new on it?       What I heard from somebody is that they should make it sort of an open world structure, which wouldn't be that bad of an idea, just that it would be a drag looking for the treasures. I think they should just make like one level having an open world structure like a small town or something. Also, as a proud platinum owner, they should definantly make a lot of trophies that involve stealth or shooting and make treasures not as hard to find (i didn't really like looking for them).      Anyway, enough from me. I want to hear from you guys!

20090222133207AAXBst3	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Other - Games & Gear	Do you think the PS3 will drop out of the console race next generation?	Since the xbox 360 and the wii are completely smashing the ps3, do you think the ps3 will not make it to the next gen of gaming and turn into the new sega and just make games for other systems? the ps3's graphics are the same as the 360 and the ps3's online sucks despite the fact that it is free. also its so much more expensive than the 360 and the wii and there aren't any good games for it. additionally it has blue-ray which i don't think anyone needs. the ps3 tried to take the good ideas from the 360 and the wii and tried to make something cool, but in my opinion it was an epic fail and i laugh every time i think of it.  Obviously the 3rd party games care a lot more about the 360 than the ps3 just look at the gtaIV add on. it was only released on the xbox 360 marketplace when they could have made it for the ps3 but didn't want to? So what do you think?

20090222122611AAFbcIw	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	How can I figure out what's wrong and fix my Pentax k200/lens?	So my friends and I were doing work when one of them accidentally knocked my camera off of the table about three feet only a carpeted floor. Doesn't sound that bad, but something happened. When I turned it on, the FA 50mm/1.4 lens apparently could not be read as it was before and the camera prompted me to input the focal length, which I had never seen before.   The camera and lens are still usable, but the aperture will not show in the lcd screen or the viewfinder, which makes most pictures under/overexposed if I'm not totally meticulous. Also, and what I'm more concerned about, it will not autofocus anymore.    This is the only lens that I have at the moment, so I can't figure out a way to figure out if it is a problem with the camera or the lens itself. I've tried taking the lens out and putting it back in a few times, but nothing has seemed to work. Is it hopeless? Will I have to relearn how to use my camera? Am I just overlooking something stupid that will magically make it read focal length again?   Thanks in advance. (:

So its an strategy game where the world is a small little ball and you are in a very early state of the humans. All the people look like indians and you need to build houses and temple's and barracks and that stuff. There are also priests who convert people to the other side. You need to put your people in barracks and then they will become soldiers. You also have god powers to let it rain fireballs and thunder. There are also statue headed things where you can pray at. There is also a building where you can put your soldiers in and they will become people who can throw fireballs or something. All people are humans and there aint monsters (as far as I know) in this game. The engine is 3D and you can go around the world with a little mouse push. I remember if you were playing missions or something that you were the collor blue. It was released around sims 1, or it was already released but its very old.

20090222131016AAW1wco	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Will my receiver work with my Xbox 360 to provide true Dolby 5.1 surround sound?	I've been fortunate enough to get a decent set of speakers from a friend and and old receiver. I've set up the entire speaker setup consisting of a sub, front left, front right, center, and rear right, rear left speakers. The only problem is that the rear speakers seem to be playing back the same channel. I feel like the receiver doesn't have proper support for the 5.1 that the Xbox 360 outputs, but I'm not sure.      The receiver is a Harmon/Kardon and is several years old. It says "Dolby Digital Pro Logic" in the surround mode area of the display so I imagine that is the surround sound that it supports. Will this give me the 5.1 surround sound I want when I'm hooking up to the Xbox 360?       Just to note: I have my 360 set to output 5.1 surround, and I'm running the red and white audio cables from my Xbox into the receiver.

20090222134357AAJk0hO	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	Sorry if I'm repeating a previous question but I am looking to buy a camcorder and want to buy the right one?	I went to a store and the salesperson deterred me from miniDV's and DVD because 1) it only records for short periods of time and 2) the quality isn't as good as a hard drive model or flash drive. So, I have opted for a flash drive model because it would suit my needs better than a hard drive model.    I have read a lot of reviews and found that the Canon FS100 looks like the best one in my price range (up to $300). Can anyone tell me if this is a good choice or if it isn't, what do you recommend? Thank you.
