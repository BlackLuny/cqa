vlCWp7sSaa	You are my new best friend. Someone who finally agreed with me. Well, I don't have any money to sue- but I did waste $20 for a copy. It needed a twist. Something needed to happen that we were not expecting. Instead it seemed like everything was repeating itself. The stupid clearing for example. Why does everything keep happening in the clearing? It ended happily ever after- and to be honest I hate books like that. I want to finish reading the book and think about events that could lead to a new story. No- the way I saw it was a story that was cut off as "and moved into a magical land and lived happily ever after."  That's a saying for "I'm out ideas."|`|83QTevwmaa	I have no idea what you're talking about. Bella's adorable to call Nessie her "little nudger." I loved that. I actually thought it was a perfect ending. So what if it ends too happy? And maybe the writing was a little different, but it wasn't bad. I just think people expect WAY too much from poor Stephenie that she makes ONE mistake and everyone criticizes her.<br>  I think Renesmee is an adorable name. :) Just say it aloud. It's beautiful, really.<br>  Again, so what if she has a happy ending? She so deserves it. It's Stephenie's story. She can do whatever she wants with it.|`|XxtVwslraa	Well, suing her sounds like a good idea but just return the book for now. I do agree the happy ending is even worse than this disney and they lived happily ever after. I was reading the ending, getting more upset by the minute, and thinking "if there isn't a fight i will burn this book." I would have been happier if all the Cullens would have died, sad slightly, but happier. This is what happens when authors can't detach themselves from their characters long enough to let real life happen to them.|`|FtagL9jQaa	I didn't like the ending at all.<br>  I thought it was too happy of an ending.<br>  In order for a story to be good, it needs to have somewhat of a tragedy.<br>  <br>  Like in Harry Potter-.main characters died, which led to a good story.<br>  The fact that nobody died in Twilight and it was a picture perfect ending was just bad fanfiction.|`|Gh0tLUjOaa	I don't like Stephenie Meyer any more than you do, but come on. YOU bought the book, probably knowing how sketchy her style is. You're just pissed off that the book didn't go your way--but guess what? It's HER book, her characters, her stories. You didn't like it, well tough. Next time, check it out at the library-at least then you can't complain about what a waste of money it was.|`|NQbtQwOUaa	I enjoyed all the series, however, I do think that the author should have left something hanging... the ending was too perfect. But I don't think it was bad writing, heck imagine how hard it is to come up with 700 pages of writing(good or bad).|`|tL73W0VZaa	I agree. I disliked the whole series, but "Breaking Dawn" just plunged over the edge of "bad writing" and into "pathetic writing."|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	You can't sue an author because you don't like the ending.<br>  <br>  Yes it sucked, but that's what libraries are for --So you don't waste the money|`|L4zq5ATsaa	News flash.  Stephenie Meyer didn't write this book for you, she wrote it for herself and happened to get a publishing deal out of it.  If you didn't like it, sell your copy back to the used book store, pretend it was a trilogy and write your own fan fiction so that it'll end how you want it to.   I personally liked it and will hang on to my copy.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	Breaking Dawn was one of my favorite books, and you can't sue Stephenie she has more money and is more powerful than you.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	What's wrong with a happy ending?  <br>  Goes to show how grim this world is, when people can't even accept something that is FICTION to be happy.<br>  <br>  Stephenie is allowed to publish what she wants.  Just because YOU didn't enjoy it doesn't mean it should be quarantined.<br>  <br>  And Bella will be losing lots. All her family and friends besides her lovely Eddie-poo.  <br>  <br>  And eventually she will lose him too in 5 billion years when the sun expands and swallows the Earth.<br>  <br>  Nothing is 'perfect', so calm down already. It's a bunch of words on paper, no need to get your panties in a knot.|`|kJs0RmtXaa	This just goes to prove that you can not possibly please everyone.  I thought the book was exciting and well written. Stephanie has said on her website that the reason every one lived is because this was a mental battle, rather then a physical one.  If it had been a physical battle with Volturi then there would have been, pardon the phrase, bloodshed on both sides. And Bella did lose something.  She lost her mortality. and she will lose, Jacob, her dad, her mom, her friends, even Phil. They will all die and she will not.  She will lose if you think about it that way.   Well anyway, even though I don't agree with your opinion, I still respect it.  And I am sorry you were so disappointed. :)|`|XgH9uuv9aa	The only reason some teens say the Twilight series is 'bad' is because they can't spell 'atrocious'.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	The whole series is poorly written. Anyone who got through the first book should have known what to expect.|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	again people, it's called "Smeyer's fairytale syndrome".. after all those talks about danger, death, pain, uncontrollable newborn impulses, volturi attack/threats in the whole series, then nothing? absolutely nothing? everything just falls into place? <br>  <br>  stupid, pathetic, redundant.. i swear i could not read words like beautiful, perfect, dazzling again without rolling my eyes.<br>  <br>  lol, i won't sue though :) Meyer's the boss, she chose write a not-so-nicely written book, and yet managed to turn it into a bestseller. kudos to her<br>  <br>  **though  i actually prefer breaking dawn rather than eclipse or new moon.

kwnXOlZBaa	Definitely go to strobist.blogspot.com like the above answer suggested.  Go through the lighting 101.  It's a huge "course" but well worth it!<br>  Here's what I did on a budget:<br>  2- Vivitar 285HVs (~$40 each on ebay)<br>  2-light stands (~$20 on ebay)<br>  2-flash/umbrella holders (~$15 on ebay)<br>  6-umbrellas (2 silver, 2 shoot thru, 2 softbox umbrellas) (~$2-$20 each on ebay)<br>  Then you need a cable and a sync splitter, available on ebay or www.bhphoto.com<br>  So all in all you can spend $150 and have a great set of umbrellas.  I spent more like $200 because I have a few different types of umbrellas, and I bought some gels for the flashes.<br>  I recommend the products from amvona.com but don't buy from their website, buy from their ebay auctions.<br>  They aren't super high quality, but they're great for the price.  They're not the super cheap bargain bin stuff, it's nice.  Everything I've bought from them I've been very pleased with (tripod, softbox umbrellas, shoot through umbrella)<br>  <br>  If you need to go even cheaper than that, get some foam board, the big white sheets.  One person above suggested covering it with tin foil, but personally I would leave it as-is.<br>  You can tape them together as a "T" and they will stand up.<br>  Now buy a couple of cheap clamp lights - they are typically used for garage and project stuff, about $7 each.  Now clamp the lights on the foam, aimed AT the foam.  Now you're reflecting (diffusing!) the light to create a softer look.<br>  Better yet if you can mount the lights a foot or so away from the foam board, you'll get better light spread.<br>  <br>  Keep the lighting consistent.

On the one hand, the debts left over from the war left the French king broke, and the refusal of the First and Second Estates to pay led to the revolt. On the other hand, most Americans supported the French Revolution, and American Thomas Paine is considered a French hero even today.<br>  <br>  The 1803 Louisiana Purchase was a way to support the French government and Napoleon, in part to thank them for support during the American Revolution.<br>  <br>  The French Revolution was what actually triggered independence movements throughout Latin American, but the people were also profoundly inspired by what the Americans had done a generation earlier.<br>  <br>  As late as the 1960s Ho Chi Mihn paid tribute to the American founding fathers.|`|f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	I'm sorry, but I don't know how much tribute the Chinese or Ho Chi Min truly had for our American Founding Fathers...not.  Yet, I do believe that it has had a huge impact on all of Europe.  I would not venture to say some countries actually 'dislike' their own histories and heritages, but I think our nation brought a 'light at the end of the tunnel' for many European nations.  Our independence was hard won.  But Europeans have been fighting such battles in their individual nations for centuries.  <br>  <br>  American national unity brought a hope that a fledgling nation can survive that I don't think had been in Europe since the great Reformation.  <br>  <br>  Still, we (the USA) should be inspired by their historic achievements and lengthier history as well.  <br>  <br>  The US Declaration of Independence speaks well for itself without my piney 'pros and cons'.  <br>  <br>  I just hope Americans themselves aren't losing sight of value of what we have.  The pro/con question makes me wonder.  (Sorry if you are looking to answer a homework assignment, but if you are asking this personally, go to the public library.

Many atheists are atheists because they were exposed to religious fanatics in their youth and are simply reacting to that emotional experience.  But some atheists are atheists just because that's how they see the truth of the world and they have no emotional disliking of religion, they just think it's not the truth.|`|6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	Are you anti-tooth fairy?<br>  <br>  Anti-Santa Claus?<br>  <br>  Anti-Zeus, Osiris, Vishnu, Cocopele, Mithra, and all the other gods that humans have worshiped?<br>  <br>  To be anti-something is to be opposed to it.  But how can you be opposed to something you don't even believe exists?  Atheists are against _believing_ in gods, but that's not the same thing.  Satanists are anti-god.  They believe that god exists but they are in rebellion against it/him.  But how can an atheist be in rebellion against something he doesn't recognize as existing?<br>  <br>  Atheists are not people who secretly believe in gods but are in denial or rebellion about it.  Atheism is not an excuse to behave unaccountably (and from personal experience, most atheists seem more moral than most believers).  We atheists really, really don't believe your god exists, just as you don't believe that all those other gods exist.

1hvrQYWiaa	The British political system at the time of the American rebellion was based very firmly on Anglican Protestantism.Laws stated very clearly the monarch had to be a protestant, and also that they were the head of The Church of England; even Protestants who were not Anglican had to pay for their own priests and build their own churches. Catholics were still denied the vote.<br>   To gather enough support among American colonists to successfully achieve independence, their leaders had to offer them something different, and to belittle the Anglican church in particular, so as to undermine the foundation of the British political system that ruled the American colonies.<br>   So,Franklin was saying that functional,useful things (such as lighthouses) contributed more to the safety and wellbeing of the individual than buildings that provided only spiritual things (such as churches)
eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Second World War and Korean War veterans remember the American Red Cross charging troops token fees for "comfort items" such as toothpaste, coffee, donuts, and cigarettes and for off-base food and lodging. The fee suggestion had been made in a letter dated March 1942 from the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to Norman H. Davis, the chairman of the American Red Cross. The thought was that allied soldiers were being charged so Americans should be charged too so as not to bring down allied morale. The Red Cross subsequently adopted the Secretary's suggestion as policy. Some[who?] veterans and their families have resented the Red Cross since because of the policy.<br>  <br>  To make amends, the American Red Cross issued an apology during Veteran's Day 2007 celebrations,stating "Thank you for your service to our country. And thank you for your support of the American Red Cross. And, now and forever, the coffee and doughnuts are on us." The Red Cross also set up a tent near the World War II Memorial in Washington D.C. and gave away coupons for coffee and doughnuts as they solicited donations for the organization. yeah yeah.

AA10097349	Speak of the devil, I just started a blog (and I swear I'm not trying to promote it... honestly) but I'm struggling with the same questions. <br>  <br>  The reason I blog is basically to get other people's input on my thoughts. If you make it about something interesting or that other people are into (cooking or writing or art) then yeah, it's a great way to discuss your ideas with a sort of broader range of people. The thing is, you could keep blogs private to you or your friends, but that to me defeats the purpose of a blog. Not everyone's a stalker and if you really just needed your friend/family's input, you could ask them in person or through any other communication we have today. <br>  <br>  It's also like a journal in the sense that, it's a way for you to get your thoughts organized in a way that you can express it to other people, which is always a good practice.  <br>  <br>  I've googled how to get mine popular myself and gotten some generic but sensible answers:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Blogging-Tips---How-To-Make-Your-Blog-Popular" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Blogging-Tips---...</a><br>  <br>  But, based on my own experience and the blog(s) I've visited and why I like them, I'd say one way is to establish yourself on some other website where you can easily get attention (even here if you're really desperate or rather) like on youtube or something. Make a video and then if people see your videos, also post a link to your blog there??? Not a great way, I guess but it's something. Get popular somewhere else because blogs can be otherwise obscure; not many people will google your username or even your blog name unless it's really clever, so you should spread the word starting somewhere else. <br>  <br>  For instance *shrugs nonchalantly* ... here's mine <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dream-parapet.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dream-parapet.livejournal.com/</a><br>  <br>  (So yes I did subsequently promote my own blog but you get the idea and you also asked if people would share their blogs)...

jCeylLsIaa	That depends on the angle of your shot. Where's the focus? if you're focusing on the couple...that's your love and unity...if the 2 are dwarfed by the vast expanse of beach...that's "you and me against the world"...if you have their footprints at the background...that's means "were' going somewhere...just the two of us". if your emphasis is the sun (if sunset, that means "love even at the prime of your life". if morning sun "hope for the two of us". if your focus is the beach (with the couple, a blur)..."God's "greater" creations...". if the couple is by the horizon...it signifies "nothing can go between us".|`|CjPtAEzmaa	For me, the beach symbolizes the meeting of two very different things, the land and the water. Usually the land and water are very far apart, and very different, but at the beach, they meet and exist in perfect harmony attached to each other. So, in a way, the beach does symbolize love. It seems to be a simile to the two people holding hands (attachment, meeting, harmony) to the land meeting the water (attachment, meeting, harmony). Sounds like a really nice photo :)|`|kPNnfjNSaa	I don't think the beach symbolizes love in that scene...but maybe it symbolizes the content and comfortable feeling the couple have when they're with each other, like everything is right in the world.|`|XZ4RcUHWaa	The ocean gives a feeling of something unimaginably large (like the couple's love for each other)<br>  <br>  The sounds of a beach are peacful and relaxing....|`|CTAg1Ugdaa	helloo!<br>  Wow, yes of course it does..<br>  Twopeople holding hands at a sunset on a beach symbolises love because of the fact that theyre holding hands, but the sunset, and the fact that theres a couple there, symbolises love.

Q4u2ZT1baa	hmm....everyone does learn at a different rate but if you learn fast......then with the right sources you'll be able to play some pretty good stuff within 3 months. i dont know what kind of music you want to play but i learned all of stairway to heaven, crazy train , and i made a song that sounded great on the acoustic all in under 3 months. BUT.....playing guitar, was literally all i did for those 3 months. I'm a quick learner myself because im persistent with it. You could probably learn to play a third of the Offspring's songs in a matter of 4 days if you're persistent with it, because its all mostly power chords as is most punk/pop punk music. this is also something that will help you pick up your knowledge of the guitar really fast if you study it. <a href="http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_lessons/discover_the_fretboard/notes_on_the_fretboard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_les...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  its a list of all of the notes on the fret board. DO NOT LEARN SCALES. learn this, its all of the scale put together, but by learning this, and not just all of the scales at different times, you will learn EXACTLY where every note is on the guitar. To find A-minor on that chart you just look between A and B. Also.....if you are not willing to suck up every bit of information you can get and study hard at it you will never become a good guitarist and you'll be stuck with power chords for the rest of your life. Trust me, its a lot of work at first, but once you get going with it you dont want to stop. if you have any more questions you can e-mail me at justmadethis123@yahoo.com|`|7Jwp70eXaa	Every person learns at a different rate. Most will learn in less than a week or can take up to a month . Well that depends on how well you practice and how long you practice. You can find free lessons at ultimate-guitar.com. They really helped me. If you want to learn fast. You might want to dedicate your free time learning and practicing guitar, listening to music . You might also use tablatures so can learn a song quickly. You find exercises that will quickly increase your finger strength from the said site. Here's a tip, if you wan't to learn fast practice everything slowly. This makes the learning process much faster. You should use a light gauge of strings when playing a guitar(a thinner set of strings),they will give you lots of pain after practicing for a while, but u should develope calluses after maybe 2 or 3 days, it will make playing the guitar less painfull and you'll be able to practice longer.<br>  And by the way its worth learning.<br>  And 0ne m0re thing, ull lern faster wid a teacher, i think. . .i nvr had one. .<br>  <br>  Rock on!!!<br>  or something . .haha|`|tT4vEiwSaa	It really depends on three things, first your ability to learn the guitar, how much effort you put in it, and what exactly you want to play. If you want to play something very complicated, you will be in the process for years. If you want to learn quick but want to rock ***, you should play punk from the 80s. The reason is because they often have very simple chords that even a beginner can learn quickly. Look into Misfits songs. I was a month into learning the guitar by the time I was able to play 4 Misfits songs- Static Age, Some Kinda Hate, We Are 138, and Hollywood Babylon. Now I can play almost their whole discography, and I'm 5 months in. If you want to play something within a month, go on ultimateguitar.com and look up Misfits tabs. They are simple to play but rock ***. This is an easy way to learn to play the guitar.|`|6GCAYAAiaa	its completely up to how much you practice, your style of music and most importantly: if you like it!! i learnt guitar and absolutely loved it. if you don't like it, well, don't do it!! success is 98% attitude and 2% knowledge. i've spent my whole childhood playing guitar/bass, it's worth it to just learn a few things on guitar but it takes years to master all the different techniques and modes and scales and chords (i could go on all day). i'd say just go for simple songs first 'cos everyones impressed just playing out a piece like G&R.<br>  ok first you go to a few lessons and start to learn i few riffs and songs and a simple technique. a lot of people will stop here and its fine if you do but you'll never be a pro guitarist. next if you want to you'll learn kinda theory stuff, techniques etc. you'll progress slowly/medium for a few years, then suddenly it will all come together and you'll shoot forward (no not overnightbut in a month or two you'll be so much better. after that its slow going towards the pro musician. but if one thing gets stuck, whether it's your finger speed or what you'll stay at step one (jamming out G&R riffs).|`|12fmOqQJaa	It kinda depends on what style of music you want to play and how much time you spend each day practicing.  In my opinion, its definitely worth it.  I practice for hours every day and I love it so much.  Also, some songs you can play by only knowing basic chords, like C, A, G, E, and D.  You should be able to learn a simple song well in the first week if you keep at it. (Your fingers hurt a lot at first, especially if you're playing a steel string).|`|4jyAH75vaa	People spend their entire lives learning to play an instrument...<br>  <br>  but in terms of learning a few songs, because you have such a strong background in music already, you'll likely pick up guitar pretty quickly.

D2JW4wKxaa	It is not legal to photograph a minor in a sexual context. She does not have to be nude for it to be a sexual context. Posing her in a bathing suit with a nude male is likely to be deemed a sexual context. Even if you could come up with a legal argument for this, it is so close to the edge that it could easily result in you having to argue it in court. It is better to not have to defend yourself against felony charges. <br>  <br>  Additionally her parents need to sign the release since she is not old enough to sign a contract. It is not wise to shoot anything controversial of a minor without a parents permission. Better to wait a year or get a model over 18. Far less trouble.|`|oXPDFw4daa	I can't address the legalities, but I will say that it would not be very prudent.  There are two issues:<br>  <br>  1.  The fact that the male is 19 and therefore legally able to give consent doesn't make it acceptable.  A good rule is that nude models should always be at least 21.<br>  <br>  2.  Having an underage female present when the male is nude would  also  create angst among the red necks in Florida (my home state, sad to say).  The fact that he is her boyfriend won't help.<br>  <br>  Remember that Florida is a politically conservative state, and society is heavily dominated by the religious right.

The major European countries began to colonize nations all over the world, though the largest conflict was in Africa. <br>  <br>  I would have to say that Great Britain was the most powerful then. They had a motto: "The sun never sets on the British Empire." and they had the most territory around the world (I think), though France was fairly close as well. Germany, Portugal, Italy etc. all got some colonies in Africa as well.|`|RZKBW0zzaa	I would say D. While America was prospering, it was not until after WWII that it became a super power. The Soviets too were not powerful until the late 20th century. Europe is a general term and it is possible that that is the answer. However, a better answer, I think, is Great Britain. They spent the 19th century trying to take over everything, india, africa etc.
iNXqiDIYaa	Berlin is a major center of culture, politics, media, and science in Europe.[8][9] Its economy is primarily based on the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, media corporations, environmental services, congress and convention venues. The city serves as a continental hub for air and rail transport,[10][11] and is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the EU.[12] Other industries include traffic engineering, optoelectronics, information technology, vehicle manufacturing, biomedical engineering, and biotechnology

bf5cDEyZaa	The term progressive has varying meanings in different countries.<br>  <br>  In some countries, the word refers to left-wing politics. For instance, in the United States, the term progressive emerged in the late 18th century into the 19th century in reference to a more general response to the vast changes brought by industrialization: an alternative to both the traditional conservative response to social and economic issues and to the various more radical streams of socialism and anarchism which opposed them. Political parties, such as the Progressive Party, organized at the start of the 20th century, and progressivism made great strides under American presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William H. Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Baines Johnson.|`|FMJ9H0rjaa	In general Progressivism stands most truly at the opposite pole from economic elitism, and has enjoyed its greatest support and successes precisely when the injustice, exploitation, arrogance, and greed of economic elites become intolerable — to both liberals and conservatives alike.

Again, we don't know. There are a few suggestions. The most common is that it alludes to the belief that, under English law, anyone who survived three attempts at hanging would be set free. This is probably from the story of John 'Babbacombe' Lee. Lee was a West Country sailor who was convicted of the murder of Emma Keyse at Babbacombe Bay in 1885. He was sentenced to hang at Exeter prison and three attempts to execute him all failed. The Home Secretary of the time, Sir William Harcourt, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and Lee was later freed. He was known thereafter as 'the man they couldn't hang' and went on to live a long life, dying sometime in the 1940s. Fascinating story though it is, the use of 'third time lucky' predates it and thus it can't be the origin. Nor is any earlier reference to the supposed English law on freeing those who survived three hanging attempts. This legal ruling never existed in any general sense and is restricted to isolated cases like Lee's. <br>  <br>  Another suggestion is that it refers to the Christian Trinity. There seems little to support that idea. It might relate in some way to goodness or luck being associated with the number three, but has no specific link with the third of anything.<br>  <br>  It seems more likely that it is just a folk belief that, having had setbacks, we ought to persevere and not give up. This is enshrined in the phrase 'try, try and try again'. Three seems to be the right number of times to try. Two isn't enough but four is too many. Think of every time you've seen a drama in which a character tries to unlock a door with an set of unfamiliar keys. The first key fails, the second key fails - it is always the third that works.|`|1Z5f82lqaa	This poem was uncomfortable to read, and it needed to be.

y8bFwXZEaa	I will answer based on a presumption: that you mean the essence of man. You are not clear on whether you mean the essence of man, or the essence of existence.<br>  <br>  The essence of man is a like the color of an object. It exists, but not without the object. You can't have "blue" without something that contains it, like the sky or the sea.<br>  <br>  So in the case of man, essence does not preced existence, nor does existence precede essence. They come as a package deal. <br>  <br>  Man without essence is a vegetable lying in a hospital bed.

P1alfkrJaa	I don't know any Muslims who would agree that `those words are for that time only'. The Quran is supposed to be THE last word from God and the very title, `Quran', means "the telling" as in God is telling the world what He wants/who He is. And in this `telling' you have lines like these from Surah 4:76 -"So let them fight in the way of God who sell the present life for the world to come;and whosoever fights in the way of God and is slain, or conquers, We shall bring him a mighty wage." and, later, around verse 80, "The enjoyment of this world is little; the world to come is better for him who fears God...Wheresoever you may be, death will find you, though you be in lofty towers." From Surah 5:56, "O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends...God guides not the people of the evildoers." And then there are the passages already cited here by others from Surahs 8 and 9. And, believe me, there are plenty more. I also had many Muslim friends at one time but their belief in this book as THE final word of God - and my lack of belief in same - ended the relationships. It is not just a handful of misguided people misinterpreting the Quran which is the problem - it the book itself and the belief system the book supports.|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	I believe those words are meant for that time only... I have so many muslim friends some had been co-worker and classmates yet they are so friendly and join the good times. some people just deliberately misunderstood the verses literally to justify their hate and brutality. I much admired the line "In Islam.. every human is part of GOD." yes! Its a universal fact that roots unto the deepest meaning of the Islam spirituality that connects to other religious beliefs. It is DIVINE not HUMAN understanding!|`|2OS6mq6Saa	God revealed His will to the angels, saying: "I shall be with you. Give courage to the believers. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads, strike off the very tips of their fingers." (Sura 8, Verse 12)|`|yuuvBSKsaa	By all means read the Qur'an.  Treat yourself to the charming suggestions for the proper treatment of Christians such as Sura (9:5) <br>  <br>  "And when the sacred months are passed,  kill those who join other gods with God wherever ye shall find them; and seize them, besiege them, and lay wait for them with every kind of ambush; but if they convert, and observe prayer, and pay the obligatory alms,  then let them go their way, for God is Gracious, Merciful.<br>  <br>  Got it?  <br>  When an American says 'mercy' they mean the kind and tolerant treatment of people with different beliefs. <br>    <br>  The Muslim definition is sparing the lives of those willing to convert.|`|LH1gqxdBaa	This is not true. As Muslims are instructed to Love all of God's creatures. Islam is not the problem some so called muslims are the problem with their self-righteousness and ego. In Islam, every human is part of God's creation. The refrence of infidals was when these guys were trying to kill muslims for their peaceful ways so God asked Muslims to defend themselves. It is according to that time only! Peace and Blessings!
Yz981zO6aa	Go to Playbill.com. They have job listings.|`|YxO8kVlWaa	I'm an American set/lighting designer, so I can't give you UK-specific advice, but... if you're looking locally for low-level positions, your best bet is to contact a local theatre and get in touch with the Production Manager; barring him/her, the Technical Director or Master Electrician. Once in touch with these people, ask to be put on their overhire list. An overhire list contains names of people to be used on large-scale calls, such as a strike or a big put-in. Answer a few calls and you will become a regular; I know a few people who get regular show calls from several venues in town and this is their living.<br>  <br>  To work on a show-length project, your best bet is to contact an independent theatre company (i.e. a company that doesn't own a venue) and ask if they need a production intern/carpenter/electrician/scenic for their next show. This will likely be less money, but you will get a better feel for the business and the available jobs. You can also get training this way, and you may get recommended to other companies for other positions. For example if you show yourself to be a good carpenter on one production you could become a technical director on another.<br>  <br>  To find theatre companies in your area, the web is a great resource. Otherwise, look at the theatre listings in your local paper, call the reservation line and ask for contact information for the company.|`|f42b59297654b7eb6918a980d6b6cf64aa	The Stage a newspaper that comes out every thursday

I'd read it.|`|sYaD9zcEaa	That sounds really good and I don't really like books like that   GO 4 IT  i would try to publish it if i was u   My friend wrote a book of quotes and got it published  SO COOL|`|k020tpALaa	no first off your book has waaay to many components plus no one will read this.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	Ok, it's a little derivative of various others books, but it still sounds interesting, I like the idea of him raising the Griffin himself.<br>  <br>  One thing to be careful about, you set your story up very well, lots of things thought through, but then you go into generalizations, about an epic journey, finding out dark secrets etc... make sure you actually know what all this is going to entail, otherwise you will get beyond the early stages of the story, into the actual meat of the tale, and find you have no plot.<br>  <br>  Keep a good eye on your grammar and command of English though - I'm assuming you are a young person, still at school?  If that's the case could you get a teacher to help you out with that side of things?  Might help a lot.<br>  <br>  Keep at this one though, it's not even the type of book I enjoy much, but it still sounds interesting to me.|`|dQmFoRRiaa	Sounds like an interesting concept in fantasy literature; you might want to write this one.

f4Nn0W1xaa	I think that very creative people also tend to be a little peculiar. Peculiarity isn't the surest route to security in this world so we end up with a chicken or egg type of argument. Does hardship breed genius, or does genius breed hardship? I would tend to argue the latter, personally.|`|oo1bOj9caa	I would think that in order to take the time to create a piece of art and or literature, the prerequisite is wealth, meaning not having to work all day and having enough to sustain yourself whilst you are creative. So it is not hardship, it is a high standard of living in a country that allows some of its citizens to be creative and not starve to death before they have accomplished something. Compare creative output of Zimbabwe with Tunisia, of Japan vs China in 1930-1990, to make that point.
bMVJkCShaa	Are you playing on an acoustic or electric guitar?<br>  <br>  I've always found acoustics a pain in the ****; I have RSI in both hands and holding down the strings really can hurt if I'm not warmed up.<br>  <br>  Try switching to an electric; the strings are thinner and so easier to hold down. As for jumping from chord to chord, that's just down to muscle memory. I would say increase your practicing to no less than 30min sessions, preferably 2 a day. (if you're only spending 15mins on the guitar in each session, this could explain why your muscle memory isn't kicking in).<br>  <br>  Stick with it, it's worth it in the end!|`|eeUhEGeVaa	Learning guitar is a lifelong pursuit, you will never absolutely master it but it's great fun trying.

You are a complete beginner. Yes, it is normal for it to take so long. It will take several YEARS for you to become an accomplished guitarist.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Never quit. Start with chords A, D, E (it's the key of A)<br>  Nylon strings are softer for beginners and not as hard on the finger tips as found on a folk guitar.<br>  There are also 2 chord song books available.<br>  Try some simpler older songs. Strum simply and sing along.<br>  I wish you the best on this.<br>  But NEVER quit!!
TAIlyvgyaa	OK, Intercalary means  - "Inserted between other elements or parts; interpolated"<br>  <br>  Allegory means -  "The representation of abstract ideas or principles by characters, figures, or events in narrative, dramatic, or pictorial form. <br>  A story, picture, or play employing such representation. John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and Herman Melville's Moby Dick are allegories. <br>  A symbolic representation: The blindfolded figure with scales is an allegory of justice."<br>  <br>  Therefor Allegorical means (in this instance) chapters using allegory/allegories.<br>  <br>  Now, it really would have taken you less time to look those up yourself, than wait for all of us to give you answers and you might find more information that way.

I have since i was a little girl~ however I did not completely devote my life to him until my 30's.

My faith in God~ is my existence.<br>  <br>  My life~ it is because God gave it to me. I believe our lives are for us to learn certain things while we are here on Earth. We are to learn what is important and what is not in our being. We are to face challenges, some not so good, but they are what make us grow and become stronger in our selves. I believe we are to become who God meant us to be.<br>  <br>  Love is the one main lesson for us all to learn. Unconditional love~ that is the big difference from just love.

It can be directed. The best direction can be found by using the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The Articles of Confederation, the first official government of the United States had many serious weaknesses. 1) Under the Articles there was only a unicameral legislature so that there was no separation of powers. 2) The central government under the Articles was too weak since the majority of the power rested with the states. 3) Congress, under the Articles, did not have the power to tax which meant that they could never put their finances in order. 4) In order to change or amend the Articles, unanimous approval of the states was required which essentially meant that changes to the Articles were impossible. 5) For any major laws to pass they had to be approved by 9 or the 13 states which proved difficult to do so that even the normal business of running a government was difficult. 6) Under the Articles, Congress did not have the power to regulate commerce which will cause competition between states as well as diplomatic issues.

sc4BtGxGaa	The previous responder has only SOME of their info correct.  Usually called a *split E* mechanism, it really splits the G pads (2 of them) into independent mechanism.  The LOWER of the two G pads should stay closed (using a clutch mechanism) when you play E3.  This does NOT make F#3 harder, stuffier, etc. - this is another note that can sometimes be problematic, and is usually solved with alternate fingerings, or fingerings that pertain ONLY to that situational passage.  See www.wfg.woodwind.org for alternate fingerings.<br>  <br>  A split E mechanism necessitates an offset G key, rather than an inline  G.  The offset is much more ergonomically conducive for MOST players, regardless of hand size; there are some players who have played inline G for so long, that they find off set G strange - but it is worth adapting to!!<br>  <br>  There are OTHER ways to conquer the inherent acoustical freak in E3.  One way is to have a *donut* installed in the lower G tonehole.  This works well, adds no mechanism or weight to the flute, and is *reversible* if you find you do not like it.  Another way, far less common but EXCELLENT, is the RF ( named fro Ray Fabrizio) modification; the lower of the 2 G toneholes is SMALL - the size of the C toneholes, almost as small as a trill key pad.  I sold a very good Emerson flute with this key to a good student of mine - this works really well.  The G# key must now be placed differently and  LOOKS longer, but has the identical amount of travel as normal - it feels and plays the same.<br>  <br>  Some flutes just plain do not need ANYTHING for E3.  But you will need to use alternate fingering for rapidly moving from E3 to A3 and back - that is just not going to go away, no matter what.<br>  <br>  Unless you are getting great deal on that split G, do not bother - you will have to deal with weight and ROLL issues, and might as well get the flute you want, and then have a GOOD flute tech ( not the local band instrument guy, unless they are NAPBIRT or a flutist themselves) retrofit a donut.  CHEAP to do.  I have owned professional-level flutes in the last 10 years will all of these options - I currently play a Muramatsu with a donut, even thous I tried one with the split - my last pro flute had a split, so I was used to it - and I went with the donut.  I also got the C# trill key - THAT is worth having!<br>  <br>  If you can get to the National Flute Association convention in NYC this August, you will have the WORLD laid out at your feet to try - and thousands of experts opinions to listen to!  I'll be there - I'll help you choose!  If not - I hope I helped you more than confusing you!|`|dlidLQK6aa	I know "split g mechanism" only as the more correct but less used name for "split e mechanism" which makes the high e easier but the f-sharp harder to play.<br>  <br>  I'd never choose a flute without playing it for, say, a couple of weeks! Split e mechanisms for example often (but not always) require a weird stretching of the little finger - if yours is short that would mean that this maybe isn't a good flute for you.

pbw7chpyaa	Sounds like you need to raise the money to pay for a "proper" yearbook.<br>  <br>  In general crappy online yearbooks are the result of the expense of printing limited run items with plenty of pictures like yearbooks.  Most yearbooks are subsidized by the school system as well as being paid for by the students.  It isn't your teacher making the choice, it is the administrators who make the budget.  So blame them or blame the people in your town for being cheap and/or broke, but don't blame the teacher<br>  <br>  On line yearbooks still give students the experience of assembling the photos and writing, the actual creative work, without the high costs.  It's a compromise which retains the "learning" experience while not incurring what many see as a frivolous expense.<br>  <br>  So if you want printed yearbooks, find out the costs and then raise the money.

XN0cYCATaa	What is truth?<br>  "What is truth?" is a very simple question.  Of course, answering it isn't so simple.  We can offer definitions like "Truth is that which conforms to reality, fact, or actuality."  But this basic definition is not complete because its definition is open to interpretation and a wide variety of applications.  What is reality?  What is fact?  What is actuality?  How does perception effect truth?  We could offer answers for each of these questions, but then we could again ask similar questions of those answers.  I am reminded of the paradox of throwing a ball against a wall.  It must get half way there, and then half way of the remaining distance, and then half of that distance, and so on. But, an infinite number of halves in this scenario never constitutes a whole.  Therefore, it would seem that the ball would never reach the wall if we applied the conceptual truths of halves.<br>  <br>  The ball-against-the-wall scenario simply illustrates that defining and redefining things as we try to approach a goal actually prevents us from getting to that goal.  This is what philosophy does sometimes as it seeks to examine truth.  It sometimes clouds issues so much, that nothing can be known for sure.<br>  <br>  But, even though it is true that an infinite number of halves (1/2 of "a" + 1/2 of the remainder + 1/2 of the remainder of that, etc.) does not equal a whole, we can "prove" that it does by simply throwing a ball at a wall and watch it bounce off.  Actually, the "1/2" equation above does not equal a whole -- mathematically.  The problem is not in the truth, but in its application as is often the case with philosophical verbal gymnastics.<br>  <br>  "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ," (Col. 2:8).<br>  <br>  In order for truth to be defined properly, it would have to be a factually and logically correct statement.  In other words, it would have to be true.  But, perhaps we could look further look at truth by determining what it is not.  Truth is not error.  Truth is not self-contradictory.  Truth is not deception.  Of course, it could be true that someone is being deceptive, but the deception itself isn't truth.<br>  <br>  In relativism, all points of view are equally valid and that all truth is relative to the individual.  If this were true, then it would seem that this is the only truth relativism would have to offer.  But, the problem is that in reality, relativism isn't true for the following basic reason.  If what is true for me is that relativism is false, then is it true that relativism is false?  1) If you say no, then what is true for me is not true and relativism is false.  2) If you say yes, then relativism is false.  Relativism seems to defy the very nature of truth; namely, that truth is not self contradictory.<br>  <br>  Again, what is truth?<br>  If there is such a thing as truth, then we should be able to find it.  If truth cannot be known, then it probably doesn't exist.  But, it does exist.  For example, we know that it is true that you are reading this.<br>  <br>  Is there such a thing as something that is always true all the time?  Yes, there is.  For example, "Something cannot bring itself into existence."  This is an absolutely true statement.  In order for something to bring itself into existence, it would have to exist in order to be able to perform an action.  But if it already existed, then it isn't possible to bring itself into existence since it already exists.  Likewise, if it does not exist then it has no ability to perform any creative action since it doesn't exist in the first place.  Therefore, "Something cannot bring itself into existence" is an absolute truth.<br>  <br>  The preceding example is a truth found in logic.  But, there are truths that are not logical by nature.  It is true that I love my wife.  This isn't logically provable via theorems and formulas and logic paradigms, but it is, nevertheless, true.  Therefore, we can say that truth conforms and affirms reality and/or logic.<br>  <br>  Is this what relativism does?  Does relativism confirm to reality and logic?  To be honest, it does to some degree.  Relatively speaking, there is no absolute right or wrong regarding which side of your head you should part your hair, if you part it at all.  To this we must concede relative "truths" that are different for different people.  But, these are relativistic by nature.  Examples of relativistic truths are, 1) people drive on the right side of the street in America and the left in England; 2) I prefer to watch science fiction over musicals; 3) snow is better than rain, etc.  These things are relative to culture, individuals, preferences, etc., and rightfully so.<br>  <br>  If we are to ever hope to determine if there is such a thing as truth apart from cultural and personal preferences, we must acknowledge that we are then aiming to discover something greater than ourselves, something that transcends culture and individual inclinations.  To do this is to look beyond ourselves and outside of ourselves.  In essence, it means that we are looking for God.  God would be truth, the absolute and true essence of being and reality who is the author of all truth.  If you are interested in truth beyond yourself, then you must look to God.<br>  <br>  "I am the truth"<br>  For the Christian, the ultimate expression of truth is found in the Bible, in Jesus who said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life..." (John 14:6).  Of course, most philosophers and skeptics will dismiss His claim, but for the Christian, He is the mainstay of hope, security, and guidance.  Jesus, who walked on water, claimed to be divine, and rose from the dead, said that He was the truth and the originator of truth.  If Jesus is wrong, then we should ignore Him.  But, if He is right, then it is true that we should listen to Him.<br>  <br>  The eyewitnesses wrote what they saw.  They were with Him.  They watched Him perform many miracles, heal the sick, calm a storm with a command, and even rise from the dead.  Either you believe or dismiss these claims.  If you dismiss them, that is your prerogative.  But, if you accept them, then you are faced with decisions to make about Jesus.  What will you believe about Him?  What will you decide about Him?  Is He true?  Is what He said true?<br>  <br>  Truth conforms to reality.  Jesus performed many miracles and rose from the dead.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Absolute truth and relative truth?

0allQKP4aa	Tuskegee, Alabama|`|MGHTJx0Waa	Facts in Brief: <br>  Birth: Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913 <br>  <br>  Parents: Her parents are James and Leona McCauley <br>  <br>  Education: She went to King at Anderson <br>  <br>  Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913(Encyclopedia of World). Rose’s mother was a schoolteacher and her father was a carpenter. When Rosa was old enough to go to school she went to Montgomery Industrial School for girls. At the age of fifteen Rosa graduated from All African American Booker T. Washington High School in 1928. Rosa also attended Alabama State College for a short time. <br>  <br>  At the age of nineteen Rosa married a man named Raymond Parks who at that time was a barber. Rosa and her husband were both involved in various civil rights causes, such as getting voting rights for blacks. Park’s husband died in 1977. A few years later, her mother and brother died as well. Rosa has suffered from heart problems, but continues to be active, working with NAACP and other civil-rights groups. Rosa Parks has been given many awards and honors in recognition of work ( Black Americans). <br>  <br>  Rosa Parks was very influential in all aspects of the Civil Rights movement, but her biggest contribution was the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Like most other people she depended on the buses to get to work. In Montgomery, the first ten seats of every bus were reserved for white passengers, and the blacks could not sit in them, ever, even if there was no white person on the bus at the time. The back seats on the bus were for the blacks and if there are no white seats left and the whites needed a seat the blacks were forced to get up and stand. Some of the bus drivers had a practice; they would make the blacks pay at the front and then he would make them get off the bus and get on at the back of the bus. Some of the bus drivers would take off with out the blacks after they had paid their money at the front of the bus as they were trying to get on the back of the bus. One day, when Rosa was riding the bus, she recognized the bus driver, his name was James F. Blake, he was one of the bus drivers who had the practice of driving off without the blacks. Rosa got on the bus and sat down. Later, a white person got on the bus and needed a seat. Blake asked four black people to get up for the one white person all of the blacks refused at first. Blake asked again and said they would be arrested if they did not move. The other black people got up but Rosa refused. Rosa Parks was arrested and had a trial. The African-Americans in Montgomery protested Rosa’s arrest and a boycott was held against the Montgomery, Alabama buses.<br>  <br>  After Rosa’s trial upon the advice of her attorneys, Rosa deiced not to pay the fourteen dollars fine or the court cost(Reference Library of Black America). The case was appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 20, 1956 the court ruled Montgomery’s segregated seating was unconstitutional(reference Library of Black America). After the trial because of the boycott, Rosa and Raymond both lost their jobs.<br>  <br>   <br>  In 1965, Rosa became an assistant Representitive. for John Conyers Jr. of Michigan. In 1987, Rosa established the Institute for Self Development for young people.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	They are generic terms given to the English dramas of medieval times.<br>  <br>  Mystery Plays: Mystery plays were Bible stories. There were four or five short mystery plays in each presentation. Clergymen were the actors. Each presentation was broken up, and staged all over town. One stage was located right outside the local church. Another scene might be staged in a wagon that was pulled through town. Some scenes were placed in different parts of town. The audience moved from stage to stage. The mystery plays were quite fun and very well attended by commoners and nobles alike. The stories included the Birth of Jesus, The Wise Men, and the Flight Into Egypt.<br>  <br>  Miracle Plays: Miracle plays were plays about the lives of the saints and the miracles they performed. Again, the clergy were the actors. These plays were staged like the mystery plays. <br>  <br>  Morality Plays: Morality plays began with the rise of towns. Actors performed these plays. The stories were about virtues and vices such as fellowship, good deeds, and death. The towns also produced miracle and mystery plays that were performed by actors. Some sets for some plays were really elaborate. Sometimes, there were no sets at all. This was especially true of plays performed in the cathedrals. The backdrop of the cathedral was the setting.

They whipped up a storm of public protest in spite of the fact that there was no concrete evidence available to prove the Spanish had definitely been the perpetrators. The government responded to the clamour for action against the Spanish by adopting a hostile and aggressive attitude towards them which eventually led to armed conflict.

PXxd4EAYaa	The numbers in the tab refer to semi-tones, based on the open string note, noted in the beginning. So if the tab looks like this : <br>  e|--1-- <br>  it means you shall play the note, that is one semi-tone over "e", which would be an "f". If it looks like that: <br>  e|--5--2--3--5--   e.g.<br>  it means you shall play 5 semi-tones over "e", which would be "a", then 2 semi-tones over "e" (f#), 3 semi-tones (g) and then 5 semi-tones again. <br>  All these notes can obviously be played on the violin as well ;) But I don't know whether it is that useful, because you have to translate all the numbers into notes, which is not really the general idea of tabs.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	sure its possible. violin players know where certain notes are on the string so if a tab says 2 or 3 or whatever - they have a general idea of where to go.  its just not a explicit as a guitar :p

TbTO5SXlaa	Well I looked at your example at full size and what I saw is an image that is ever so slightly out of focus. It also suffers from a shallow depth of field due to using a larger aperture. <br>  <br>  From your example I'm guessing that the light wasn't all that good and you had to use a large aperture (f3.5? f4?) and higher ISO (400? 800?) to try and keep a reasonable shutter speed. If this was indeed the situation then next time try using a tripod so you can use a smaller aperture (f11, f16) and a lower ISO (100). If you'll shoot in Aperture Priority Auto (A), use a tripod and let the camera select the shutter speed you should get better results. Use the camera's self-timer to release the shutter.<br>  <br>  All built-in flash units like the one on your camera produce a harsh, unflattering light. One way to help alleviate this is by using a diffuser like the ones sold by Gary Fong ( <a href="http://www.garyfonginc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.garyfonginc.com/</a> ). The alternative is to buy a Nikon SB-600 flash unit. This unit allows you to bounce the flash in landscape or portrait orientation which gives a softer, more natural look to your flash pictures. I also suggest the Nikon SK-6 Power Bracket to get the SB-600 off the camera. If the SB-600 is too much for your budget then take a look at the Vivitar 285HV. NOTE: Many years ago there was a Vivitar 285. If used on your D70 it will fry the electronics. If you decide to buy, make 100% certain its the newer 285HV. You can find the 285HV for under $100.00 at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a> or <a href="http://www.adorama.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.adorama.com</a>|`|C77c0OE2aa	That shot is very dull and lifeless. It simply needs more light. Yes, you are correct in that the on camera flash is horrible, but there are times when you MUST have an extra external light source. Otherwise, you are going to be forced to use high ISO and or long shutter speeds, either of which creates noise... even with a DSLR. There is no free lunch. What you need is an external flash AND a remote trigger to fire it. Using the on camera flash to fire the external flash as a slave is worthless because the on camera flash is still going to ruin your photo. You could also use a bright light source on your close ups, but you will have to be sure and learn to set your white balance correctly for the light source and you will still need a tripod.<br>  <br>  But the basic answer to your question is: LIGHT is what will allow you take photos without settings that produce noise.<br>  <br>  steve|`|R7Hexutqaa	More light with lower iso setting will reduce noise. Obviously to get that good natural light look your on camera flash will not do.  <br>  <br>  So you can use a tripod and slow shutter (if the image is a still life) or you can add light with off camera lights or flash|`|AA11119636	try shooting in RAW then process...<br>  <br>  if you are shooting in JPEG make sure it's the highest resolution<br>  <br>  <br>  more light<br>  make sure it's 100% focus<br>  use photoshop sharp filter|`|j5CwVtn9aa	reduce the iso to a lower iso    i would think

zpGccg1caa	Actually, I hate Twilight because it's just another cliched crappy teen book that appeals to preteen girls who have the mental capacity of an shoe.

When I ran out of Twilight books, The Obsessives called me @ 4AM to reserve for books.<br>  2. The Obsessives demand me to order directly from the publisher for books (i'm like, "NO F*ing WAY!)<br>  3. A Twilight Obsessive even accused me of keeping the books out of sale so I "can sell it later for a higher price when demands get higher" (i'm like, "excusez-moi? i profit good even w/out Twilight).<br>  4. The Obsessives are sooo aggressive in getting the Books.<br>  5. They claim that it's the BEST book ever (when some of them haven't read a REALLY GOOD BOOK before. Not one.)<br>  <br>  I think that explains enough why Twilight obsessives irritated most people. (I'm traumatized by them)<br>  <br>  So don't worry too much. <br>  It's not TWILIGHT. It's the gushing obsessives we hate.<br>  I don't mean to be rude, so * peace *.|`|2KD0AaJ1aa	i actually liked it<br>  nobody in my school has read it (except me and a younger girl who isn't my friend), but i would just love it, if there was someone who has read it so i could talk to them about it

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	It would be wrong to think that Ethical Relativists have no values. The idea of Ethical Relativism maintains that there is no absolute measure of what is (or is not) ethical conduct. <br>  <br>  Instead of absolutes, the relativist argues that ethical standards are going to vary depending on time, circumstance and social norms.<br>  <br>  For example, at one time in history, the common practice in every civilized society was to have public executions and tortures. People had no problem with this; and so, neither would an ethical relativist. But as social customs evolved, these practices fell from grace with society. Another example would be the practices of certain native peoples walking around with little or no clothes on. Europeans encountering these things were shocked, and the missionaries in particular, were horrified, and said these people were savages and behaving in an immoral manner.<br>  <br>  An Ethical Relativist would say that you can't make hard and fast rules that don't take into account differing social norms and customs, and would laugh at the presumptuous attitudes of outsiders attempting to impose their values on total strangers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

They come to conclusions but do not see the other options as devoid of virtue but having assessed the scenario they had made a descision that is according to their moral priorites,  superior.<br>  <br>  "Superior" says it all; they do not consider moral standpoint as right/wrong rather better/worse, hence can make choices.<br>  <br>  Very few people beyond the most hair-brain of religious bigots live their lives without applying a degree of moral relativism to their everyday descisions...|`|1zKendxQaa	Utilitarianism is the idea that the moral worth of an action is determined solely by its contribution to overall utility: that is, its contribution to happiness or pleasure as summed among all persons. It is thus a form of consequentialism, meaning that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome: put simply, the ends justify the means.|`|vuKD7je1aa	They don't.

pI5jKfmaaa	Martin Luther (10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German monk,[1] theologian, university professor, priest, father of Protestantism,[2][3][4][5] and church reformer whose ideas started the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization.[6]<br>  <br>  Luther taught that salvation is a free gift of God and received only through true faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. His theology also challenged the power of the papacy by using the Bible as the only infallible authority[7] and by considering all baptized Christians to be a universal priesthood with direct access to God's grace.[8]<br>  <br>  Luther's refusal to retract his writings in confrontation with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by Pope Leo X and declaration as an outlaw. His translation of the Bible into the language of the people made the Scriptures more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation,[9] and influenced the translation of the King James Bible.[10] His hymns inspired the development of congregational singing within Christianity.[11] His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.[12]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luth...</a>|`|AZgIkmfxaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_95_Theses" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_95_Thes...</a><br>  <br>  Go here and read this.|`|qgs155HNaa	He also wanted the abolition of monasteries and the reduction in the number of Sacraments from the Catholic seven to the Biblical two (Baptism and the Eucharist).|`|3LGKs7SAaa	Get rid of indulgences, Sola Fide (faith alone), Sola Scriptura (original texts), Priesthood of all believers (prists are equal to commoners).

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

1thzSbS8aa	The only description you have is that they are both very good-looking. There are absolutely no physical descriptions of either character other than the occasional "fair" (meaning "pretty").<br>  <br>  But you can gain a lot from inference. Juliet at age 13 is so beautiful that she has a member of the nobility (Count Paris, who was very handsome himself according to the description in Act 1 Scene 3) head-over-heels in love with her, willing to do anything to marry her, and content to keep a vigil by her grave every night after she suddenly "dies". She's so beautiful that one look at her causes Romeo to forget about Rosaline and start muttering about snowy doves and rich jewels in an Ethiop's ear and such, comparing her to statues of saints, the sun, etc. (Act 1 Scene 5, <br>  <br>  And Romeo is so good-looking that this spectacularly beautiful girl falls in love with HIM at first sight.<br>  <br>  Don't bother looking for height, eye color, or any of that, because it isn't there. If you are going to rely on metaphors, the main one is contrast between light and dark:<br>  <br>  "For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br>  Whiter than new snow on a raven's back." (Juliet speaking of Romeo in Act 3 Scene 2)<br>  <br>  "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,<br>  As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows." (Act 1 Scene 5)<br>  <br>  "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br>  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br>  Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>  That birds would sing and think it were not night." (Act 2 Scene 2)<br>  <br>  The point of these metaphors is that both of them stand out from the crowd (or their love makes it seem that way.) That the rest of the world looks dim and dark next to them. So your actors are going to have to have a unique, lumious beauty. And with the proper makeup, lighting, and camera work, you could put that on just about anybody.|`|tVCJ26L9aa	I see you're probably stressing over this. Romeo & Juliet is not my favourite play at all, and I currently have to work on an essay about it as well.  There aren't any real physical descriptions, but you may want to think of the style of the actors/actresses. How does this person do better as a bratty 14-year-old who's in a whirlwind affair with a 16-year-old? How exactly would this actor personify the Friar, whose intentions are good, but eventually cost several people their lives?<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is the actual movie version if you can. Try to stay away from things like West Side Story and Romeo + Juliet because they are somewhat modernized adaptations of the original onto screen, which already constitutes some form of change in the storyline.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.

z4Yeofq8aa	The effect was that it cost the US over 2000 casualties which marked a turning point in America as public support for the war diminished. The losses of the Vietcong were such that they were no longer an effective fighting force and volunteers from the NVA had to be used to replace the casualties whereas previously the Vietcong had been composed almost exclusively of south Vietnamese. It did also fundamentally affect the strategy of the regime in Hanoi. The ability of the US military to rapidly move reinforcements and resources to areas which came under attack came as a shock so the failure of the Tet offensive forced them to adopt a strategy that avoided any future large scale engagements.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	cause: decision by the North Vietnamese dictators to eliminate in-party competition which was formed by the popular and independent minded viet cong activists<br>  <br>  mode employed- forcing the vietcong to go into the open in a surprise offensive. in order to achieve this several divisions of North Vietnamese draftees were infiltrated via Laos and Cambodia.<br>  <br>  Effect 1: (intended) complete extermination of the VietCong as a fighting force. Also extermnation of the North Vietnamese draftees- but that was 'acceptable" to the fat cats in power in North Vietnam<br>  <br>  Effect 2: (non-intended) a feeding frenzy among the US journalists who "covered" the war. At last they had a "disaster" which they could feast upon- and plenty of headlines and prizes. The fact that this sabotaged the US war effort was of no importance as compared to the prospect of a Pulitzer- and was often intentional.
vkzkXWfzaa	1) Shoot in Aperture Priority mode - you don't want the camera to alter aperture as that would alter depth of field.<br>  <br>  2) Turn off auto focus - you don't want the camera to refocus between shots.<br>  <br>  3) Use a low ISO, HDR exaggerates any noise.<br>  <br>  4) Use Photomatix Pro <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdrsoft.com/</a> its the best software there is. IMHO<br>  <br>  5) Use a tripod, it is possible to hand hold for the three shots, but a tripod eliminates camera shake.<br>  <br>  6) Take any 'blobbies' (dust on your sensor) off any files before you open them in Photomatix. It just exaggerates them.<br>  <br>  7) This one is a recent development for me, use your cameras spot meter and measure the brightest and darkest parts of the scene the set your bracketed EV values to just take in this range and no more. I'm coming to the conclusion that you can give Photomatix Pro too much unnecessary data such as burnt out highlights and totally black darks, neither of which carry any useful data. The darks particularly seem to 'muddy' the results. This is still in 'experiment', but definitely seems to be the case. <br>  <br>  heres a link to my HDR Flickr account.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris-judge/sets/72157608074352722/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris-judge...</a><br>  <br>  Chris|`|sDZNFp3laa	Screwdriver says it all really.  His tip about metering the highlights & shadows is excellent - I've used it as well after seeing a very informative video presentation on the Zone System.<br>  I would add that other HDR software worth trying is Dynamic Photo from Mediachance.  I have both DP and Photomatix & find DP slightly more intuitive to use.<br>  Take a good range of shots between the 'either end' exposures, ie. rather than bracket just 3, maybe 5, 7 or even 9!!  I find giving the software more to work with reduces noise too.<br>  Use a remote or a time delay to minimise vibrations from the shutter.  To really ensure no vibes, you may be able to use a 'mirror up' mode (dunno if this is possible on your camera) as the mirror moving can also contribute to vibrations.<br>  <br>  The temptation when doing HDR for the first time is to 'overcook' it with saturated colours and an almost 'cartoony' style which some people hate - but experiment & find what you like the best.<br>  <br>  P.S.

There was a tremendous amount of migration by humans throughout history. Groups of peoples settled, got displaced and got replaced constantly all over the world including Europe.

The first was the bombing of Japan, in which the U.S. dropped two Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, after which Japan surrendered. The other two dealt with postwar Europe. In 1947, President Truman issued the Truman Doctrine and implemented the Marshall Plan, designed to help nations recover from the war, and move towards democracy. In 1948, when the Russians blockaded west Berlin, the Berlin Airlift was launched, where plane after plane landed at Berlin airstrips to deliver supplies. <br>   <br>  Foreign Events of Harry Truman <br>      <br>  Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not see the war end. He died on April 12th, only a month before the surrender of Germany and less than half year away from the Victory over Japan day. His successor, Truman, had a great deal of ground to cover. After the San Francisco conference established the United Nations, Truman turned his attention to Europe.<br>  <br>      The nations of Europe were ravaged. Since only the poor were susceptible to Communism, Truman proposed the Marshall Plan to sponsor reconstruction in Europe. The Marshall Plan passed in 1947, right after the Czechoslovakian Communist revolution. Congress appropriated $5.8 billion for the first fifteenth months, and contemplated further spending. To further fight Communism, the United States declared the Truman Doctrine. It stated that totalitarian governments undermined the foundations of international peace, and thus were a threat to the United States. It was used in Greece and Turkey: after the communists tried to take over, and a revolution erupted, the United States supplied the anti-Communist forces with money and arms.<br>  <br>      The situation in the Pacific was not much better than that in Europe. It was agreed in Potsdam and in Cairo that Korea would become a free and independent nation once the war is over. However, after V-J Day, the Soviet government was quick to establish a Communist regime. The United States helped Korea setup a democratic government on the Southern Part of the peninsula. The situation was tense and rightfully so; on June 25, 1950, North Koreans crossed the border in full force. The UN, presented with its first real conflict, acted quickly, partly because the Soviet representative had walked out a few days earlier in protest of China's lack of representation. War was declared on the aggressors by the United Nations. Although all nations contributed, it was mostly the United States fighting the war. The war lasted for about a year until a peace treaty was signed splitting Korea long the 38th parallel. A total of 33,000 Americans died and 103,000 were wounded.<br>    <br>  <br>   <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/11492/cgi-bin/pres.cgi/truman_harry?foreign" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/11492/cgi-...</a>|`|shVgCizBaa	the united states implemented the truman doctrine by _________? B.] providing aid to greece-------------------------------Tru... Doctrine<br>    The Truman Doctrine is a set of principles of U.S. foreign policy declared by President Harry S. Truman in an address to Congress to request $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, as well as authorization to send American economic and military advisers to the two countries. Truman argued that the U.S. should support Greece and Turkey economically and militarily to prevent their falling under Soviet control. He supported this request by proclaiming: "One of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion. This was a fundamental issue in the war with Germany and Japan. Our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will, and their way of life, upon other nations." He called upon the U.S. to "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,"[1] which generalized his hopes for Greece and Turkey into a doctrine applicable throughout the world. The Soviet Union was clearly at the heart of Truman's thoughts, but the nation was never directly mentioned in his speech. As Edler states, Truman was attempting to solve Eastern Europe's instability while making sure the spread of communism would not affect nations like Greece and Turkey.<br>  <br>  The Truman Doctrine represented the hard side of containment policy, while the Marshall Plan constituted the soft side. The declaration of the Truman Doctrine was followed by the end of tripartism (coalition governments that included communists).<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doct...</a>
pbw7chpyaa	There is no universal life changing book, because people are not interchangeable cogs, identically manipulated like machinery.<br>  <br>  Now I've met many people who were blown away by different books, for some it was Walden, others On the Road.  Take On the Road, many who read it at age 18 are instantly inspired to travel and see the country or the world.  Read the same book in your thirties and you see it as a bittersweet memory of days long past.<br>  To some Walden can be a rallying cry to live an examined life, a simple life, or to get involved with environmental issues.  To others it is just a damn hippy book which says nothing about Christian values or the way they see the world working.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of books that might be life changing to the right person, maybe you're just not the right person or maybe you just haven't found the right book, or the right movie, you might be that sort.  You might only be influenced by music lyrics or images.   Or maybe you are the truly closed minded man, who will refuse everything.  Plenty of people seem to stay teenagers for their whole life.

Until one of Stine's patented witticisms popped up (Someone saying "Thrills," which no ghostwriter would knowingly reuse), I was convinced this was the product of farming the series out to someone who hated the series but still wanted to show how it could be done right. The book has the triumvirate of Goosebumps cliches-- staying with distant relatives, a scientist, and a werewolf-- and somehow still makes these tired elements work.<br>  <br>  Heidi gets off alone at the tiny village bus station and finds herself without an escort. Her Uncle, the scientist Dr. Jekyll, was supposed to pick her up, but he's nowhere to be found. While waiting, Heidi gets spooked by some cawing birds outside the station. Um, wrong Jeckle:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  While she waits for her uncle, Heidi chats up a cute boy hanging around the empty seats, Aaron. His mother works in the bus stop's cafe and he's killing time until she gets off work by providing valuable background material to girls who get off busses. It seems a horrible beast is stalking the village at night, and the townspeople know her uncle is to blame-- though their evidence seems at best to be that they know his last name. I mean, that's pretty damning stuff, but somehow Heidi isn't convinced.<br>  <br>  Tired of waiting, Heidi trudges up the snowy hill to her uncle's ominous-looking mansion. She's greeted at the door by her grumpy cousin Marianne, who tries to get Heidi to leave at once. And go where exactly, her parents are dead and she's alone in Vermont. "Leave at once-- and go tour the Ben and Jerry's factory!" Heidi's Uncle Jekyll however is pleased to see her, and apologizes for getting so caught up in his lab experiments that he forgot to pick her up. Now, guess which one is the werewolf and which one is the scientist.<br>  <br>  And then most of the book becomes about the tension of escalating attacks in the village and whether her Uncle is living up to his namesake. In one of the book's great visuals, Heidi's bedroom overlooks the entire village and she sees the beast wreak a path of destruction from a bird's eye view, ending with the lights of the patrol cars shining through the night. Heidi then feels her suspicions growing when shortly thereafter, Dr. Jekyll returns from "a walk" covered in dirt. Maybe he was doing something even more horrifying than werewolfing.<br>  <br>  Heidi decides to spy on her Uncle and witnesses him downing several concoctions in the lab. I guess that settles it: either he's a werewolf or thirsty. When she tries to escape, she's confronted by Dr. Jekyll, who locks her in her room for her own good. She shimmies down a drain pipe and goes out to stop the beast's destruction. While she witnesses the general destruction of the village, she sees something far worse: the beast. Aaron shows up and foolishly attempts to protect his friend. The beast merely throws the boy into a fire. He survives, but that doesn't change the amazing fact that this is a book where a werewolf throws a boy into a fire.<br>  <br>  Heidi discovers that the entire village is fed up with being terrorized by a werewolf, as if they had anything else to do. A string of angry villagers descends (ascends?) on her uncle's mansion, just as she learns the secret: Marianne was bitten by a werewolf on vacation several years ago and ever since, Dr. Jekyll has been working on a cure. As the villagers arrive, Dr. Jekyll leads Marianne and Heidi down below into the basement, where there is a secret tunnel leading away from town. The three get halfway down when Heidi remembers an old diary she'd found in her room. She insists that the old artifact is worth saving and abandons her family to go brave the kill-crazy bunch and retrieve it. Upstairs, she sneaks past the vigilantes, who luckily are too busy setting fire to curtains and breaking things to bother killing monsters. The bedroom furniture had it coming though. I mean, just look at the way it was dresser.<br>  <br>  Heidi retrieves the book. Unfortunately, the angry townspeople have run out of things to destroy and finally notice her. There hasn't been a mob this angry at Heidi since the Raiders/Jets game of '68. Luckily, a remarkably well-healed Aaron shows up to rescue her (this time without being thrown into a fire in the process) and the two escape downstairs. Tragically, her uncle and cousin have already left, never to be seen again.<br>  <br>  But the Twist is:<br>  Well, I guess if it's a werewolf book, someone who wasn't a werewolf has to turn into a werewolf. Safe at Aaron's house, Heidi begins reading from the old journal, only to discover it contains modern writing. Apparently Marianne liked the vintage journal and began charting her transformations within it. Heidi reads through the pages until she reaches the end and reads the entry about how one night Marianne bit her while she slept. Is it possible Heidi grabbed the wrong book?<br>  <br>  the Platonic Boy-Girl Relationship:<br>  Heidi and her friend Aaron, who gets burns halfway through his body.<br>  <br>  Questionable Uncling:<br>  I know it's sad when someone's parents die, but maybe you don't invite orphan girl to live with werewolf girl, huh?<br>  <br>  Memorable Cliffhanger Chapter Ending:<br>  Ch. 16/17:<br>  The door to Heidi's room swings open, revealing: a draft.<br>  <br>  Great Prose Alert:<br>  "I don't know what I'm doing," she mumbled into her tuna casserole.<br>  <br>  Conclusions:<br>  Turns out you really can't judge a book by its cover. Except for Chicken Chicken of course.<br>  <br>  <br>  Come back Friday for the traditional Halloween update. If you know your Goosebumps, you can probably guess what it'll be.|`|N2IJDxwEaa	Jekyll And Heidi is the fourteenth book in the Goosebumps: Series 2000.

cxDbdhELaa	The point is that science needs an underlying philosophy (or theology) to justify it. Thus the claim is made that this underlying explanation is what provides the WHY.|`|bxlYleZkaa	They are patently wrong, arent they? Science does explain how SOME things happen. Not all , granted, but some.|`|AA11564934	I disagree, science can't explain "Why there's a universe" or "Why does an electron jump from one shell to the next?  Why doesn't it just stay where it is?"<br>  <br>  Science can't explain those questions.  The laws we have are simply the ones we have. Why?  Science has nothign to say on the matter except that this happens to be the universe we're in<br>  <br>  EDIT:  TO be clear to other responders, Why generally indicates a purpose or meaning, Why am I here?  Why is the universe here?<br>  <br>  HOW indicates the process, including cause and effect.  If I ask "Why is this car here on my chest?" I can easily recount HOW it got there by retracing it's recent past, but if the person is asking "No, why is it on me today?  i don't need this!"  There is no answer to that.|`|HORACAnlaa	It proves theists are very self centered. What they mean by "why" is how it relates to them. The whole universe needs to, according to theism, explain why you kiss your wife, go to work, eat, etc., and how all these activities fit into the grand design of the universe.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Science is on one planet, and religion is in another galaxy.  They have absolutely nothing in common, thus any "argument" is nonsense.  People who believe in spooks and things that go "bump" in the night as being able to explain anything "are not even wrong".|`|gsWha0wTaa	And so religion explains why? only one version of one group of peoples 'why', an invented one at that - and which religion do we choose....|`|gLp7pvPnaa	God is the answer to everything for the faithful and nothing to the thoughtful. Faith requires indoctrination from the real world, science discovers evidence about the real world. Indoctrination begins in children, evidence is gathered in adulthood. Indoctrination moulds the mind, science excites it.|`|f01jXc8naa	The fact that you brought theists into this explains everything why they said that...<br>  <br>  MY OPINION - <br>  Science is based on our universe. What is already there. <br>  Of course it can't explain why did it happen. Of course not. <br>  That's the reason the term God was created....<br>  I think it is just a blind answer to prove their point. <br>  One supreme being is not the answer to all of the questions...<br>  <br>  Universe could turn any other way, but it turned out this way....<br>  And Science is based on the outcome, the way it turned out...<br>  Not before....<br>  Therefore we cannot answer WHY to this question. But it is better than the blind faith.<br>  <br>  Explaining the basics of a basic is not easy....<br>  If i ask you to Define Time - you will take a lot of time to come up with an answer<br>  but GOD it's just not the answer.<br>  <br>  To Sum it up - It is only a remark to prove their point (which actually doesn't have a proper base)|`|7aVOCIh4aa	well, i understand what u mean but u gotta understand that we still need answers to such life-based questions...basically theists arent one step above (like they think) when they say that the existance of a supreme being answers such questions....<br>  <br>  Science doesnt actually explain WHY it happens but then again NOTHING DOES....<br>  <br>  U JUST CANT IGNORE THE FACT THAT WE NEED ANSWERS and we have a long way to go|`|aAupgOiQaa	I agree with the first statement. Its almost like what comes first, the chicken or the egg? Science can conjure up explanations but not its facts or theory, or meaning. If Science could, we would know if God exists. Scientists and Theists can give you an alternative theory of life but cannot prove its fact.<br>  <br>  :)|`|EWUXcJ0Qaa	i agree..it does explain the purpose of almost everything..what it doesn't, or maybe couldn't, explain is its origin..whether it be big bang theory or whatever, it cant explain what created the universe..|`|kxlmcG4gaa	I think itd true,<br>  Sciene explained how we evolved, how other animals adapted to there surroundings..etc...<br>  But they never explained how/why those things happend.|`|9QAVNJtWaa	science explains, thats the important thing|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	how has been proven<br>  why is just a random coincidence|`|xtDzsNlLaa	The difference between theists and scientists is that theists believe that they already know the answer to 'why', all they have to do is find evidence to support it, whereas scientists are interested in asking both 'why' and 'how' and use scientific method to look for evidence of either. The other difference is that scientists use their god-given intelligence!|`|0k321LYAaa	I think it's untrue.  Science does explain why.  If something happens it happens for a reason.  Cause and effect.  Whys does this happen?  Because this other thing happened.  Why did that other thing happen?  Because something before that happened.  That's your "Why"

W1h3w5gdaa	Honestly the best advice I can give is to go out and find yourself a good instructor. I've been teaching for several years and have had hundreds of students. Most of them came to lessons after failing to learn by trying to use books and video systems sold over the Internet.<br>  <br>  It's not that books and systems are inherently bad, it's that most of them are designed to sell you the next lesson in the series. (e.g., they'll teach you the minor pentatonic scale, but you have to buy book 2 to learn the "major" pentatonic scale. They fail to mention that it's the same scale, just moved three frets.)<br>  <br>  Also, these systems are "static" meaning you only learn what is presented to you in the order it was presented. It's missing the most important fundamental of any teaching method; the ability to ask questions!<br>  <br>  Decide what your goal is with guitar, then go find a teacher who will take you there. I prefer instructors that are trained and certified by a network using a specific method, but with enough flexibility to take you in whatever direction you need to go. But I'm biased, because I happen to BE such an instructor, and I wouldn't teach the way I do if I didn't think it was the best way.<br>  <br>  I'll put a link in the source field and you can check out my network's website which has a list of instructors. Some of us give private lessons via e-mail.<br>  <br>  Now, as for beginning tips, I'll tell you this:<br>  <br>  1) Learn a basic finger exercise and practice it for five minutes, really really slowly, every day.<br>  <br>  2) Learn a basic melody, like Mary Had a Little Lamb and play it until it flows naturally.<br>  <br>  3) Learn the following chords: C - A - G - E - D - Am - Dm - Em and memorize how to play them. Practice changing between chords very slowly without losing your rhythm. All guitar chords are based off these eight positions.<br>  <br>  4) Mute your strings and strum along with a lot of different songs. (Muting is just touching all the strings lightly with your left (fret) hand so that when you strum, instead of notes you get a percussive beat sound.)<br>  <br>  5) Learn the C-major scale in open position. (Click the Ultimate Guitar link below and play JUST the first measure. Ignore everything else.) Use your 3rd finger for notes in fret 3, 2nd finger for fret 2, and 1st finger for fret 1. Memorize it and play it all the time. Then figure out how to play it elsewhere on the fretboard.<br>  <br>  6) Learn to play 8-bar and 12-bar blues with a straight beat and a shuffle beat. All rock music (and by extension, most pop music) has its roots in the blues. Understanding this will help you understand a great deal more.<br>  <br>  That should get you started, but you should really get a professional teacher. Check with your local YMCA and if they don't have a guitar program, have them contact the YMCA of Central Kentucky. (Link below.) They have the most successful YMCA Guitar Program in the United States, including sponsorship from Gibson, and should be able to help them get started.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy rockin!!|`|0AUPrCMZaa	the best way, honestly, is to get a guitar instructor.  <br>  <br>  dont rely on tabs either - those are lazy (and now i get flamed).|`|v4EqZC3oaa	<a href="http://xrl.us/beijdq" rel="nofollow">http://xrl.us/beijdq</a><br>  <br>  that is the only place you should need to start learning guitar, there is not a better resource than that site.

Where I don't use it is:<br>  <br>  Macro shots<br>  Portraits with limited depth of field<br>  Low light situations where the AF may hunt for a focus<br>  <br>  Also, I can select the focus point the AF uses, so I am, in a sense telling the AF what I want to focus on and not just letting it use the whole image.

szFG9r4Maa	The Rough Riders was the name bestowed on the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, one of three such regiments raised in 1898 for the United States' war with Spain and the only one of the three to see action. It was also called "Wood's Weary Walkers" after its first commander, Colonel Leonard Wood as an acknowledgment of the fact that despite being a cavalry unit they ended up fighting on foot as infantry. When Colonel Wood became commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade (1st U.S. Cavalry, 10th U.S. Cavalry, and 1st U.S.V. Cavalry) the Rough Riders then became "Roosevelt's Rough Riders". That term was familiar in 1898, from Buffalo Bill who called his famous western show "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World".<br>  <br>  World War I<br>  <br>  Just after the United States entered the war against the Central Powers, the U.S. Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders. Roosevelt immediately selected eighteen officers (including: Seth Bullock, Frederick Russell Burnham, and James Rudolph Garfield) to raise a volunteer infantry division, and began corresponding with Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War. After several months, many more men joined Roosevelt's World War I volunteers, but Baker refused to offer any assistance or guidance to the new unit. Frustrated, Roosevelt telegrammed President Woodrow Wilson requesting his assistance; however, as Commander-in-chief, Wilson refused to make use of the volunteers and Roosevelt disbanded the unit.<br>  <br>  They had no part in WW2|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	1st United States Volunteer Cavalry<br>  They became famous during the Spanish American War.

uqb7dkBbaa	Just like any empire China had its up and down. During its long history it had civil wars, invasions... and spent a lot of time invading its neighbours. It isn't for nothing that some Chinese maps claim countries as far as Vietnam and Cambodia as part of the old Chinese Empire because Chinese armies went there. China was aggressive, powerful and technologically advanced as well as extraordinarily stable thanks to its administration.<br>  The Mongols succeeded because they came during one of the weak moments any such Empire can have. The Europeans came as the empire was stagnating and just like the Egyptians it fell in front of more aggressive and more technologically advanced adversaries.|`|ky3B42f6aa	What do you mean by "past"?  The history of China goes back at least 5,000 years.  What you are talking about is less than a few hours......|`|7hmjTUubaa	Because for the most part the Chinese were peaceful self sufficient people that kept themselves to themselves. Also they were not as nationalistic. The nations and people that you have mentioned were war mongering power hungry empires that had a lot of recent experience in warfare. Population means nothing when the people don't know how to defend themselves properly, or their religion discourages it. Just look at the British colonization of India.|`|agY5Oauqaa	It's a matter of geography. The Chinese have only a couple of natural barriers to protect them--the Himalayas and the Gobi desert. There's nothing substantial stopping anyone in Southeast Asia from invading from the jungles, and most of the remaining borders are out on the mostly flat steppe lands which make for easy movement. Also, China has a huge coast, and a mostly non-existent naval tradition, which makes them extremely vulnerable to maritime incursions.|`|Si4PlJsSaa	Take your pick...<br>  1. Civil War(s).<br>  2. Technology deficit.<br>  3. Corrupt and unmotivated leadership.<br>  4. A general distaste for the martial.<br>  5. A cabal of nations against one.<br>  <br>  Historically borders retract when not expanding.  The Chinese expanded for a while (made it all the way to Africa) saw that there was nothing for them in terms of resources, deemed the rest of the wold shitty, and closed the door.  The rest of the world got unshitty and caught up.<br>  <br>  If you care to examine this subject further with a more contemporary conflict where the aforementioned detriments are non material you can examine the Korean conflict.  A highly martial, modernized, motivated, united Chinese Peoples Liberation Army took on the new American superpower and fought it to a stand still that exist to this day.  <br>  <br>  I've studied the academia of conflict.  I've been lucky enought to talk with bonified vetrans from WWII in the Pacific, Vietnam, and Korea.

HORACAnlaa	To answer your question in depth we need first to examine what beauty and inner beauty are. After that I'll come to my summary.<br>  <br>  I think to answer your question we need to examine beauty itself. Beauty, I hold, is a harmony of the individual parts into a coherent whole. A face is beautiful if the nose is in proportion to the entirely of the face. Additionally the face must be in harmony to our ideal of the gender of the person. And lastly the face must be in harmony to our notions of sexual attraction, meaning it could be a great face, say Brad Pitt, but if he's wearing lipstick the beauty is gone because it violates our notions of sexual attraction. The same could be said for a woman who has hair on her upper lip. So beauty is a harmony between proportion, gender ideal and sexual ideal. Of course, this definition of beauty only applies to human beings. <br>  <br>  So what is inner beauty? Since inner beauty is not visible it can't any of the three things named above. But it is a proportion between different ideals. It is those ideals that we hold to be over arching, namely: truth and goodness. The three ways we have to evaluate this world are simply put: truth, goodness, and beauty. In our ideal dream world those three things are always aligned with each other. But in the mundane world of our existence sadly they can be very much not in tune with each other. A beautiful person can be a bad person. A good person can be ugly. The beautiful truth of e=mc can be used to build an atomic bomb, a very bad thing. Now a person who has inner beauty has a personality and/or character that is in harmony with truth and goodness. In some manner or form they give us the truth of their being and goodness of their soul.<br>  <br>  Based on the above, I would say that beauty is of more value in the short term. The enchantment of the eye leaves many good people in wonder. A beautiful woman, Helen of Troy, can lead to a war. Inner beauty, however, is clearly the long term winner. Helen is a footnote in history besides the inner beauty of Socrates. We still stand in wonder to his insights. <br>  <br>  The sadness of life is that we don't always have the long term to let things play out. This means that sometimes beauty is of more value than inner beauty but we always hope for a day when that's not true.|`|FBGMKdqKaa	inner...sometimes initially physically unattractive people become beautiful once you get to know them. <br>  <br>  outer is temporary anyway.|`|gspTDufpaa	If you have inner beauty, then the outside will also shine brightly.|`|SDiYtubGaa	you expect ONE different answer???|`|gaHc6UONaa	do you ppl blind yourself that easily i mean if you see an ugly person coming to you an asks for ur email or cellphone number will you give the real one to him/her? or if a socalled "nerd" does that will you give ur email to him??<br>  everyone who says inner beauty is more important the nouter beauty (atleast to us humans) is either real ugly or lying or believes a load of bull.<br>  it IS true that with inner beauty (intellegence,sympathy etc.) you can amke the outer "look bigger" but if you are really ugly then you are pretty messed up that doesn't mean you won't get anyone but it  should be harder for all for women cause men(feel atracted to looks) are more superficial the women are(feel atracted to personality...mostly).<br>  my opinion they re both important i mean you would date a "dum blond" but howlong would it last??? a week?<br>  or someone intellegent and interesting but if he/her is REALLY UGLY then you would want to learn and then get the heck outta there.<br>  both must be in balance actually there are a lot of ppl who are pretty and smart.|`|ruAIuDTcaa	Depends of an individuals definition of important.

Self confidence is beautiful.<br>  <br>  I sometimes think this actually carries through to external beauty to an extent. I've noticed girls before who seem to be attractive at first glance, but after observing them, they become unattractive through their actions, words, even posture and the way they carry themself, and this all seems to stem from a lack of self confidence, appreciation, and kindness on the inside, and I get a clear impression that they "hide behind" their good looks and are otherwise a shallow or internally ugly person.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have noticed women who may not seem overly attractive at first glance, but upon observing them and seeing confidence and kindness in their actions and words, an external beauty begins to appear.

HORACAnlaa	Yes it is in two different senses. One philosophy always starts with the accepted common opinions, thought to be wise, of the non-philosophical when it attempts to find truth. That's what the Socratic Method is all about. Two, philosophy can only establish it's truth by understanding the senses we all share in common. Knowledge must be judged before the bar of objective reality, which is only experienced by the senses we hold in common. So therefore we must say philosophy is a child of common sense in two different ways that we mean by common sense, commonsense as wise common opinion and as the senses common to us all.|`|gspTDufpaa	I think it is.|`|YZnJDWAEaa	No.<br>  <br>  It is the act of looking around and wondering why common sense is so uncommon that is the seed of Philosophy.<br>  <br>  Shana|`|1Z13L9h2aa	Before it was metaphysics, now it's common sense and logic.|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	no because the whole

Only when UN forces- which at that time were mostly Americans- had entered North Korea and reached almost as far as the Chinese border which was marked by the Yalu river did the Chinese launch a massive invasion of North Korea forcing UN troops back into the South. From that point on the North Koreans played a minor role and most of the fighting was done by the Chinese but the war eventually became a stalemate with both armies positioned roughly along the 38th parallel which marked the border between the North and South. The Chinese also used the charade that their soldiers in Korea were all volunteers fighting for their Korean comrades rather than as a part of the Chinese military in order to try and discourage a full scale confrontation with the west that might have resulted in the use of nuclear weapons.|`|HnqedumSaa	the chinese entered the war on the north korean side after McArthur drove his forces all the way to their border on the Yalu they felt threated and intervened
iNXqiDIYaa	this from an amazon customer<br>  <br>  It's the companion volume to WHISKERS AND SMOKE [original title: A TRAIL OF ASHES]. The Harper family of New Hampshire has swapped houses with an English widow, Rosemary, for the summer. Nancy Harper has reason to be grumpy. Her scholarly husband, Arnold, is too eager to get down to research in London. Her twins come from the Calvin of "Calvin and Hobbes" mold. Certainly she loves her husband and children, as can be seen during those times she fears she's lost them, even though they do their best to drive her crazy.<br>  Arnold can be a dreadful tease, but is that any reason for his series of near-fatal accidents? Was Rosemary's husband's death an accident after all? Can the Harpers find out what's going on before Arnold has his final "accident"? How many letters telling Rosemary what damages those Harper imps have caused is poor Nancy going to have to write? If only Donald and Donna could be as polite and well-behaved as Esmond, Rosemary's cat.<br>  <br>  Yes, you will find those Babson scenes of awkward social situations in this book.

pI5jKfmaaa	The Hitler Youth (German:  Hitler-Jugend (help·info) , abbreviated HJ) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party. It existed from 1922 to 1945. The HJ was the second oldest paramilitary Nazi group, founded one year after its adult counterpart, the Sturmabteilung (the SA).<br>  <br>  The HJ were viewed as future "Aryan supermen" and were indoctrinated in anti-Semitism. One aim was to instill the motivation that would enable HJ members, as soldiers, to fight faithfully for the Third Reich. The HJ put more emphasis on physical and military training than on academic study.[3] The Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (NSRBL), the umbrella organization promoting and coordinating sport activities in Germany during the Nazi period, had the responsibility of overseeing the physical fitness development programs provided to the German youth.[4]<br>  <br>  After the boy scout movement was banned through German-controlled countries, the HJ appropriated many of its activities, though changed in content and intention. For example, many HJ activities closely resembled military training, with weapons training, assault course circuits and basic strategy. Some cruelty by the older boys toward the younger ones was tolerated and even encouraged, since it was believed this would weed out the unfit and harden the rest.<br>  <br>  The HJ wore uniforms very like those of the SA, with similar ranks and insignia.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Because it was mandatory by law.|`|ZBV5TET7aa	This does in a way relate to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which placed limits on the levels of re-armament following Germany's efforts to control much of the world in WWI.

As for the question of can they be judged, there is no doubt that they can be.

iNXqiDIYaa	this is the best i can find<br>  <br>  God wills it!" the Crusaders cry in battle. In this richly detailed and lovingly crafted story, Michael Cadnum explores the terrible paradox of holy war through the eyes of Edmund, a young apprentice metalworker, who finds himself unexpectedly rescued from prison and pressed into service as a squire to a knight. Without a bit of experience with horses or swords, Edmund goes off in terror and delight to help rescue the True Cross from the infidels in Jerusalem, and finds his manhood in surviving the siege of the sea-fortress Acre and the terrible bloody battle of Arsuf. <br>  This is not the sanitized version of the Middle Ages that appears in so many young adult novels. From the first scene, in which the king's men punish Edmund's master by whacking off his hand, Cadnum gives us the authentic brutality of the period--its stink and bugs, random cruelty, drunkenness, and sudden death--as well as its colorful pageantry and lofty ideals.

HE23qtamaa	I don't know what you mean by "affordable" first of all. But, if you're a beginner, you don't need anything special besides ballet shoes. The most affordable option for these are canvas and preferably split-soles - you can buy them at the Bloch store in Camberwell (across the parking lot from the safeway). Don't let the sales people convince you that leather shoes are better because they last longer etc blah blah blah. All the professionals wear canvas because it's more comfortable, and it looks better. If you're only beginning, and dancing like once a week, those shoes will last plenty long. Plus, they can be washed, which is a big plus!<br>  <br>  As far as leggings and the rest, you don't need anything particular to ballet. Just go to Target - they have good and affordable workout clothing. Anything fitted would do, like tight black pants (no flares) and a few singlets and maybe a good sports bra. That's all you need.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|eqine698aa	Hey! Say hi to your kangaroo friends for me!!!

0dU50gc9aa	amazingly enough...you're right. but you cant compare a chicken's mentruation cycle to that of a human mammel. obviously chickens produce more unfertilized eggs than humans. and this is based on several different outside stimulii...anything from the amount of food available to water to their diet, so many things could affect the number of eggs they produce. also keep in mind that the ovulation cycle of chickens, in some instances, are chemically altered. normally, with proper diet and nutrition, hens ovulate everyday, which means they can lay an egg per day.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Animal and human reproduction do not match bit for bit.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Happy hiram is right - the reproductive cycles are different in different species.  But the chicken's egg is the ova - the same bit that is shed during a period.  Chickens are just able to reproduce more frequently, given optimal conditions.  A cow, as it happens, is more comparable.  A monthly menstrual cycle, and nine-months pregnancy, just like people.<br>  <br>  If your friend is attempting to put you off eating eggs, there are a lot of better reasons to go vegan.  Read up on what cheese is; or why butchers paint meat with an artificial red "blood" colour!|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	Believe it or not, the egg laying process for a chicken begins in its eye. Chickens lay eggs only after receiving a light cue, either from natural sunlight entering a coop or artificial light illuminating a commercial egg hatchery. The light stimulates a photo-receptive gland near the chicken's eye, which in turn triggers the release of an egg cell from the chicken's ovary. Most chickens lay eggs on an almost daily basis, unlike some other egg-laying animals which only release an egg every thirty days or so. The chicken also releases a small disk of material which surrounds the egg cell and provides nutrition. The chicken's uterus also fills up with albumen, the viscous substance we know better as egg white. Meanwhile, a membrane forms around the inside uterine wall, which seals in the egg cell, yolk and albumen. Eventually a mixture of water, salt and calcium surround this membrane and form a thin but structurally sturdy outer shell. This shell is molded in the shape of the uterine wall, thus giving a chicken's egg its distinctive shape. While in the uterus, the egg's narrower end points downward, but it will later turn and be ejected wider end first. Once the egg has fully formed, the chicken's uterus begins to contract in an effort to expel it. The egg moves down a vaginal canal towards an external opening known as a vent. The vent is a common opening for both egg laying and waste elimination, but a chicken cannot perform both functions at the same time. An internal flap known as a cloaca keeps the vaginal canal and the intestinal track separate until either an egg or excrement reach the vent. When a chicken is laying an egg, the cloaca descends and blocks the intestinal track. Once the egg passes the cloaca, it is carefully expelled through a series of muscular contractions which essentially turn the vaginal canal and cloaca inside out at one point. Eventually the egg is pushed out through the vent and ideally lands intact on the ground. Many chickens let out an audible cluck at this point, but designated egg layers rarely display any other maternal concern. These chickens lay eggs every 24 to 36 hours at the height of their productive years, so individual eggs rarely attract their attention. Once a chicken lays a certain number of eggs, it may stop producing more eggs and go into a "brooding" stage, a maternal stage in which the mother will sit on her eggs until they hatch. In order to prevent egg layers from brooding, freshly laid eggs must be removed on a daily basis. Chickens lay eggs as long as they believe they need more to form a proper brood. The egg laying process continues whether or not a rooster provides enough sperm for fertilization. A chicken cannot tell if an individual egg has been successfully fertilized or not.|`|KXiwLOtOaa	well a chicken doesn't have to go up town to buy pads every day but yeah its the chicken equivalent to menstruation. How else do you get an egg.If the egg is not fertilized while developing it won't hatch. If it is fertilized you can crack the egg and you will literally see the sperm as a white spot in the egg. It is quite easy to see and has no impact on the taste as near as my palate can tell.

SIzRlwBqaa	Are you asking if a belief in God is the result of brain chemistry?<br>  If so, you have asked a very good question.  However, I believe we learn to believe in God.  That learning is achieved by our primary relationships as a child.  As we mature, the belief in God may continue to satisfy our need to belong to a group. If the belief in God is a satisfying experience, we continue to believe.  If the belief in God is a punishing experience, we reevaluate our belief system and adjust our level of belief.  Some people never evaluate their belief systems and continue to believe in what they have learned.  Again, if you want to achieve a God realization, then seek out a group of believers and learn what they have learned.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	I dont believe that its merely a chemical reaction (is how I initially read your question)<br>  <br>  I get a goose bumps that run down my spine when I realise God (I refer to as the the Devine) is around me like the air we breathe<br>   <br>  I achieved it after repeating what worked for me in the past...I have also achieved it through other religions/philosophies I never thought I'd be into|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, God realization is a faith principle, it is some thing that you learned and believe as a child according to you ancestors belief and we go about this by finding Him in whitin. It is the natural desire of man is achieve divinity or God realization i.e. to find God within himself or her self. Yet most people fail to realize this goal due to the three powerful enemies who tempts him realization of his true self. Man in ignorance makes these enemies as their friend hence distance himself from God. If a man can only recognize these three enemies, he would face no difficulty in realizing God within and enter in the kingdom of God.We can achieve this realization,  by using our mind and spiritual eyes to see and know the things of God,  as we re-new our ways of thinking and see the Lord as a spiritual being, the maker of every thing by His Spirit alone, then we will be on our way to accept the truth of the Bible.|`|T76LGcmLaa	God-realization takes character, character to<br>  recognize flaws and perplexity of life,<br>  character to realize we will not ever have all<br>  the answers we need and do not exist alone,<br>  we have the need to not exist alone without<br>  the creator, just being humanity is not enough<br>  and for good reason; time and the cold<br>  dark universe is not enough to explain our love<br>  away chemically.  After all this, the final realization<br>  is when we experience light and love spiritually<br>  and this is overwhelming and that is when we<br>  can believe just enough to ask God into our lives<br>  and change us daily then we see so many of God's<br>  works all around and realize more and more how<br>  blind a man and woman can be to all of it!|`|cu2RpNDtaa	Dissolving your identity is God-realization.Whatever we have gathered in the mind is all from outside.We identify ourselves with the mind.Once it is all dissolved we realize Him, as we become egoless.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Hbr 11:6 But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God MUST believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. <br>  <br>  Also see Romans 10: 9, 10, 13.|`|eBtK4Szbaa	No it is COSMIC reaction, one should either meet and follow a living Master or follow some faith, Help will come to You, but efforts & desire should be genuine.

How well you have put it!|`|HORACAnlaa	Actually there is no attempt to disguise dead animal corpses by other names than the name they had in life. The reason animals have different names when we eat them comes from the strange evolution of the English language. After the Norman conquest the rulers used a different language than their subjects. They were the ones who ate the animals and they called it: beef, pork, etc. Their servile subjects, who raised the animals, still called the animals by the names they were familiar with: cow, pig, etc. Just a historical accident in the evolution of the English language that we call certain animals different names when we eat them.<br>  <br>  It's not really that bizarre that humans like eating animals. The human race has been doing it since the beginning of the human race. Now if you want to claim that it's not right we eat animals, that's another question, which can only answered by coming to understanding the basis of rights. Do animals have rights? If they do what are they?These questions I'll leave for another day.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	From some of the answers I see, it seems that most of you live in big cities LOL and believe there's only one language "English".  Well, I'm French, I live in a small place with less than 1000 Population and I didn't visit a farm, I practically lived on a farm since my grandparents were living across the street and were farmers as well as my uncle and aunt who were also my Godparents.  In French, the right word is "porc" for pigs and "vache(female cow),boeuf(bull)", so we know exactly what we're eating.  We call the process nature.  It's not good to eat too much meat but it's a healthy food.  The only problem today is what they feed their animals.  Well not my relatives, their into vegetables now, no more animals.  However, as sensitive as I was and still am, there was one rule on a farm.  You never name something your going to eat.  You give names to the cats, the dogs and whatever you won't eat, the rest, leave it the way it is.  I didn't kill a cow myself but I've been there.  It's not always easy but one needs to eat.  What about the hunters.  In Canada we have so many moose, it's a good thing we have moose hunting season, etc.  It's the cycle of life and everything in balance and in moderation is good.  The problem with people today is that they're extremists.  Everything is either black or white.  I happen to live in the grey zone, then, there's no problem since I can compromise and I'm happy.

The ages are puking infant, whining schoolboy, sighing lover, quarrelsome soldier, the round-bellied justice, the shrunken elder, and finally the second childhood “Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.”<br>  <br>  Many have tried to find significance in the colors of the rooms since clearly the order of presentation from East to West and the number seven indicate Poe’s intentions. Those who have tried to discover the meaning in the colors are correct in assuming that the colors are significant; since Poe states in his essay The Philosophy of Composition that when one writes there should be “no one point in its composition is referable either to accident or intuition—that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.” Consequently, the colors of the rooms are clearly intended to create a specific ‘effect’ in the story. However, none of the common theories are satisfactory.|`|1tiCB311aa	Poe's story tells us no one can escape death. I believe the room colors show us the steps of life. The first room is blue, which normally means birth. I think each room takes us one step closer to the final room death. What do you think?

I would like to add on moving yourself from the standard " I'm standing here" mentality. Get on your knee's or lower. Get on a ladder or up on top of a vehicle. Push yourself to do something a little extreme. <br>  <br>  Don't forget the old adage too : If the picture isn't good enough, your not close enough. <br>  <br>  Use colored filters, my favorite has to be the red filter. A quick lesson on filters, the color of the filter will lighten it's own color and will darken it's opposite.  Using the red filter darkens skies to almost the point of black, but clouds if any pop right out and become vivid. The reason for this is the sky is blue and the red filter removes the blue. When you remove something all that is left is black. The clouds are white and so they contain the red light. They are highlighted because of this. It's a huge area of study and worthy of exploration.  Don't forget polarizers too<br>  <br>  Placing subjects in the middle makes them seem closer, towards the edges -- farther away. <br>  <br>  Try some forced perspective. Balance or unbalance shots. Diagonal  lines enhance excitement, horizontal lines give peace and vertical lines show strength - just picture a telephone pole-- it represents strength.<br>  <br>  One thing I noticed in my work is how strong B and W can be, the general rule that I use is if it's a colorful shot, use color, if the color isn't really all that important, the picture can be greatly enhanced by shooting in B and W. ( actually you always shoot in color but in B and W you desaturate the color out of it in post).<br>  <br>  Use shadow and compose for postive and negative space too.<br>  <br>  Use available lighting and wait until it it's just right, so you might have something you really want to shoot, but it might be better to come back or wait until it's just right.<br>  <br>   A rain storm does wonders to nature shots.

p2G5KJywaa	I assume this is a textbook question. If so, then I can only guess as to what the correct answer your text might give. However, since it was Gandhi's goal to see his countrymen freed from British rule I would say the two choices regarding their fate would be to (A) Remain a British colony and remain under British rule OR (B) to somehow peacefully reclaim their rights for self government and autonomy. <br>  They did acquire their freedom after many years of nonviolent protests. Gandhi knew they could never defeat the British Empire in open warfare and would only make things worse.

KUehcrofaa	James 1:8 says "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways." People become "double minded" because they live in the state of Romans 7:8 which Paul calls concupescence. You see there are 3 parts of man - Spirit, Soul, and body. Each part gives to us motivational drives. The spirit gives love joy peace meekness gentleness kindness...(at least the positive spiritual traits). The soul is comprised of the mind, will and emotions which make up our "essence" and define who we are. The Body comprises our physical being and is defined by our senses of taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell. Each one of these parts yield motivating drives which call us to act in certain ways. The Christian operating according to God's laws lets his Spirit rule over and dominate the other drives. One operating in the world, embraces the flesh and is dominated by the sensual drives. This sensually dominant state is concupesent and results in double mindedness - because we still have a conscience but it is somewhat suppressed by the desire to feed the sensual drives. Thus the result is instability. If it continues along these lines, then the sensual drives become so dominant, and quench the spiritual drives that one looses the capacity to distinguish right from wrong any more, which is called a reprobate mind. Reprobates embrace abominations such as bestiality and child pedophilia because of the strong driving forces of the physical sensual lusts out of balance and out of control. So this is how relativism, or concupesence, may lead to anarchy as you say. Anyone you see will operate according to one of these three states. The only way to remain at a balanced state for true peace and harmony in life is to accept the absolute truth of morality as based on and outlined by the Bible. Also key, to maintaining this, is the Biblical principle of "let your moderation be known unto all." Moderation is the key that lets us enjoy things without getting them out of balance in our lives. <br>  <br>  Now an interesting note is that the more society embraces diversity and tolerance, the more it shuns absolutism. I am all for diversity and tolerance but both diversity and tolerance reach a point where they diversify and tolerate moral standards that have been clearly outlined as sin in God's law, the Bible. Once we get to the point of diversifying and tolerating that which goes against God's word we are in trouble - because that leads to concupiscent relativism which leads to reprobate anarchy. <br>  <br>  Lastly, let me point out how the ethical theories relate to this. I think all the ethical theories make good, observable points, thus I find some merit in them all. I believe we reach ethical conclusions that correlate with our distinct drives of Spirit Soul and body. I will pick general categories of ethics and relate it to what I have just talked about - (this does not match up perfectly - but many key elements strongly correlate). First you have Virtue theory - which is where you incorporate a core value intrinsically and always live by that standard. I will specify the standard as Divine Command theory based on the Bible and use that as the base for the intrinsic values and correlate that with the spiritual drives. Next we have Deontological ethics which is based on moral obligations and duties as they relate to others. Such as the duty to be a father and provide for family, or the duty to be a good citizen of the nation. These deontological drives correlate to the mind, will, and emotions - which make up our soul. Finally we have consequentialism - which focuses on consequences of actions. Some of utilitarianism may apply here as well. You would find such statements as "the end justifies the means" here. One that bases everything on consequences as dominate ethic motivation I would correlate with most strongly with the physical drives and desire to seek sensual pleasure. I see these ethical theories (Virtue/Divine Command, Deontological, and Consequentialism) correlating with the motivational drives of man (spiritual, soul, physical). Looking at these ethics systems as interrelated with primary motivational drives may yield deeper insights into how and why we operate in a certain manner depending on which state we are in (balanced, concupiscent, or reprobate). Again - balanced harmony should be an ethical motivation system that is dominated and ruled over first by virtue/Divine Command, supported by deontological drives, and which recognizes the consequential aspects, but is not ruled by them.|`|8IHfytEvaa	You are absolutely correct and this story is ample proof of it.|`|0dU50gc9aa	so, while i think it's a great question, i think it may be slightly skewed. relativism is not a single doctrine and the views are derived from something...."some central aspect of experience, thought, evaluation". so while the thief can be steadfast in his new philosophy, his original experiece is still modified by christianity. he can think whatever he wants to, but the fact that he uses the store owner's philosophy against him AND is murdering should still be effected by his previous beliefs. he may not agree or think like a christian anymore but the thief is still affected by his previous knowledge of the religion. <br>  <br>  the link below leads to a really good article staying how sometimes the all-or-none thinking of arguing of relativsm tends to scare people away from discussion of the topic, which i think is very true. it's like an agnostic trying to communicate with christians OR atheists.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	It doesn't matter if you believe in relativism or not.  Many animals are biologically imprinted with a basic morality.  You don't need God or Relativism or any of that to create morality, because it is in your nature.<br>  <br>  Proof?<br>  Primates who live in groups in the wild behave in basic moral ways with compassion.  Do you think they have any idea of God or Relativism?<br>  <br>  Your obligation to behave in a moral way is the same as your hunger to eat food -- it is an inner drive.  Some people are born with brain damage or are disabled where this inner drive is broken.  It is the same as people who have disorders that make them eat too much.  They are simply sick, damaged people, such as the thief in your example.<br>  <br>  Normal people may not always behave in a moral way, but that inner drive is there.  Just as hungry people may not always eat (such as dieters), but they have the desire to do so.|`|AA11938604	Just a comment really;  I certainly see where you are headed with your scenario and you make some good points.  If we don’t base our laws on God’s word, which is the absolute standard, society will eventually crumble.  I think politics could be all, but done away with, if when passing a law we first looked at what the absolute standard said instead of “majority rules”.  A majority did not want to follow Moses into the Promise Land.  A majority built a golden calf and rebelled against God and Moses.  I’m not taking the time to look up chapter and verse, but several places in the Old Testament say something in the nature of “and each man did according to what was right in his own eyes.”  Without an absolute standard to follow (God’s Word) what might be right in MY eyes, might not be right in yours.  <br>  With the direction the United States is heading we are certainly heading to a time where right and wrong are relative.  We are calling good evil, and evil good.  If you go back, say 100 years and took with you some of the bills that have been in front of congress they would laugh in your face.  I’ll pick on gay marriage as an example.  Would gay marriage have been an issue 100 years ago?  Even now, if we were to use God’s Word as our political and social standard it would not be an issue.  “What does the bill say?  Now what does the Bible say?  Well, that’s pretty cut and dry.  Let’s go home now.”<br>  One final thought.  If everything is relative and each man does what is right in his own eyes, I’m going to remember that the next time I play Monopoly.  I don’t care what the rules say on the inside of the cover I’m going to do what I want.  The game wouldn’t be very fun for everybody if one of the players did what they wanted when the wanted to.  Everything goes much smoother when we all follow the rules that have been laid out for us before hand.  No, you can’t please everybody.  Somebody in Monopoly has to lose, but it’s not whether you win or lose, it’s how you play the game.|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	Your little story uses the phrase "within the confines of society", which places the society and it's structure above the individual. It becomes necessary, under that definition, to restructure the relativism so that it doesn't create the destruction of society. The overall success of a society is based rules that are "relative" to it's existence and it's continuity. Unless the entire society agrees to the parameters that create the events you outline in the story, then you have a rogue style of behavior, not anarchy. The shooter was clearly going to jail if he didn't shoot, because society said that was wrong, and it made him afraid, but society condemning the killing didn't bother him because he wasn't going to let society define his morals, or lack thereof when it came to murder. Regardless, we all act under our own personal restraints and what's right or wrong is our determination based on the effect it will have on our well being. Killing as illustrated is wrong inside an individuals perception of right and wrong that he or she allows to be shaped by society.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Very interesting question.   Well, if anarchy is the absence of government and without government we would have lawlessness since there is not awareness of sin or wrong doing within the people, then I think you would have the worst of situations.  I think society today is breeding relativists.   They are called humanists also.   They make their own rules, their own laws, they decide what is right and wrong of course if it benefits them it is good and if it doesn't, it is bad.  Just like that old Frank Sinatra song "I did it My Way".  Now if everyone is practicing that kind of individualist thinking, then there will be kaos such as we have never seen before because everyone's standards will be different.  The out come would be devasting I think.  Perhaps that's exactly what will happen during the great tribulation.

Without there being absolute values in which to ground ethical choices, there is no ultimate reason to do anything at all.  People are constrained by different levels of self-interest, sentiment, fear, etc, but beneath these, there is nothing to provide a moral bedrock for the relativist.  People may fear any number of consequences, but not what Kant called "the moral law" itself.  People who believe this therefore have one of two choices.  Either they construct reasons for morality based on something else - in which case they can't complain if others don't respect that something; or they arm themselves against trouble!<br>  <br>  Having said that, there is a difference between what people say they believe, and how they act. The prisons are full of religious believers.|`|ajrnlFczaa	My dictionary's definition of Anarchy: <br>  the complete absence of government<br>  Political disorder and violence; lawlessness<br>  disorder in any sphere of activity<br>  <br>  <br>  So I have to agree if relativism were true and the norm, it would lead to anarchy.  Your story shows an example of it.<br>  And also look at society, since people have gotten away from absolute truth and are living in their own relativism, we have political disorder, violence, lawlessness, etc.  It keeps getting worse as we keep straying from absolute truth, which can only be found in one place - God's Word.|`|KXiwLOtOaa	my mom says there's a lot of anrachy in africa|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Well said!|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	There is a difference between moral relativism and moral nihilism.  Just because there is no ABSOLUTE right or wrong, it doesn't mean there aren't other kinds of right or wrong.  Let's mine your story for examples.<br>  <br>  Obviously the thief doesn't have NO ethical system.  He has values that he uses to make his choices.  He finds murder more acceptable than being imprisoned.  He finds stealing to be more acceptable than poverty.  And we can probably guess at the reason why he makes those decisions - he is mostly interested in his own personal benefit and disinterested in the benefit of others.<br>  <br>  As we see from the events in the story, your jeweler is not a moral relativist at all.  He does believe that there are some universal standards of right and wrong, and the thief demonstrates to him how truly erroneous that belief is.  So really your allegory shows the opposite of what you seem to think it does.<br>  <br>  In fact, if your jeweler were a moral relativist, he would probably have realized right away that the thief's ethical code was different from his own - the jeweler, after all, is not out there robbing stores.  He would instead have tried to understand and appeal to that code.  For example, he might have said, "If you just rob from me, the police might look for you for a couple of years, but if you murder me there's no statute of limitations.  It is not in your interest to kill me... you'll have to hide for ever.  Or you could just turn around now and you'd only be guilty of breaking and entering and the police probably wouldn't even bother investigating."  Or maybe he could have just mentioned that the day's events had been videotaped and so killing him would be pointless because the police could just see the theif casing the store earlier.  And perhaps that last point is a lie... which only goes to prove the point futher:  if lies are universally wrong, it would be better to be murdered than to lie... but I don't think there are very many people who hold that ethical system.<br>  <br>  In fact, I would argue that ethical nihilism is about as untenable a position as any kind of nihilism.  It is natural for people to want and value things to different degrees.  Trying to disprove it seems to me to be a waste of time.  But you're welcome to keep doing so, if it makes you happy.  Peace!|`|AA11114869	A quick glance at the news should tell you that no one is obligated to conform to social norms, - it's just that most simply do so.<br>  The question then becomes:<br>  "Why do most people conform to social norms?"<br>  <br>  The answer to why people conform to social norms is, oddly enough, the same as that for people who do NOT conform to social norms:<br>  that is, everyone lives their lives in a manner which seems most beneficial to them.<br>  <br>  Given this, - the idea of theft, rape, murder, etc..., may seem to MOST people as being morally 'wrong', but it only seems this way because our natural desire to pursue that which would 'please' us is outweighed by our desire to avoid the risk of 'displeasure', - the potential for such displeasure being those punishments which our society besets upon those who pursue those pleasure-seeking 'desires' which our society has deemed detrimental to the survival of the group as a whole;... a typical 'herd' type of self-preservation.<br>  <br>  That said, - those who DO NOT see the potential for punishment as outweighing the pleasure they seek in pursuing their desires are living their lives in no different a manner that those who DO; law-abiding conformist or not, - we all base our actions in ways which we feel will benefit us.<br>  <br>  In his book, HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN, Nietzshe wrote:<br>  ---..."... We do not accuse nature of immorality when it sends us a thunderstorm and makes us wet: why do we call the harmful man immoral? Because in the latter case we assume a voluntary commanding free-will, in the former necessity. But this distinction is an error.  And then: we do not call even intentional harming immoral under all circumstances; one unhesitatingly kills a fly intentionally, for example, merely because one does not like its buzzing, one punishes the criminal intentionally and does him harm so as to protect ourselves and society... it is always in some sense a matter of SELF-PRESERVATION."...---<br>  <br>  I wholeheartedly agree with that assertion.<br>  -
kJs0RmtXaa	Heeheeheee, I could not read that first part either, the first time i read the book, however last night, while re-reading Eclipse, I forced myself to read the story, the general idea of that part around the bonfire, basically the vampires are the bad guys, one of the wolf's wives runs forward and sacrifices herself to distract the vampires.  The fresh blood would do that, draw the attention from the wolves.  She sacrificed herself out of love for her  wolf man, and of course Bella would relate to that.  Basically that is it.  Now on Jasper it just tells about how he became a vampire, and how he used his military training to train newborn vampires in combat. Even though most of the newborns die, during their battles anyway, he taught them to fight much more efficiently, which is important to the story because he teaches the other Cullens how to fight against newborns and win.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	The story begins with the revelation that Seattle is being plagued by a string of unsolved murders, which Edward suspects are being caused by a vampire that is unable to control its thirst. Edward and Bella fill out college applications, while Bella explains to Edward her desire to see Jacob, her werewolf friend, again. Meanwhile, Alice Cullen has a vision that Victoria, a vampire who is hunting Bella for revenge, is back in town. Although Edward fears for her safety, Bella insists that Jacob and the rest of the werewolf pack would never harm her, and he eventually allows her to visit Jacob once in a while. A few days later, Edward proposes to Bella and, despite having an aversion to marriage, she accepts.<br>  <br>  Bella and the Cullens realize that the murders in Seattle are being committed by an "army" of newborn vampires, controlled by Victoria. The Cullen family joins forces with the werewolf pack in order to combat this threat. As everyone else prepares for battle, Edward and Bella camp up in the mountains, hidden during the battle, where they are later joined by Jacob and Seth Clearwater, a young member of the werewolf pack, to wait out the fight.<br>  <br>  In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and becomes very upset. He threatens to join the fight and get himself killed. To stop him, Bella kisses Jacob. Victoria tracks Edward's scent to Bella and Edward is forced to fight, despite Bella's wishes to keep him safely with her. After Victoria and her army are successfully destroyed, Bella explains to Jacob that while she loves him, her love for Edward is greater and she cannot live without him. After receiving a wedding invitation from a humble Edward, Jacob runs away in his wolf form to escape the pain he feels, angry at Bella's decision to become a vampire.|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	I struggled with those bits too... frightfully boring. But then the rest of the series wasn't too entertaining, was it?<br>  <br>  Basically LOADS of foreshadowing. <br>  <br>  It's nothing terribly important.

At least then when you inevitably realise it's complete trash you'll be able to say so having honestly read it.|`|F7ubafH1aa	I would just read the book. I will admit I was pretty bored with the whole Quileute thing, but Jasper's was interesting. That tells about how he becomes a vampire. Read it!!|`|RrtUV5wcaa	if you're too lazy to read it, then just don't read it.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	LMAO.<br>  I had a hard time reading those too.<br>  But once I forced myself to, they got really interesting.<br>  <br>  The Quileute story is mostly about, the ancestors would go into spirit form to protect their wives and children, until one Indian (can't remember his crazy name) betrayed the leader and killed his own human body, and put his spirit into the leader's body.  He then went to the village and posed as the leader and had the other Quileutes never go back into spirit form to avoid the rightful leader telling them what happened.<br>  Blahblahblah, the leader went into wolf form and came to the village and he had to kill one of his cousins because the 'leader body' ordered them to kill the wolf.  He felt awful and hid away, I think. ANYWAYS, that story isn't too important.<br>  <br>  But the other half of the legend is about the third wife.<br>  Some of the women from the Indian villages were disappearing, so the warriors went into wolf-form to search around.  <br>  <br>  They came across a scent that burned their noses.  They followed the trail and came across human blood and bodies that were sucked empty, and a vampire.  The vampire was cold and hard, and ripped apart one of the wolves.  <br>  <br>  The other two warriors worked together to kill the vampire, but only one wolf survived. <br>  <br>  The survivor ripped it apart into hundreds of pieces, but were shocked to see that the pieces were reassembling themselves.  They immediately burnt the body and it produced a horrible cloud of smoke. <br>  <br>  They soon came to find out that the vampire they killed had a partner, and the partner was attacking the villages out of revenge.<br>  There was only one warrior left, so he did what he had to do.<br>  <br>  He started fighting with the vampire, both of them tearing limbs and chunks of skin off eachother. The wife of the last warrior saw her husband losing the fight, and she had to help him anyway she could.<br>  <br>  She grabbed a knife from the village and ran to where they were fighting, she stood a couple feet away from the scuffle and plunged the knife into her heart.  <br>  The vampire immediately was overcome by the scent of the blood, and forgot about the wolf. <br>  The last warrior finished the vampire while it's back was turned.<br>  <br>  After that, he never left his wife's body.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  JASPER:<br>  <br>  Jasper was in the military, and was almost immediately promoted through all the ranks because of his charisma (hense his vampire power).<br>  <br>  During one of the wars in the 1800s (can't remember which one), they soldiers were sent to gather all the women and children to put them in safe houses.  While Jasper was out searching, he came across three beautiful girls who he couldn't seem to take his eyes off of.  <br>  He told them he had to take them away to keep them safe, but they told him he'd be good to be with them on their side (amongst other confusing things they said).<br>  <br>  One of the girls bit Jasper, and he was made to be a "newborn vampire trainer".  His job was to take the newborns and teach them how to fight, and then once they were a year old, he would kill them since their strength was slowly deteriorating.<br>  <br>  After decades of this, he ran away from the army he was creating with the other three women, because he could feel the emotions the newborns were feeling when he was killing them.<br>  <br>  He met some other vampires, yadayadayada, he wanted to see what life would be like in other places, and he went to a diner, and that is where he met Alice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if these are longer than the actual book-versions.

There are so many political action committees to try and wade through to get to the prize. But a Lincoln of today could run and win. Or is this the Lincoln of the 1860s? It is an irrelevant question in that sense because the entire political landscape is different. Yet I know of nothing in his character that would have kept him from surviving any political environment.<br>  <br>  But Lincoln did something else extraordinary and that was he almost single-handedly held the country together when everyone else was calling for an end to the war. A premature ending to the war would certainly have been the end of the United States. We would have been swallowed up by France and England. Lincoln, for good or bad, transformed us from a republic into an empire.
pI5jKfmaaa	An enabling act is a piece of legislation by which a legislative body grants an entity which depends on it for authorization or legitimacy to take a certain action(s). For example, enabling acts often establish government agencies to carry out specific government policies in a modern nation state.

pI5jKfmaaa	The  Schutzstaffel (help·info) (German for "Protective Squadron"), abbreviated SS- or  (Runic)- was a major Nazi organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The SS grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as the Führer's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men, (both on the front lines and as political police) managed to exert as much political influence as the Wehrmacht. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during the World War II, and most of the worst of those crimes.<br>  <br>  Initially numerically smaller than Ernst R?hm's Sturmabteilung (Storm Battalion abbreviated SA), the SS grew in size and power due to its exclusive loyalty to Hitler, as opposed to the SA, which was seen as semi-independent and a threat to Hitler's hegemony over the party. Under Himmler, the SS selected its members according to the nazi racist ideology. Creating elite police and military units such as the Waffen-SS, Himmler used the SS to form an order of men claimed to be superior in racial purity and abilities to other Germans and national groups, a model for the Nazi vision of a master race. During World War II, SS units operated alongside the regular German Army, and in the final stages of the war, exercised dominance over it, to eliminate perceived threats to Hitler's power while implementing his strategies, despite the increasingly failing war effort.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_ss" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_ss</a>|`|wNEpfTEnaa	One of the many ways in which the Nazi regime successfully repressed the German people - through the use of terror. (specific methods of terror you could look into) other methods of repression included indoctrination by the propooganda ministry etc. However, make sure you don't fall into the trap of thinking the SS and Gestapo were patrolling every street corner in Germany, in fact many historians elude to the idea that the German population used the idea of the SS to their own ends, and in some ways the bark was worse than the bite. Nevertheless, a ruthless part of the Nazi regime.|`|5eRy51aXaa	The SS in Nazi Germany-<br>  <br>  Among the institutions operating in Nazi Germany, the most sinister and feared of them all was the SS. Originally subject to the SA, this collection of soldiers began as a small elite bodyguard that protected the Fuehrer and developed into a number of different institutions as it grew in size. The different roles it later assumed are (1) a party police force; (2) a terrorist police force; (3) a regular army within the army commanding its own forces, the Waffen SS; (4) a huge economic conglomerate with its influence heavy in big business in Germany and later in the conquered territories; and (5) a huge killing machine that supervised a horrifying system of concentration camps in which people were tortured and annihilated.<br>  <br>  The SS had its origins in Bavaria in the 1920s, led by the short, unathletic, and near-sighted Bavarian, Heinrich Himmler. With great dedication and careful skill, Himmler assembled the major instruments of Nazi terror-SS, police, and concentration camps. The goals of his efforts was not to plainly administer terror for its own sake but to create a racially pure machine. The sterilization, euthanasia of those considered "not worth living", and medical experiments were all for the sake of achieving this ideal, of creating a race of uebermenschen, supermen. Therefore, his terror machine was the product of both his and Hitler's racial beliefs. It was these beliefs that Himmler would believe in and follow religiously and expect similar devotion of his beloved SS troops.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The SS in Poland. Photo from the National Archives.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  In June 1931, Himmler would also meet his closest and most ruthless henchman, Reinhard Heydrich. Ironically, in all the ways that Himmler fell short of his "pure" racial appearance, Heydrich fullfilled them; he was tall, slender, blond, and athletic. In the spring of 1933, Himmler and Heydrich began their grab for power. It was that March that Himmler became police president of Munich and would use this position as a base of operation to expand the SS and his police system. While Himmler gained more and control, Heydrich also solidified the apparatus that helped make Himmler's efforts possible-the Security Service Branch(SD) of the Nazi Party, which he had built up since 1931.<br>  <br>  In expanding their system of control, Himmler and Heydrich not only built up the SS, especially the Security Service, but also focused on infiltrating the German Police. During the Night of the Long Knives, Himmler permanently incapacitated the SA and as a reward for eliminating Roehm, the SS was made an autonomous organization and was given complete control of the Gestapo. On June 28, Himmler would reorganize the German police system and form a new security police. Under the former Weimar Republic, the police had been divided in to two branches: the administrative police and the executive police. The executive police was then divided into four major enforcement and political branches: (1) the Kripo(crime); (2) the Schupo (urban constabulary); the political police, and the gendarmerie. Himmler split off from this executive police the two more important branches - the criminal police and the political police - and formed the security police (Sipo), added the newly obtained Gestapo, and place them under Heydrich. The rest he left to Kurt Dalugue and meged them into a new Ordnungspolizei (the ordinary police [Orpo]).<br>  <br>  In the years following, Himmler would make use of several indivuals to carry out his agenda. Bruno Sreckenbach, former chief of the Hamburg police, for example, would set up the first gettos in Polland and put together the infamous Einsatzgruppen that rounded up and murdered Jews and "Asiatic inferiors". Also, there was SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Oswald Pohl, who destined to build up a huge economic conglomerate of SS business enterprises based on slave labor, extortion, and murder. Arthur Neve, head of Kripo, would be the first to volunteer enthusiastically to exterminate Jews in Poland under the cover of employment duty to the east. Finally, Theodor Eicke, a sadistic sociopath, would run the whole Nazi system of concentration camps.<br>  <br>  Naturally, as Himmler's system of totalitarian terror developed, the crowning structure would be the concentration camp. Himmler groomed a special volunteer unit of SS men for long-term service as concentration camp guard and named them Death's-Head Units. In charge of this system was Theodor Eicke, a brutal psychopath who standardized a set of cruel and unusual punishment in all of his camps.<br>  <br>  By 1939, the SS was organized in to four major branches: (1) the General SS, consisting largely of part-timers who combined their regular occupations with evening and weekend service in the SS on a voluntary basis; (2) the SD or Security Service; (3) the SS Military Formations, later renamed the Waffen SS; (4) the concentration camp guard units|`|LvELjQ2saa	well i'll keep this short, unlike everyone else, and i'll actually give you the right answer.  the ss were simply the people who were at the concentration camps and killed the jews. if you remember, prince harry wore an SS suit to a costume party and took a lot of heat. they are different from the nazi soldiers that actually fought in battle.|`|PoY7vcnQaa	They were the Nazi version of our SWAT teams.

TAIlyvgyaa	Yes, all those things contributed, but in real life rather than in fiction, many people grow up in terrible misery and neglect and abuse and DON'T become evil, murdering monsters.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between a bad start in life being a reason for later troubles and it being an excuse.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I'd say if we are searching for a reason more than just - JK wrote it that way - then Voldemort was an evil person because he had no conscience.|`|AA10505866	He was an evil person because he chose to be. Tom Riddle suffered many hardships as a child, including rejection by his father, but plenty of other characters suffered equal hardships as well. Harry, Dumbledore, and Nevile all suffered rejection, the loss of family members and friends, or both, and none of them turned out evil. Harry grew up in a horrible home, surrounded by people who hated him. Voldemort, as a young man, decided that the way to deal with his pain was to change the world to his liking, and to cause the pain he had felt on others. That's at least the beginning of what made him evil.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	yes, i think thats why. his mother died when he was born, and his father didn't want him, so he grew up in an orphanage feeling that no one cared for him or ever would care for him, and it probably gave him the idea that there was no love in the world - which led him to isolating himself from everyone and everything.|`|562qoBUUaa	Yeah I agree. He didn't know how to show love from the beginning and was isolated because of it.

The mother thought that the father would love her without the spell so she stopped it. He ran away from her and dissapeared. Voldemort was born and his mom died so he was brought to an orphanage. He was a mean boy hurting other kids and once he found out about his powers, and his muggle father, killed his father, and grandparents. He was on a killing spree ever since.|`|cgz85foTaa	I agree.  It's the same thing with serial killers in real life (Voldemort could be considered one).  Something is wrong with their childhood concerning one of their parents and it screws them up later on in life.  Of course, this doesn't happen to everyone who is neglected...but it is eerie how many people this happens to and they become cold-hearted killers.  J. K. Rowling must have done her research.

For drama, maybe they aren't broken down, they hit someone or they're lost. Maybe the driver kidnapped them or something.<br>  Enjoy yourselves!
JkHdGCqeaa	He does this because they are having intercourse and instead of harming her because of the way she smells and them being so close, like has almost happened many other times in the previous books, he harms other things such as the headboard, pillows, or nightgowns...whatever.<br>  <br>  She doesnt hear them, because, again, they are having intercourse! And as said many times by Stephenie Meyer throughout the book, Edward Cullen's smell, aura, whatever kind of puts her in a trance kind of, like she only is focused on him (just like many other times in the book where there is passion, them kissing and whatnot) where she is only focused on him and i suppose doesnt realize whats going on around her?<br>  that would be my guess..?|`|MPztCHj0aa	Meyer's religion doesn't allow her to write sex scenes (although apparently gratuitous violence is super-duper-peachy-keen), so she had Bella pass out while Edward basically raped her (because he *could* have stopped once she passed out, but he didn't) on their "wedding night."<br>  He bit pillows and broke the headboard because apparently he never learned any sort of real self-control in 108 years of existence.<br>  Bella did not notice this until he pointed it out to her the next morning--because she was so fascinated by him being "ZOMG PRITTY" that she actually didn't notice that she was covered in bruises.  And then, she forgave him for it, apparently because physical abuse is just sooooooo cute now, especially when coupled with the excuse, "Baby I love you, I just couldn't help myself."<br>  <br>  And much like the rest of the plot for the rest of the series--it doesn't add to the story at all.<br>  I read the series so I could see how bad it was.  The honeymoon part was sickening.|`|BImAj5WIaa	He does this because Bella and Edward ar having Sex<br>  <br>  Bella doesn't realize this util the next morning because she is distracted by Edward<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|m3rt9x8Caa	It doesn't add to the story as such. He breaks and rips things because they are having sex and he is trying not to hurt her by gripping her arms or something to hard so he holds on to the headboard or bites the pillows. Bella doesn't notice because shes to distracted by Edward.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	It's very easily explained - Meyer is not a very good writer and ALL her work is full of plot holes like that.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	He does that because he is doing anything he can to keep himself from biting Bella or snapping anything on her while they are having sex.<br>  <br>  And she doesn't notice because she is too into banging him to realize anything happening around her.<br>  <br>  And it adds to the story because that is basically how everything starts in Breaking Dawn, with Renesmee coming around.|`|ANEdyayCaa	He tears her nightgown to have sex with her, bites the pillows so he doesn't bite her, breaks the headboard because he is holding to it not to hold her too tight. He doesn't want to hurt her while ... you know. She finds out in the morning because she's been busy while he was doing it, busy with pleasure. Hope I helped! :)|`|dXRrxxrFaa	That is easy to explain. He does all of that because he is going a little mental of sex. He is enjoying himself so well that he goes a little crazy.<br>  Bella doesn't hear him either because she is so wraped up in her own enjoyment that she doesn't notice.<br>  Does that help?|`|5pj25lL4aa	instead of hurting her, he either bites a chunk outta the headboard or tears the pillows. cannot really expalin why she doesn't hear him but stephanie meyer probably just chose not to put that in her book.

If I read between the lines, you're asking that if there is truly no such thing as a "sin", it removes our ability to define ourselves? Here's my answer to that. No generation has defined all sins the same way, no two religions define sins the same way. If there were no such thing as a sin, there would still be actions that are counter productive, either to society, or to another individual. Those, under the classification of do no harm, would be negative actions, wrongful actions, maybe even despicable actions, but without the intervention of a group that has a religious agenda, whether it be an invisible man who lives in the sky and can change the earth moon and stars with a thought, or the idea that a magic creature lives inside a volcano and won't spew ashes and soot on your village if you throw in a cow now and then, these wouldn't be labeled as sins. I believe the assumption in your (perceived) statement is incorrect.|`|SDiYtubGaa	Does that imply sin and man are inseparables or that man cannot be controlled without the theory of sin and punishment? 'Externalization of values' is losing its luminance in the light of self-realization and eventually yes, there will be no such thing as sin.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Basically...I agree.

SHNYP6Xpaa	I believe you would be hard pressed to find a holocaust denier in this forum.<br>  <br>  But I will say why people deny it.<br>  <br>  Note : I am Jewish, I know the Holocaust is real. I've also researched objectively it myself to check claims and have conclusive evidence that it is real.<br>  <br>  However others claim it is not real, simply because of "gaps in the chain of evidence," believing that a super secret program to mass exterminate a group of people due to religious beliefs would be talked about more in social circles. That the government of Nazi Germany would put billboards on the autobahn that talk of the glorious death machine or that this final solution policy would be up for public debate.<br>  <br>  They question the lack of evidence to the amount of human remains at death camps. You know, because all murdered people are just left out in the open next to the murderer's house and really who doesn't want 10 million bodies strewn about Central Europe? No one would ever dump cremated remains in a river to dispose of them and hide the scope of the, again, secret project. <br>  <br>  There are other reasons people think this way, I will put up links for you to read the insanity of it all.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I believe it happened!<br>  There is countless proof in documentations and eye witness reports everywhere.<br>  Hitler was as evil as they come.

The first people I knew who were in denial were Germans who were children during the war. They apparently weren't told about it or just told "In the war, a lot of innocent people died." They were not anti-semitic, but just felt the fuss over the Jewish people who died was wrong because of hundreds, maybe thousands of civilian women and children of all religions were also killed in bombing raids and nobody in America seemed to care about that. It took movies and documentaries about it for them to realize the scope. But they did not deny it after they learned about it. <br>  <br>  But I have met former soldiers who helped liberate the camps, they were real. Most people who deny it don't know what they are talking about. They are either anti-semitic and don't care; or they have the naive view like the Germans who just thought they were all war casualties, no different than any others.

W1h3w5gdaa	In many ways, asking someone "what's the best guitar" is a lot like asking "what's the best flavor of ice cream?" It's not all opinion when it comes to a guitar, but it is more than most people give it credit for. People become fans of a particular brand, even a model, and assume that everyone else in the world should feel the same way.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are a lot of crappy guitars out there. It's the number one selling musical instrument in North America, and outnumbers the next 5 or 6 top selling instruments combined in terms of revenue and units sold. This means everyone's gonna have an opinion. And you know what opinions are like...<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to define a price range (which you have) and then go to a guitar store. Play with guitars in your price range. If you think you're not very good and are embarrassed playing in public, get over it. Play to your little heart's content, fall in love with a guitar and take it home. You will never be happier than if you follow that method.<br>  <br>  And, unless it's the only guitar store in town, don't settle. If you don't fall in love with it, don't buy it. Try a different store, and keep playing them until you do. Trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and have fun!!|`|hlE3nwyGaa	To start out, acoustic cutaway.

SHNYP6Xpaa	That is not always true that "talkies are better than silent pictures" that's like saying "color is better than black and white movies."<br>  <br>  Silent films are still being made today.<br>  <br>  A group made a movie based on "The Call of Cthulhu," one of the more popular stories by H.P. Lovecraft.<br>  <br>  It was done in the style of a 1920s horror movie. Black and white, silent, symphonic score and it's brilliant.<br>  <br>  It is also regarded as the best Lovecraft film, simply because it did not rely on modern movie techniques and CGI to produce a truly good movie.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	It seems to me in the 1980's or 90's a silent movie was made, but I don't know for sure and have no idea what it was called or who was in it.<br>  <br>  It is just the technology improves, so do movies. You are right, they paved the way for modern movies and TV. <br>  <br>  There have been so many innovations in entertainment and other things in recent years, it would be hard to imagine when people were excited to get to go see a flickering, silent film with somebody playing a piano or organ in the theater. The films also broke very often, from what I understand (I wasn't here yet). <br>  <br>  Some people still like Charlie Chaplin movies, etc. Some of the silent movie  people might be more appreciated for their acting and things like that today than they might have been years ago, when people could still remember the silent era and just liked 'talkies' better.|`|w5C0XrNOaa	Basically silent films were the state of the art at the time. They were the next logical step in the evolution of film.

Well they represent a specific time in the history of art when a lot of experimentation was going on and they represent one man's way to experiment with oils, with painting, and with getting a record on canvas of his own subconscious mind. He called it 'Action painting' because he tried (with great success by the way) to allow the motions and actions of his body dictate the application of the paint to the canvas. He put himself into a trance-like state and dripped the paint and flung the paint onto large pieces of canvas streatched out on the studio floor.<br>   The idea was to take conscious thought out of the process.<br>    Brilliant!|`|D9AUzmZRaa	I didn't like them then, and I don't like them now.
z4Yeofq8aa	For much of the century you're talking about British rather than European colonialism and the motivation for it initially was mostly economic exploitation to get raw materials for British industry e.g. cotton and to create new markets for British exports. Their main focus was on India and they annexed territory throughout the 19th century until they virtually controlled the entire sub continent. The other European powers became involved in what was termed the "Rush for Africa" in the late 19th century as they sought to compete with Britain. In this period Britain's motivation for colonialism was mainly to provide strategic bases in Africa and the Far east to protect their existing colonies from attack. The current ethnic and religious divisions in India and Pakistan are one legacy of British colonialism.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Britain is the best example of this, not long ago it owned one quarter of the worlds land and a quarter of its population, it was the biggest empire the world has ever seen.<br>  <br>  Britain often Colonized places for materials, strategic points for trade, also, it colonized Australia simply so it had a place to put its criminals, also wile they were there working in Australia, they would Create a British colony creating a income.<br>  Britain often occupied places so as to take the lands potential away from its rivals from taking advantage of it.<br>  <br>  It has caused many disputes between land that are going on to this day, There is also somthing called the Common wealth, wich is a collection of the countrys that were colonys of Britian, such as India, Australia, Canada and so on.... Lots of countrys are part of the common welath, They all have the  Queen of England as there queen also. Also, all countrys have good trade with eachother. Britian industrilized lots of countrys and caused a population boom in its colonys.<br>  <br>  Britian started to dismantle its Empire after WW1 and WW2 because it was becoming expensive, it worked out more profitable to dismantle its empire and keep good trade rights with the countrys it owned then to keep hold of the land.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped. :]

It's not all opinion when it comes to a guitar, but it is more than most people give it credit for. People become fans of a particular brand, even a model, and assume that everyone else in the world should feel the same way.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are a lot of crappy guitars out there.

This means everyone's gonna have an opinion. And you know what opinions are like...<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to define a price range and then go to a guitar store. Play with guitars in your price range. If you think you're not very good and are embarrassed playing in public, get over it. Play to your little heart's content, fall in love with a guitar and take it home. You will never be happier than if you follow that method.<br>  <br>  And, unless it's the only guitar store in town, don't settle. If you don't fall in love with it, don't buy it. Try a different store, and keep playing them until you do.

Lets face it, look at his work the way he portrays men and female relationships there is a clear intimate portrayal.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Gustav Klimt|`|HJdwLLkUaa	Asinine to say the least, and ridiculously incorrect. <br>  <br>  Both Gustav Klimt and Egon Shiele hired women of exceptional beauty to pose for them. This was typically teen to early twenty something women. They would pose them in very suggestive positions (especially considering Egon's work), which caused much controversy.<br>  <br>  What "child molester" controversy that you are referring to, PROF. bellevuebigbody, actually surrounds Egon Shiele--NOT Gustav Klimt. Egon worked in the same studio and was a friend of Gustav. The controversy was when Egon fell in love and ran away with a 17 year old model that both Gustav and Egon employed. Based on today's standards, we tend to disprove of the age difference between Egon and the young lover. But it was actually their bohemian artist lifestyle that the small town folk of Krumau disproved of and tried to accuse him of lewd such behavior.|`|zcxOK5u0aa	People magazine meets art history! <br>  <br>  I wanted to add that when one looks more closely at this work, it is apparent that the woman's head is pressed against her shoulder in a seemingly uncomfortable way.

Your sentences run strings of descriptions and events together that could be separated more effectively, for what I think would be better storytelling. In that first sentence, for instance, the action of you almost knocking over the lamp essentially serves as another descriptor of the lamp, when that action would probably be better off as a separate sentence or clause. Controlled decompression of the description of a scene is what I would use here.|`|4vbovQKJaa	It's not really a story.  It's just 2 paragraphs of gratuitous romance-novel-esque groping.

oFV48JbGaa	ok|`|FoIxsunVaa	I too am a jealous dog.|`|P1alfkrJaa	I agree with Woodsman. Go with old age. Time will take of you on its own sooner or later so why rush things? The philosopher Heraclitus said, "Life is Flux", life IS constant change - so whether our circumstances are great or nightmarish the one thing we can count on is that those circumstances WILL change. That's the nature of life. In John Steinbeck's novel Cannery Row he has a great scene where these two boys are talking and one says how his dad killed himself. The other boy asks why. The first boy says, "Because he couldn't find a job" then pauses and adds, "Funniest thing. The next day after he killed himself a man came by to offer him a job." Perfectly illustrates the `Life is Flux' idea. You don't know what's coming tomorrow. Why not hang around and find out? It's not all bad. You get to type things like `The word dog has 3 letters' and I know my dog appreciated that you were thinking of her.

jgubeXubaa	There is an art to letting go.  We never really know when death will be knocking on our door.  I don't think that we should be worried about it.  In that last moment just take a deep breath and say ah ha! as you are exhailing.  What you can't prevent or change just accept with love and curiosity.  Carl G. Jung, the psychologist, wrote about a death experience that he had in his biography.  It's called Memories, Deams, and Reflections by Anelia Jaffe.  I think it is highly worthwhile reading. I have to say that I enjoy the purity of your soul and the curiosity that moves you in your search for truth.

At least 6 million Jews and I don't know the numbers of Gypsies, and Poles, political dissidents and others also killed.

I don't know the numbers on those.<br>  <br>  There is the ongoing genocide in Darfur and problems in Zimbamwe. Stalin killed possibly millions of Jews, political dissidents and others. We don't know how many were killed in China, starting with Mao's regime, during the "Long March" before he took over, the Chinese Civil War, the Cultural Revolution, and the imprisionment and killing of dissidents since Mao's death, especially after the 1989 'democracy' uprising. <br>  <br>  But Hilter still tops the list, no doubt with the others coming  in close in some cases.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	The knee jerk reaction is to go straight to the victims of Nazi Germany and I in no way want to down play the horrors of these events.<br>  <br>  It has, however been argued that the Stalin purge or 'Putch' along with deliberate mis management of the defence of Russia actually resulted far greater numbers of dead|`|1hvrQYWiaa	It has to be the Holocaust under the Nazis - it was carried out as an act of state policy on an industrial scale, and meticulously documented by the perpetrators|`|d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	To me the Rwanda genocide is more horrific, because it was done largely by civilians, not by the military or government.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Eight hundred thousand Tutsi civilians chopped to death with machetes in less than four months. It was a real community effort by the Hutu, like one of the Amish barn raisings, only bloodier. If you want a good look at how they did it, I recommend a book called Machete Season.<br>  <br>  It’s very simple, totally straightforward, just interviews with a gang of Hutu farmers who spent three months making daily expeditions into the local swamp, where surviving Tutsi civilians were trying to hide. They all tell the same story: “Every morning we got up, took our machetes and looked for Tutsis to hack to death. Sometimes we gang-raped the pretty girls, because those Tutsi girls have such soft skin from all the milk they drink. But we’d kill them too when we were done. After weeks of killing the Tutsi didn’t even resist any more. They just stood there and waited for us to finish them off. We had the time of our lives.”|`|D6FBLQfwaa	Numbers wise, Mao Tse Tung in China killed the most, followed by Stalin.

It is arguable that these two events were the biggest genocides of the 20th Century.

(Russian, in full: Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин (Josef Vissarionovich Stalin), real name: Иосиф Виссарионович Джугашвили (Josef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvilli), Georgian: ????? ????????? (Ioseb Jughashvili); December 6 (OS)/December 18 (NS), 1878[1] – March 5, 1953) was the leader of the Soviet Union from mid-1920s to his death in 1953 and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922-1953), a position which had later become that of party leader.<br>  <br>  Stalin became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1922 and following the death of Vladimir Lenin, he prevailed over Leon Trotsky in a power struggle during the 1920s. In the 1930s Stalin eliminated effective political opposition both within the Party and among the population (see Gulag) and consolidated his authority with the Great Purge, a period of widespread arrests and executions which reached its peak in 1937, remaining in power through World War II and until his death. Stalin molded the features that characterized the new Soviet regime; his policies, based on Marxist–Leninist ideology, are often considered to represent a political and economic system called Stalinism.<br>  <br>  Under Stalin, who replaced the New Economic Policy (NEP) of the 1920s with five year plans (introduced in 1928) and collective farming, the Soviet Union was transformed from a largely peasant society to a major world industrial power by the end of the 1930s. Since many peasants resisted collectivization, the government resorted to often violent repression against so-called 'kulaks, resulting in millions of deaths, both through genocide (see also Holodomor) and direct government violence.<br>  <br>  A hard-won victory in World War II (the Great Patriotic War, 1941–45), made possible in part through the capacity for production that was the outcome of industrialization, laid the groundwork for the formation of the Warsaw Pact and established the USSR as one of the two major world powers, a position it maintained for nearly four decades following Stalin's death in 1953.<br>  <br>  Stalin's cult of personality, his concentration of power and the means of its execution has led to a common characterization of him as a dictator and to an opinion that he was personally responsible, directly or indirectly, via his policies, for millions or tens of millions of deaths and unjust imprisonments in the Soviet Union.<br>  <br>  Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin's actual successor, denounced his mass repressions and cult of personality in 1956, initiating the process of "de-Stalinization".

But if somebody is Christian, Jewish, Muslim, especially, understanding how the people in ancient times lived and thought helps understand the fundamentals of some of the religions and what things, like how women in the Bible are treated, relates to the culture of the writers and not necessarily the teachings of God.

Remember that if a digital camera crops the image to a 1:5 factor you may be effectively shooting at 105mm focal length when the lens is set at 70, but you still have the perspective of 70 mm because the lens elements are still in the same relationship to one another that they would be at a 1:1 factor.

If you are more interested in mummification you can use sodium bicarbonate plus salt (an approximation of natron, the substance the egyptians used)<br>  <br>  Otherwise the water in the organs would need to be replaced with alcohol (in gradual steps) and then the alcohol with propylene oxide (or whatever solvent mixes with your embedding resin). The alcohol will also work as a fixative. Particularly for whole organs the whole process might take a while. If your resin doesn't mix with alcohol and you have to use a substance like propylene oxide you will have trouble getting hold of the chemical and rightly so, as it's cancerogenous. If you don't have a fume hood and no experience working with toxic chemicals you might not want to start then. If you are at an university you can check if there is a nice research lab which does histochemistry and which lets you use their chemicals.

Beginning with the Middle Kingdom (2134-1668 BC), Ra worship acquired the status of a state religion, and the god was gradually fused with Amon during the Theban dynasties, becoming the supreme god Amon-Ra. During the 18th Dynasty the pharaoh Amenhotep III renamed the sun god Aton, an ancient term for the physical solar force. Amenhotep's son and successor, Amenhotep IV, instituted a revolution in Egyptian religion by proclaiming Aton the true and only god. He changed his own name to Akhenaton, meaning “Aton is satisfied.” This first great monotheist was so iconoclastic that he had the plural word gods deleted from monuments, and he relentlessly persecuted the priests of Amon. Akhenaton's sun religion failed to survive, although it exerted a great influence on the art and thinking of his time, and Egypt returned to the ancient, labyrinthine religion of polytheism after Akhenaton's death. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freemaninstitute.com/Gallery/religions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freemaninstitute.com/Gallery/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ancient+egyptians+call+the+sun+god&ygmasrchbtn=web+search&fr=ush-ans">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ancient...</a>|`|rh5vbol9aa	Ra and later Ammon-Ra.|`|GsSRY7quaa	Ra|`|w5C0XrNOaa	The ancient Egyptians called their sun god Ra.|`|PoY7vcnQaa	They called him Ra.

Three deputies from North Carolina appeared on the 14th. Peyton Randolph, of Virginia, was chosen president of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, of Pennsylvania, was appointed secretary. Other delegates appeared afterwards, making the whole number fifty - four. Each colony had appointed representatives without any rule as to number, and the grave question at once presented itself, How shall we vote?

XN0cYCATaa	What is Truth ?<br>  <br>  What is truth?" is a very simple question.  Of course, answering it isn't so simple.  We can offer definitions like "Truth is that which conforms to reality, fact, or actuality."  But this basic definition is not complete because its definition is open to interpretation and a wide variety of applications.  What is reality?  What is fact?  What is actuality?  How does perception effect truth?  We could offer answers for each of these questions, but then we could again ask similar questions of those answers.  I am reminded of the paradox of throwing a ball against a wall.  It must get half way there, and then half way of the remaining distance, and then half of that distance, and so on. But, an infinite number of halves in this scenario never constitutes a whole.  Therefore, it would seem that the ball would never reach the wall if we applied the conceptual truths of halves.<br>  <br>  The ball-against-the-wall scenario simply illustrates that defining and redefining things as we try to approach a goal actually prevents us from getting to that goal.  This is what philosophy does sometimes as it seeks to examine truth.  It sometimes clouds issues so much, that nothing can be known for sure.<br>  <br>  But, even though it is true that an infinite number of halves (1/2 of "a" + 1/2 of the remainder + 1/2 of the remainder of that, etc.) does not equal a whole, we can "prove" that it does by simply throwing a ball at a wall and watch it bounce off.  Actually, the "1/2" equation above does not equal a whole -- mathematically.  The problem is not in the truth, but in its application as is often the case with philosophical verbal gymnastics.<br>  <br>  "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ," (Col. 2:8).<br>  <br>  In order for truth to be defined properly, it would have to be a factually and logically correct statement.  In other words, it would have to be true.  But, perhaps we could look further look at truth by determining what it is not.  Truth is not error.  Truth is not self-contradictory.  Truth is not deception.  Of course, it could be true that someone is being deceptive, but the deception itself isn't truth.<br>  <br>  In relativism, all points of view are equally valid and that all truth is relative to the individual.  If this were true, then it would seem that this is the only truth relativism would have to offer.  But, the problem is that in reality, relativism isn't true for the following basic reason.  If what is true for me is that relativism is false, then is it true that relativism is false?  1) If you say no, then what is true for me is not true and relativism is false.  2) If you say yes, then relativism is false.  Relativism seems to defy the very nature of truth; namely, that truth is not self contradictory.<br>  <br>  Again, what is truth?<br>  If there is such a thing as truth, then we should be able to find it.  If truth cannot be known, then it probably doesn't exist.  But, it does exist.  For example, we know that it is true that you are reading this.<br>  <br>  Is there such a thing as something that is always true all the time?  Yes, there is.  For example, "Something cannot bring itself into existence."  This is an absolutely true statement.  In order for something to bring itself into existence, it would have to exist in order to be able to perform an action.  But if it already existed, then it isn't possible to bring itself into existence since it already exists.  Likewise, if it does not exist then it has no ability to perform any creative action since it doesn't exist in the first place.  Therefore, "Something cannot bring itself into existence" is an absolute truth.<br>  <br>  The preceding example is a truth found in logic.  But, there are truths that are not logical by nature.  It is true that I love my wife.  This isn't logically provable via theorems and formulas and logic paradigms, but it is, nevertheless, true.  Therefore, we can say that truth conforms and affirms reality and/or logic.<br>  <br>  Is this what relativism does?  Does relativism confirm to reality and logic?  To be honest, it does to some degree.  Relatively speaking, there is no absolute right or wrong regarding which side of your head you should part your hair, if you part it at all.  To this we must concede relative "truths" that are different for different people.  But, these are relativistic by nature.  Examples of relativistic truths are, 1) people drive on the right side of the street in America and the left in England; 2) I prefer to watch science fiction over musicals; 3) snow is better than rain, etc.  These things are relative to culture, individuals, preferences, etc., and rightfully so.<br>  <br>  If we are to ever hope to determine if there is such a thing as truth apart from cultural and personal preferences, we must acknowledge that we are then aiming to discover something greater than ourselves, so|`|FoIxsunVaa	The ultimate philosophical question is WHY?|`|yOK32PM9aa	It is not universal, but probably the biggest is<br>  <br>  "Why is there anything at all".|`|1tccQF3gaa	for ontology it's "what is being"<br>  for cosmology it "what is the universe" <br>  for ethics it's "what is good"<br>  for epistemology it's "what is knowledge"<br>  <br>  and Metaphysics is a coming together of all the answers - so I suppose the ultimate philosophical question is the request for a persons own metaphysics and the way to ask that is <br>  <br>   "what do you believe?"|`|vGVfe3Gaaa	everything could be a universal philosophy question.<br>  but what about.. <br>  What came before Big Bang?|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Cyberdog has it down....the meaning of life.|`|cGbxP589aa	"Where did energy come from?"|`|w4DoIq3gaa	What is the meaning of life?

W4FtzyDnaa	The short answer is practice, practice, practice. <br>  <br>  The long answer: <br>  While it is a tough skill to acquire, it is not impossible (charicature artists do it all the time). <br>  <br>  It won't come with any secret trick. Practice and experience is the best teacher. That said, here are some tips on how to practice.<br>  <br>  1) try drawing in pen - it helps to free you from the idea that you can just erase mistakes, and forces you to be more "honest" with your sketching<br>  2) try drawing in Sharpie (black marker) - same reason as above, but might be a bit easier.<br>  3) try setting a time limit - The shorter the limit, the better. This forces you to set lines down and leave them, rather than trying to fix them....don't worry about the final outcome/quality of the drawing in this case - just focus on disciplining yourself to set down lines and leave them. You will get better over time. <br>  4) Scribble sketches - these are kind of a fun exercise I like to do. Close your eyes and draw some random scribbles on a piece of paper, then try to use your imagination to create something meaningful out of the random scribbles. Because there's no preset concept of what you're drawing, you feel less compelled to "get things right" by sketching lines over and over. <br>  <br>  <br>  All that said, many artists tend to do a bit of "sketching" as you put it. The difference lies in how you do it. Use freeflowing, sweeping strokes, instead of tight, short ones. Try locking your hand and using your wrist as a pivot for short lines, and locking your hand and wrist and using your elbow as a pivot for longer lines. For straight lines, use a ruler or other straight edge.|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	ive wondered the same thing. But ive found that fear of making a mistake makes me make all those lines. I try to remember sometimes perfection makes art boring and not to worry about technicalities. Just draw.

If God is real, then it is probable, that it will not feel many of our emotions, including sadness, and if God does feel sad, and it is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing) and omnibenevolent (all loving), why doesn't it do something about it, it's all powerful and all knowing after all... <br>  <br>  It's because of the fact there is innocent suffering in this world, therefore god can not be all three things, because if god is all loving, why does it let innocent people die? <br>  <br>  A= all loving B= all knowing C= all powerful<br>  <br>  Line 1: God can be A + B, but cannot be C.<br>  Line 2: God can be B + C, but cannot be A.<br>  Line 3: God can be A + C, but cannot be B.<br>  <br>  Line 1: Meaning God may love us all, and it knows about our suffering, and wants to do something about it, but can't because it isn't powerful enough.<br>  <br>  Line 2: Meaning God Knows about our suffering and has the power to stop it, but it doesn't care about us, and is happy to let us die.<br>  <br>  Line 3: Meaning God loves us all and has the power to end our suffering, but it just doesn't know about it, so it can't.<br>  <br>  And the bible states that God is all three, but this cannot be true, for the fact that i have just explained, it is my belief that there's roughly an 80% chance that God isn't real, however this means that I believe that 20% God could be real. Therefore, in my view God does not feel sadness, because it is not real and that it may not feel sadness, or compassion for us. <br>  <br>  And if there is a God it's blumin unlikely that there's only one, just look at the human race, there isn't just one of us, it's the same for all things, so some God's may feel something close to sadness but others may not....|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	His children can grieve Him in their sin and lack of faith.

For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves". (Jesus' Words in John 7:24; Luke 7:43, 12:57 and Matt. 23:15)<br>  <br>  There is an extremely serious error that is being believed by the vast majority of people caught up in christian religion. This error is literally making those folks unwilling and unable to discern truth. And what is this error? It is believing that all "judgment" is wrong. If this is true, then what is to be made of Jesus' Words above? In the verses above, Jesus clearly commands people to judge, commends people for judging, and judges himself.<br>  <br>  The key point to understand is that not all judgment is wrong, just various types of judgment. The types of judgment that are wrong according to Jesus are condemnation, as well as hypocritical and self-righteous judgment. On the other hand, right judgment is commended by Jesus as we see above. Right judgment includes the judging of truth versus falsehood.

oHO0XOQVaa	I personally like using acrylic and oil paint on canvas most. You can use whatever you want to use, brush, palette knife, forks, spoons. Acrylic dries fast (10 minutes to an hour or more depending on how thick you apply it) and oil dries slowly but it's easier to blend because of that. So acrylic is best for hard edges and filled in solid shapes and oil is best for blendy stuff. You can water down acrylic to blend with it though.<br>  Paint whatever you want, there's so many different types of paintings showing so many different techniques out there you just have to look for yourself.|`|afc818594423abb198b9222afe9865c9aa	I would suggest acrylics if you are just starting out. It would be a good idea to study books on the medium of your choice. I learned to oil paint with library and bookstore art books and magazines. Study books on well known abstract artists and you may be surprised to know most started out as traditional painters. Just be careful of jumping into abstract simply because it appears the easiest thing to do. My brother is an abstract artist but will (on occasion) also do traditional works. He started straight out as an abstract artist, painting just for fun and as he puts it, abstract will remain his passion, his traditional works have given his abstracts and himself as an artist the respectability and credibility many artists seek.

c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	Steam powered ships are fine, but the really neat trick was the ability to record longditude.  In order to achieve this you needed a really accurate clock that was resilient enough to withstand the rigors of sea.  Now that you had both latitude and longditude you could sail directly to your destination, rather than using guestimates and visual observations.  You could also make viable maps.  <br>  <br>  Steem ships were, for the most part, costal craft.  Even by WW2, a ship would need to be re-supplied regularly and would opperate within a specific area, wheras a sailing craft could sustain a voyage without large amounts of coal.<br>  <br>  After iron ships became more popular, the traditional magnetic compas became compromised.  Science again came to the rescue, in that a device, or housing, using magnets, was created to counteract the effects of this disturbance.<br>  <br>  Diet and medicine also expanded.  The British sailors became known as limeys, since they would eat limes in order to stave off the effects of scurvey.  Also, medicines such as quinine, being the reason that G and T became pupular with colonists, meant that collonies which would normally have been ravaged my malaria, were able to gain a foothold and prosper.<br>  <br>  The Machine gun.  This is credited with keeping the British in Africa for an additional 50 years.  Quite a useful tool for quelling native unrest.<br>  <br>  The steam engine plays its part, but rather than just in boats, it also enabled colonial expansion via railway.  Thats what Rhodes was up to in Rhodesia.  India still uses many trains that would not look out of place in the 1900s.<br>  <br>  There is more, but it is basically a history lesson of the industrial revolution.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|Lq5Up23Faa	Steam powered ships did not take the seas over until the 19th century thus propelling the British expansion over the colonies. In earlier times, new scientific discoveries prompted a review of knowledge in geography that benefited nautical development.<br>  Indirectly, an absolute faith in scientific progress and reason -the Age of Reason- which gave unprecedented impulse to scientific enquiry and new inventions brought the conviction that the man had the right to exert total dominion on nature as well as an ethnocentric vision that fostered the colonisation of "primitive" societies.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Advances in science and technology made Britain the pioneer of steam power and using steam powered ships as opposed to sailing ships greatly increased their ability to spread their influence throughout the world but that didn't occur until the nineteenth century.

gje8bfFgaa	First up, big props to you for choosing to do a project on the much maligned Tracey Emin. I think she's amazing too.<br>  <br>  The obvious place to go for Tracey Emin's work, and for work by the YBAs in general, is the Charles Saatchi gallery in Chelsea. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/visitor/visitor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/visitor...</a><br>  <br>  You're also quite right to think she has work on display in the White Cube. Here's a link: <a href="http://www.whitecube.com/artists/emin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitecube.com/artists/emin/</a><br>  <br>  Emin's a very important artist. I'm sure if you go to either of these galleries you'll find at least some of her work on permanent display. If not, then they probably have some of her work in storage. If that's the case than I suggest phoning the galleries, saying you're an art student and asking if you can book an appointment to be shown her work. I'm a History of Art graduate myself and can promise you that that works more often than you'd think, especially if you have a letter from your teacher to back you up. Good luck with your GCSEs!

There is a program that can make slight changes in blur caused by camera movement, but that depends upon the camera only moving in one direction and no subject movement at all.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a tutorial that may help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://photoshoptips.net/2006/03/09/smart-sharpen/" rel="nofollow">http://photoshoptips.net/2006/03/09/smar...</a>|`|0LgpcOBDaa	Nope...<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson<br>  <br>  PS - the stuff you see on CSI and such..?

P1alfkrJaa	Humans have free will and those free wills are going to eventually come into conflict with each other. Throw in religion, where you have people claiming Absolute Truth on their side, and you have even greater conflict because those involved feel they have more to lose/gain. Our individual egos are at war with themselves and, at the same time, with others who do not share our individual vision. And since no one can completely share another's vision of what life means/should mean there will always be conflict. What's the point of the whole thing? That is an excellent question. I don't know. I like writing and drinking beer with friends and leaving everyone else the hell alone to do whatever they feel like doing and I hope they do the same for me. In my own life I've found that it's the love you put into anything you do that gives meaning to life and being grateful for every small thing.

gsTpQmGfaa	I think it is the ability to be able to make yourself believe anything, and if you don't believe it, it is your choice. We are existence expressing itself, I believe. We always see evolution taking place, the spirit finds a body as a way of expressing itself, it always was and always will be, you are an expression of infinity experiencing itself through the flesh, I believe. If you choose to not exist, it cannot be done as there is no such thing... So what is death? Hard to say but I think there is no true death. If we cling to the earthly world and posessions, maybe even certain types of people, it is possible that we may become ghosts, shadows of our former selves.<br>  Belief is a choice, and there are an infinite amount of things to believe, but love is your guide.<br>  This is my belief, you can choose to make your own.|`|FoIxsunVaa	infinity is a mathematical concept.

uGmEjSLDaa	If you have the same taste as I did as an 18-year-old (and still do to some extent, although I've become a bit more well-rounded), a bunch of solipsistic poets that lots of teenagers will identify with:<br>  <br>  Philip Larkin--try 'This Be the Verse,' if you want a poem that sticks in your head for all the wrong (and right) reasons!<br>  <br>  Walt Whitman--Probably the one American poet whom absolutely everyone should read, because he's about as intrinsically American as it gets. I'm particularly fond of 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking' for the meter and the rhythm of it.<br>  <br>  Ezra Pound--Weird, experimental, brilliant, and obsessed with the East.<br>  <br>  e e cummings--Start with 'i sing of olaf glad and big,' and see if you can figure out what's going on there. Note: R-rated!<br>  <br>  Andrew Marvell--My favorite pre-1800s poet, because he takes normal English countryside settings and turns them into weird, twisting worlds of too-lush greenery and almost science fiction settings.<br>  <br>  Out of these, Whitman is probably the most inspiring in traditional terms, and Larkin the least (he was a bitter fellow)!<br>  <br>  Other favorites: Yeats, Keats, Byron, Coleridge, (not Whitman, never got into him), Hardy (a better poet than a novelist), Wilfred Owen, George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, Neruda, Kenneth Patchen.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	On 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot and killed while having his nightly public walk on the grounds of the Birla Bhavan (Birla House) in New Delhi. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, was a Hindu radical with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan. Godse and his co-conspirator Narayan Apte were later tried and convicted; they were executed on 15 November 1949. Gandhi's memorial (or Samādhi) at Rāj Ghāt, New Delhi, bears the epigraph "Hē Ram", (Devanagari: ?? ! ??? or, He Rām), which may be translated as "Oh God". These are widely believed to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot, though the veracity of this statement has been disputed.|`|LvELjQ2saa	i'm not sure on the name, i'd say the guy above is probably right on with the name.  but why gandhi was killed?  it's simple, nobody likes people that have a positive impact on the world.  it just shows the cruelty in the world, and its quite sick.

The British and Americans caused the Nazis to fight a two front war, wich was the cause of the Nazis loosing the war.<br>  Hitler himself said somthing like, a two front war would only lead to defeat befor he started WW2.<br>  <br>  Britian made it so the Americans could attack the Nazis a lot more effectavly and quiker then they could have without the British, it also help them fight many battles, Britian had also weaken the Nazis by fighting them for so long. Had the British not been there to help. The Nazis may of defeated the Russians to the east, then would have been able to defeat the American attack on the west.

There is no limit to the tragedies a single person can face, be it death or loss of important things.  And sometimes it's so bad that you feel like you are losing pieces of your soul. <br>  Remember that the 'why' of your situation is not important.  Focus on the 'how'.  I don't think it matters whether God will only give you what you can handle, just recognize that whatever is present in your life right now can be fought through.  I know it sounds impossible, but start slow, have an unwavering faith in Yourself, and you will find that strength where you think there is weakness.<br>  <br>  Out of control means you haven't yet decided to move forward.|`|LHbdPdg3aa	It's so weird you asked this question because it's something that's been on my mind for awhile these past few months. Well, I guess it only means that there is always a bright side in the future and the wait is worth it because you are supposed to experience it. There are lots of tragedies where a person might commit suicide, only they should have waited a little longer because, I don't know, they would have won the lottery in a couple more days. As for pushing through that tough stuff....I only know from my own experience is that my faith in a higher power allows me to be able to handle what I go through. That is where the "faith" comes into religion. You have to be able to turn to Him or else you would end up taking on too much for yourself. It's sort of a test to see if you really believe or you don't and just fall lower. I mean, you need your friends and family around you...but sometimes they are not there. That's when it matters. Just my personal take on it.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	That whole God giving you what you can handle is crap! (not only because I am atheist) Think about it. If there were an all knowing entity hovering above us, who created us, do you think he'd let us suffer--at all? If we are made in It's image, then we would be as God is emotionally too. Mothers and Fathers can be super protective. (Especially mothers....) So, I would think if there were a God, this would be paradise, just because It created us and wouldn't want us damaged or hurt. I don't care how many times ANYONE tells you pain builds character. That's a crock. Living by ordinary means builds character. A few challenges here and there that make you think, builds character. Blinding adversity does NOT build character...It pisses you off, makes you mean and makes you not want to be here.... <br>  <br>  With that said... I have to say to answer your other questions on how to work out blow after blow.... You take it one single day at a time. Make it through this day, then tomorrow... Keep pulling it out as long as you can. Loss of freedom usually happens because someone is manually held down by another human OR because someone is trapped in a situation that is temporary.

In these moments we need to strengthen our connection to God. We need to pray more and to get strength from His Word.

An absolute faith in knowledge, reason and scientific progress enabled the human being to relieve himself from the yoke of religion, partly, but made him also think of himself as equal to God, hence the possibility to create life as from Victor Frankenstein's perspective. This display of "arrogance" and lack of fear to God results in tragedy and abomination when the creature is cruelly cut off from any kind of affection, generosity and guidance and decides to take revenge against his creator. Just as Victor revealed himself against God by creating life and just as the human being has revealed against his creator throughout history. The novel also hints that the human being is good by nature but when he is pushed to extreme circumstances or when he is ignored, rejected and cut off from social life and its restrictive rules turns to evilness. <br>   The narrative pattern is somewhat complex. We read the story through a letter by Captain Walton to her sister in which the Captain retells the story of Frankenstein. There are many narrative voices because every now and then the creature and Frankenstein narrate their own experiences. However all stories are framed in the sister's letter.|`|07a9175e70bfbce430435ca0734fb799aa	You could get cliff notes for this book and maybe in your native language too. Don't wait so long to get help next time. Call a book store and ask them if they have cliff notes for this book. Cliff notes are a brand of books that summarize classic novels. There are a lot of books summarized. Frankenstein is really hard to understand, I've read it and personally I think it sucks. Dracula by Bram Stoker is much better.|`|AA11610054	Do NOT go out and rent the movie.  It's nothing like the book.<br>  <br>  In the short space I have to answer your question, I'll give you a basic premise.<br>  <br>  Dr. Frankenstein created a creature by reanimating dead flesh.  This creature was not a monster, until the townspeople's fear and prejudice made him one.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|NV6q8hQpaa	basically the book is about a crazy scientist who wants to create new life by taking body parts and sticking them together
SFxQyTfJaa	ok ^^<br>  think realistic honey: <br>  if you say "oh, I want to find someone as perfect as Edward Cullen because only he's perfect enough for me"<br>  it's the same for a girl as if a guy says "oh, I want to find someone as perfect as Heidi Klum because only she's perfect enough for me. No other normal nice girl, no. I just want someone as perfect as Heidi Klum. Bah!!"<br>  would you date such a guy?<br>  -.- I guess no<br>  <br>  hear this. maybe you'll think about something else then Edward:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3gGQfyVyw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3gGQfyV...</a><br>  ^ I love that song<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9u3c65LHIY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9u3c65LH...</a><br>  ^this song is just soooo cute<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1qVWpO-t8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1qVWpO-...</a><br>  ^I always try to sing with it but I just don't manage xD<br>  <br>  edit: Ive copied you an answer to the question "would you want Edward to bve real?"<br>  hope this helps...<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Uh ...... no.<br>  <br>  First of all, he's undead.<br>  <br>  And honestly, do you really want a guy who controls your every move and never wants to leave you out of his sight? To the point of taking the engine out of your car? He's not sweet, or caring, or loving. He's jealous, controlling, and manipulative.<br>  <br>  The guy is a stalker. If someone in real life stood outside your window and watched you sleep, you'd call the cops.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, why is a 100-year-old vampire interested in a plain 17-year-old girl? Can we say "pedophilia," boys and girls?<br>  <br>  Oh, I know, I know. He Sparkles. And he just wants to cuddle. Yes, I know. And therein lies the fascination. But trust me, you would NOT want this guy to be real.<br>  <br>  It scares me how many young girls think this is some kind of "ideal" man. I know most of them are young and have never been in a real relationship, so they have no point of reference. But Edward is the poster boy for abusive, controlling relationships. He only seems so wonderful because young girls identify with how awkward Bella feels and would love for some guy to swoop in, fawn over them, and tell them how special they are. It just shows that they have a lot to learn about relationships. I'm ashamed of Stephenie Meyer for telling impressionable young ladies that this is their "ideal" man, because it just confuses them and sets them up for disappointment in the real world.<br>  ______________________________________...|`|LvywvZSeaa	Ok, umm...where do I start?<br>  HE'S NOT REAL. He is a MADE UP character. He was "created" in someone's mind (a woman, who most likely WISHES there was someone out there like him). But there's not. Robert Pattinson is an actor...he "acts" like Edward's CHARACTER. He's just guy like every other guy out there. Get it?|`|YMzRBzZAaa	I use to be the same way. I screamed when I saw a poster of him in walmart. The only difference is that I went to a christian skewl and I was teh first to read it. That mess spread faster than idk what.

Oh and when you feel an edward related topic coming out of yr mouth just try and change the topic or answer the question diferently.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I have NEVER heard of so many people getting so completely obsessed over a book that they completely lose sight of reality, yet every single day you can come in here and read about how the Mrs. Cullen fanatics simply can't live without their fictional Sparkly hero. What the heck is it about this series? Did they spray the pages with crack or something?<br>  <br>  Seriously, you need to get a grip. He's a FICTIONAL CHARACTER, and not a very likeable one at that. "I just want to find someone as perfect as Edward," you say. No, you don't. He's not "perfect." He's a stalker. He's abusive. He's controlling. He's jealous. He's manipulative. He's 100 years old, and yet he's fawning over a plain, clumsy 17-year-old girl. How this makes him "perfect" in the eyes of so many people is beyond my wildest imagination to comprehend. <br>  <br>  Oh, I know. He Sparkles. And that somehow makes all the difference. Pardon me while I retch.<br>  <br>  What's the cure? I have no idea. Get out and breathe some fresh air. Turn on the TV. Listen to some good music. Spend time with non-obsessed friends. Better yet, read some literature with good characters and an actual storyline. You'll wonder what you ever saw in this series once you get your hands on an author who actually knows how to write.|`|FT7rLZ0daa	They are planning to have Edward be a homosexual in the next book just so you know.Not that that's a bad thing, homosexuals are normal people.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Wow...you're in love with a storybook character...interesting...that sounds kind of odd, and saying you're not a weirdo, tends to backfire on people...|`|2QiLmXfhaa	Lo.<br>  You think 3 months is how long yr gonna get over it? <br>  I read all the books a YEAR ago and I loved them N then when the film came out it got even more cos more of my mates got into it. <br>  Lol. <br>  I have the same condition darling.  :o)<br>  Its cos Stephanie Meyer writes up the most PERFECT person.<br>  It makes us wish that there were people like Edward, but because he's so perfect it makes it impossible.<br>  <br>  *Sighs*               Stupid Twilight books. :ol.

With that I think those people try to hard.<br>  But still my mom told me I might need to talk to a professional. HAHA I know. But I don't want to so I talk to my closest friend Isabelle and Trisha about it. They make jokes about me being Mental. But I think I might be. [At least for Twilight is all.]<br>  Not like totally crazy kind of Mental.|`|jmEv4XBWaa	Omg i know it sounds cheesy but I KNOW EXACTLY what you mean. That's exactly the way I felt after watching the film and I felt like crying at the end of the film because he's not real and there's no-one like him. <br>  I think that it hit me so hard because I fell truly in Love with some-one in my year at school and we started going out and I felt sure that it was going to last because it was Truly Madly Deeply in Love with him. but then a month later he dumped me and i found out that 2 weeks before he broke up with me, he snogged a total Slut in the year below us. <br>  <br>  But back to Twilight, i think that'll you'll get over him sooner or later because I went through a total EDWARD CULLEN stage when I had read the book and watched the film and now I don't think about him.. that much (:<br>  <br>  This probably didn't help, sorry !! ):<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|wq2QfVI3aa	omg i used to be like that :) for like two weeks i wandered around in a daze because i didnt know how i was suppost to get over twilight, and i started to love it more and more until finnaly i told myself thats enough and i picked up another book and started to read it. Seriosly it helped! <br>  <br>  Im 15 btw lol and i do still love edward but i know he is a fictional character, and its nice to just dream about him sometimes with my mouth hanging open but thats about it, i started reading twilight last summer and for that summer and for ages i just loved them, but since then i have read loads of other amazing books and watched other films and even wrote some stories too. <br>  <br>  You just gotta find another thing that will take your mind off of it, not something that you think is boring, because after twilight i thought "no other book is good enough for me!" but then i found another book that was just as amazing, just was wonderful and i loved it and then i found another and another and all my favourite books are on a shelf and of course twilight is still centre stage but im just saying that twilight isnt the only book in the world. <br>  <br>  seriosly i know how you feel and i dont think your crazy - i mean i know several people who love edward too lol (my best friend for egsample, we got into an argument because i said edward was mine and she could have emmet and she hit me haha) but you can still love him but love other books and characters too, you just gotta find them :) one of my favourite books is Lucas by Keven Brooks, its so wonderful and very different from twilight, but its kind of a good thing :) just read loads of other books and see what you think after a while. i hope i helped :) x|`|1Rxcqggoaa	Uhmmm, well Edward isn't real.

Get over yourself.|`|bnE7eUzJaa	ooo, your the most popular girl in your year, pfft|`|DFkoruA6aa	Read a different book. I recommend something from the Vampire Chronicles if that's your thing, or perhaps Dickens. Great Expectations has a few things in common. Vary your literary experience a bit. <br>  <br>  Also, take a look at some of the things the character actually does in that story. Breaking into someone's room to watch them sleep is not an acceptable way to display affection. It's stalking. Disabling someone's truck to keep them from leaving is also, similarly, unacceptable. It's controling and abusive. The fact that this is glamorized and has so many teenage girls responding in the same way as our asker makes me worry for the young women of the world.<br>  <br>  I don't blame her for her interpretations and responses. I've heard from many hundreds otherwise intelligent and well spoken women who feel similarly. One of these was about twenty minutes ago. <br>  <br>  My advice? Put the books down. Go spend some time with flesh and blood humanity for a while. Learn a little more about who you are and the kind of people you enjoy associating with. You're young yet. Don't let one book (series?) become the yard-stick against which you measure all other men.|`|clsTSNkEaa	I get what yuur going through but yuu just need to know yuur judging Robert is not Edward he is pretending to be him really if yuu think about it if yuu knew Robert and saw he was nothing lyk Edward yuu wouldn't lyk him but....yuu will get over this me and my friend were obbsessed maybe not as much as yuu are but we lyked twilight before everyone knew about it but as soon as everyone started going on about how they imagined marrying Robert i just told them they needed a life and it really opens yuur eyes to teh fact these girls have a problem.

You should read some real literature about proper romance, try Pride & Prejudice. Yeah, Robert Pattison is hot, but Edward Cullen is nothing but a figment of some Mormon author's imagination. There are plenty of other good-looking, intelligent guys out there- sitting around moping about a fictional character won't be doing anything for you or your parents.

The film is quite a bit different to the stage version.  If I remember, the stage version is brilliant.  It brings home to you the number of young men who gave their lives for their country.

In the 18th c., which is when Rousseau lived, that became "a philosopher", i.e. a friend of wisdom and knowledge (although we know that wisdom and knowldegde are two different entities).<br>  That is why Rousseau is considered a philopsopher.  He was a good writer and he wrote his ideas.  He wrote a book like St. Augustine, of which the title was "Confessions".  To me, that is the extent of Rousseau as a philosopher.  He gave his opinion on God, on society, on this, on that.  But Rousseau, although he has influenced the people at his time, is not a great philosopher who can influences his posterity like Descartes or Aristotle, or Pascal.  No.  At least that is my point of view.

I, however, believe his enduring legacy is his style of writing. The sparseness and precision with which he wrote still influences writers today. I used to teach College Writing and I found it fascinating how quickly students picked up Hemingway's style after reading only a few of his stories. His style influenced writers like Chandler and Hammet, and created the whole `hard boiled detective' genre through them. More young people have started off to Paris and adventures in Europe after reading his The Sun Also Rises than any other novel.

Their instructors are absolutely amazing, the camp setting is beautiful and serene, and the ppl who go there are unbelievably talented. They have two three-week sessions every summer, and you can go to one or both. I went to the three-week session every summer for three years (only for dance once, though; the others were for art & music) and loved it and wished I could have stayed longer. You have to apply to the camp, and it is very competitive, but you should honestly just give it a shot because you could get in, and if you do, I promise you'll love it. <br>  <br>  Other suggestions:<br>  Stagedoor Manor; It's the camp the movie "Camp" was based on. <br>  <br>  Idyllwild also has a great summer camp, but it's in California so I don't know if that's too far for you. <br>  <br>  North Carolina School of the Arts Summer Camp<br>  <br>  There are a few guides to summer camps online, like Peterson's and the American Camp Association's, and you can search by interest there. <br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )

pI5jKfmaaa	Aristophanes<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  <br>   <br>  Aristophanes as imagined by a nineteenth century illustrator. It can be inferred from jests in his plays The Clouds and Peace that he was prematurely bald.[1]Aristophanes (?ριστοφ?νη?, ca. 446 – ca. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Cydathenaus,[2] was a prolific and much acclaimed comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays have come down to us virtually complete. These, as well as fragments of some of his other plays, provide us with the only real example we have of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy and they are in fact used to define the genre.[3] Also known as the Father of Comedy and the Prince of Ancient Comedy,[4] Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author.[5] His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries - Plato[6][7] singled out Aristophanes' play The Clouds as slander contributing to the trial and execution of Socrates although other satirical playwrights[8] had caricatured the philosopher.The demagogue Cleon once prosecuted Aristophanes for slandering the Athenian polis with his second play The Babylonians (now lost). Details of his trial and punishment are not recorded but Aristophanes replied with merciless caricatures of Cleon in his subsequent plays, especially The Knights.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophane...</a>
6uSUp7V3aa	Aeschylus (pronounced /??sk?l?s/ or /?i?sk?l?s/, Greek: Α?σχ?λο?, Aiskhylos, c. 525 BC/524 BC – c. 456 BC/455 BC) was an ancient Greek playwright. He is often recognized as the father or the founder of tragedy, and is the earliest of the three Greek tragedians whose plays survive extant, the others being Sophocles and Euripides. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in plays to allow for conflict among them; previously, characters interacted only with the chorus. Unfortunately, only seven of an estimated 70 plays by Aeschylus have survived into modern times; one of these plays, the Prometheus Bound, is sometimes thought not to be the work of Aeschylus.<br>  <br>  At least one of Aeschylus' works was influenced by the Persian invasion of Greece, which took place during his lifetime. His play The Persians remains a good primary source of information about this period in Greek history. The war was so important to Greeks and to Aeschylus himself that, upon his death around 456 BC, his epitaph included a reference to his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon but not to his success as a playwright.

pI5jKfmaaa	Previous (Anaxagoras)Next (Anaximenes of Miletus)<br>  Anaximander (Greek: Αναξ?μανδρο?) (c. 609 – 547 B.C.E.) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, the second of the philosophers of Ionia (the first being Thales and the third Anaximenes). He was a citizen of Miletus, a student of Thales, and the teacher of Anaximenes.<br>  <br>  Thales, the first philosopher in Western philosophy, according to Aristotle, inquired into the unchanging principle of being that can uniformly explain all phenomena and identified it with “water.” This was an innovative form of inquiry in a society where Greek mythology was the primary framework of interpretation.<br>  <br>  Anaximander followed the path of his teacher Thales and similarly inquired into the ultimate principles. While Thales identified the ultimate being as the extension of a particular element in nature (water), Anaximander attempted to find a more universal principle of being. In his view, if a particular element in nature, such as water, is the origin, a being with contrary nature, such as fire, cannot emerge or co-exist. The origin must be universal and free from any particular characteristics. Anaximander identified the ultimate with the “indefinite” or “unbounded” (apeiron).<br>  <br>  By “indefinite,” Anaximander meant the original matter out of which all beings in nature originate. Anaximander characterized the “indefinite” to be divine and imperishable. Within the framework of an ontology of form and matter, Aristotle interpreted Anaximander as a predecessor who inquired into the material cause of being.<br>  <br>  Anaximander further introduced the principle of diversification or individuation separately from the origin of being. The “indefinite” is diversified by the principle of dual characteristics of hot and cold, and wet and dry and these phenomena in nature are governed by the principle of balance (Diels and Kranz 12A9). Although Anaximander did not explicitly conceptualize the principle of dual characteristics, it exists in his thought in an incipient form. This idea is somehow similar to that of the principle of Yin and Yang in ancient Chinese thought.<br>  <br>  Anaximander cultivated the path of truth his teacher Thales had opened up by extending the level of abstraction to a remarkable degree. Anaximander also seems to have had a broad knowledge in diverse areas of the sciences.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Anaximander" rel="nofollow">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entr...</a>

Also, you will need the crimping tool to cut the coil to size and to help keep the spiral on. The coils themselves are fairly cheap, and I only included the link for the lowest cost punch, but more expensive models with more features are available on the website as well.<br>  <br>  Unless you will be marking the pages (like with a dry erase marker or china pencil) to erase and reuse, you might find that laminating the pages is more costly than it is worth.  If you are looking for something that is more durable and "tear-proof", look for poly paper (<a href="http://www.graytex.com/tearproof-paper.htm)." rel="nofollow">http://www.graytex.com/tearproof-paper.h...</a> This will be tough a durable and will reduce the amount of work you will need to do. Make sure to get a size and thickness that will work with the printer you intend to use.<br>  <br>  As far as the covers, you won't be able to go too thick with the stock, since you won't be able to punch something very thick or very hard. As far as the printing, you might use full sheet label stock and print the desired image then apply it to the cover stock of your choice. Or you can print the image directly on a thicker weight of paper if your printer can handle that. <br>  <br>  The laminating and binding itself is fairly easy, even with the lowest level equipment above. The covers will be more time consuming.<br>  <br>  You should be able to find label stock, heavier weight paper and lamination pouches at any office supply store. You can also usually find plastic combs (instead of the coils) at an office supply store. I recommend looking for a paper wholesaler in your area that also deals with the public (one in my are is called Kelly Paper). They stock a wide range of paper and printer supplies and might even be able to suggest a few options for your covers as well as your inside pages. You will probably have to speical order the binding machine and possibly the laminator, although those are often available at office supply stores or hobby shops. <br>  <br>  If you have any more questions about this project that maybe I didn't cover, please e-mail me - I work in a print center and do projects like this quite often. I hope this information helped.|`|XgH9uuv9aa	I would use plastic comb binding and laminated front covers, you can buy both a comb binder and laminator, they are not hugely expensive. If you use plastic instead of wire you can have nice colors, if you use a laminator you can print a cool design and have it look professional under a plastic laminate. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Tip- if you use a laminator print on good quality paper.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you are in the USA but here's an example of a plastic binder for $46<br>  <br>  and a laminator like this one one Ebay|`|ANEdyayCaa	I don't know anything about book binding but you can watch these videos about book binding.

DNCmoJsiaa	Did you write this because of something that happened in your life?  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but the poem is not really that good.  First correct your spelling.  Poetic License has its place, but mixing homophones is just wrong.<br>  <br>  Next you need to work on your form.  You start with a rhyme pattern but end with no pattern.  Either use a rhyme pattern or don't, but don't switch half way through the poem.<br>  <br>  Then you need to work on syallables in each line.  Generally, each line should contain about the same number of syallables.<br>  <br>  I suggest you study the wording of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" which is a perfectly constructed poem.|`|b188dffc272fc0cae0706fb1e108d2cbaa	no...step away from the pen slowly|`|VHsD8KzXaa	the message behind it is good and it rymes but the if you were to read it aloud it doesnt flow as well as it should. sylabols n stuff. gud work|`|NpiAaCMyaa	How awful... the poem, that is.<br>  And your spelling. <br>  I would do yourself a favor and just stop.|`|Xl7Hak1Zaa	Great
Sl0UPcheaa	I think it is good but too easy. What makes a good poem is vagueness and ambiguity. This leaves room for everyone to interpret it for themselves how they want to. Yours is very cut and dry and we all know exactly what you are talking about. Its more of a diary entry than a poem. Use some metaphors or some other figures of speech. Make the reader have to really think about what you are trying to say.

P02L0DTNaa	Pharaoh Burgers with large Ramses fries and a diet Nefertiti cola.<br>  <br>  On feast day that would order out a large King Tut pizza with the works and wash it down with Pyramid beers. <br>  <br>  How did they eat them? Just like we do today with our hands.|`|NYU37jfGaa	In Th eBritish Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt it says:<br>  <br>  'The poorest people in ancient Egypt seems to have subsisted on bread, beer, and a few vegetables, notably onions; according to Herodotus it was with these very commodities that the builders of the Great Pyramid were paid.<br>  <br>  Bread was made from emmer-wheat, which was laboriously ground on an arrangement of stones known as a saddle quern, prelaced in Ptolemaic and Roman times by the more efficient rotary quern.  Numerous types of loaf were produced, and some of these were made in  moulds, espeically if they were intended for ritual use rather than everyday consumption. <br>  <br>  Beer was usually made from barley, and seems to have been a thick, soupy liquid, which although not always strongly alcaholic was nutritious.  Beer was also sometimes sweetened with dates or flavored with other fruits.<br>  <br>  The texts on ostraca excavated at the workmen's village of Deir-el-Medina indicate that the workers payment took the form of food rations.  The list of rations gives some idea of the foodstuffs commonly available in the New Kingdom.  Emmer and barley were the most prized items, since they were part of the staple diet.  Beans, onions, garlic, lettuces and cucumbers were among the most regularly supplied of vegetables, but salted fish also formed an important  part of the villagers' diet.  Meat was usually provided in the form of complete cattle from the temple stock-yards, or simply as individual portions.  Outside Deir-el-Medina, meat would have been regarded as a considerable luxutry for most Egyptians, something to be eaten primarily at festivals or on other special occasions.<br>  <br>  The wealthy would have eaten oxen, and the evidence from the mIddle Kingdom as well as the New Kingdom shows that pigs were raised for their meat.  Hares, gazelles, and other wild animals would have been provided a supplement to the diet of poorer people, as well as providing hunting quarry for the elite.<br>  <br>  Animals were also used as a source of fat, and in order to provide milk for cheese making.  Ducks, and, from the New Kingdom onwards, hens were kept for eggs and meat, and wildfowl were hunted for sport and food.<br>  <br>  Various fruits, such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, dom-palm nuts and, more rarely, almonds, were available both to the inhabitants of Deir-el-Medina and to the population at large.  Grapes were also used in the making of wine, and there are numerous tomb scenes of vintners at work.  Wine, however, appear to have been generally consumed by the wealthier groups in Egyptian society.<br>  <br>  Honey was obtained both from wild and domesticated bees, and in the absence of sugar, it was used to transform bread into cakes and to sweeten beer.  At Deir-el-Medina it is recorded that confectioners were employed to prepare honey-cakes for the gangs of workmen.'<br>  <br>  In 'Life in Ancient Egypt', Eugen Strouhal writes:<br>  <br>  'Like the daily menu, so the frequency and manner of serving meals differed according to social position.  Ordinary people ate twice a day, at sunrise and at dusk, with only the odd snack during the day.  Richer folk sat down to an afternoon meal as well.  Poor families ate squatting at a low round table, taking their food from common bowls with theri hands or with chunks of bread.  Before and after eating, they poured water over each other's hands, and sometimes rinsed their mouths out.  <br>  <br>  Things were very different in patrician houses, especially at the luxurious banquets depicted on tomb walls.  Guests sat on their own mats or stools with little round tables in front of them decorated with flowers, and with their own crockery.  Even in these circles, however, there was no cutlery.  Servants poured water over the guests' hands, sometimes before the meal but chiefly afterwards, brought choice dishes to their tables, served them jugs of fine wine, an, in between,sprayed them with perfume and put cones of ointment on their heads.  The diners, afer eating and sometimes before as well, would wash out their mouths with waer containing a little natron by way of disinfectant.  Meanwhile musicians, male and female, and women singers maintaned a festive atmosphere, and young girls, virtually naked, danced for the company.'|`|pI5jKfmaaa	WHAT EGYPTIANS EAT<br>  People ate pigeons, cranes, teal, geese, and duck. Teal is a freshwater duck that is found in America, Europe, and Asia. They also ate bread, beans, onions, and green vegetables. The Egyptians enjoyed beef the most. They did not eat that much beef because it was very expensive, because cattle needed fields of grass to eat, and that took up precious land. People ate lots of fish because they were cheap. They also ate fruit. They also bought their food at the local market. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  WHO COOKED THE MEALS AND WHERE THEY COOKED THEIR MEALS<br>  Wealthy Egyptians got their servants to cook the food and serve the meals. The poor would cook the meals themselves. They usually cooked meals at the back of the house in the outdoors. They did that to keep smoke and odors out. Other poor people who had only one small room cooked over a fire made in a hole in the floor of the room. <br>  <br>  <br>  KITCHEN EQUIPMENT<br>  Some of the kitchen equipment included a storage bowl, fruit basket ,drinking cups ,and a wine jar . The jar’s pointed base was put in a stand. <br>  <br>  TRADITION AT MEALS<br>  Wealthy Egyptians had servants to serve meals . At large meals hosts and important guests sat on low chairs. Others used cushions or mats. Servants brought in courses one by one and put them on small tables beside diners , dishes of meat and more. People ate with their fingers and rinsed their hands in water between courses.   <br>  <br>  <br>  HOW TO SLAUGHTER AN ANIMAL<br>  In Egypt you needed to know how to slaughter an animal. Butchers in the town would do this for you. Animal’s legs were roped together then pulled to the side then it is pulled onto the its side to be killed. <br>  <br>  BREAD MAKING<br>  They made flour by grinding grain to a powder, by pushing it back and forth between two stones. The grinding was easier if you added a little grit to it. Grit is a small, rough granule, as of sand or stone. Then they mixed the flour with some water to form the dough. Then they added some honey to the mixture if they wanted to make sweet bread. Then they shaped the dough into loaves. Then they baked them. The loaves were baked in an oven if they had one. If not , they would cook the dough in pots stacked over a fire. <br>  <br>  HOW TO MAKE BEER<br>  First they crumbled a half cooked barley bread into a vat. A vat is a large container used for liquids. Then they added sweetened water with some dates. Then it would soon ferment. Ferment means a chemical change takes place that makes the sugar in it turn into alcohol. They expected the liquid to be very lumpy. Then they strained it into jars. Then they sealed the tops of the jars firmly with clay. They stored the jars in a cool place. The beer would be thick so they needed to strain it again. Some of the Egyptians drank straight from the jar through a drinking tube. <br>  <br>  MAKING WINE<br>  Grapes were put in a big long narrow container for holding food. Then the Egyptians would get into the long narrow container and they would step on the grapes so the juice would come out. Then the juice was poured into some jars to ferment. To ferment means that the grapes went through a chemical change. <br>  <br>  PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT<br>  Egypt as you probably know is a desert which means there is very little grass. Because of that there was no food for the cows. Since there were very few cows the beef was very expensive in Egypt. The Egyptian’s favorite food was beef but they didn’t eat it a lot because of it’s price. The Egyptians drank a lot of wine, and ate figs. The grapes you use to make wine needed a hot and dry climate. So do the figs they ate. So they were both grown in Egypt because of it’s temperature. The birds in Egypt were forced to eat a lot to make them fat. This meant that there would be more meat for the Egyptians to eat. The Egyptians also lived by a river called the Nile River. That helped them a lot because they could catch the fish, one of the main things they ate. The Egyptians also used the water from the Nile River to grow their crops. <br>  <br>    <br>  <a href="http://www.dragonstrike.com/egypt/food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragonstrike.com/egypt/food.h...</a>

English, northern Irish, and French: from Middle English, Old French beste ‘animal’, ‘beast’ (Latin bestia), applied either as a metonymic occupational name for someone who looked after beasts—a herdsman— or as a derogatory nickname for someone thought to resemble an animal, i.e. a violent, uncouth, or stupid man. It is unlikely that the name is derived from best, Old English betst, superlative of good. By far the most frequent spelling of the French surname is Beste, but it is likely that in North America this form has largely been assimilated to Best.<br>     2. German: from a short form of Sebastian.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	well this isnt the best but its unique<br>  we had a sub in high school whos last name was Youngblood<br>  <br>  i like my cousins last name because it has so many syllables- Mastragiacomo- means master george|`|R534McNOaa	Must be "Omega"|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Smith.|`|k5557KW2aa	Johnson<br>  <br>  because its my last name <br>  <br>  n odly enough all of the guys on my dads side <br>  <br>  where i got the johnson name from <br>  <br>  are all assholes<br>  <br>  including me|`|zrj8jhssaa	Hunt<br>  <br>  Mike Hunt|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	Blizard with one z. <br>  It's pronounced blizz- aard|`|XzLUA7ataa	I believe it must be Wardwell|`|ExpglPmTaa	A common first name like Bob or Jimmy|`|AA10453556	Armstrong is a good one.|`|xi5XwytJaa	Lipshitz ...by far!|`|Dhsyroekaa	beer|`|4v2jcOsiaa	Boobenheimer.<br>  :]<br>  That's my last name.<br>  It's the ****.|`|AA10958272	Right now.. that Obama last name, is media magic.<br>  <br>  (And, garners worldwide interest at that.)|`|2mla6m51aa	Supercallafragalisticksexpealeeydoshus|`|rFoKf7ieaa	O'Shaughnessy|`|zP3HQnbdaa	WATEVA THE LAST NAME OF YOUR PARENTS|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	Rodgers|`|MeCmQdLVaa	Addy|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	Bester|`|VKY3H7yxaa	Bustin =]|`|nhQvToBXaa	Armstrong.<br>  <br>  It's just...cool.

I haven't yet found a surname that I like more [if I did, it would have to begin with "A"]. <br>  <br>  ADVANTAGES OF MY SURNAME "ALLIS"<br>  1. It is an unusual surname (but one that people always know how to pronounce).<br>  2. It is one of the few surnames I know of that came from a female first name ("Alice") <br>  3. It is at the start of the alphabet, which means: I get to be one of the first people to do my speech in English. This is great because then I can get it over with & truly enjoy listening to everyone elses speech. . Being one of the 'first' in any list has other advantages too. It would be so boring waiting until it was finally my turn - after everyone else - if my surname started with "Z"). <br>  <br>  DISADVANTAGES:<br>  1. Being teased if you are a guy. My brother used to get teased that he would marry a girl in his class called Alice.<br>  2. People almost always misspell ALLIS, thinking that it is spelt like ELLIS (a surname that comes from the male first name "Elias/Elijah"). <br>  3. I am training to work in a legal setting & if I am called by my surname alone (with no "Ms" before it) people might assume that I'm being called by my first name. I guess guys with the surname "Michael" face the same problem (but to a lesser extent because it is more common for women than for men to be called by their first name in formal settings). Having said that I've heard that all women lawyers have to have a 'title' before their surname for some weird reason but men are just called by their surname alone - as if women's surnames are considered less of a permanent part of themselves than they are for men. Or perhaps it is simply because people feel they just *have* to know whether a lawyer is female or not bwhen reading about her. But that doesn't make sense because I know that female judges don't have to use gendered titles (Ms or Mrs) before their surname.|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	Warbenyegarmanjenson.|`|UdatjYEQaa	gilmore,smith,morningstar,ellis|`|7Loj1iryaa	Sobieszczuk :)|`|i071rIOMaa	Well I would like trump or gates if I were related and a close loved relative. :)|`|Vm1DndWsaa	Alston|`|ZP7jpR6gaa	Branson|`|hLzINqrHaa	Neri =D|`|gUHJOTnEaa	backyard|`|ydNbramoaa	asshole or **** would good!!

There's a long-standing debate within English studies about looking at a text in isolation (i.e., as a gem unto itself) and thinking of it as part of a larger, situational context (i.e., the text does not exist in a vacuum but has had multiple influences on its creation). <br>  <br>  If this is about your opinion, then you should feel free to interact with the text and question what you find there. What was your reaction to the mentions of "Sodom and Gomorrah"? Who is the "Jokerman" as you understand it? Answering questions this way avoids the sticky problem of finding the "one" correct interpretation. Since we can't read Dylan's mind, we may never know what a "correct" interpretation implies, and as such, your interpretation is just as valid. <br>  <br>  The second approach is to incorporate the historicity of the text into your dialogue. For example, was Dylan alive and arrested after his car wreck when he wrote this? If villains are the people sitting in prison over his testimony, who is paying the other journalists (i.e. there's a possible that the FBI guys there to pick up the officer's isn't real. <br>  Groups like this need to be shown more than their heroes--they may need to see a moral fight.They need to see that the other kind of analysis isn't valid. <br>  <br>  There you have it: either treat the text as a gem unto itself or get directly into the power of persuasion and risk an avalanche, FYI.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  TKO-12

uBxvR6FJaa	Muhammad was a slave-owning (33:50), warlord (8:1, 33:27) who spread his religion with the sword (8:70, 9:5). His “book from god” (4:82) contains many personal, often sexual and tailor-made advantages for himself (33:50-53) as well as scientific errors (13:3, 67:5, 86:7). He included his own narrow-minded, generalizations when talking about women (4:34, 2:228) and his personal enemies, the Jews (2:96, 5:13, 5:82). Muhammad institutionalized polygamy (4:3) and granted sexual rights to husbands (2:223). He allowed men to use emotional and physical punishment to discipline their disobedient wives (4:34). The Quran did not ban slavery, allowing Muslims to practice slavery (30:28), as well as sexual-slavery (23:6, 70:30), victimizing tens of millions of people, for over a thousand years (AD 610-1962 for Saudi Arabia). The Quran says that you are not forced to convert (2:256) but then it threatens you with the humiliating “infidel tax”, the “Jizya” (9:29), death, mutilation or expulsion (5:33) and an eternal hell (4:169) if you don’t.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	A Byzantine emperor stated “Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.”|`|pI5jKfmaaa	<a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/index.php?option=com_tree&task=category&id=33" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/index.php?o...</a>|`|SsRw7ujraa	It is the true religion!

draNVjbkaa	Getting into voice over acting is a hefty investment. Largely because you have to invest thousands of dollars in putting together a demo reel that shows your range as a voice actor. There are different types of voiceovers. Commercials are the biggest chunk. Then there are promo, narrative, foreign language, audiobook, and animation. <br>  <br>  Before forking over thousands of dollars to get your reel, get a lot of training before. Good training consists of proper vocal exercises and warmup, proper diction in American standard English, breaking down a VO script into phrases, and being able to make that script come to life with your imagination and not just some regular read. Improv is also highly recommended as well for you want to be able to loosen up and use your imagination when you're in that isolation chamber (recording booth).<br>  <br>  If I had to recommend a book, I think The Art of Voice Acting, 3rd edition by James R. Alburger is a good place to start. He also gives recommendations for other Voiceover resources as well. <br>  <br>  Here's a great Voice Acting resource site:<br>  <a href="http://voiceacting.com" rel="nofollow">http://voiceacting.com</a><br>  <br>  To be a radio host, your best bet is to intern at a radio station.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Voice work is highly competitive. Mainly because actors can be heard, but not seen, therefore there is less chance of over-exposure. <br>  <br>  You can take voice lessons (which is not the same as elocution lessons) and learn techniques to improve breathing, posture, etc. Yoga is a good skill to learn as well. <br>  <br>  Practice voice work by reading the front page of the paper, every day.

This is also a decent place to get your voice hear.

Woodworth, and he begins this way: "To blow a bubble requires but a pipe, a basin of soap-suds and a blower.  And it is pleasant, too, to watch these vain casings of nothingness as, reflecting in their diaphanous films the varied and beautiful colors of the rainbow, they float away beyond human ken into the azure depths of the heavens.'  He goes on like that for awhile before he gets to the point.  Adult intellectuals too, he says, "are bubble blowers. Castles in the air delight us children of a larger growth."  And so forth. <br>  <br>  For more, go to the book I've linked you to below, and then use the search function for page 303.

However, if you're intention is to share your work with other it needs to be a little less emotional and predictable gushy love.  Some advice I once got from a poetry teacher is that if you are writing a poem that will emotional for you right what you want to say first get all the raw emotions out, then basically forget what you wrote throw it out and start with new reflection.

She was healthy until she was between 15 months and 2 years old (I'm not sure how old off hand)> She contracted something that might be called encephalitis or meningitis or something like today that and went blind and deaf. Until she was seven she could barely communicate, although apparently did have some hand signs.<br>  <br>  When she was about 7, her parents contacted a school in Boston. They sent a young woman, maybe in her late teens, had poor eyesight herself, named Annie Sullivan. Annie had no real experience teaching and was learning as she went along. Most of what I know comes from the movie "The Miracle Worker".  She gradually taught the wild, unruly child to use hand signs. <br>  <br>  Eventually when she was able to sign enough, she helped her learn to talk. I don't know the process. Helen Keller later went to college and went on the write, I'm sorry I don't remember the name of her book or books off hand. <br>  <br>  I think Anne Sullivan died in the 1930;s or 40's. Helen Keller died in the early 60's. <br>  <br>  She was probably the first person with multiple disabilities, like deafness and blindness, to really succeed in the world of writing and eventually to become a public speaker.<br>  <br>  I don't know what article you mean.

She was the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.[1][2] The story of how Keller's teacher, Annie Sullivan, broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become known worldwide through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.<br>  <br>  A prolific author, Keller was well traveled and was outspoken in her opposition to war. She campaigned for women's suffrage, workers' rights, and socialism, as well as many other progressive causes.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Early childhood and illness <br>  2 Formal education <br>  3 Companions <br>  4 Political activities <br>  5 Writings <br>  6 Akita dog <br>  7 Later life <br>  8 Portrayals of Helen Keller <br>  9 Posthumous honors <br>  10 References <br>  11 External links <br>  11.1 Works by Keller <br>  11.2 Politics <br>  11.3 IMDb <br>  11.4 Other <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Early childhood and illness<br>   <br>  Keller with Anne Sullivan vacationing at Cape Cod in July 1888Helen Keller was born at an estate called Ivy Green[3] in Tuscumbia, Alabama, on June 27, 1880, to Captain Arthur H. Keller, a former officer of the Confederate Army, and Kate Adams Keller, a cousin of Robert E. Lee and daughter of Charles W. Adams, a former Confederate general.[4] The Keller family originates from Germany.[5] Helen Keller was not born blind and deaf; it was not until she was nineteen months old that she contracted an illness described by doctors as "an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain," which could possibly have been scarlet fever or meningitis. The illness did not last for a particularly long time, but it left her deaf and blind. At that time, her only communication partner was Martha Washington, the six-year-old daughter of the family cook, who was able to create a sign language with her; by the age of seven, she had over sixty home signs to communicate with her family. According to Soviet blind-deaf psychologist A. Meshcheryakov, Martha's friendship and teaching was crucial for Helen's later developments.<br>  <br>   <br>  Keller and Sullivan in 1898In 1886, her mother, inspired by an account in Charles Dickens' American Notes of the successful education of another deaf and blind child, Laura Bridgman, dispatched young Helen, accompanied by her father, to seek out Dr. J. Julian Chisolm, an eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist in Baltimore, for advice.[6] He subsequently put them in touch with Alexander Graham Bell, who was working with deaf children at the time. Bell advised the couple to contact the Perkins Institute for the Blind, the school where Bridgman had been educated, which was then located in South Boston. Michael Anaganos, the school's director, asked former student Anne Sullivan, herself visually impaired and then only 20 years old, to become Keller's instructor.<br>  It was the beginning of a 49-year-long relationship, eventually evolving into governess and then eventual companion.<br>  <br>  Anne Sullivan arrived at Keller's house in March 1887, and immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with d-o-l-l for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller's big breakthrough in communication came in April the same year, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of "water"; she then nearly exhausted Sullivan demanding the names of all the other familiar objects in her world.<br>  <br>  Sullivan taught her charge to speak using the Tadoma method of touching the lips and throat of others as they speak, combined with fingerspelling letters on the palm of the child's hand. Later Keller learned Braille and used it to read not only English but also French, German, Greek, and Latin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Formal education<br>  Starting in May, 1888, Keller attended the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1894, Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf and Horace Mann School for the Deaf. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts and Keller entered The Cambridge School for Young Ladies before gaining admittance, in 1900, to Radcliffe College. Her admirer Mark Twain had introduced her to Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleton Rogers, who, with his wife, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated from Radcliffe, becoming the first deaf blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.<br>  <br>  <br>  Companions<br>  Anne Sullivan stayed as a companion to Helen Keller long after she taught her. Anne married John Macy in 1905, and her health started failing around 1914. Polly Thompson was hired to keep house. She was a young woman from Scotland who didn't have experience with deaf or blind people. She progressed to working as a secretary as well, and eventually became a constant companion to Keller.[7]<br>  <br>  After Anne died in 1936, Keller and Thompson move

SJisSKUqaa	The Roman Empire was the post-Republican phase of the ancient Roman civilization, characterised by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings in Europe and around the Mediterranean.[4] The term is used to describe the Roman state during and after the time of the first emperor, Augustus. The 500-year-old Roman Republic, which preceded it, had been weakened by several civil wars.[nb 2] Several events are commonly proposed to mark the transition from Republic to Empire, including Julius Caesar's appointment as perpetual dictator (44 BC), the victory of Octavian at the Battle of Actium (2 September 31 BC), and the Roman Senate's granting to Octavian the honorific Augustus (16 January 27 BC).[nb 3]<br>  <br>  The Latin term Imperium Romanorum (Roman Empire), probably the best-known Latin expression where the word imperium denotes a territory, indicates the part of the world under Roman rule. Roman expansion began in the days of the Republic, but reached its zenith under Emperor Trajan. At this territorial peak, the Roman Empire controlled approximately 5,900,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) of land surface. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Roman influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law, and government of nations around the world lasts to this day.<br>  <br>  In the late 3rd century AD, Diocletian established the practice of dividing authority between two emperors, one in the western part of the empire and one in the east, in order to better administer the vast territory. For the next century this practice continued, with occasional periods in which one emperor assumed complete control. However, after the death of Theodosius in 395, no single emperor would ever again hold genuine supremacy over a united Roman Empire.[5] The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 as Romulus Augustus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer.[6] The Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire endured until 1453 with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks led by Mehmed II.[7] Therefore, it is difficult to give an exact date when the Roman Empire ceased to exist, however this article will focus on the empire from 27 BC to the permanent division in AD 395. For more information, see History of the Roman Empire.

o3sYIdOzaa	After the Japanese invasion in 1940 a resistance movement began.  The Japanese defeated the French, who had occupied the country, and proclaimed Vietnam an independent nation, with Japan as an overseer.  When Japan surrendered Vietnam declared itself an independent nation.<br>  <br>  "The author of Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence was none other than Ho Chi Minh. As early as May 1945 Ho had sought out a young American Lieutenant who had parachuted into the northern Vietnamese mountains with the OSS. "He kept asking me if I could remember the language of our declaration," the lieutenant later recalled. "I was a normal American, I couldn't." Eventually he realized that Ho knew more about the American proclamation of freedom than he did himself. On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh addressed a crowd assembled in Hanoi, and indeed, the entire world, with these words:<br>  <br>  We hold truths that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.<br>  <br>  This immortal statement is extracted from the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. Understood in the broader sense, this means: All have the right to live to be happy and free. These are undeniable truths.<br>  <br>  We, the members of the Provisional Government representing the entire people of Viet Nam, declare that we shall from now on have no connections with imperialist France; we consider null and void all the treaties France has signed concerning Viet Nam, and we hereby cancel all the privileges that the French arrogated to themselves on our territory.<br>  <br>  After eighty years of Western rule, Viet Nam was again independent and again united.  This peace in Viet Nam was to be short-lived. Already the French were regrouping, waiting to reenter the country on the heels of the Allied occupation force in southern Vietnam."<br>  <br>  "1941-45: <br>  <br>  Vietminh lead the fight against the Japanese, supported by the US, which supplies them with weapons. When France is liberated, the Japanese imprison French troops. In 1945, when the Japanese surrender after Hiroshima, the Vietminh, who are based in the north, take over Hanoi and declare the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Ho persuades emperor Bao Dai to abdicate, due to his associations with the Japanese. Ho Chi Minh hopes for US support against the French. <br>  <br>  British troops arrive in Saigon from Burma. They aim to restore French colonial rule. They rearm Japanese troops and use them to drive the Vietminh out of Saigon and the south. The French re-establish colonial rule in the south. <br>  <br>  Vietnam declared independence in 1945. But France was reluctant to lose her South East Asian empire and so resisted Vietnam’s bid for independence. Fighting soon broke out and only ended in 1954 when the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu.<br>  <br>  After WW II<br>  <br>  At the Geneva conference in 1954, Laos and Cambodia gained independence and Vietnam was temporarily divided along the 17th Parallel. A communist government under Ho Chi Minh was established in North Vietnam. In South Vietnam the government, which was headed by President Ngo Dinh Diem, was backed by the US. <br>  <br>  National elections were due to be held in 1956 after which it was hoped that the country would be reunited. Ho Chi Minh was confident that the elections would go in favour of the communists. The United States, worried that the communists would win, did not push for the elections to go ahead. They feared that if Vietnam became a communist state other countries in South East Asia would follow. The elections were never held."|`|gW0nD5cEaa	If the Germans had not invaded France, the French could have held a tighter grip on Indochina (Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos). But Japan took over Indochina and Germany invaded France. I don't think the 'Free French" under De Gaulle, in exile in London; or the Vichy French, who were allies to the Germans kept any control of Indochina. After the war, it took France a while to get back in control, so much had happened in France.<br>  <br>  Ho Chi Minh's nationalist, I don't know if they were COmmunist to begin with or later became communist, began to fight the French and beat them in 1954, after that Viet Nam was divided between the Communist North under Ho Chi Minh and the South, really a military dictatorship backed by the US.

Not in our hands.  If you suffer early you will have good life later.  If you have a good life now, you will suffer later.  All human have to go through this suffering and pain in one stage.  You cannot escape from it.Try to be happy with what you have.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Its all in how process the information then act upon it.  You apparently have no intention of acting at all, just throwing in the towel before the round starts.|`|AxCDyX2Caa	Something doesn't have to be everlasting to be influential and important.  You're not here simply to die; there's more to life than getting to the end of it.<br>  <br>  Now that being said, I'm not a religious man or anything, so I'm not going to try and tell you there is some divine plan for you, but I would rather like to ask you this...  When you look around yourself at all that this existence is, do you really think we've got it all figured out and there are no real mysteries left?  Many are in the scientific communities, some are within our own psyche, and there are plenty more in all areas of life.<br>  <br>  Assuming you agree that we don't know and understand it all, then my next question would be... how are you so convinced that us dying at the end of our lives is such a bad thing or somehow renders our actions during life as pointless?  I don't know what happens, you don't, no one does.<br>  <br>  I've had similar thoughts about existence and life, but for me when I really looked objectively, since we have no clue why we're here or if there's any rhyme or reason to any of it, there's no point what so ever in wanting it over soon or ending it early.  Worst case scenario is you live to old age and find out it was pointless anyways, might as well give it a shot and see if anything surprises you.|`|zu1DQNxZaa	To be honest, you'll probably come out of this feeling soon enough, you never know, just give it some time.<br>  If not, chat to friends, do stuff to cheer yourself up, keep your mind off it, and if all this still fails, theres professionals you can always go and see who deal with this kind of stuff all the time. :)|`|86k0M2VDaa	.. you sound a bit suicidal...<br>  :(<br>  well all I can tell you is that life is worth living<br>  I used to be like you. There's no point in anything.<br>  But we're young. We don't know if "life" sucks yet.<br>  You're only 1/4 through.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you hate the people at school.. yes i know they're all ignorant idiots.

No matter what the situation is, you just should feel it, once you do you will feel like it was worth living.|`|m6ZFQV1qaa	Really, so you've just been dieing over and over again throughout your life and nothing else?  How is it that you asked this question then?|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Sounds like you have already made up your mind.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	what is the point in life if all i do is no life at all?|`|qThmcR1Aaa	The point is just to live life and make the best of it.<br>  <br>  You're right ... we all suffer. We all experience pain and loss. We're all in the same boat. But that, ironically, is what can help you push on in tough times: Knowing that, in some sense, we're all in this together. If you can help lighten someone else's load, you've made their journey through this life a little easier, and just think of how good you'll feel when someone returns the favor someday.<br>  <br>  That's what keeps me going: Empathy, and the hope, however slim, that some action I take might make a difference in someone else's life. My only hope in life is to leave the world better than the way I found it. <br>  <br>  Your feelings of despair are why a lot of people cling to religion. It gives them hope in what sometimes seems like a meaningless existence. But the truth is, existence *is* meaningless. You can either be miserable with that fact, or you can soldier on, with the realization that we're all in this together, and try to make the world a slightly better place. The choice is yours.<br>  <br>  Buddhism addresses a lot of your concerns. I'm not a Buddhist, but I know that the Buddha tapped into this same existential angst, and he wrestled with it for years on his own spiritual path. Try checking out some Buddhist studies ... perhaps they can bring you some comfort.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!
w7USF5wDaa	I assume you are talking about T.C. Boyle's short story "Greasy Lake," no?  If you had actually read the story I don't think you'd need to ask this question.  The lake-***-lagoon is clearly symbolic, the story is full of water images and references to water.  I suggest you go back and reread the story, t should be obvious that it is integral.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

draNVjbkaa	Getting into voice over acting is a hefty investment. Largely because you have to invest thousands of dollars in putting together a demo reel that shows your range as a voice actor. There are different types of voiceovers. Commercials are the biggest chunk. Then there are promo, narrative, foreign language, audiobook, and animation. For you animation demo, you have to create original characters. Copying already established characters like from Family guy or Simpsons won't help you that much.<br>  <br>  Before forking over thousands of dollars to get your reel, get a lot of training before. Good training consists of proper vocal exercises and warmup, proper diction in American standard English, breaking down a VO script into phrases, and being able to make that script come to life and not just some regular read. Improv is also highly recommended as well for you want to be able to loosen up and use your imagination when you're in that isolation chamber (recording booth).<br>  <br>  If I had to recommend a book, I think The Art of Voice Acting, 3rd edition by James R. Alburger is a good place to start. He also gives recommendations for other Voiceover resources as well. <br>  <br>  Here's a great Voice Acting resource site:<br>  <a href="http://voiceacting.com" rel="nofollow">http://voiceacting.com</a>|`|gkLReOwCaa	this is teh funniest Q i've ever seen =))
cR8UZdi1aa	What I would suggest is take it into a fine art gallery, sometimes they will appraise art for you, (though they may charge a fee). I worked at an art gallery & several people would ask about appraising artwork they had, we had a gentleman on file who would appraise artwork from our area. Your local gallery may also be able to tell you where you can have it appraised if they don't do it themselves. You might even try posting a picture of it on YA & ask what people think it is worth.<br>  <br>  You might also try searching on ebay for similar type of artwork, you may find something comparable to your piece & that may help give you an idea of it's worth. If you don't want to sell it, this can give you at least an idea.|`|QT6iRQNaaa	You can try the Price Check forum at RarityGuide.com<br>  <br>  Many Art collectors hang out there, and if you post a photo maybe someone will identify it.
0dU50gc9aa	improv is all about practicing. you're training your brain to think fast at the same time as training yourself to trust what your brain comes up with. no second guessing what you say. no trying to think of something funnier. although what comes out may not be funny at first, the point is to get where it doesn't matter what comes out as long as it comes out fast. the funny will come, young grasshopper. you're in a much tougher position b/c highschool is full of jerks and they'll make fun of you about anything. you have to tune them out. do your thing. listen to the people you're working with and get comfy with 'em. it's important to have a rehersal with your group or a group of people period so that you're always learning and gaining more confidence. and FYI, EVERYONE is bad at improv when they first start out. if there isn't any kind of rehersal, then take the initiative and bring this up to your teacher. that kind of motivation is beneficial to anyone interested in theatre b/c it trains you to think on your feet. plus, it may make you stand out to your teacher that you would like to spearhead a rehersal group for improv.

If you have names, they might be in the social security death index (if these are US persons). <br>  Your other option is that many military units have history / reunion type websites.

Q6mMKYxZaa	Ever heard of a Rural Lenaea Festival?<br>  It is a greek festival where the players perform under the stars, in the woods, somewhere outdoors.<br>  Depending on the play, that usually works, or you could ask around and do a play in a public place.  <br>  Word-of-mouth works mostly, and then you need fliers, posters, and all that stuff.<br>  break a leg!  I'm sorry I couldn't help anymore than that, but that is the best I could do.|`|ob1NhypDaa	The Greeks used the stars as their canopy, the moon as lighting and the wind as stage effect.
