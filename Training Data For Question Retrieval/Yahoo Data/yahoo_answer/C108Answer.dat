l2MjVVpRaa	I am against it 100%    Why should I work so that those that don't can have a 'freebie'?    Why should I pay taxes so that those that don't can get a 'rebate' check?    Why has the ignorance in this country allowed a person such as Bozobama to even be elected KNOWING that anyone above welfare status is going to get screwed?|`|AU70o6wTaa	you mean the govt waste package? I'm totally against it. especially the part that takes all our PRIVATE medical records and sends them to DC|`|i790R5DXaa	AGAINST IT.    If you are drowning, do you need more water? I would say not.    If you are morbidly obese do you need more food? I would say no.    When you have more debt than money, do you go shopping?     If you have Common Sense, you would STOP SPENDING MONEY...........    A:~)|`|SlhuFfuZaa	Against: Giving money to ACORN!  Giving money to any big business. If they can't make it on their own they did it to themselves by paying some high priced C.E.O. too much to do nothing.  Borrowing money that is being illegally printed by an illegal banking system.   A socialist government under the auspices of our best interests.    It does no good to try to talk our Congress people into what we want, because most of them have been bought and paid for by the Federal Reserve and are for the Global union.|`|AA12020119	For    Tired of the rich getting all the money!|`|bIOf9lv7aa	First off, it has too many suspect items in it.. Pork.. Secondly, I dont even know for sure we need it.. Trying to buy your way out of a recession has never worked in the past, why would we think it would now??  I think Obama is using our situation to go on a huge democratic spending spree followed by higher taxes in the years to come..    I am against it in its current form.|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Against too much bs spending The lies of the left are exposed in this so called package|`|Yzb44aV6aa	For.    I think it will help.  I dont know how much it will help or in which specific industries, but we cannot do nothing!  I think at this moment in time its not about coming out with a "perfect" package, but about coming out with a package that will control some of the damage that has already been done.|`|tu2VbI0zaa	Against it...    just another excuse to spend money we don't have on things that never work...    just another socialistic fantasy by the democrats!|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Against it. It cannot come in the form of a tax break because the Tax Codes are already out for 2008. With that said, it will most likely come in the form of a check. The Government has to keep printing this fake money at the taxpayers expense so that we can so called "jump start" the economy. Its an awful decision with inordinate amount of funds going toward channels that do not benefit the state of the economy in any way, shape, or form.    For example: proposing $200B to low income families for Contraceptives and birth control.|`|IC7D7i1Zaa	Against!!!  Our government, the people WE put in office are selling us down the river.|`|f87aecace64788161262ee4e762de87aaa	For it!    Why? ... Because it is desperately needed. How great would America be by just allowing the Rich to prosper and not providing opportunity to the less fortunate.    People complain about welfare but applaud foreign aid... come on, lets help our fellow Americans.    If we continue not to care about anyone else but our selves we're going to find ourselves in a world of hurt. Parts of America will begin to favor small violent third world countries that prey on the more affluent. Is this what we want? To take a vacation and possibly find ourselves a victim of crime. How about our children? Will negative influences target them just because they have and others have not?    Instead of giving a dollar or two to the unfortunate looking homeless person on the side of the road dollars would be given to organizations that would qualify and distribute services to needy families and children in the form of money, training and educational programs.    Remember, that inevitably we are all connected and if your only concerned with what's happening in your own neighborhood, then go ahead with your foolishness and wait for it to come to you because it will. The gap between the "HAVES" and the "HAVE NOTS" is too great.    How can we be competitive with other nations when the standard of education is guaranteed only to a select few?     Some people need help, some people need more help than others, and some people need no help at all. For those persons who remain shiftless, lazy, irresponsible and unwilling to make the effort to become successful... you are mentally ill...     Can we understand people... "They ARE mentally ill" and in need of help too.    Have some faith in the "Home Team" , Obama is trying to set up an All Star Team with the "Best of the Best."|`|UnXCTJUkaa	AGAINST!    Why?  Because it will fail miserably, and I think Obama knows this good and well.  Here is a video explaining exactly why it will fail:    http://www.neithercorp.us/nforum/geopoli...      ///////Californian  What in God's name are you talking about?!  This country is going to fall apart WITH OR WITHOUT Obama's stimulus package.  The writing is on the wall.  The Stimulus will only make the collapse WORSE.  Our Country is BROKE.  Do you understand what that means?      We owe trillions of dollars to countries like Russia and China!  We are busted!  How is the Government going to save all these people you are talking about?  Where is the money going to come from?  I'll tell you where; we'll print it out of thin air!  Do you know what happens then?  Our dollar collapses due to inflation!      And who is mentally ill?  lol!  You know, the Obamatons are starting to sound more and more like Neo-Cons everyday.  Give them a little power and they run around like Nazis.|`|7QERhhRJaa	Would be cheaper and better to send me a case of beer.That way I would get something out of it.

You can't solve problems from over consumption and too much debt by greater consumption and more debt.    The elements in the package aren't justifiable even in a GOOD economy, either.    However, as it is it is throwing gasoline on the pyre of the economy.|`|73kknl3Qaa	for...we're at a critical mass at this point.|`|8zs5APHWaa	Against. Tax cuts would be easier.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	Against. The government has no business in business. Let the market decide or turn the country into a socialist entity. You can do one or the other successfully but you can't do both at the same time.    If you owned a rare baseball card that was worth $1 million dollars, obviously due to it's rarity. Then what would happen if suddenly there were a million baseball cards exactly like yours on the market?    The U.S. is broke it has to either borrow more money which means that we have to bail it out again in a few years or it prints more money (see paragraph above). So do you own dollars? How about things priced in dollars? Bad Bad MoJo|`|BrjZhySIaa	Against.  Propping up a FAILED SYSTEM will only put a band-aid on a gunshot wound as we FURTHER DEVALUE OUR DOLLAR.    Besides, you want the BEST stimulus package the government could offer?  Abolish the income tax!    "The notion of taxing one's way into prosperity is like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself up by the handle." ~ Winston Churchill|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	Against!

X4z3GqAeaa	Being that the USA has a GDP of $14.3 trillion and the next closest is Japan with $4.8 Trillion....

v0ZvjE0Iaa	Well, aside from the general score requirements subject to all recruits, you need a 90 in what's called aptitude area CO, which is the sections arithmetic reasoning, auto/shop, and mechanical comprehension combined.    EDIT: The base scores to get in are 32 with a HS diploma and 50 with a GED. This is in the AFQT area, which is word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, arithmetic reasoning and mathematics knowledge. So focus on those areas for a good qualifying score.|`|dV7s6wYiaa	32% overall score to get in. its not hard at all i got an 82 without even trying. you can guess most of the answers and have a good chance at getting in, but you have to be careful because they try to trick you sometimes.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	to be a grunt... a zero.

If you want to see what's in store for you in the future, look at Chicago. Chicago used to be the "City of big shoulders", now it's the "City of big brother". There are cameras everywhere and Daley isn't done yet. He wants MORE! They say it's to fight crime. Here's an idea, quit taxing us to the point that we can't afford the basic necessities and people won't be stealing and killing each other to the degree that they are now.

One black president is a big step forward, but the vast majority of people in power are still white. To correct this takes generations, not decades.    1) African American gets a good job now (maybe better than he would have been able to get w/o affirmative action)  2) He is able to provide for his family better, which includes a solid family unit, good education for his kids, etc...  3) His kids go to college, get even BETTER jobs    Repeat until the African American community (and all minorities for that matter) approach the level of affluence of "average America".|`|xxDjV6Axaa	We won't be doing away with them if Obama gets his way.

My top 4 Branches are !    1. U.S. ARMY, As a Soldier in the U.S. Army, you have several options when you join. No matter which options you choose, you're showing your commitment to your country and yourself  and you'll be an important part of the world's most powerful Army. The strength of the Army lies not only in numbers but also in the individual Soldier. Because no matter what job they have or rank they hold  there is nothing stronger than a U.S. Army Soldier. The training and salary you get as a Soldier are only some of the ways the Army strengthens you for tomorrow. The Army also offers money for education, comprehensive health care, generous vacation time, family services and support groups, special pay for special duties, and cash allowances to cover the cost of living.    2. U.S. NAVY, There are so many reasons to explore the Navy. With over 1,000 available careers as a Sailor or Officer, there is a perfect community for everyone. And when the workday is over, youll be amazed at the many cool activities Sailors participate in. The Navy takes care of its Sailors. When you join, you will receive an impressive array of benefits designed to keep you healthy, comfortable and secure. And the best part is that all of these benefits are above and beyond your Navy pay and allowances.    3. U.S. Air Force, The mission of the United States Air Force is to fly, fight and win  in air, space and cyberspace. Whoever you are and wherever you fit on the Air Force team, the Core Values are what you will live by and learn to cherish. The Core Values are much more than minimum standards. They remind us what it takes to get the mission done. They inspire us to do our very best at all times. They are the common bond among all comrades in arms, and they are the glue that unifies the Force and ties us to the great warriors and public servants of the past. Air Force technology gives it the power to see and strike across the globe. Discover how the world's dominant air and space power stays that way. If youve got a high school diploma or are about to earn one, a career is waiting for you in the Air Force. And its not all about planes and pilots. Weve got a career for almost every interest and skills.    4. U.S. Marines MARINES ARE MADE, NOT BORN. 12 WEEKS OF THE TOUGHEST TRAINING IN THE WORLD TRANSFORMS CIVILIANS INTO MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES' MOST NOBLE BROTHERHOOD. Marines are men and women who, once trained, will meet the highest standards of moral and  physical strength. Marines can serve on active duty and in the Marine Corps Reserve, as both  enlisted Marines and officers. The Marine Corps stays ready for any kind of mission by training every Marine for a military occupational specialty (MOS), a specific role that contributes to the mission. The Marine Corps principal organization  is the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), which includes the Command Element and three  other elements: Ground Combat Element, Aviation Combat Element, Logistics Combat Element.  THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE MARINES !|`|6zRXqE7Waa	Should you join the military, Absolutely, if you want to then go for it. Now which branch in the bigger question.    The Marines are the Elite Warriors. They are treated the worse to break them down and make them stronger. The quote "Pain is weakness leaving the body" comes from the marines.     The Army is not so hard on you, they are not the strongest or the smartest but are not pushovers either. They are one of the largest branches are are treated pretty well.    The NAVY is the way to go as far as how well you are treated, they have the best food for example. Also if your looking for special forces the NAVY seals are most likely the most intense, and most powerful force. Also the most difficult to get into.    The Air force is also very needed. They are intelligent are prestigious. They have got to be right up their with the NAVY as far as the food etc.    One last point, when you ask someone is the NAVY what they do they say "I'm in the NAVY"    When you ask someone in the Air force they say: "I'm in the Air force."    When you ask someone in the Army they say: "I'm in the Army."     But when you ask someone in the Marine Corp they respond: "I AM a marine."

There's this girl in one of my classes who was one of those annoying people who would ask you if you're registered to vote like five times a day. She still wears her Obama button on her coat. It's not really a button: it's a big rectangle probably 6 inches by 3-4 inches.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	No it's not, I had Bush's face on my toilet paper|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	Yes and the Sasha and Malia dolls are just disrespectful.

Yzb44aV6aa	They were talking about that on CSpan today.  Apparently the rate for mortgages is at about 5.5% right now.  The government could theoretically offer a 4% rate to homeowners.....    The negatives of that are:  --it would cost the government soooo much money to do that...  --they also want to differentiate between people that really need the help and the ones who are able to keep their mortgages the way that they are.  With this idea, they wouldnt be able to tell really well and probably end up offering this rate to everyone...  --and what about the banks that are offering mortgages now? if the federal government took that part of their business from them...they would not be in a very good spot and require more and more money to sustain their businesses...|`|AA10329269	Yea, I don't think that's a good idea. Last I saw, mortgage rates were around 5% - which is pretty low! "Quality" home owners can go and refinance if they would like - but the government should have no part in forcing either party to do so.    EDIt - then what exactly are you suggesting? The government go in and renegotiate contracts between 2 entities? How is that not forcing them, if one or both parties does not want to do this?|`|xagiOb80aa	This is the best solution and one I have considered.  Everyone should automatically be converted to a 4.5% rate...    This would help those struggling, reward those who never had a problem, and let the speculators and home flippers eat their losses or live with them  .    Further, banks, who have already been rewarded, would have a better idea of their returns, since foreclosures would be reduced.    And, as you say, this costs taxpayers nothing, can be done immediately and is, in fact, a monthly "stimulus" all can enjoy.    It may be wise to consider similar rate adjustments on folks pre-existing crdit card debt, too, to say, maybe 8-9%....    ______    there would be no need for the Govt to pay for any of this, simply convert everyone's loan to 4.5%, and force the bailed out banks to accept this...|`|XvovBRlnaa	Oh you Socialist: What you do to us each dark day|`|gsKfSkJ1aa	Obama could give EVERY HOMEOWNER in America $17,000     Total Cost : $825 Billion    but he'd rather give it to his lobbyist pals and fellow Democrats pet projects (aka PORK)|`|2ISGwSK7aa	This corruption has to stop.

i0LUuhyLaa	I will not even address what came to mind when I read this except I agree with the first poster.    Immigration holds are just that.. immigration holds.  They are not offered bail therefore cannot "jump bail".     A member who was also an attorney wrote a very informative blog about this very subject.     "Estimated cost: per court (one judge, two attorneys, one court reporter, one bailiff) that's 350K, times 1000 courts, that's 350 million dollars just to pay the salaries. Triple to include paperwork, overhead, lights, building usage, etc. That's one billion dollars, per years, just to process the deportation hearings. And does not include the hearings required for anyone with anyone who is actually facing criminal charges."    http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-kjFFwXQyd...|`|413999ce3344ac9070b2bf70d21ebe12aa	Seriously now, if that were the case the deportations would happen so fast it would make your head swim and the govt wouldn't be wanting another amnesty.|`|lZe1daRAaa	all is about money in USA|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	That could work.

d7667642d6476c7c373029d6c1a8327baa	The rules of self-defense vary from state to state.  It all depends where you live, and what the verifiable facts are.  Generally, the law allows you enough force to escape the situation, or to stop someone from harming you (in that order of preference), but it does NOT entitle you to retaliate afterwards.      If you use a pistol to defend yourself (presuming that it is legal for you to do so), prepare to defend yourself later in court.  The burden will be  on you to prove that your life was in danger at the moment you used the gun.      Concealed carry laws and self defense laws do not give you the benefit of the doubt that you acted responsibly.  They merely recognize that rights to self-defense exist.  It is up to you to stay within the confines of the law in order to invoke a self-defense claim.      The guy with the bat could still be charged with assault, attempted murder, or other charges (depending on the state's criminal code), but that does not necessarily mean that you are off the hook.  You could still be charged as well.      You really should address this scenario with an attorney specializing in criminal defense if you are genuinely concerned about it.  The law is very fact sensitive, and only an a qualified attorney can advise you as to how the law will apply.|`|UIgDmhnIaa	well, that sucks Leonard.|`|tCnETE4caa	you look like a lawyer with your tie and all... so you should know about this.

Working people don't have time to listen to the radio all day.  Rush is an entertainer.  Never forget that.  Like Howard Stern, he is what I would refer to as a "shock jock".  I enjoy him when I have had the time to listen and generally I agree with many of his views, to be honest.  He is outrageous, though, at times.  I laughed when I heard Obama "ordering" people not to listen to Rush and I'll bet his ratings went sky high after that.    Excuse me?  Turning to an entertainer for your political views is much more a democrat thing.  I even saw Cheech and Chong on some award show tell people to vote for Obama.  They are such fine upstanding citizens, though, so of course you all listen to them, right?  I also heard P Diddy and Madonna speak out for Obama.  My goodness, they are pillars of the community and have such pure reputations and lives.  So, don't start on the entertainment industry, darling, as you have no leg to stand on.|`|cpLoD9NJaa	Isn't it amazing that the president blames Rush for things not getting done in Washington?

Isn't it amazing that Rush alone is keeping MSNBC in business?    Isn't it amazing that 99% of what Rush says is taken out of context, but bull heads like you wouldn't know that because you spend all day wiping up the tingle running down your leg when you hear Obama speak?    Isn't it amazing that the Media is fawning over Obama?  The Washington Post front page article on Christmas Morning talked about his glistening pectorals?

It's not unbelievable -- Obama had very little reason behind saying what he did.         And to be quite frank - Rush is right.  If we want America to succeed long term -- we need Obama to fail in the short term.    If you disagree--then it's clear you haven't read through his pork filled H.R. 1 bill (also known as H.R.

They were there fighting and asked if they could get a case, they were going to send the money. Starbucks refused and said they didn't support the war! After that I got everybody I know to stop buying from them.

These bailouts and stimulus packages are just short term solutions. Since the country is already in a deficit, these stimulus packages come from printing billions of dollars that don't exist. This in short term works, however in the long term we will have a considerably weaker dollar. I doubt it will result in hyperinflation since a majority of the world depends on a strong dollar, but we will definitely experience bad inflation that will result from these bailouts and stimulus packages.|`|ZN2dmoEnaa	politicians never really seem to get it.|`|PhdK3S6uaa	i use to be a republican, but have become a libertarian.

YWqWb7JSaa	The Army National Guard does a lot of disaster relief along with boarder control. They secure our homeland and provide security during times like 9/11 and hurricane Katrina. However, during these uncertain times you will most likely be turned into an active Army infantryman at some point and deployed. The National Guard is kind of a jack of all trades... eventhough many think that they are just weekend warriors. There job consists of more than just weekends during times like this. You will most likely be deployed overseas. The benefit is that when you are not deployed you belong to the state of whichever Natioanl Guard branch you join and do not have to worry about being relocated to a different base (unless deployed, of course)|`|Iwtv6QyIaa	Sorry, he lied.  You will, more than likely, serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.   The deployments aren't as long as regular Army. I have seen many NG go through Ft. Stewart, GA.to be deployed.  If you stay stateside then you will be "crowd control" basically.   Hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, any natural disasters or riots.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	NG is a part time soldier. Active duty is full time soldier. There trained the same. Good luck.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	National Guard troops not on an "active" deployment are at the beck-and-call of State Governors, who commonly call them up to help in emergencies (natural disasters, such as storms or floods) most commonly.  Otherwise, they spend their duty time trying to maintain their basic infantryman skills.  I think ones in the southwestern states are being called on to help patrol the borders with Mexico.|`|DV4xyeChaa	im sure the 10s of thousands of National Guard solders in iraq and Afghanistan would be shocked to hear it..
K7x1RHVFaa	The fact is the bigger the lot the more the handicap spaces have to be there, and the more companies in the lot the more spaces have to be there. The laws require more spaces for some businesses than others and before you know it all the front spaces are marked for the handicapped. You are lucky. I was on the other side of the equation and had to argue for more spaces because the business in question was a clinic and all the patients were handicapped so I had the complex add more in form of that clinic alone.    Good Luck.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Walking is a good reason to stay healthy
YaTgrhr9aa	Pouring money into the "stimulus" package is a ensuring our children's, children will be paying it off and to put money into ACORN who is being investigated in several states is ludicrous to say the least, and yes it will fund them to continue their racial agenda|`|d9L9C4dHaa	what a waste of money that is that is just payback from Obama from all the shady things ACORN did during the election.  giving ACORN money will not stimulate the economy at all.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	America should be happy that Democrats want us to borrow money, pay interest on it, and give it to ACORN for more election fraud.   Go Barry!|`|t3QAaSN9aa	There is no provision to give ACORN 5 billion dollars, so stop repeating that lie. The Republicans are trying to propagandize one provision in the stimulus package that is not particularly aimed at ACORN and demonize ACORN at the same time. ACORN is not a racially divisive organization except in the fevered minds of hate-filled conservatives.|`|2jNQhT7laa	Um, the only reason everybody's up in arms about ACORN is that it's been racialized in the media, made to look as though it only serves all those lazy dumb black people. It is in fact a fine organization that serves ALL KINDS of disadvantaged peoples, some of whom are black.    But way to buy into racist bullsh*t about organizations you know nothing about besides what you saw on Fox.|`|ewOQX1D1aa	It`s all part of America`s "conversion"...Now, will America stand for Barry`s "change" ?

So why is Obama trying this tactic, cause it does work for the short term. If Obama can get us up a little in four years, he's almost guaranteed another term, that's probably why he's imitating FDR, cause FDR got voted in 3 times.|`|8UiV3vDsaa	dont know i just want points|`|q6ka1qEtaa	you are anti american for bashing a war time president|`|AA11248279	Simple.  Because he believes another 'New Deal' will keep democrats in power for another 5 terms like FDR believed.|`|ObfEroZMaa	WW2 got us out of the depression not the new deal (as most people believe).    FDR helped a little.|`|85jvX3Szaa	You must have voted McCain|`|KbRIqrmhaa	He's trying to fool us into believing he's trying to help us when in fact he's going to do just the opposite.

Obama is going to say that bailing out the banks are more important to save our country BS line.|`|LkR86Eb1aa	Isn't it strange how some people need role models instead of just being themselves.|`|jS2s21W0aa	We're in the worst economic rut since the Great Depression.  Hey, guess who was President during that period.  Guess what happened after that President instituted the New Deal?  It worked? Really? Fascinating.

If the probation officer pulled a suprise visit and came to your house, or drug tested you, there would not be any legal recourse.     If you want to turn them in, it's just a matter of finding out their names and calling the probation officer.  They'll take it from there.  You will not have to testify in court.

aHN5fDwQaa	In general, the San Pedro cactus is not restricted, despite its interesting chemical content. You still need to check local laws however because it's unlikely that San Pedro is native to the UK and the import of non-native species can be an issue.     Because cacti are slow growing (fortunately San Pedro grows fairly quickly as cacti go), they are unlikely to present an ecological danger. Still, there may be a blanket law prohibiting the import of non-native species.    Call your local customs office and ask if there are any restrictions on the import of ornamental cacti. Be prepared to answer the question "What kind?". Have a list of several innocuous varieties and just drop the San Pedro somewhere in the list as if it was one of several that you plan to plant in your xeriscape project.|`|bnURhMzdaa	Yes, if you were to purchase it online, you could get it shipped to the UK. If you were to go to San Pedro, purchase a cactus, and attempt to bring it to the UK, you would have to keep it in your luggage that wont be your "carry-on" baggage. Then when you would enter immigrations of UK, you wouldn't claim anything in your bags.|`|AA11206283	For the right price, you can pretty much get anything delivered.

6edczUEBaa	It depends on your state laws. I know in the state of OH the custodial parent claims the child unless you have a court order stating that 1 year you claim the baby and 1 year he claims the baby. If he did claim the baby and was not allowed to you need to contact the IRS and let them know what happened and they can tell you exactly what to do. Hope this helps you out a bit|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	THe federal income tax laws CLEARLY state that the parent who has the child 51% of the time gets to claim the child. My ex and I have the same fight every year and every year I win. Instead making a big deal of it let him know that he made a mistake and instead of turning him or making him refile tell him that you would like for him to reimburse you for half. This has seemed to work for my ex and I. We switch every other year and pay each other out for half of the child income tax credit.|`|a2Oal2Siaa	No he can not claim him if you have custody. Is it in the divorce papers? If he already filed his taxes with your son on them, there is nothing you can do but appeal the process. When you file your taxes with him it will get rejected, then appeal it. Once they review it, you will get the credit for your son, and he will owe the IRS the money he was overpaid.
K7x1RHVFaa	You.    Unless you agreed to it he can not claim the boy and if he does then you can't and vice versa.    Custodial parent gets the deduction unless otherwise agreed to.    You can deduct him.     He is the one in trouble. Claim what is right. He will have to ammend his return to correct the mistake.    Good Luck.    edit.    I missed this pare of your question but yes , he has to get you to sign a 8332 form to deduct or clain exemption for your son if you are the custodial parent.    http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8332.pdf    But all you deserve is to claim you son. The costody agreement gives you custody and the tax codes give the exemption and the deduction unless otherwise signed away.    Oh, child support has nothing to do with being able to deduct a child. Alimony like child support are lose lose scenarios. You pay and you can deduct nothing under the reasoning that you would be paying that money anyway had you stayed married. Like I said he is the one with the problem.    I am only wondering why he told you he claimed the boy when he should not have. Telling you does not make it legal.    Oh, and if you want to make an issue out of this you can report you ex for tax fraud using form 3949 A or right them at Internal Revenue Service, Fresno, CA 93888    http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...    Good Luck no matter what you choose.|`|aucsqB7Laa	you split up with your son?|`|AA10405438	First of all if you are divorced it shoulod be in your divorce decree.  You can claim your son.  Then, the IRS will become involved because you both cannot claim him.  It matters not which parent spends more time, it matters who spends the most money and has proof.  Get back to your attorney and have him/her file for you to be able to claim your son.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Is there anything in the court papers or mediation report about this?|`|btVNM1Djaa	he can claim him, how much depends on how much money he spent on raising him, you can claim him as well, again how much depends on how much you spent on raising him. quite frankly its really none of your business whether or not not your ex is claiming him. If he's doing things illegally or improperly sooner or later they will catch him. (IRS caught Al Capone when the FBI failed). If you feel you have the right to claim your son, do it, its none of the fathers business either

There are, however some things to consider.     1. New rules on dual citizenship. It is no longer recognised and UK Immigration may require you to give up a passport. If you want to join the military then it will probably have to be your US one.    2. You will have to join the Army or Royal Marines and serve for at least three years. The Parachute Regiment is probably the best for SAS and Marines for SBS.    3. The drop out rate in selection. Only 1 in 10 in people who try selection, actually get in.

C5JxA8k0aa	The more which go the better, every time I see one of these government ministers such as  Hazel Blears, or Jack Straw on the tele; talking in that annoyingly self righteous patronising tone, I think to myself how great it will be when their all gone. When I voted for them in the past, I thought that they were a progressive centre left party, who would save the NHS and improve the lives of people in this country. However they turned out to be a bunch of Marxist liberal nuts, who have grown increasingly authoritarian, have curbed many of our civil liberties, and seem obsessed with moulding society and public opinion in line with their own party political doctrine, rather than listening to the people who they are supposed to represent. They have profoundly damaged the social fabric of our society.  I cant wait till their all gone.|`|VfYvJypEaa	Hopefully none . Realistically they will be the largest party in opposition .|`|AA12349988	My money is on hung parliament - I really dont think that the conservative party have done enough or will do enough to win the election.

But to answer your question I predict that Labour will get between 290 and 310 MP's  -  The conservative will get slightly more leaving no overall majority.|`|jtPzPhHCaa	Hopefully NONE.

Last poll headline I saw gave the Conservatives a 12% swing (on the 2005 General Election results) in their favour, which means (according to the Swingometer) there'd be 161 Labour MP's left, with 411 Conservatives, 47 Lib Dems, and 30 "Others".    Another one I saw gave the Conservatives a 14% Swing in their favour, which would mean 135 Labour MP's left, 445 Conservatives, 39 Lib Dems & 30 "Others".    Cranking the Swingometer right the way to 20% (as high as it'll swing) leaves 66 Labour MP's, 527 Conservatives, 27 Lib Dems & 29 "Others"    Unfortunately those same predictions suggest even with the 20% swing we'd unfortuntely still have the likes of Gordon Brown, Harriet Harperson, David Miliband, John Prescott & Peter Hain in Parliament.... but Jacqui Smith (3% swing needed), Jack Straw (10% Swing needed), Margaret Beckett (17% swing needed) could quite possibly be going to be out of a job.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	They're already yesterdays men and women - finished and justifiably so!

eiVlnKgNaa	House Democrats have proposed $825 billion in stimulus spending to be used to create jobs, protect workers, expand infrastructure, and provide aid to states. To put it into perspective, $825 billion is worth approximately $10,520 for each family in the United States, or $22,445 for each family with children under the age of 18.    Average spending for all family groups in the United States is similar to that of families with children. On average, families are spending:    ? $2,330 on apparel and services  ? $3,595 on health care  ? $4,322 on food at home  ? $11,657 annually on shelter    If all families were asked to equally shoulder the burden of the $825 billion stimulus package, it would be like asking them to take on an amount of debt equivalent to what they spend on food, clothing, and health care or most of what they spend on shelter for an entire year.

I voted for Bob Barr, so that ought to tell you where I stand.  That being said, let's take just one of your examples:  cars.  Our auto industry is in the toilet and needs all the sales they can get.  If the government buys new cars every year, that goes a long way toward keeping them in business, and their employees working, and spending money to stimulate other parts of the economy (housing, autos, or whatever) depending on the choices they make.  Those cars they get rid of benefit the used car dealers, who are always in need of late model vehicles.  Those guys employ people too, and their spending wends it way through the economy stimulating "whatever", depending on the choices they make.  Are you getting the drift?  Economists call it the "multiplier principle".  Simply put, it means money isn't spent just once.  It's spent countless times as it passes from hand to hand, paying for goods and services for whoever possesses it at any given point in time.  The same could be said for the employees of all the other examples you cited.  I'm not a big government guy, by any means.  But the private sector depends on government sales and the government depends on tax revenue derived from the profits on those sales.  It's a circle.  One hand washes the other, and this is no time to run out of soap!|`|ZCrIKWlQaa	What people who believe in the policy seem to forget is that the money that the government has had to come from somewhere - the taxpayers.  Government spending to stimulate the economy is like me breaking all of the windows in my house.  Does buying new windows stimulate the economy?  Absolutely not, because I would have been much better off spending my money where I wanted to rather than replacing my windows.  The government spending my money to stimulate the economy follows the same logic.  Wouldn't I be better off spending my money where I wanted?    Economists call it the Broken Window Fallacy.|`|AA11248279	It's not.  It will just propel democrats deeper into power.

It is not evidence in a court, though, unless you allowed him to have your phone.|`|U12GVF7Kaa	well if your cheating then yes but for no valid reason then no, its simply an invation of privacy|`|f39270a966433c441b97202467862551aa	Apparently you weren't supposed to have the phone at school and or you had it when you weren't supposed to, so when you broke those rules you forfeited your rights!!!  You should be exposed as a cheater if that's what you are..|`|e8mnEw1taa	yes they can if you abuse there rules!|`|58H53s8maa	im not sure but it seems like the school is allowed to do whatever the f*** they want....that reallly sucks though|`|suTfAyBCaa	yes it a volation of our rights . if you go in and tell him this he will give it back to you|`|0rpS2b97aa	If you were cheating...that is probable cause.  Especially if they knew that you were using your phone.  There is no such thing as an evasion of privacy.  If you are asking about an invasion of privacy, if it is on school property then they can search it.  Absolutely 100% legal.|`|43942bc50710c4456dc14871795e132baa	In most cases it is not illegal. Obviously you were doing something you weren't supposed to and obviously he knew. If you are a minor, and in a school, your parents basically give your teachers rights similar to their own. If someone told him that you had drugs in your backpack would you say he had no right to look through it? And are you more mad at the fact that he looked through your phone, or the fact that you got caught cheating?|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	That depends on the School district's policy since it happened on the school's property.  In short yes they can to see if you have any contraband pictures, like answers to test questions on it or pornography on it, or terrorist related material on it.|`|qVuYGiF2aa	If your principal thought you were cheating or you had something bad on it then yes, But if it was just to look then no it would be a invasion of privacy.|`|KBKRYmULaa	im pretty sure they are allowed to. because its on school property and if they think they havea  reason to look through it|`|HWHpgZObaa	Its legal..  But he has no buisness looking through your pictures.|`|2k6lvvfJaa	school laws an shizz here  http://cbize.net/upload/document/pa%20Ch...|`|aOiPMjInaa	if the phone was open to the pictures when he took them he could  or if he had parental permission  but he couldnt have just flipped through your phone  without knowledge from an outside source|`|9MO6Iu1laa	No he is not allowed to do that tslk to someone at your school you trust to tell him he could get fired for invasion of privacy that is not legal.|`|FLZaCrF9aa	yes if he had a reason but if he didn't you could sew him for stalking|`|mVInwaeAaa	if they have a reason to look through them - say you are suspected of something and they have permission from legal authority blah blah that kind of thing.  Then Yes, it is allowed.      However, randomly no.  It would be an invasion of privacy.      I'm no expert on law, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal.|`|tAEvNPydaa	I am a legal lawyer and yes the school can look through a phone. Right after september 11 , 2001 [world trade Center ] the government got scared and gave schools ,hotels and other goverment buildings the right to look through a phone . Sorry about your phone|`|kfFzGftsaa	Well, most principals have broad rights to explore certain things. This is a battle you will not win.    Children have no "rights" to speak of. You are required to be at school by law and your parents are likely to be supportive of the matter.    Additionally, quit your cheating. Learn something, like law for instance, and go out and champion the rights of students in the future.    Sadly, you got busted and have no real remedy.|`|RwsakS9laa	Unfortunately he can. At the beginning of the year you signed a packet that said you teachers and pricible have every right to look through personal devices. He proboly thouhgt that you were texting and so he has to look at.

Disregarding any other good or bad factors, this should kill her off as a candidate.|`|7d2d6d4d7776168256be9f967571c2caaa	When pigs with lipsticks can fly, then yeah, perhaps. Until then, not a chance.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	Only if Joe the Plumber runs with her, wish they would run off the edge of a cliff.|`|ciAAdMd2aa	I would not put money on Palin winning the nomination of the GOP, let alone the presidency.    But anything can happen, I guess.... but she needs to stop whining every time she talks to the press.  Whining is not presidential and she better get a thicker skin in the next few years.|`|gOtoO3vUaa	YES, we can olnly hope. Obama is bad news, she is soooooo much better!!!|`|yjDM4Mzfaa	A chance at what is the real question:  making a bigger fool out of herself than she did this time around, or maybe milking another five of her 15 minutes of fame, or maybe cutting another ghost written book deal for her faithful neocon Repube lemming followers on which to 'feast!'  No more "Gotcha Politics," from Caribou Barbie, please!  Please stick to messing up our last wilderness in the name of big oil and let's not forget field dressing a moose in record time now and then to keep in practice!  Wow, the continued Neocon Repube outright stupidity never ceases to amaze me!|`|q6ka1qEtaa	shyt no|`|cgXX13YVaa	Nope!! Not even a slim chance!|`|V44ARW4maa	she has two chances: Slim and none.|`|WLnIG9H2aa	No but she is a good governor for Alaska.|`|bXR0qdLSaa	Sarah Palin is history,even Mccain refuses to lend his support so i doubt|`|GZXDHVkXaa	ROFLMAO|`|IfR2oaFnaa	HA! NOT A CHANCE! SHES DISGUSTING!|`|9ann8DYGaa	Yes she does!|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I think so..........she just wasn't enough of a politician for a lot of folks.  But she is a quick study!!|`|CifmtBQqaa	I hope so.|`|mgVrAqpkaa	um, no. i don't even think she would win the primary|`|AA12255473	No, with the way the majority is going in this country I don't really believe she has a chance.  I wish she wouldn't have run with McCain because then she might actually have a chance in 2012 if she didn't get pulled down by McCain.  Either way, if she runs, I've be honored to vote for her.|`|AA10137068	lol      i don't think her ego can take any more of a bashing|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Definetly not. She is the reason why McCain lost. Many people were going to vote for McCain changed their minds when they saw how incompetent Palin was, and voted for Obama instead. There's no way she could win if she ran for president. I doubt she'd even make the ballot.    EDIT: The person who said when pigs with lipstick fly- HILARIOUS!|`|qjptIgKZaa	None whatsoever. The media blitzed her like Reggie White on Joe Montana.      Mitt Romney and Bobby Jindal could be the ticket.      I think Sarah should stick to Alaska and run for a Senate seat.  She's still young yet and could have a future that includes the White House.|`|uije8eDraa	Maybe, but two things are going to have to happen.     1. Obama is going to have to do a really bad job to where he loses the support of a significant number of Democrats.     2. Palin is going to have to reinvent herself. The majority of people appear to think she isn't very bright. Even some Republicans think so. She will have to something to make the majority of people change their minds about her. I think she will have a tough time even winning over the Republican Party as a whole. And the Democrats? That would be a miracle.     I doubt if it's possible. But stranger things have happened--Nixon lost to Kennedy and came back to beat Humphrey in 1968.|`|G2auAv1Saa	There is really no accurate answer to this question until 2012.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Sure. She has the same chance a snowball has in hell.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	absolutely!|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Well I think she has a good chance. She is a dynamic and great public speaker who captures the hearts and minds of conservatives all over.|`|RermzbWgaa	Consider how many out there four years before this last election thought Obama had a serious chance?    Time changes things ALOT in politics.  (Political circumstances are not static).    If Obama does very poorly (say Carter-Bush II like) I do think think it matters who the Republican nominee is....I think that person will win.  If Obama does fantastically (say Reaganish in appeal) I do not think any Republican will beat him.  If Obama was mediocre (Bush I or Clinton), and the nation is still divided....then its a open ball game (and if Obama goes left on social issues like guns.....he is very unlikely to take some of the states he took in this last election).    While I may not vote for her right now....yes, I think she has a significant chance.
AA10255776	But he didn't. And we can't. The economy and mortgage debacle had nothing to do with the wars. He's the worst thing that ever happended to this nation so far.  "WinonaGa", your response shows just how underinformed you are. First, you can't declare war on a concept, you declare war on a nation. The "global war on terror" is a concept used as a propaganda tool to convince underinformed people to endlessly fund the military-industrial complex, give up their rights and feel good about doing so. Additionally, you obviosly have no clue as to the conditions in Iraq outside the Green Zone-there are fewer schools, less infrastructure, and less access to utilities than prior to the war. They weren't exactly living in huts, you know.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	He started a war he couldn't win because no one could define what a 'win' is.|`|lEaT5q06aa	if wars are quickly won, they will be laid at the feet of obama    if they are quickly lost, will be tried to be dumped on bush, but will be a split decision    if obama does a johnson: escalation and then not follow through  it will be what i expect|`|6AZpu3p0aa	bush LOST the wars when he invaded -sending US troops in under-manned, under-equipped and without an exit strategy, so we will never know.|`|AA12212403	Both wars?  I think there is only one war, The Global War on Terror.  At any rate, if we win now, Obama will take credit.  Winning is a very difficult thing to determine.  Does winning equate to Osama Bin Laden's head on a silver platter?  Winning, to me, is what we have already done.  We have captured terrorist cells (though Obama will release them so very intelligently), we have set many free from tyranny, schools are built, women have more rights, people can vote, they now have running water and utilities and we have been working on getting them up and running to be on their own.  We won many things and have done great things.  So many have lied and made us out to be villains.  We are not villains.  Have you seen the utube video Dear Mr. Obama?  Look it up.  That guy is my hero, he is the true winner and example for us all.  I'm proud to be an American when I see a guy like him.  I respect him more than any politician out there.|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Wouldn't erase the fact Bush ignored terrorism and national security until terrorists attacked us on 911.Which led to the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	1) Deer-in-the-headlight look on 9/11  2) USA Patriot act  3) Still lied about why we invaded Iraq.  4) Spying on US citizens in the US        Yes he acted, but he betrayed the US Constitution with every decision he made and every action he took.  He took an oath to defend and protect "the constitution of the United States of America" and on that alone he failed miserably.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	We should have never gone into Iraq in the first place.  The eventual outcome, whatever that is, won't change that fact.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	Once people reach down and grab their ankles and pull their heads out of their azz' they will see he was a great President.|`|5rL4njnxaa	There will always be people who think we should have never gone to war in one or both places.  But the disaster that was the Bush Administration didn't just go into questionable wars but they do it with perfect incompetence.      He would be more successful if he hadn't have bungled everything but I can' imagine him ever being considered among the best of anything.|`|8vHWUmR9aa	Iraq is won and Afganistan is on its way.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Funny thing is we actually did "win" these wars...    I mean seriously, look in the dictionary..look in history.    You destroy a country, their leadership, their weapons, their buildings, their infrastructure, their army... What else would you call that? We won the war in less then a week.    HOWEVER  What made Bush so terrible is he thought he could rebuild a country in our image like some old school colonial emperor. Thats why the world hated him, not the war..but the occupation.    Uness Americans were willing to move to Iraq, inter-marry with the people and impose our culture....thats the only way to achieve what our "mission" was. Of course thatd never happen, so we were doomed from the start.    But to make pretend and say "bush won 2 wars in office" and be all simple about it. I still say itd make him mediocre at best, that wouldnt change his lousy domestic record one bit.|`|XzStbSPnaa	If monkeys had typewriters sooner or later they would eventually write a novel.

Wait, they already do.|`|eef76b61eca737b62766034d9204c8baaa	History will decide NOT you.|`|jXlOhFfdaa	if Obama win the wars that even makes his reputation worse. it means that he was simply incapable of winning the wars, and Obama (or any other president) was. It will be better for his reputation if Obama doesn't win the war. then it's gonna be that no one could actually win the war. so it wasn't something within anyone's reach, after all. that makes his image at least better. but i want the war to end as soon as possible (i want a victory though).
Rlvo5P9maa	He figured if you ignore it it'll go away.|`|Z03zgM0maa	I don't know if it was preventable. I think the terrorists were bound to carry out an attack no matter what.

Why didn't Clinton do more?  He knew about Al Quida for 7 years.    He warned Bush about Al Quida, not about what they were doing.  He destroyed the intelligence community because they didn't feel good to him and his ivory tower elite supporters, and so he didn't know what they were doing.    Poor try, bush hating bigot, you can't legitimately cover 7 years of knowledge about the problem and blame someone with 7 months just because you like the first and hate the second.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	because even as the 9/11 comission stated     By the time Bush took office there was no real chance to stop the attacks as they were already in operation mode.

He was playing GOLF!!!!!!!!   Because of that missed opportunity....3,000 Americans died on September 11, 2001....THAT is how President Clinton KNEW to warn President Bush.

I'm sure that you were at least 100 miles away pissing your pants cowering under a desk.  Regardless of what left-wing newspaper articles you post the fact is that you were not there and have no concept of what happened on that day.  Actually IF the US had forced the '93 WTC Bombers to stand Military Trial INSTEAD of a PROLONGED civilian trial ( as they did ) the US would have obtained the intelligence re: Obama & his  9/11 plans would have been known to us when Clinton had ( but passed up ) the opportunity to eliminate  Obama on that fateful Sunday.  As a result of 9/11; I have been diagnosed with emphysema & neither Bush nor Obama has yet to address the medical problems of first responders.  You should be ashamed of  yourself for insulting the memory of the 3,000 innocent civilains who died on that day.

People elected him to do a job, and that job is to uphold the law.|`|l89iLUbsaa	Perhaps because Sheriff Joe wanted to actually catch someone and didn't want ICE to have the chance to warn them he was coming.|`|HYVCjjtaaa	It makes Bulk very ~>>~ and green, to see those illegales trample down our laws, and to see "Ramons" & "Manuels" working for USCIS,...~>>~...Next thing they will make mexican~Spanish an official language in USCIS offices...~>>~|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Why wasn't there any immigration agents present during AZ Sheriff's latest raid?  Did he accidentally forget to inform them? Why do you think he didn't have any ICE agents there?  Oh! Wait! PHOENIX - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) allowing deputies to perform immigration law enforcement functions as permitted by Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That's why!  http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/...    Suspected of being illegally in the country"....so does he think he's doing AZ residents a favor by holding people that are keeping this business going, and maybe just having 2 or 3 of them being actually illegally in the country?  Or is it identity theft as stated in your own article? You cited it! Did you read it? Where was this "Suspected of being in the country illegally"?   He is doing AZ residents a favor by helping to rid AZ of criminals! That is why he was elected! Here in AZ we believe in getting rid of criminals instead of looking the other way!|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	he is the sherriff.  he has the authority.  he only needs ICE when he has to prove his case.  thank you Arizona for protecting us.|`|AA10382849	Maybe you should read the article.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a law enforcement officer and that's exactly what he was doing, enforcing the laws.|`|AA10123414	Funny, the article never uses the line "Suspected of being illegally in the country". It does indicate they were arrested for identity theft. The sheriff does not need ICE to arrest people for violation of state law.    "...so does he think he's doing AZ residents a favor by holding people that are keeping this business going..." - Nope, bt I'm sure he is doing the victims of identity theft a huge favor.|`|wdxTxXHOaa	we need more sheriff joes|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Any Sheriff's Dept. or State Police agency can get trained in immigration enforcement under the federal 287 g program. They are then legally able to detain people solely on immigration charges. This is an excellent program that more American police department's should join in order to fight the illegal alien invasion.    Sheriff Joe of AZ is a hero to most Americans!
Ca8i226Xaa	No, but with the liberal fascists in total control of our govt, anything is possible. Cafferty is correct about Pelosi. Pelosi is a certfiable loon and Obama has been keeping his emotions in check for so long, I'm afraid that he's going to explode one day!    Did you know that it was progressives (liberals) in the early 20th century who were behind the Eugenics movement in the USA? It's true. I read about it in the book: Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning,   by Jonah Goldberg, (Doubleday, 2007).  http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-Am...    Liberal Racism: The Eugenic Ghost in the fascist Machine  Im not saying that people who once called themselves progressives were racist and therefore those who call themselves progressives today are racist, too. Rather, the point is that the edifice of contemporary liberalism stands on a foundation of assumptions and ideas integral to the larger fascist moment. Contemporary liberals, who may be the kindest and most racially tolerant people in the world, nonetheless choose to live in a house of distinctly fascist architecture. Liberal ignorance of this fact renders this fascist foundation neither intangible nor irrelevant. Rather, it underscores the success of these ideas, precisely because they go unquestioned.

The CIA training the Shah's secret police that tortured and killed Iranian dissidents. The CIA killing Iranian dissidents. The US providing Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons and helicopters to drop chemical weapons, which Saddam used against Iran in 1983-1987, killing 100,000 and wounding 200,000.

1CVOHoapaa	I'm English. I don't apologise for that. When asked for a nationality on forms I always put British. I can understand some of the feelings that make devolution popular for the Scots but it has always seemed to me that the people who advocate it are looking backwards not forwards.  We have been a british people for hundreds of years. The UK was formed 301 years ago! I believe that we are inter dependant and that that is a good thing.  Regional assemblies seem to work and gives control of aspects of government to the local people. That seems good.  In times of trouble we have pulled together as one nation and I think that it is the best way forward.  A fully devolved Scotland would not be able to sustain the benefits it has seen with partial governance under the regional assembly. The national income could not cope.   That is my view. Obviously there will be others! LOL|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I suppose from a Scottish point of view, you have good natural resources and surely being independent from other countries will help strengthen your economy?

An eminent politician in 1880 said;Sell the masses a dream and they will feed off it like someone in a twilight world devoid of all reality.You do not mention who and how it will be paid for;But keep selling that dream to the masses!  The question I ask in all honesty is;Will Scotland be able to self finance their own Pension schemes,Benefits Systems,Defence,and other programmes without having to rely on the  English Taxpayer.  Anyone with one ounce of honesty will say!The English taxpayers have done their bit.It is now up to the Belgian,French,Dutch and Italian taxpayer to take up some of the strain especially after the oil runs out in 30years time.  Let Scotland prove that it can stand alone without having to sponge off others!|`|8NqQvOqQaa	i agree  im from scotland and i dont think theres any point in making scotland independant  its much better being with the rest of the uk|`|c5ca3ca881510b113bbfaa1ef922d149aa	Scots have a false idea of independence, they have far more cash given them than any other part of Britain. If we can`t all have the same as the Scots,ie free university education, free care for the elderly, free priscriptions, medical treatment  the rest of us are unable to have. They have split Britain into parts. I am not anti Scots but the UK cannot remain united until we all receive the same treatment. Go it alone, who will pay for it all?

This woman has been a member of the parliament for decades and she has been a minister for years. She is the parliamentarian who most Icelandic people trust at the moment, so she is probably the best leader available for the new government.    The previous government wasn't functioning anymore and wasn't doing enough to deal with the current economic crisis and the nation lost its patience, which is why a new government is being appointed now temporarily until elections will be held in the spring.

The guy has never been more in the limelight.|`|liJKE5B2aa	Great band from Canada.|`|AA10578359	Rush is a ____blowhard____ but it does not change the fact that this stupid "fairness doctrine" or whatever they are trying to call it does stifle the voice of the opposition.    After all, who is listening to the liberal radio?  Is there liberal talk-radio hosts?  I've not heard any.    To tell anyone in the USA that their opinion is not valid is wrong.  Even if it is Rush Limbaugh, or Bill O'Reiley, or that Don Imus guy.  As long as they don't say things that are untrue, then they are entitled to their opinion.    Shame on anyone who believes that just because you don't agree, you should be able to silence someone else.  That's the same as the thumbs down for a good answer that just happens to differ from what you believe.  Not very sensible.    The USA was made so that people could say what they believe.  Isn't it wonderful that we can?  Isn't it pathetic that some people don't 'get it'?|`|lEaT5q06aa	it is a matter of squashing the opposition,|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	I was attacking Rush and thinking he was an idiot long before Obama even announced he was running for President.    So no - I think it has a lot more to do with Rush being a self-centered idiot that cares about nothing more than his opinion.|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Yes, they want to silence any opposition!|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Rush is an entertainer, nothing more.  If he wasn't being controversial then what would his show be?  He made an outlandish comment for a response.  He's gotten tons of free advertising for his show as a result and that was probably the intent to begin with.  If Republicans are looking for Rush to be the new leader of the GOP they'll be disappointed.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, as a republican I have had it with that big headed ogre. We have the dumbest people in our party. Today Ted Haggard went on Oprah & said he spoke with President Bush every single day. Palin is not a good representative, Rove, Cheney. They are making fools of all republicans not just the ones who can't see this so I agree we should get decent people in the party if we want to be known for being the party of values...only kidding, no republican would admit that. Rush attacks himself everyday. Once day he will have a heart attack & it will all be quieted on it's own.|`|6AZpu3p0aa	Nope.    For the last 8 years anyone that dared to question bush or his administartion heard the screech of "TRAITOR".    Now limpbaugh comes right out and said he wants obama to "fail" and all of a sudden you sycophants are concerned about "silencing anyone who opposes this administration."    Why the flip flop?|`|93r3nCM1aa	Omg why are people so concerned with Limbaugh? WHO CARES!    Rush can just continue his radio show as usual, and all the liberal puss ies freaking out about it can just shut up and let him have his free speech.    And yes, I am actually a liberal, I just think it's ridiculous to waste time petitioning a radio show. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. That's always worked for me.|`|AA10123414	No one in the Obama administration has done anything to silence Rush.    Perhaps you should read some of the articles in your link to see what was actually said, you know instead of assuming Rush is being impartial about the whole thing.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	It's not just Rush, it's conservatism. Rush is just the most popular voice of conservatism and they are trying make him look bad. Since they can't beat conservatism in the realm of ideas they have to attack and slander people with lies and half truths. I used to buy their B.S. until I actually started thinking beyond their superficial attacks and looked deeper.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	bravo you are `100% correct in your question|`|1amF7oNwaa	Liberals have a hugh problem.  Most people in this country do not like what they want to do.  Because of this they have to hide the details of their programs and paint them in such a way that Americans will buy them.  People like Rush expose them and they hate that.    Liberals believe people are dumb and need the government to look after them and tell them what to do.|`|u23sBafTaa	Yes That is exactly what it is !

He thinks he is going to get in every ones face and intimidate them into doing it his way !  Some of his ACORN tactics he taught in Illinois !|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Interesting how Rush was a cheerleader for Bush's failed policies and prolonged his screed with vitriol when describing those who dissented as unpatriotic.  Can't have it both ways.|`|k6hicodfaa	Limbaugh said: "We are being told we have to hope he succeeds, that we have to bend over and grab our ankles... because his father was black, because he's the first black president, we've got to accept this.

How sad that it could actually work.|`|WLnIG9H2aa	It goes way beyond Limbaugh. It's the left's desire to achieve their goal of a totalitarianism system where you cannot voice opposing views.

AA10025824	World Wars I and II were caused by some pretty complicated conflicts that would take some reading to answer.  Simplifying it wouldn't be fair to you.  Maybe you could read a short synopsis of them to understand.    World War 3 hasn't happened, and hopefully no government is stupid enough to start it.  We have avoided a world war for over 60 years due partly to luck, and fear, and believe it or not the common sense it takes to avoid it.  Two nuclear bombs on Japan scared people and brought the devastating consequences to reality and hopefully it's never forgotten and never happens again.  And a World War 4 is probably not possible after a World War 3 because there may be no one left to fight it.  Except for the cockroaches I guess.|`|ufb32uRdaa	World war 1 started when the crown prince of austria was assasinated.  World war 2 started when germany invaded poland and attacked france.  World war 3 has not yet happened but it might because of growing tension among countries regarding oil, economy, religion.  World war 4 don't even worry abt it. Because if there will ever be world war 3 there won't be anything left for world war 4. World war 3 will be the ultimate doom for the world. Don't listen to creationists.

You didn't earn the money so you have no right to take advantage of someone else's mistake. It's just wrong. Technically speaking if you have been issued a second check, the first check would have a stop put on it and would be worthless. So even if the place found the check later, they wouldn't be able to cash it. However, they will have records and it could come back and bite you if they decide to pursue it in court. Also, your employer would have to pay the bank to put a stop on the check (in most cases) and I'm sure they will want to know why. If one day you lose your check for real, it could maybe raise some eyebrows. So, in the short term, it could be done but there may be consequences for doing it.

Because they are opportunists.  They would elect Osama Bin Laden if they thought it was the only way that they could win.

DTSUJe2oaa	Florida: If an individual is under 18 years of age, but older than 16 years of age, a marriage license can be obtained with parental consent.      If a parent has sole custody or the other parent is dead, the permission of one parent is sufficient.      If a person is under the age of 16, the marriage license has to be issued by a county judge, with or without parental permission.      If a minor's parents are both deceased and there is not an appointed guardian, he/she may apply for a marriage license. A minor who has been previously married may also apply for a license.      A minor who swears that they have a child or are expecting a baby, can apply for a license if the pregnancy has been verfied by a written statement from a licensed physician. A county court judge may at his/her discretion issue or not issue a license for them to marry.      Pre-Marital Course Providers will be charged a one time fee of $4.00~|`|cEZ3T6iyaa	Before you marry this man, why not get a life?  You bring nothing to the relationship because you do not have an independent id.  He is obviously enlisted and makes chump change, housing on base for enlisted sucks, What are you going to do while he is gone all the time? You are not going to travel with him unless he is in the band and gets stationed at h&I.  Grow up and bring something to this.  You are going to have to go to work, so why not get an education!  Worry about tying the knot and making babies, when you can afford them.
iaugc41aaa	DT has correctly stated the position for Scotland.  In England/Wales the age for contracts is the age of majority - 18.  There is, however, an important exception: a minor may still legally enter into a contract for (and be sued for) "necessities".  What constitutes a necessity is not fixed, but may fluctuate over time.    For a service, that is similar to a mobile phone service but isn't one, it is unlikely that there will be a binding contract, but only a court can properly determine the question.  I have no wish to pry and so will not ask what the service is, but detail would enable a fuller reply.    One other thing to note.  You may be able to avoid liability on this contract, but a note will be made on your credit rating and when of full age that may just come back to haunt you.    EDIT - "on thin ice" and I are in accord on this one.  I know that, as a lawyer, I should be more of a pedant and, when dealing with lawyers, often am.  In those instances I would, of course, use the legal term of "necessaries" but, when dealing with the public at large, have adopted a plainer English style.    My colleague has, however, clarified the legal position with a useful example without once ever mentioning fancy waistcoats (a case we all had to learn when studying law).|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	YES being as you where under 18 at the time of signing it does void the contract.    Had the same bs with my son, who LOOKED over 18 but was in fact almost 16 at time of signing but as he had a bank account they just assumed........... when they tried to take out extra money from his account to pay for "extras" I stepped in.    Just a wild guess here but is it a cell phone contract??? as it was with my son.    Step back and let you parents deal with this, best bet is to start with the shop / place you signed the contract first of all and then if they are taking extra from a bank account, have them go there and place a stop on all monies going to them.    Good luck, took me a day of sorting it out but even got the money back they had took due to him being under age.|`|fvkbwtPSaa	If you're in Scotland, the age of legal capacity is sixteen, at which point you can enter into several types of contract (although not a house purchase, or anything where the statutory minimum age is 18) - Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1995.    May be different in England, though, but there is not one age covering the whole UK.|`|65c830b566c8cb5f9d618316e611c8beaa	Not knowing what the 'contract' is for it is difficult to give a precise answer as if you are liable or not but in England / Wales the position is that contracts for what are called 'necessaries' are enforceable but others are not.     Trying to keep it simple what it means is that if you have entered into something that is necessary for you, in your situation taking into account your age, your life style, possibly your educational or employment situation, then maybe it will be enforceable, even though you are under 18 yrs at the time of entering into it. The situation will also depend if, after you are 18yrs does a person take any steps to, in effect, endorse and acknowledge that contract by continuing with it after reaching 18yrs.    Edit: For the legally minded: I see 'old holl' has made a similar contribution but just to be slightly pedantic. There is a subtle and important legal difference between the words 'necessaries' and 'necessities'. That is why I say your own life style is a consideration. It may be 'necessary' for an under 18yr  Prince to have a gold pen but it is not a necessity as a biro would achieve the same purpose, on the other hand a gold pen would not be necessary to  the ordinary, average under 18yr person working in a supermarket but a biro would unless they already had loads of them. The Prince's contract for a gold pen would likely be enforceable, whilst it is not necessary for the supermarket worker to have a gold pen.

In N.H., for example, you do not need proof of insurance unless you're involved in a collision for which you could be liable. Many motor vehicles are also exempt from needing a "drivers license" to operate, especially if not being operated on a public way, and the same goes for proof of registration; sometimes you need it, sometimes you don't.    However, to operate a motor vehicle on a public way you generally need to have a current license and registration, as well as any number of vehicle safety requirements (brakes being universal) as may be relevant (lights after dark, windshield and seatbelts if not antique, etc).|`|z88IMXNFaa	License  Registration  Proof of Insurance    Lack of any one of these will earn you a ticket.|`|mkEGjlmNaa	1.

That is what the court is going to ask you.    I know the idea is to get the car and get out of there before the driver has the opportunity to get inside the vehicle but you tell this like you did nothing but stand there. Why?    The judge will want her to show cause and you will have to show you did nothing to assault her.     Obviously they will assume you were trying to arrest her. You have to make it sure that you did not do that either. And for goodness sake do not admit if you had a firearm on you.    I have friends in the repo business.    You should be fine.    You are not the first person to be accuse thus and you will not be the last person.    Good Luck.     edit.    In the other states you do not have to wait for the police.    In other states it is common practice to tow cars as a team, one person as a look lut so that the driver does not jump in to the vehicle. If the driver does so, the law in other states says that you must unhook the vehicle.    As for the term arrest, the definition of arrest is the detainment or obstruction of one from their free egress or ingress. It does not mean that you tried to cuff her or pretend like she did anything wrong. It merely means you got in her way so as to impede her movement. Don't be surprised if her lawyer accuses you of this.    And in many place, apparently not NJ they shoot at repo persons so the tow truck drivers carry firarms, normally with permits, to protect themselves. Knowing this happens makes it necessary to touch on the subject.    And regardless of what type of tow truck you have, if she jumps in the car, she can again claim false arrest and or kidnapping.    The point of your question was what can she do legally to you and is it serious.    The point of my answer is these are some of the things she can do but the courts have seen them before and absent in agravating evidence or testimony you should be fine.    I am curious as to what you partner was calling the police for. This was not an orange tag repo where the city told you to do it,(or was it), and if it was then that is another good reason the city will not look kindly on her complaint. In that case it may never make it to court.    Again, good luck.
X8vWJIAjaa	He probably would have just pulled you over rather than mailing anything to you. Are you sure it wasn't a mall rent-a-cop? if it was, all he could do is call the real police and give them your plate number and they would come over to your home and act as if they could arrest you (which they can't) just to make it sink in to your head that you can't do donuts in a parking lot. Don't worry so much. The worst case scenario is that you get a talking to.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	He would have pulled you over. I don't think you have anything to worry about. Good luck.
V74QiNi3aa	Yes,I believe that we should remain as part of the Commonwealth.    This is part of who we are as a nation, in the grand picture of things, Canada is still a very young Country.  If you do not mind I will give you an analogy of what I mean.    A child is born and it remains, grows, and learns from its parents(before confederation).   When that child get to be an adolescent it starts to venture out a bit on its own (ie: where this Country was before the Constitutional accord).  As the child grows into the upper teens it starts to make its own mistakes but still ask for information, and guidance from their parents. (where we are today as a country).  I believe that until we grow enough to form our own style of government ( one that is truly Canadian) we should remain connected to the Monarchy.  When we do achieve that point in our growth as a nation then we should ask for a complete separation from them as we would be mature enough to get that type of blessing from our parent.    Canadian should keep in mind that in World history we were the first  Country to ever achieve our independence without a civil war against Britain.

8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	In my city, you show up for court and plead guilty or not guilty.    If you plead not guilty, it gets set for trial on another day.  The officer will not be there at all when you plead guilty or not guilty.
u6ALw1gAaa	When you get to court the prosecutor will call the docket (which is a list of names of the people with cases that day).  Usually the prosecutor wants you to answer to your name one of three ways, guilty, not guilty, or the name of your lawyer.  This may very depending on where you go to court.  Don't worry if you answer not guilty because you can change your plea later.      Most likely the Officer will come to court if there is going to be a trial.  In my jurisdiction that is the only time I go to court.  I have cases on the docket almost every day, but I only go to court on days that I am subpoenaed for a trial.  This may be different depending on how court is run in your area.  Officers rarely miss court for a number of reasons, we get paid to go to court, we have to go to court or we could get written up, we have an interest in seeing our cases prosecuted, and most of all we don't want to get in trouble with the judge.      You can usually work something out with the prosecutor, like pleading to a lesser charge.
RANWeh9Uaa	When one shows weakness to a terrorists they receive demands like this. It is called a test of their mustard.

I will say about obama is that he doesn't walk it like he talks it. somehing happened in his meeting with bush in the transition, he all the sudden decided he's going to do the same thing and continue bush's wars and worse yet for the same reasons. this shows the world that obama too believes the rhetoric and politics that the world is evil and not worth saving or some such. or that these places are evil the bad demons with horns that you claim they think you are and want to kill all of you. something like that. watch princess mononoke, it explains all.     not only do you demand apologies of people, you demand they leave thier country and turn it over to you and if they don't you kill hundreds of thousands of people, you demand they have technologies approved by you, you demand they impose laws you say, you demand how much china should value it's currency, so don't act like asking you for an apology is an outlandish state of affairs that's just your perspective cause you think you're better than everyone else. a common feeling. something about the self and the ego.|`|BJhOd2usaa	No, of course he won't.

Doing things right is not the way to fast money. Problem is though fast money is just and only that..........fast.    God forbid anyone ever tried saving money and being prudent. Or even actually building something. You're looked down upon like an antichrist.     Well, you reap what you sew. Yea, i think alot of ppl should have listened and paid attention. Now they'll see the consequences of their actions(and nonactions) first hand.     Funny thing is, this could have been avoided altogether 6 yrs ago. That's when it showed its teeth ppl.    All of this has been done Intentionally. They played on your greed instead of innovation. They knew most ppl's greed would win out over everything and anything else. All in the name of the fast buck, completely crushing what was being built for the betterment. They suceeded. And they can go to hell.     We need to scrap them. And send them to packing.      That article(in very many ways) is spot on.    "Manipulation" hmmm.|`|lEaT5q06aa	i agree    storm is in front of us and not behind|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	DAR, the info you've provided these two years has elevated nearly to the status of "law" the theory that our system - especially the sincerity of the R & D parties - is broken.     I got through about 2/3's of the linked article; but the author lost all credibility in assuming that the line dividing our Nation can be drawn between the "two" parties.     Were he steeped a bit more in Locke, Washington, Jefferson,  Madison, Franklin, etc, he'd have drawn a bold line around unconstrained government and its abuses, correctly seeing the divide as between the People and a single entity with two masks doing the "good cop/bad cop" routine.     Beyond that, his analysis of the financial debacle is pretty well spot-on. Much sharper than most I've read, he charges the recklessness of central banks with the lion's share of the blame.      Still, there is a mounting uneasiness over what can be done about it.     We are out of time, here.     The "2010 vote" looms like the "Armaggedon" meteor. Either we splinter the party collusion then, or time runs out and our Liberties and economy suffer its full impact.     I appreciate the link. Thanks.     But what, when and how? We have a massive threat to counter.    ...    Edit: I agree and hope I didn't imply otherwise.     Let me be the first to admit: I hold every indication that their divisive propaganda has sabotaged our weapons of logic and discrimination of fact to be as heinous as any other forcible (or stealth) disarmament by any would-be usurper of free-thought and discussion.     I'm not angry at the author but at the paramount presence of "a lie, repeated often enough" to be regarded as true by so many.    I'll try to watch my tone. Keep me on my toes.     Thx.     ...|`|x97ktCqwaa	That is very interesting.  Very true.  People who have lived through this know what is going on.  Wish other people would wake up to the facts!

The GOP will slowly collapse like a flan in the back of the cupboard.

He's just like McCain with all his moderate views on issues that a majority of real Republicans have a consensus on.    The GOP needs a hardline Conservative who will reach to the moderates, not a moderate who will try and reach both ways.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	I am not a Republican but I don't think the Democrat have the answer     either.  I think the US is in for a very bumpy ride    Many well established companies like GM Chrysler and Ford have hit    the skids.    I can see a whole lot of problems with this country with approaching    socialism and a National Dept that will keep the future generations    slaves to this trillion dollar anchor.    So maybe the Republicans and Democrats better regroup and come up    with a solution as time is running out for the good old USA|`|otYOxmnuaa	If they were smart, they'd sit back and watch the Dems continue to run the Country into the ground until the people get so pissed they march on D.C. w/ pitchforks and torches.    www. cbo. gov - The graph on the main page sums up Obama's approach -- deep deep in the red when we don't need to go there.    Adding 10 Trillion dollars to our national debt certainly isn't a good start.    The more one considers the matter, the clearer it becomes that redistribution is in effect far less a redistribution of free income from the richer to the poorer, as we imagined, than a redistribution of power from the individual to the State.  Bertrand de Jouvenel      I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.  Thomas Jefferson    I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on the objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.  James Madison    A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been about 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: '>From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.

By the way, bankrupting the evil empire was not a failure.      But you would have liked it if the U.S.S.R. had defeated America and the idea that government is servant to the people.      What is it about servitude that you like most?  That you're given cradle to grave subsistence?  Don't you have the personal pride to achieve great things?      America was about greatness.  Yet you rejoice in mediocrity.      No wonder Yahweh says he'll spew the lukewarm out of his mouth.      Even I find you distasteful.

OYtoM9fXaa	I prefer to think of it as the religion of pieces, as that's what's left after one of its more zealous adherents blows himself up and takes a few dozen bystanders with him...all because he's mad that someone claimed that Islam isn't peaceful.    Libby:  Please cite an example of a case of terrorism perpetrated in the name of Christianity during the last eight years.  On the off chnace that you are able to do so, I can name literally thousands of them committed in the name of Islam.    Libby:  First, there are NO terrorist attacks in Iran.  None, nada, zilch.  If you mean Iraq, get it straight.  Assuming that's what you meant, let me remind you that Christianity has neither a foreign policy nor a military, sovereign nations do.  The United States is a secular, multicultural sovereign nation.  It is not a "Christian nation" in any sense other than that a plurality of its people profess Christianity.  There are Jews,  Muslims, and non-believers in Congress as well as in the military.  If you can't tell the difference between a religion and a nation, I feel nothing but pity for you and the pathetic state of your education.|`|t82AcQT1aa	we should "help" them on their journey to the other side.|`|V03nUMXBaa	It is unfair to base an opinion about an entire religion based on one member of its faith.

"the enemy of my enemy is my friend"  is the liberals train of thought.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Many religions are only peaceful only if you adhere to their principals and remain in their inner circle.|`|POygTyTAaa	Unfortunately, the crimes of the last eight years during the Bush administration have created havoc on the reputation of true Christians.  Unfortunately the Bush years have made Christians look more like a terrorist group of mass murderers rather than a peace loving religion. We have to rebuild our reputation as a nation and as Christians.    edit for Islam:  There has been a terrorist attack in Iraq everyday since 2002.  Bush called it a necessary war.  It was a war by a nation of Christians.    edit for Islam:  You would be a complete idiot to debate my educational level with yours unless you have a PhD.  I was attacking the Bush administration.  Even in the race for the White House, "Muslim" was a bad word.  We are a nation of multi-ethnicities, however, the "Christian" coalition is the first to specify another other religion that that of Jesus Christ to be evil.  The way the world looks at us is a nation of evil-doers (and if we are mostly Christians on a high horse, then that is how Christian extremists are viewed) terrorists so to speak, to get what we want in the name of God.  Does that sound any different that Al Qaeda or look any different in the eyes of other nations?  Been out of the country in the last eight years.  I have been out of the country at least a dozen times, and you can guess what the reputation of America is.  And if you want to debate terrorism in Iraq, go ahead.  However, if the war was here, and innocent Americans were getting killed, would that not be terrorism?  How is it different?    My guess is that you are the uneducated one, otherwise, you would not be trying so hard to prove yourself.  Let me guess, you spent 9 weeks in BUDS training, did a couple of tours in Iraq, watch FOX Noise, took a couple of classes on terrorism & homeland security at the local community college, and sleep with a Rush Limbaugh blow up doll.  That certainly doesn't qualify you as a world traveller or an authority on international public opinion.

Our whole economy was being propped up by cheap money. The illusion of a healthy economy was just that. Job growth was stunted, wages were not increasing, people were being overwhelmed by the high cost of energy and medical care any  everything was being purchased on credit. This was not something that suddenly sprang up. It was something that has been brewing for quite some time that only came to light in the past year. It is the conservatives unfathomable belief in Reaganomics or what George Bush called "voodoo economics that got us here. . You can thank Obama for listening to the   Republicans, but I really don't even want to hear what they have to say .I think it is  time to stop listening to the conservatives who have been wrong on everything from the economy to the Iraq war to social issues.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Republicans!!!

There is no one answer that has brought our country & the world to where we are today, but it's a way of life that we have been living mostly. Overspending on things that are really not needed is a big thing. The Dems. along with Barney Frank and the Fannie May type deals really brought this to a head. Some Repubs. were sounding alarm bells over 4yrs. ago & again 2yrs. ago...good ol Barney was saying last summer everything was fine with the way Fannie was lending $$ to people with no $$ down to buy homes..Our Pres. Bush should have stepped in then to have set the record straight...all of the banking deregulation, easy lending along with, wall street bankers being allowed to buy on margin( little % of money down to buy stocks) ran up and overpriced the prices of stocks caught up to the country...then add in the crooks like Madoff and that's what brought us to where we are...Trillions have been lost..in the current deflation that is not finished yet..most of the Repubs. seem to be awake now, but the Dems are just trying to spend our way out of this...wrong call..all government should be cutting spending now..all spending... yrs. from now these times will be called the Great Depression II     and both parties, if they survive will blame the other for it

These are a few examples in the $825 BILLION (and counting!), over 1,588 page stimulus bill. Nancy Pelosi argues this bill would stimulate the economy, however only 7 percent of the legislation actually goes towards infrastructure - the rest of the bill reads like a taxpayer funded payoff to groups that have supported liberal interests.      And what a pay off! ACORN, the long controversial group that purposefully tried to muck up last year's elections to benefit the liberals is being rewarded by Pelosi with potentially $4.19 BILLION in taxpayer funds. And more than 10 percent of the proposal-$87 billion-would be directed to groups like Planned Parenthood!   What a scheme!  The country's recession is crippling families, and their solution is spending billions of dollars on contraception?  Who are we kidding here?|`|s25Dh5RVaa	It's not.

First--anybody can "claim" anything they want. Actions--not words--are what count.    Second, the Constitution (especially the Bill of Rights) was written to protect citizens FROM the government. The whole point, beyond the mechanics of authorizing basic institutions like Congress, the courts, and the presidency--is to RESTRAIN the government.    Take a look at the wording of the Constitution. It's clear at every turn. The Constitution speaks of rights belonging to the people--never of the government granting rights. Everywhere you see it repeated again and again and again: the government may not do this, and this, and this.    "Government in its best state is but a necessary evil--and in its worst state an intolerable one"  --Thomas Paine  "Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time--and the government when it deserves it"  --Mark Twain|`|AA10031161	I think it's entirely possible... depending on their perception of what is best for the nation and the observer's perspective...    As a conservative, I feel that the liberal mindset is dangerous to the vitality and strength of this nation (US)..... so to me, the liberal activist movement is far from patriotic....    But then, I can see their side, as well- They (very possibly) feel that the conservative mindset is dangerous to the unity and compassion of this nation, and some liberals may even consider me to be unpatriotic.      Does that make any sense?|`|VDgAJETtaa	LOL, we just got rid of one|`|YYpI9Md9aa	You are seeing it now. The liberals are traitors.

It has been happening since Lincoln and the passing of the14th amendment.    When freedom of speech is gone, and the right to protect yourself from the government (2nd Amendment), and the government starts implementing things no  matter what the populous wants, then the people will finally start to realize, except the people that want the government taking care of them like mom and dad.|`|NHstEhMtaa	The founders believed that government was the enemy.  That's why they wrote the darn thing.|`|ZbnVjxQOaa	Government, federal or state or local, is the only possible enemy of the Constitution. The purpose of writing a Constitution was to lay down the groundwork for governing, specifying the limits of power for each of the three branches, etc. The Constitution primarily restrains gov't. from running rampant.  The Bill of Rights, without which, the Constitution would not have been ratified, enumerates several of the rights retained by citizens and states. In that aspect, it should be considered to be part of the Constitution, rather than amendments.  When you consider this question, consider who would be an enemy of the Constitution. Only a government which wanted to become tyranical and insert itself into every facet of its citizens life.  Jefferson once lamented, "I fear we have made the Constitution a blank paper by construction". Even in his time, politicians were finding ways to stretch the Constitution.  Look at the "necessary and proper" clause (Art. ISec.8, Clause 19) for Congress. It means what it says, "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers...". However it has been stretched into meaning Congress shall have the power to make all laws necessary and proper, not limited to their powers.  That is how we no longer have hard money (gold and silver), but use the Federal Reserve System (Unconstitutional) as printer of worthless paper currency (Unconstitutional).  It is gov't., federal primarily, which has consistently subverted the Constitution. It hasn't been the citizens who have undermined it, it has been the Feds. Government is the only real enemy of the Constitution because it restrains them.  As our life is now, the only Amendment which is not violated on a daily basis is that forbidding the quartering of troops in homes. And those violations are from gov't., no one else.|`|QCspoMFMaa	i like bill, super, and liberty answers    of course government can be an enemy of the constitution, even if they they swear an oath to defend it.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Yes, that's why the framers considered the possibility of the necessity to overthrow an unjust government by use of a militia.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Anyone can claim they are patriotic.  The word is meaningless now.    Just look at the assaults on the Constitution of the past 8 years.  Remember that the purpose of a constitution is to create limitations to arbitrary and abusive exercise of governmental powers.  The very definition of dictatorship is a government not restricted by a constitution.  No matter how benevolent the dictator or how he organizes the government, without a constitution he is a dictator.     That alone should lead you to only one logical conclusion: that constitutions and authoritarians are mutual antagonists.  They are enemies.

LTS3GCpQaa	I grew up on a beef farm in Ontario Canada  --- and I really didn't believe that was beef in those burgers and neither did anyone I knew      We all thought it was some sort of soy bean press --- and so we avoided it McDonalds doesn't do well in farming communities -- in fact for them to do well it has to be at least a large town with a stable town population which has nothing to do with the agricultural industry in order to survive      Who eats fast food ? City people do --- poor city dwellers to perhaps the middle class who view it as an occasional treat --- that is who eats the crap      ------------------     I came to the city --- and one of my first jobs in the middle of this big 4 million person city was to herd cattle into their last destination ---     I worked oddly at one of the biggest suppliers of Kosher meats --and "Hal all " meats (spelling ??)      The place next door had the contract to supply McDonald's with beef --so I and all my friends were wrong -- there is actually beef in those burgers      How much --- ? I am not sure at all because they sell their beef to a company called 100 % pure beef -- it is a name not an informative statement      So how much beef and what the hell the rest of the "burger"  is made of I have no idea at all      --------------- One of my friends did look into it --- and long story short she said if you go to McDonald's eat the box it came in and throw out the contents because she really was sure that the box was made of paper and better for you.       There is a documentary out there called super size this --- and it shows a man getting sicker and sicker -- mental problems health problems etc      Then another documentary out there called super high -- that guy is fine no health or emotional problems      Conclusion ?     Go to McDonald's -- eat the box throw away the contents --- go home get stoned and make something from scratch in your own kitchen ---- that is if you want to live      If you want to die --- then eat the contents of the happy meal and never touch dope|`|Rlvo5P9maa	The quarter pounder is pretty good...

eiVlnKgNaa	Obama economic adviser admits Republicans plan is better?  The substitute bill, sponsored by House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, would create 6.2 million jobs through 2010, according to its Republican backers, compared with just 3.2 million jobs claimed under the House Democratic bill to be voted on Wednesday evening.    Democrats rejected the analysis, saying the plan's reliance on tax cuts amounted to the same old song we always hear from Republicans, according to Rep. Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat.    But the analysis by the Ways and Means Republican staff relied on a formula used by Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to estimate that Republican-backed tax cuts of nearly $400 billion over the next few years would produce at least a 6.1 percent increase in GDP.    http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan...    Using a jobs formula endorsed by Mrs. Romer and Jared Bernstein, now Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s top economic aide, that GDP boost translates into 6.2 million jobs over two years.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Your teacher is wrong on several counts.

98JZcrO6aa	The west aren't the only ones to blame here. The violence kicked off again because Hamas were elected into power in palestine and fired missiles into the Israeli border.     It is both Hamas' and Israels fault this war is going on. The other group in Palestine, Fatah were quite peaceful but this led to Israel bullying Fatah around. Eventually the palestinian people had enough and Hamas won the majority of the vote. Rather than acting peacefully, hamas think that the best way to chieve independance is to use war. Hamas fired the rockets so Israel is blasting the hell out of the gaza strip.     In a sense both Israel and Hamas are to blame, yet it is the palestinian people who are suffering. However, not all palestinians voted hamas but regardless of what party you support, all palestinians are suffering.    The only way this could be sorted is that Hamas are booted out of power of Palestine, a seperate palestinian state emerged and then the west need to prevent Israel from bullying palestine around.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	It is, clearly, a nonsense to hold peace talks that exclude one of the protagonists in any dispute.  We, eventually found that out in England with reference to Northern Ireland.  The British government, you will recall, had been having secret talks with IRA and Sinn Fein for years before they officially included them in the negotiations.  Mr. McGuiness and Gerry Adams, formerly leaders of the IRA terrorist faction, are now recognised as respectable politicians.  It would have been impossible to carry out any kind of peace process without their involvement, and this country would still be suffering the bombings and other attacks of the IRA, had we tried to do so.  So far as I can see, the same applies to the properly elected representatives of Palestinian people in Gaza. Like it or not, that means Hamas.  Rights and wrongs are irrelevant at this time, and, in any case there is wrong enough on the part of both Israelis and Palestinians.|`|vEW5WbREaa	Hamas is also denounced by the palistinians. They and hezbollah are known terrorist organizations who don't want peace with Israel. For instance, when Israel announced a unilateral cease fire, hamas immediately resumed rocketing southern Israel indiscriminantly. There will be no peace from hamas until the state of Isreal no longer exists. I don't think thats a concession Israel is willing to make.

When I add up the separate amounts the total does not get above $700 Billion.  Where is that other $150+ Billion supposed to go?  Why is that a secret?  Maybe it is meant to replace the $140 Billion that was in the first (failed) $700 Billion Bank bailout which was headed to ACORN.  Remember, the one the Senate Republicans voted down.  The bank bailout that finally passed (I sooo wish it had not passed either) did not have any funds visibly slotted to go to ACORN.    Can you say redistribution of wealth?

The substitute bill, sponsored by House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, would create 6.2 million jobs through 2010, according to its Republican backers, compared with just 3.2 million jobs claimed under the House Democratic bill to be voted on Wednesday evening.     Democrats rejected the analysis, saying the plan's reliance on tax cuts amounted to the same old song we always hear from Republicans, according to Rep. Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat.     But the analysis by the Ways and Means Republican staff relied on a formula used by Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to estimate that Republican-backed tax cuts of nearly $400 billion over the next few years would produce at least a 6.1 percent increase in GDP.     Using a jobs formula endorsed by Mrs. Romer and Jared Bernstein, now Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s top economic aide, that GDP boost translates into 6.2 million jobs over two years.     For half the cost, we can have twice the impact, said Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican.     The amendment was given virtually no chance of passage as Democrats expected to pass their version of the stimulus bill Wednesday evening. The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the stimulus program next week, and lawmakers want to have a bill to the president by mid-February.         http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan...|`|RermzbWgaa	Come on you didn't really think it was going to be all hugs and kisses did you?

So if they want to open a new branch they have to make these loans. That's the government forcing banks to do something that they wouldn't do if they were following sound business practices.

Clinton ignored it (the first sub-prime banks started going out of business in the mid 90's) and by the time Bush 43 came into office... well, he ignored it too!    The simple fact is, the government forced lenders to EQUALLY lend... even to people that maybe were not as credit worthy as their normal customers.

Stay tuned for the second phase of the bailout:  The U.S. House of Representatives is voting tonight.      What good is a bailout?  It prevents the cascading effect that the weak housing market starts.  The last time something similar happened, it resulted in the Great Depression.  President Obama and Congress are trying to prevent that possibility.  The bailout has all the attractiveness of a "mud sandwich," as Congressman Boehner put it, but we all have to eat it in order to prevent something far worse.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	It's a scam.

Emotionalism and sensationalism and fanaticism is what frames the arguments of the anti-abortionists.    People who support a woman's right to choose her own reproductive destiny subscribe to the medical, biological, scientific view that the moment of birth is when life as a human being begins.     All the rest of it is pure, unadulterated emotion.  **********************    Fetuses aren't people, either, dude. They're fetuses. And I tossed out the "tumors are alive" thing because THAT was your "argument" in your question.|`|xagiOb80aa	Personhood is denoted, legally, at birth.

Being pregnant, it certainly seems that they are alive.      I only believe in abortion being an option if the mother's life is in danger. But this is my opinion and I don't necessarily believe it should be the law.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	This is the whole point of the Left's argument.    They have convinced themselves that a fetus is not a person and can be removed like a wart.    They haven't quite explained the magic threshold when a fetus becomes a human.  Three months?  Four?  Six?  And why that magic number and not three days sooner?    Viable outside the womb?  Who made that arbitrary definition?    All I know is that a hundred years from now when we are all more enlightened, we will be astounded to hear how vehemently some people fought for the right to kill their babies.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	This comes down to a semantical argument between "alive" and "viable."  A fetus is alive long before it's viable.  Intelligent people can differ on when life begins, as they define life.    Having said that, the real issue is who makes the decision--the woman or the government.  It's interesting that most who think the woman is not smart enough to make her own medical decisions would argue violently that all Americans should be allowed to make their own decisions about how the|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Yeah the fanatic right wing likes to make a bunch of cells the size of a pin into life.  Yet when live babies are starving, they could care less.|`|a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	The debate should be over life and death. The decision was made when the choice to have sex was made.    At the point of conception, the life of the baby is the only person that the constitution should have made their decision.     This whole climate of "choice" is really a climate of death. Killing a pre-born baby is abortion. Killing a born infant (Partial Birth Abortion) is the beginning of infanticide. Killing a person near the end of life before natural death, is called euthanasia.    All of these pro-death issues are becoming laws in different states, thanks to our court judges who want to make laws instead of uphold them.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	there is no baby at conception. in fact, there isn't even an embryo. it's called a zygote. the embryonic period begins once the zygote is attached to the uterine wall. nearly 50% of zygotes don't even get attached to the uterine wall. they are flushed out in a woman's period. does that make menstruation wrong as well? abortion is a choice, get over it.|`|V03nUMXBaa	Realize that Abortion will always be legal in the U.S.    1-  Making Abortions illegal would only lead to women seeking them in dirty alleys and by unqualified 'doctors'.  The If you remember history, Prohibition was a miserable failure.  2-  The Abortion issue is a hot button issue, meaning the left and right can get their people out to vote based on this sole item.    The GOP had the Legislative and Executive branches of government for 8 solid years with 2 Supreme court Justices appointed to boot, yet RvW was never even considered for tighter regulation.|`|jHDc6Rwmaa	Yeah, I would say that the debate is a matter of life and choice, but it should actually not have anything to do with choice. It should be a constitutional debate and it would end quickly when someone says "what about the right to life?"|`|xkcLOfTKaa	How about a matter of a state's right to regulate an elective medical procedure! The Supreme Court took that right away from the various states in 1973.    What other medical procedure can you walk into a clinic and receive without oversight from a medical association, or without a doctor's orders?    Don't I have the CHOICE to live in a state where abortion is regulated AS a medical procedure? NO! I don't. Because it is illegal for me and the citizens of my state to ban the practice.    You care about CHOICE? DEMAND Roe v Wade be overturned, and give the RIGHT OF CHOICE back to the states!|`|xNsJqTgaaa	so really, it all comes down to when life begins.  Some say at birth, some say conception, some say before conception and some say somewhere in between.    When we figure that out, the morality becomes more clear.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	it will never be settled. a child can live outside the womb at 22 weeks, so that is the earliest time to be considered life, for now. tumors are not alive, good grief. i believe it is from conception myself.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	You are right in defining the issue.      Nobody who supports abortion believes that the unborn is a human life.    Nobody who would outlaw it believes that a fetus is just a piece of tissue.    I don't know if we'll ever be able to completely resolve that argument.    David Foster Wallace thought he had it.  He said that there is not complete certainty about whether a fetus is a human life.  If you are uncertain about whether something is a human life, then it is wrong for you to take action that would kill it.  At the same time, he says, in the face of doubt over whether or not it is a human life, it is wrong to judge such actions on the part of others.|`|uPDAmpdFaa	The debate is really about the personhood of the child and if people should be allowed to murder their children. :/

I like Lieberman; at least he has the courage of his convictions and the balls to stand up against his own party.

NO, our congress ppl do not represent us and it's been a few decades since they have. hard to blame them really. if you had a job where the boss never checked up on you and you could do nothing you'd probable do the same thing and then you could give yourself a pay raise anytime you want and the boss just stay at home watching tv. if the american public does not want to get involved your going to get exactly what we have. an overpaid do nothing congress. they are the ones with the money not the President and I think it's about time we started holding them accountable.

I just wish he would campaign more actively, during the election season.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	They must spend millions to get elected.  Most of that money comes from businesses.  Have you ever known a business to spend money without expecting a return on their investment?    These people are bought and paid for before they ever enter any office.|`|AA11702773	My congressman does not.  The straw that broke the camel's back was when he voted for the bailout.  Unfortunately that was so close to the election, where he was unopposed, that only one write in (put in place after he voted for the bailout) was on the ballot.   I voted for whomever that write in was (I forget the name).  However, obviously he didn't win.    This year I will look for and volunteer for someone running against him. I can't imagine people wouldn't vote against Berman if they had an option.  The man had a 17% approval rating.    And Feinstein stood up in the Senate and outright said she'd received about 80,000 contacts from constituents and probably 90% were against the bailout, but she knew better so she was voting for it.    We have to hold them accountable, as you say.

Most elected officials have some sort of twisted idea that because they won an election, that they have a permanent mandate from their electorate to do whatever they want to do.    We all heard the old adage "You can't fool all the people all the time..."    The fact of the matter is that once a congressman gets elected, he becomes a member of his political herd.  The herd directs him now, not the voters.  (One notable exception to this herd-mentality is Joe Lieberman...but that's mostly because his herd trampled him.)    Responsibility takes a back seat to group-think.|`|zjpB2GARaa	If Congress generally represented the people, we'd see them spend alot less time in session passing new laws to oppress us even more and to further harm our economy.

I've said it from the beginning but you put on big stages elibrite speaches & no questions point enough fingers & blame bush enough & republicans people already self focused with their own troubles will see what they want to see in the hopes of better times especially if that is coming from the exact opposite. Bush was hold your guns accept mistakes but do what you thought was right & based on his own beliefs & morals & osama's is what best suits me & my rise to power. Many other things will come out & be not least bit shocking about him his beliefs & his ties also to his openly bowing down to terrorists including Hamas who openly target civilians & while he condemns isreal only to speak to isrealis & jews as if their friend. I'm catholic by the way so dont think I saying his anti isreal focus because it suited me. When you blow up a bus full of civilians across the street from a military check point or a base simply because its an easier target higher moral boast to your own terrorist group then you can complaint when your group is attacked let alone justify breaking a ceasefire you agreed with LOL which hamas has done for years. Even now the ceasefire agreed to was only if hamas stopped fireing rockets & trying to rearm yet they opening do & so isreal attacks.      1452 days till he's out.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	He has only denied being a Muslim,I've lived in Muslim countries and know there are more good ones then bad.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	We knew he had muslim roots or ties or what have you.

Of course, when he was campaigning, he might as well have described himself as an All-American, apple pie-eating son of Kansas.    The "we" is very telling.  It's scary that people were glossing over the passage in his book when he said that he'd stand with the Muslims if the wind blew that way...guess that's because he has no spine.
OYtoM9fXaa	I absolutely believe these are properly state issues.  It saddens me that so few Americans remember the Tenth Amendment.  People who get downright weepy in defense of every comma and jot in the First Amendment have a tendency to pretend the Tenth doesn't exist at all.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	abortion, prostitution, and drugs, yes.  I don't think ANY state should be allowed to deny people their civil rights based  on popular vote.|`|ivsKcwwvaa	I think the federal government should contain evil, secure the borders, and protect Americans and American interests, and otherwise leave us the hell alone like the constitution demands.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	Individual rights, should be decided by the individual at hand. We are all born with human rights.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, absolutely not.    We are born in a state of freedom.  Laws are with the consent ot the governed.  We do not accept the tyranny of the majority.    The social nonsense you list are simply wedge issues designed to separate Americans.  They are fundamental rights and should be protected at the federal level.  The States should spend their time on infrastructure, making sure the places we live are safe, conducive to making a  living, and have a solid educational system.|`|PCVJg5ieaa	The basic line fo deciding, for me is this: When it comes to protecting individual rights, the federal government should act.    I would consider that people have a right to their bodies.  That means that I think abortion should be federally protected.    I would consider that equal rights to all under the law is a basic right.  That means that I think gay marriage should be a federal protected issue.    I would not consider employment choice or use of substances to be a right, thus I think Prostitution and marijuana use should be up to the states.      My line is good because it protects individual rights and liberties and also protects states that choose to deviate from the federal policy when those deal with choices or practices rather than rights.|`|Lk46wreDaa	Absolutely!!!!  This is how it should be, according to the 10th amendment!!|`|xagiOb80aa	No...    The rights of minority groups should not be infringed upon by the voting majority.

It involves more then what happens in one state, with residual effects    the rest is stationary|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I think abortion, prostitution, and marijuana usage should be decided by the individual, with no government involvement on any level.      As for marriage, that should be decided on the federal level since movement of married couples from state to state is frequent and the legal ramifications of a marriage with regard to taxes, inheritance, social security, insurance, etc need to be standardized across the board.|`|D6kwriPxaa	No, they should all be allowed in all parts of the USA.  We do not need our governemt to babysit us.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	Well, I think abortion and gay marriage should be decided in favor of on a Federal Level. It's ridiculous to put any kind of civil rights in the hands  of voters.    The guy who said homosexuals are just as much as a minority as murderers needs to get his head out of the gutter. Being gay doesn't put any one in danger.    I'm not a pot smoker, but as far as marijuana goes, I have the personal opinion that it should have similar laws to that of alcohol. I think it's insane that a person who is convicted of possession of marijuana could spend more time behind bars than a sex offender.    I don't have much to say about prostitution.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	Prostitution is already decided on a state level.  There are no federal laws against it.  That's why it's legal in Nevada.  As for the others, I'm not sure the federal laws are accomplishing anything really.  The practices seem to be spreading despite the laws.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	As a Libertarian, I would advocate limiting the power of the Federal government along STRICT constitutional lines. They have no business getting involved in any of these activities. Only if a state tried to pass an unconstitutional law should the supreme court get involved and overrule it.    The Constitution does not declare marijuana, prostitution, or gay marriage to be illegal, so neither should the federal government.    Abortion is more complicated since it depends on exactly when the fetus is considered a person. Smarter men than me will have to figure that one out. I think the mother bears the burden, and should have the ultimate say.|`|mxDoggk0aa	Whatever state Is good with Marijuana will become very popular.      I think federal level.|`|AA11450062	Well Gay Marriage should be decided at the federal level because it is a civil rights issue. Prostitution, Marijuana, and guns should be left up to the states.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	As a matter of law, it IS up to the States.  Federal legislation and regulation in these areas is unlawful usurpation.    "Believe" has nothing to do with it. I can read.|`|uEyxjAdcaa	Yes, if people would actually take the time to READ the Constitution they would understand that the Federal government's duties are very specific and very LIMITED, with everything else left to the states.

Therefore, the Federal Government does have the authority not only to declare abortion illegal, but to enforce it.

I believe our foster children cannot work and shouldn't be blamed for the mistakes of their parents/guardians. ALL of these people can't work....it isn't that they don't want to work. If you find that someone is not working and is receiving money just 'because they don't want to work'....you should report them, so that they take less of your money and take less of the money needed for those in actual need.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	We actually need more people like you.  We don't have enough.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	I volunteered, when I wasn't working with or for the government or being in office as a representative of the people most of my life, and the vast majority of my adult life; and have many times regretted the lack of power I now have for the things I now have the wisdom to fight for, due to the lack of money that life gave me.
G1sEBPQkaa	Ford enacted the Earned Income Tax Credit. Reagan expanded it, as has just about every president since. Bush expanded it again in 2001.|`|AA11702773	So?  What you do with a bad policy is reverse it once the impact is clear.  You don't implement MORE of it.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Um, well, golly, are you suggesting we agreed with everything Reagan did? I can still respect the man and not agree with all of his actions and initiatives. You see, that's how it is amongst folks like us. Unlike, apparently, folks like you, we're independent and free thinkers. We don't support all or nothing. We support what is right and oppose what is wrong. What a concept, huh?     Now, you show me someone who supported these actions under Reagan and oppose them under Obama and you might have a point..with that person.     Hope that helps.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I dont give a crap who thought it up its still welfare.

Again, it is thinking such as yours that rewards irresponsibility and punishes responsibility. Am I allowed to say that word, responsibility?  What do you not understand about an "Earned Income Tax Credit"? In order to get this you MUST pay taxes. If you do not pay taxes you do not get it.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Everyone's wrong sometimes. Your question basically asks, "since we did something wrong before, why oppose doing it again?"    Do you strongly favor "supply-side" economics, called "trickle-down" by Democrats? If not, your whole question is nonsensical rambling since the Democrat hero JFK was a supply-sider.

America could have saved itself some trouble by not overthrowing Iran's elected government and replacing it with a sadistic monarch.    Kennedy's Bay of Pigs fiasco may have made "the Castros" a little twitchy about America's designs on their country.    I know Americans like to see their country as the hero in some sappy Hollywood movie. But real history ain't like that.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	That would be terrible, stupid and ungodly.

There's NO justification for killing thousands of innocent civilians (9/11? remember that?), whatever sick reason the terrorists had in their heads at the time. And if you do think the terrorists were right in killing thousands of americans, I welcome you to join them in Afghanistan, because nobody here wants you around|`|6mkIBeLeaa	GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TERRORIST.

You can't win a war on terrorism by occupying a country. We should pull out and focus on security of our borders.

So, would you rather they build up enough support for another attack on US ground, like another 9/11?|`|RPeqzomsaa	Because liberals won't let us drill for oil here, and we all want cheap gasoline.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	What you are suggesting was already research and discussed in highly classified meetings you and I aren't privileged to listen in to.  The people discussing these things have a lot more military and/or diplomatic experience than you as well.  If it was as easy as you said we would be gone already.  Even the President, who made it a main campaign point to pull us out of Iraq, changed his tune after he was allowed access to highly classified information he didn't have access to while he was a senator.    By the way, the radical Islamists were fighting us long before 9/11.  Remember the first bombing of the World Trade Center in the early 90s?  Or the hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979?  Do a little research.|`|Ojd2pDsOaa	no because a little neglegence could cause another 9/11 type of scenario|`|THNvhp3Caa	What?!

OiAl6w48aa	It doesn't!  This is a myth being perpetuated by the insurance companies!  In fact, over the past several years, not only are the number of lawsuits against health care providers DOWN, but the average jury award in those suits is DOWN as well.  Yet miraculously, the hospitals and doctors keep raising their rates.  And the insurance companies have started pricing their premiums so high that some places are forced to close their doors (like in Las Vegas).    Edit: Here's a great article on the subject: http://www.slate.com/id/2145400/.      As the study's author concludes: "After all, including legal fees, insurance costs, and payouts, the cost of the suits comes to less than one-half of 1 percent of health-care spending."|`|S6XSLvjLaa	I think the judgements would be limited which would mean lower cost to insurance companies thus lower cost of malpractice insurance which is passed onto the patient.    ADD:  Do you mean cost or care?

It is not just a lazy, careless five percent of the profession.   The insurance industry has decided to settle claims that are not really medical cases of negligence in diagnosis or treatment.  I have chatted with several specialists who retire from surgical practice in their early to mid 50s due to the cost insurance coverage.  Lower health care costs is not a one bullet factor.  The government takeover will drive health costs higher than ever deemed possible.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	If health care providers are less likely to get sued, rates will go down across the board.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Work it out, dude. Fewer law suits = fewer insurance payoffs. Fewer insurance payoffs =  less cost to insurance companies and less cost to doctors to GET insurance, which in turn = lower health care costs.    The DOWNSIDE of course is that it becomes MUCH more difficult to sue a doctor or a hospital for medical malpractice.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	it doesn't ...besides don't you want higher health care....now, if we were all to get a health care plan like the president promised if he go elected those currently without would get health care but those with it would get lower because they can't get in to see there doctors, which would lead to higher costs for paying the doctors.....|`|VR7JfxM4aa	"Tort Reform" means limiting the ability of people to sue doctors, hospitals and other medical personnel and institutions when they negligently inflict harm upon patients.    Tort Reform would lead to lower quality health care because health care workers would have much lower incentive to provide adequate care.
FOai1n0Xaa	I don't think the US will end up looking like the USSR. The days of Stalinist state capitalism are over I am pretty sure. Sure the Keynesian policies being pushed through at the moment are placing more economic control in the hands of the government, but that is a far, far cry from the totalitarian ruling bureaucracy that arose in Russia after the defeat of the revolution.     But a powerful elite already dominate the world. The richest 2 percent of adults own over half of the worlds wealth. Yet the poorest 50 percent own around 1 percent of wealth. And ownership means control, i.e. power.    If that vast disparity doesn't constitute the domination of a powerful elite what does?|`|AhO0Uoppaa	in the future eather china or india will be the superpower|`|0sw9nrcpaa	nope, there will be no elite just a lot of pissed off buisnessmen and lots of criminals|`|Run7dyraaa	That is exactly what I envision.

Our presidents are all funded by the wealthiest corporations in the world.  J.P. Morgan used to call personal meetings with the United States Presidents (Cleveland, McKinley) whenever he felt like it.  And if you think the days of robber barons are in the past, then consider that President George W. Bush used to meet with Kenneth Lay (the founder of Enron) very frequently and even recorded a farewell video with his father (President George H.W. Bush) when one of the CEOs left the company.      I don't think the US will look more like the former USSR.  Because of the unbridled competition created by capitalism, the elite will manipulate politics until business becomes less and less regulated to keep 90% of the nation's wealth in their hands.|`|auV6OLVDaa	why not|`|gpBicBEPaa	back in the us, back in the us, back in the USSR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... da nah nah nah nah nahnah nah nahnahnah nahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VY5dcdXVaa	Considering how heavy the elite are getting taxed, I'm going to go with the former USSR.|`|T585QWNsaa	no idea|`|0Awd4VYWaa	i can totally see it coming|`|GZXDHVkXaa	learn Chinese buddy

That we don't have regular military coups, and that our citizens do have some say in how things get done is something that not every nation can brag about.  We should be very proud.    I disagree, though that the only difference between Democrats and Republicans is the words they use.  I think the difference, really, is in the ways they want to accomplish things.  To be sure, we all have the same goals of ensuring that America is a safe and wonderful place.  But Republicans want to get to that goal with one set of policies, and Democrats want to get there with a different set of policies.  It's not just that one says, "I want security", and another says, "I want freedom".|`|MhLiv5TQaa	js put down the obama koolaid,hes only been in office a week and a day,lay off the greatest pres ever.im glad we have elected men who are gracious in defeat.it should never get personal.i wish obama well,i didnt vote for him but hes our leader and i respect that,the fact that hes the first half black president wore off 1 minute after he won the election.|`|e3620b9a08ac5adee34c4f8e35f62a75aa	I have to agree with you.  As much as I despised Bush's policies, he seemed truly generous and dealt with the transition with class.  And that did make me appreciate again how nice it is to live in a country when power is transferred in peace.
xEdhOEsqaa	Well, I'm Liberal and I don't really hold either of those viewpoints.  I think PETA has gone completely off the edge (see: http://www.peta.org/sea_kittens/), and I don't favor late-term abortions though I am pro-choice.      So I'm not really sure how you could believe both of those things.  In fact, I'm not really sure why anyone is vegetarian, because we evolved eating meat.  I understand not wanting to eat meat from a feedlot or the Tyson chicken plant, but some good, farm-raised meat or an animal you hunted yourself?  I don't see anything wrong with that.|`|xagiOb80aa	Look, you can be a PETA member and still enjoy meat, too.    PETA is about the means with which animals are treated and viewed.    Free-range meat products exist|`|97VqHCIRaa	99% of the animal rights people I know HATE PETA.    They are extremists... normal animal lovers lean towards the SPCA.|`|VKFDL4sraa	To Nick C  -  Those on death row EARNED their spot there, usually having taken another life.  Unlike the innocent life beginning who isn't even able to make their own decisions.  Are all liberals this stupid???|`|CiDVOEwraa	Great question. My only response is that liberalism REQUIRES hypocrisy. Period.    I love the typical liberal lines: Not allowing a woman the right to choose would invade her right to free control over her body. I see, so the woman can freely determine what she does with/to her body, but the baby does not have that same right? Oh that's right, they don't want "to be burdened", as Obama says...|`|mBZU9a1Baa	Easy. Because PETA feel as though people are expendable. Animals -and fish - are not. That is why they want to change the name of "fish", to "Sea Kittens".    If you ever needed an example of the Liberal left lunacy...PETA  is the poster child!    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090110/ap_o...|`|OdrgLFFOaa	Explain how you can be anti-abortion and support the death penalty|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Sure.    Pro Choice is NOT Pro Abortion.  It is letting the individual decide to have or NOT to have an abortion.      PETA is just wanting animals not to suffer needlessly or hunted for its skin to make coats.    Now here's my question.  How can one be for less Government interference but wants the Government to intervene in abortion cases?|`|POygTyTAaa	Easy -- you can be a lacto-ovo vegetarian and be pro-choice.  Essentially, they are one and the same.  It's not like pro-Peta people are out slaughtering three year children.|`|B5HyOmxdaa	Who's in favor of late-term abortions?  A very small percentage of people who are pro-choice are totally fine with abortions at the late stage.  Pro-choice also does not mean you promote the idea of abortions, you just don't want it to be an illegal practice.  Many women would never dream of having an abortion but still don't want the government intervening in their uterus.  If they feel the need to intervene they should supply birth control at every public building, including schools.  That said, animal rights is a different issue.  It's about the use of completely different, lesser creatures being used for human benefit.  Trust me, there's a difference - removed before even breathing air, or tortured throughout your entire life.|`|BJhOd2usaa	Is an acorn an oak? I don't care about embryos. While I think the PETA people are nuts, I do care about cruelty to animals, because animals are sentient and can experience fear and pain and loss.|`|AA11166769	It's simple. We all have the right to complete autonomy over our own persons, and if you take away a woman's right to choose, you're violating her right to that autonomy. Animals exist independently of humans and in their own right, so they shouldn't be killed or made to suffer by humans, especially when so many alternatives exist.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	sadly, some people give animals more credence than human life. it's sad but look at the way their raise their own families and treat their elderly.  some people only like dealing with those that can't talk back - it makes them feel smarter and more superior.    i can't wait to see the answers to this!|`|fh12fkNWaa	Who says Peta people or people who support them are also Pro-Choice? I've seen nothing to support that claim. Peta is pretty radical and a very small group.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	They're all gung-ho about the treatment of dumb beasts, but they don't give a crap about the poor innocent babies being slaughtered with a curettage.    Babies DO feel pain at about 8 weeks. Women tend to find out they're pregnant at about this time.|`|fB0gmEioaa	Explain to me how you can be pro-PETA and also pro-choice    The life of an animal has more value to the PETA people then a human life does. If PETA had it their way all humans would be wiped out so mother Earth can reclaim herself.|`|z8Euv8xKaa	Cognitive dissonance?|`|2gx2LgzEaa	PETA = People for the Eating of Tasty Animals!

His hidden messages like 'citizens of the world', 'share the wealth', 'wealth re-distribution', are all neo-socialist globalism - and we're on the fast track to that right now.  The only difference from the Bush/Clinton administrations is that an orchestrated, manipulated economic crisis has made Americans 'hungry' enough to accept this 'change' from free enterprise to government control without saying a word.|`|77lIzq4Taa	The change is happening, we are changing back to the 90's with all the clinton "hacks" in the current administration. Talking about economic policy, we are "time warping" change bach to the FDR new deal era. The new deal did nothing except create whole populations of "victims" with their hands out from the 30's to present.|`|AA11676794	HEre is a piece of change.    In one Week since he was president. President Obama has met with more republican representatives to discuss legislation than Bush did in his first year of office.    Change is a slow process.  there is an old eastern saying that says "before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. after enlightenment, chop wood and carry water."    He has made fundamental changes in the tone of international diplomacy    He has made changes in the openness of the White House    He has made changes in the relationship between lobbyists and the White House.    All of this in one week.    In a week, message and tone is about all one can show. I can't say that I like the stimulus plan 100%. But, at least they are trying to do something. Rebulicans who are against this haven't offered any meaningful alternatives expcept to cut taxes even more. Which is the same damn thing they have called for for almost thirty years.    So- let build a few bridges, create more solar and wind farms, sod the damn Mall if it creates a paycheck then by God do it.    Hell even the condom distribution thing (which has been dropped) would have a given a job to someone out there. It isn't like the condoms grow on trees.    Let me ask you. If in one year's time the jobless rate has fallen in a meaningful way and we are able to create something of a change in the middle east. (not a full solution but positive change) will you come on here and annouce that you were wrong? Or will it be a new complaint about something else with this administration?|`|53216puqaa	From your pocket to theirs!  I still believe that this 'stimulus' is to launder money so as to cover losses that were forced upon many lenders by the Congress.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	The change isn't in the economy it's in the philosophy of a nation!

At this point no one else has volunteered a stimulus plan so let's pray that the time Obama has had on his has made it a good one that can work.    A lot of the people Obama picked he picked because they could get the job done effectively and with experience doing so. Would you rather he pick a bunch of newbies who have no idea what they are doing or even where they are.

That is all we have left..they are going to take away Conservative talk radio soon, so who will voice our feelings...they have a platform and the government wants to get rid of opposing views...That is why Obama picked out Rush Limbaugh....Mark my words, they will go after Rush, Hannity, O'Reilly, Beck..and all the conservative talking heads..so where will we go then?  Can you imagine that they are giving $4 bil. to ACORN?  An organization that is under investigation?  I really fear for my country and it seems like they are pushing this program because they know if a groundswell of people start calling Washington to voice their opinions against it, it will be shelved or revised drastically...It is going to pass in the house because there is a majority of Dems, but in the Senate, they have to do some real fighting...It is a disgrace...Now you know why Obama picked all Clinton retreads, as they have the same philosophy as he and he felt comfortable with them...Where is our money?

7pfCkrCzaa	Posted by Matt Hawes on 01/27/09        President Obama's nearly-trillion dollar stimulus package could be voted on in the House of Representatives as soon as tomorrow.    For more information on the dangers posed by this plan, check out readthestimulus.org. This will be an early test for the Republicans, as it remains to be seen whether many of them will remain firm in their opposition to the bill.    In addition to being yet another example of bloated big government spending, this legislation also contains several provisions that have nothing to do with "creating jobs" or otherwise "stimulating" the economy. One such provision is that it requires the Treasury to "study" the feasibility of requiring students to perform community service as a condition of Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax credits - one step closer toward Obama and Emanuel's national service plan.    Contact your representative and let them know that you oppose the Obama "stimulus" package. It is important your representatives know that you haven't gone away since the bailout was passed, and that you'll be keeping a closer eye on them more than ever.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Yeah, I'll get back to you in about a month.

Corrupted officials tend to be the ones higher up, and they never ever get laid off. It always go by seniority, so the new guy who is still trying to do his job the best he can (and hasn't gotten comfortable) is the one who loses his/her job first. So, essentially, by laying off these people, your losing the good ones, and keeping a higher concentration of bad ones. Sure, keep rooting for it.

It has little to do with basic health care for women.  It also involves contraception, which many Catholics object to, inclduing the Pope.    Some of these pro-life people object to the morning after pill that will cause a woman who has a microscopic zygote in her womb.  There's no way to tell if the MAP will result in an immediate "abortion."  If the woman is not pregnant, how can she be deemed a sinner for taking the MAP?    I dislike abortion, but abortion is legal and is at the discretion of the woman.  Expelling a microscopic organism, if there is one, to avoid a possible pregnancy is a lot better than a late-term abortion.|`|AA10152346	They don't care for said life once is out of the uterus. You've made that clear in your comments and that's how it is. they want to see the person who made a mistake by getting pregnant "pay" suffer the most for that "mistake" they want to see the mother struggle through her pregnancy and then struggle to keep up with raising her kid to "pay" for her mistake and they want that to be as hard as possible.    There's no logic in banning abortion if you are not also going to facilitate the means to help that "life" they are supposedly trying to protect through it's rocky beginnings. All they want is for that woman to be punished in every possible way. Not that a baby is punishment but raising it without support is.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Why do pro-choice people hate unborn babies?|`|qUSkOO03aa	Umm it doesn't create jobs and therefore shouldn't be in the "stimulus package" that is suppose to create jobs|`|mxDoggk0aa	I don't know who "Jon Boener" Is I only know a John Boehner.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	For my comment, reread what Mrs. Herrera wrote.

I as a pro-life person want women to make smart decisions before they get pregnant,  however I do not need to finance their decisions whether it be birth control, abortion or welfare for the child.

AA10118655	I'm having a hard time believing this.    1) Social Security is run by the federal government, not the state, and     2) If it is direct deposit, it doesn't go through the post office.

acj9mB9Paa	I am a white Republican who has had to be on welfare (I had to quit my high paying job when I became unexpectedly pregnant  so my insurance coverage was canceled).  I was on Medicaid from the time I found out I was pregnant until my son was four months old.  My husband found a higher paying job with insurance coverage and we are now expecting   2 and will be paying for the birth ourselves.  I said all that to say this.

That would be suicidal, as it would provoke the gang of criminals in DC to invade Iran (which is what they've wanted to do for a few years).

AA12212403	Obama made it quite clear during the campaign that he would be raising taxes for people making certain amounts of money, in particular small businesses making beyond a certain amount.  How could be all forget that famous Joe the Plumber?  Someone said Obama has indicated he won't do this until the economy is better.  Well, I hope that is so but I wonder what kind of barometer he will use to indicate "better".  He's promised so much and is going nuts with all these spending proposals.  How else will he come up with money? Our country is already in debt, so where else can he turn but to people who he feels must share the wealth.  I'm watching the news and see a state such as MA, with a democratic governor, whose revenue is way down.  They are talking tolls, more taxes on things like cigarettes (which I think should be made illegal or something anyway, so let them tax them sky high), eating at restaurants (the owners are already suffering as people aren't eating out due to the bad economy) and many other "creative" ways to raise funds.  When you start increasing things like meals taxes or tolls, people have less money to spend.  Restaurants have already been closing in great numbers, will increasing meal taxes bring out more people to dine out?  I doubt it.  Jobs will be lost.  It's going to be the same way for Obama.  He's going to back himself into a corner and then he will just have to find a way to create revenue.  Sad, but true.  Stop spending money on bail outs, spending money won't help it will get us into further trouble down the road.  Your kids and mine, and even your grand-kids  will be paying for this for their lifetimes.|`|X4z3GqAeaa	Liberals would rather have a $1,000 stimulus check than a steady job any day of the week.|`|AA10118655	That's what is so great about his plan: Not only does it create all these government jobs, it also creates the people that are needed to work these new government jobs.|`|GNNh52OMaa	why raise the deficit more and have to pay more taxes in the future? a tax relief won't raise the deficit. and when the economy gets back on track, when we have to pay off this deficit, our taxes won't be as high.     dems love handouts!|`|ivsKcwwvaa	Because they also see unicorns grazing in the fields, and rainbows dancing in the clouds.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	Dude, he's going to lower taxes on lower and middle income people, and small businesses.|`|xagiOb80aa	Obama will lower the taxes on 95% of taxpayers, contrary to your statement.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	Look at this it will show you that the government is spraying poison on all of us.

FQ046dIsaa	making abortions illegal will not change anything. people will do what they have to do. and more women will die from horrible situations.    the government should not be legislating their views on morality. I'll never understand why people can't just mind their own business.    and the fact is that abortions are on the decline (compared to the 80's). most of that is probably somewhat better contraception and the campaign to use condoms, which, while not perfect is sure better than NOT using anything.    The REAL solution to eliminating abortions is education and a contraception that is 100% effective. NOT pointing fingers.|`|zjpB2GARaa	No    The best way to stop abortion is to legalize paid adoptions.  Currently, women have the option of killing an unwanted baby immediately or putting it up for adoption and losing 9 months of income to the pregnancy.  Were paid adoptions legalized, it would change the incentive structure by reimbursing women for their lost time while they were pregnant.    In order to prevent unwanted pregnancies, the most effective method is to stop having sex.  Obviously, this is not acceptable to most people (and is unhealthy), so the best choice is probably to use birth control (which has a risk of failure).|`|teKeLxX2aa	It'll work about as well as the War on Drugs. Instead of having people go to medical professionals to perform the operation, they'll go to black market Abortionist' who may or may not have any medical experience whatsoever. Not that this will ever happen since the ruling of Row Vs. Wade in 1973, but a lot more women would die as a result (and of course the baby would die too).    If people want to do something, a law and a couple of law enforcement agents over a widespread area aren't going to be able to stop people from doing it.     Take historic examples like the Prohibition movement that made alcohol illegal in the 1920's. Even though a world without alcohol would be ideal because there would be no drinking and driving, and supposedly a lot less crime (because a large percentage of felonies are committed by people intoxicated on alcohol), it wasn't realistic because it excluded the human element. Because people had such a strong desire to drink, they we're willing to do it illegally. They encouraged bootleggers and mobsters to transport and sell alcohol underground, which only ended up increasing crime and illegal activities in the end.    So given from this example, people will do things that's not in their best interest because they have wants and desires that they'll follow through on, regardless of what the governments stance on the issue is. The only sure way to avoid unwanted pregnancy, is to not have sex. However, considering that sex is probably a stronger desire to most people than liquor or drugs, I don't forsee the abortion issue coming to a close anytime over the course of our species' existance.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	1.  No.    2.  Start a mass movement of self-reliance, self-respect, self-importance, instead of the self-sacrifice, and self-hatred movements that dominate now.    Insecure people do things without thinking. Illogical, irrational people do things without thinking about them. These concepts must be addressed.    Higher standards, less mere behavioral creatures.|`|uiGxCTMFaa	Of course not, but it will bring some validity back to our Rule of Law system!  We look at the 1973 Supreme Court decision and wonder how nine lawyers could possible arrive at a legal decision that takes away the right for people to vote on the issue of abortion. How is it that nine lawyers become experts on moral authority? I'll grant you that they are experts on the law, but I wonder how many ethics courses they took during their tenure at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, etc. Proponents of Roe argue that this landmark case is a classic example of Constitutional evolution towards greater liberty and democracy. I see this case as a dramatic step back from those values. The conflict between life and privacy is at odds with abortion. The court decided to trump the life card by giving deference to liberty...for the sake of political expediency. As for democracy, this case removes the public's ability to even vote on banning abortions. We (the voters) have no voice in this matter...the Tenth Amendment is tossed out the door. Living constitutionalism does not always evolve towards greater liberty or freedom. There is no easy solution to dealing with the issue of abortion, but the Constitution is very clear on where the legal authority comes for dealing with this moral question. The moral decision is not to be made by nine lawyers, but with the state and with the people, through a democratic process. We the people need to evaluate the best method to approach the problem and find a solution that would discourage abortions as much as possible|`|WQM5ThD8aa	No.  Those that can afford it will just go to a nation where it is legal.  Those who can't do that will have dangerous back alley abortions.   Even if these two scenerios didn't happen, numbers shows that babies that would have been aborted, but weren't because of legal issues are more likely to have a life of crime.  Just read the book freakanomics it explains all of this.|`|LXxBu79Aaa	It's not necessarily about completely stopping people from having abortions but about the atrocities exhibited by planned parenthood's forcefulness in encouraging young women to get abortions using taxpayer money.|`|THRtsl83aa	No.  Will making murder illegal stop people from being murdered?  No.  Should we therefore make murder legal?  Of course not.

Learn your history on abortions..........what use to be, what is now (safer)........before deciding all the "hype"|`|xagiOb80aa	No, it will only serve to subjugate women even further|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Well when abortion was illegal, you had woman going to unsafe "doctors" with unsterilized equipment, and they were performed in private quarters where women could often end up with an infection or bleed to death. Then there's the women who took it upon themselves and tried with a coathanger (won't go into detail about that - too horrible). So it's apparent women will do it anyway whether it's legal or not. Better to give them safe conditions than have them do it unsafely and die. It's like teens having sex - we tell them not to, but they will anyway, so at least give them the condoms to protect themselves. Same logic.    The only 100% way to prevent pregnancy is abstinence. But since that's so rare these days, I suppose birth control (condoms, bc pills, foams, diaphragms, IUDs, etc etc etc) and EDUCATION are the best tools that currently exist.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	No, it will not stop abortion from taking place, but who cares?  There are laws against bank robbery, but some people continue to rob banks.  Should we repeal those laws because some people disregard them?    The best way to avoid unwanted pregnancy is to refrain from engaging in unprotected sex.  They know what causes pregnancy these days, and it's not something in the water.|`|AA11676794	NO-    Women who want abortions when it is illegal split into two categories.  - The ones with money who will go to an area where it is legal and have it done, or know a doctor who for the right amount of money will perform it.    -The ones without money will resort to "wire hangers"    The best way to (not ensure) but rather diminish the number of unwanted pregnancies is to promote a mixture of education regarding sex and pregnancy, make contraception much more readily available, and promote the use of the morning after pill.    Promoting abstinence is all well and good but the data shows that this is an ineffective deterrent|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	no, and rich people will just fly themselves to where it is legal.|`|aGockbqUaa	No. But the clothes hanger recycling program at your dry cleaners might notice the pinch.|`|zlHgIltOaa	No, and the best way would be to educate young adults (13/14 years old...senior year is wayyy too late) about sex and to get rid of the useless waste of tax money that is abstinence-only sex education.

So many don't see it.  Hungry people are ugly.  The Katrina aftermath was nothing compared to what we are going to see.  I lived on the streets for 9 years after I was no longer a suitable Soldier.  I can shoot anything.  I can survive anywhere.  What happens to these soft folks that are used to eating everyday?  I feel sorry for all the suits.  They usually don't survive revolutions.

Americans were told during the cold war that Communism was the enemy - that all Communists were bad, and all Capitalists were good. Very Orwellian. Fear is useful for control of a population. Bush's administration used the same concept of fear of terrorists to control the population over the past 8 years. Roosevelt was correct when he stated "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself". Fear disables the population, making us scared to criticise the system, to talk out against unfair policies, and to reject elected officials.    In fact, there is usually something of value in any theory of government.

It also manifested in the U.S.'s primary rivals of the last century, the U.S.S.R. and then China.    The main problem that results from this perhaps overreaction is that now any sort of social program or redistributive policy can be lableled as "communist" with all the associated negative connotations.

AA10025824	The best way to gain rank is to get a rating (job) that has lots of openings.  That means there are positions to fill in higher ranks and more openings so when it's time to move up you can move up.  There are ratings that are so locked up you have no where to go.    As far as moving up quick, there's a certain amount of time you have to spend in one rank before you go on to another.

Sands (Contact)    House Republicans on Wednesday argued that their alternative stimulus program, heavy on tax cuts, would create nearly 3 million more new jobs than the $816 billion economic recovery plan being pushed by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats -- using the same methodology favored by President Obama's top economic advisers.    The substitute bill, sponsored by House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, would create 6.2 million jobs through 2010, according to its Republican backers, compared with just 3.2 million jobs claimed under the House Democratic bill to be voted on Wednesday evening.    Democrats rejected the analysis, saying the plan's reliance on tax cuts amounted to the same old song we always hear from Republicans, according to Rep. Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat.    But the analysis by the Ways and Means Republican staff relied on a formula used by Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to estimate that Republican-backed tax cuts of nearly $400 billion over the next few years would produce at least a 6.1 percent increase in GDP.    Using a jobs formula endorsed by Mrs. Romer and Jared Bernstein, now Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s top economic aide, that GDP boost translates into 6.2 million jobs over two years.    For half the cost, we can have twice the impact, said Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican.    The amendment was given virtually no chance of passage as Democrats expected to pass their version of the stimulus bill Wednesday evening. The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the stimulus program next week, and lawmakers want to have a bill to the president by mid-February.|`|EcuCO4LCaa	And do you think Obama actually reads the 25,000 letters and emails he receives everyday?

I don't care if you worked for a company for 50 years, you don't know what it takes to run a successful business until you do it.

He managed his way through that with pot and coke.  Then he went to school with a bunch of wannabe commies and formed his ideology.  To serve that ideology, he became a community organizer following the advice of Dostoievsky by way of comrade Saul Alinsky.  He then started running for president and hasn't stopped.

gz5O9Tbpaa	Well, this army wife LOVES the show!! But it's just a show. Not terribly true in my opinion and experience. But I like the cast and I think it has a nice story line. But they do make it seem a little too romantic to be true. Even going to the PX is an adventure... when in reality it's like doing to walmart for socks and toothpaste.     But would a post commander's wife ever hang out with a SPC's wife?? It's HIGHLY doubtful!!    Not that army life isnt a trip, but again, in my experience, it's nothing like the show. There's drama in other ways... my neighbor found out she was pregnant the same day they found out her hubby was deploying for a year. Another friend had a baby but didnt know which soldier was the father. My hubby has soldiers that are completely nuts that swap wives. Yeah, all true!!!! I WISH I was kidding!!    But for me and my hubby, we lead really boring lives. We live OFF post and I have my own job and my own friends. Our lives are not full of army drama. Like now... I'm sitting in my living room with the computer and my yorkie. My hubby brought home dinner and now he's in his "man cave" playing on his PS3. Where's that scene on Army Wives?? LOL!|`|KQL3tqS7aa	I do love that show as well!  The biggest thing that I notice is the fact that in the true Army, the enlised personnel would not be hanging out with the officers.  Another aspect of military life they don't show is just how affected the spouse and kids can be when the solier goes off for deployment.  I do like that they show the sense of community amongst the characters, but it's just a bit far fetched in some parts.  Military wives have lives like anyone with some differences...including having to hold down the fort back home when your husband is away, understanding that at times you will feel and probably be 2nd to the Army!  It's not a role for everyone, but I'm sure you'll do fine!|`|kbz5S3waaa	I am an AF wife, I pretty sure it's all the same, but I hate the show, it's not very accurate to the way I see life going down on base.

There's not very many 'homemakers' any more either, most spouses have to work to stay above water. There is a lot of drama though.

I know far too many widows and orphans to ever value a policeman's life as less than those they protect. In a city of 500,000 civilians protected by 1,400 police officers, those 1400 lives contribute more to the cause of civilization, and are therefore individually more valuable to the city than those they protect. The same goes for Firefighters, we run into burning buildings to save lives, we may die trying to save civilians, but we dont do it stupidly. Id trade a burning orphanage full of children I couldnt save, for the chance to go home at night and see my family. That certainly doesnt mean I wouldnt do everything in my power to save them, but its a cold hard fact that sometimes you just cant save everyone, and dieing to prove that wont change anything.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	"Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned in 2008 by a federal court in Philadelphia, which found that the jury in the case had been incorrectly instructed."

If anything I would value their life less, since they are being paid to risk it.    So you think that killing a police officer is worse than killing an innocent woman or child.  I would rather see a police officer die than those people.  Attack on society, I disagree.  They are killed because they are doing their jobs fighting criminals.  They are the obstacle between the criminals freedom and imprisonment.  It has nothing to do with society.

Unless there was "proper" abuse (trying to protect you is not abuse) then you have no chance of any court agreeing to put you in care or the like.

I don't talk to my mum at all I only stopped at 20 and my sister stopped talk to her a few months ago at 22, for her negotiations are open but the rocks, but until you've been through all the teen angst and come out the other side whatever the legal rights are you shouldn't do what me and my sister have done and break contact/leave.

Most Americans do not recognize how the establishment controls both parties and keeps real change from ever coming to pass.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	No - it's not.

Unfortunately, it does come from BOTH sides.    Just as you have seen many Republicans say that Dems can't think for themselves, in this election, you have seen most Dems accuse Republicans of being racist.  Which is not true - not that there are not racists on BOTH sides of the fence though.  Having different political ideas does not equate to being racist.    BTW - Bill O'Reily is usually a Democrat.    People should stop generalizing and also, they should stop thinking that people should not be allowed to agree or disagree on both sides of the fence.  All the name calling is way out of line, and if Obama is to ever realize the goal of uniting this country, it is going to take people to stop acting like children - and that goes for the Congress as well.  Even he said this himself.    So, by America continuing to be hateful to one another and thinking that disagreements should not happen and being down right hateful about it (BOTH sides), we will only continue to divide even further than we are, causing even more problems in the US.    Have disagreements and fight for what you think is right - but don't be hateful sparking anger about it.  There are some really angry people int he US today - that could get dangerous.    Just to add to this discussion - I did nt vote for Obama, I say this upfront.  I do accept that he is President and I really want to be supportive.  I do pray for him and his family - BUT I simply do not agree with some of his ideas.  Even when I see things I do like, it is overpowered by hearingthe rantings of people like Pelosi who will not let her opinions die and move on regarding Bush.  She doesn't like him, we get it, as Obama said, move on already.  It is hard to remain supportive when you have hatefulness thrown out at you.  I want very much to believe Obama's words at the elctions speech and the inaguartion speech in that he wants to be President to ALL AMERICANS - but that he realizes that he needs to earn the respect and trust.  If that is true - then let him do just that and stop beating down the other side with hate.  THEN we might unite.|`|teKeLxX2aa	What your referring to are 'stereotypes', which get their meaning from certain things that a large group of people share in common. This doesn't mean that every liberal is a wuss and that every Republican is an angry war monger, but a lot of them are.    Take for instance when your driving on the road and you see a fuel efficient car loaded with stickers that say things like "Give Peace a Chance, Make Love not War, etc.". The first thing that pops into your mind is that person is probably a democrat/liberal, and you're probably right. And then when you see some white guy driving a large pickup truck with a "Terrorist Hunting Liscense" sticker on the back of his vehicle, you should be able to conclude fairly quickly that he's a republican voter.    In my experience, I have met most people who vote to fall into one or the other categories. College kids and teachers will typically vote democratic, while blue collar workers and Christian Fundamentalist will vote Republican.     However, the Republican values aren't really what they used to be, and haven't been since the days of Eisenhower. The Republicans like to play mindgames with the Christian's by claiming that they have stong Christian values, and will vote accordingly on issues like abortion (and it works). They'll trick the blue collar folks into believing that their party has conservative values by initiating large tax cuts, but most of those cuts help the rich at the expense of Joe Sixpack.     But the Democrats aren't what they're cracked up to be either, as they have failed remarkably over the past eight years when it came to voting on issues like the war, the Patriot Act, housing deregulation, etc. The democrats have been notorious recently for having no spine when it comes to the issues and for taking a progressive stance on nearly every vote. But for the time being, they should have a decent oppurtunity to prove themselves to the American people. We'll just have to see if they have what it takes to lead us out of this quagmire, or if they're just going to lead a children's crusade of blame on the Republicans now that things are looking real bad.|`|EjVjtagWaa	I've been paying more attention to this stuff then I ever before.

xdyM3IVmaa	I do believe it should be legalized.     In the simplistic reasoning, the amount of tax dollars that could be earned by our government (rather than being spent on the so-called "war against drugs") through the legalization/taxation is reason enough. Furthermore, marijuana (THC) has never been the "cause of death" for a single person. It is not addictive. It is natural (heck, in Nebraska, where I'm from, it grows in mile-long, 7-8 foot high rows between cornfields and in ditches!). Legalizing marijuana also eliminates the crime associated with its sale and transfer. When it's legal, price drops, and smugglers and dealers have no monetary gain to be had by selling it. Nobody's going to be killed for it when it's legal.     For a prime example of how it WORKS... look at Holland.|`|Wez0ZK4Vaa	it's time...a friend with weed is a friend indeed|`|JiATH6rGaa	I don't believe it will happen for recreational use.

I am assuming you weren't blacked-out drunk, do remember the situation accurately and haven't neglected to note some crucial things you said or did.    As a law student, you should know -- and indicated you did -- that you should have left and reported the incident to the police.  We have police just to handle these, and worse, situations instead of us handling them ourselves as you did.    Police, contrary to the pretenses of both the public and authorities, are not capable of protecting the public, even if that was the intention.  They are here to intercede when we want retribution.  We hope they can do it with more justice and reserve than we, our families and friends, or large posses disastrously do when there are no police.    You demonstrated that problem.  You were not defending yourself.  You went back for a second try.  It was appropriate that you be charged, but from what you note, gbh doesn't seem to be the correct one.  You could argue for just an assault charge.    If you had tried to leave after he first attacked, he pursued you and tried to harm you further, and was large and strong enough to severely damage you, you could have even killed him and correctly claimed self defense.  However, none of that was the case.    I read your additions.  I'm sorry to note they don't change much.  The police still have reason to charge you.  It looks like a brawl and you are party too it.    Again, if you had immediately left and he pursued you, the whole story would be different.  But you intentionally remained and were hit again.  That shows were willing to stay and fight.  You were a willing participant in a fight.  That makes all the difference.|`|7Wdwo9W4aa	For starters google nuisance calls and follow the prompts IF they call you again it is forwarded to the feds as for your charge your a model citizen no priors your laughing!!!!!!!

No , it is legally impossible to arrest someone unless you have some proof of a crime.  However, are you sure that there is no proof of his having sex with the girl?  You have to have some reason to believe that he's the dad - why do you think it doesn't prove anything?    "proving it would be quite difficult i believe unless she has the kid"  Hardly - even if she miscarries, they can still check the fetus.  Also, if the girl names the guy as someone who had sex with her, then that's evidence of his having had sex with her (even if he's not the father...which isn't all that unlikely; are we to assume she's irresponsible but monogamous?)|`|i5F2jwvhaa	If my 16 yo ever comes home pregnant from a 24 year old the 24 yo will have a gunshot wound where his genitals used to be|`|z6O5ifdGaa	The parent cannot force their teen to give up their child for adoption, nor can she force her to have an abortion. The parent is still legally responsible for the teen, but not for the baby. It's a catch 22.    You can call the authorities and tell them about the 24 year old. They will want your daughter to admit that he is the father. If she does, he should be arrested.     Failing that, the investigation would be pending until a paternity test proves who the father is... this can be court ordered by the state, it's not a choice then.     Medicaid won't cover abortion, as it was consensual. I'm sure they would expect a police report of the incident if the teen wanted to claim it through her medicaid as rape.

Even if you do not use the credit card it is more likely they will believe that is your address. Hope that helps.
DTSUJe2oaa	Censorship has changed over the years and has had an effect on all people but it has none on mine now.~  Censorship is the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable, harmful or sensitive, as determined by a censor. The rationale for censorship is different for various types of information censored:    Moral censorship, is the removal of materials that censor deems to be obscene or otherwise morally questionable. Pornography, for example, is often censored under this rationale, especially child pornography, which is censored in most jurisdictions in the world. In another example, graphic violence resulted in the censorship of the "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" movie entitled Scarface, originally completed in 1932.   Military censorship is the process of keeping military intelligence and tactics confidential and away from the enemy. This is used to counter espionage, which is the process of gleaning military information. Very often, militaries will also attempt to suppress politically inconvenient information even if that information has no actual intelligence value.   Political censorship occurs when governments hold back secret information from their citizens. The logic is to prevent the free expression needed to rebel. Any dissent against the government is thought to be a "weakness" for the enemy to exploit.[citation needed] Campaign tactics are also often kept secret: see the Watergate scandal.   Religious censorship is the means by which any material objectionable to a certain faith is removed. This often involves a dominant religion forcing limitations on less prevalent ones. Alternatively, one religion may shun the works of another when they believe the content is not appropriate for their faith.   Corporate censorship is the process by which editors in corporate media outlets intervene to halt the publishing of information that portrays their business or business partners in a negative light. Privately owned corporations in the business of reporting the news also sometimes refuse to distribute information due to the potential loss of advertiser revenue or shareholder value which adverse publicity may bring. See media bias. Trade secret law may be used by corporations as a censorship device. For example, trade secret law may help keep company-sponsored research confidential, when revealing it would reveal negative health effects of the product researched. ~

Pardoned is the wrong word.   As long as the drowning can be proved to be the threat of imminent death, then it can be defense of others.     You don't pull a knife because you are afraid.|`|ED5i9qC9aa	this sounds like its from the outsiders|`|AA10202315	Good movie!! THE OUTSIDERS!!!|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	The self defense doctrine allows you to save someone else's life as well. It's called the "defense of others" doctrine.|`|VjgqZetcaa	First, it's not generally "murder" unless it is an unauthorized killing, with malice aforethought, meaning he intended to kill. It would be a valid defense that B was only attempting to "help" A, not to kill the "antagonist", thus the maximum charge would be manslaughter, if any.  Note that in some jurisdictions the mere fact of carrying a lethal weapon is presumed to be "premeditation" of any ensuing death.    Second, self-defense and defense of others (with reasonable force) is not a crime, so if there is a drowning murder being attempted by the antagonist, ANYBODY can stop the crime using potentially lethal force, or make a "citizen's arrest" of the felon (although I would certainly recommend killing anyone who would attempt such a crime).    Third, "pardon" is a power reserved to the governor, but the prosecutor would be better off simply releasing the A and B parties after verifying the facts and thus "dismissing" any charges in the death of dirt-bag C.|`|GKAZ8SKVaa	well, kids a knife wielding gang member equals violent.

But technicalities aside, it depends on how they handle the situation. Did they flee or call authorities? If the judge/jury saw it for what it was they would at most charge boy b for possession of a weapon. If not they would convict him of murder definitely.

IxSCF4SZaa	You have several options on becoming an Officer in the Army. 1. you can join the Army Reserves and enroll in the SMP program and complete your degree. Once you complete your degree you can stay in the reserves or go active. While you are in the SMP program you will be able to drill with a local unit and make E5 pay. 2. you can join the Army reserves as an enlisted Soldier and do a direct commission without having a BA. To do a direct commission you will have to be a specialist with WLC which you can most likely get within a year or so, which might be quicker than finishing college before joining. I recommend this path (it is the one I did) since you will learn valuable skills and gain experience not gained by doing OCS. Once you get commissioned you will have 4 years to complete your BA degree. 3. if you want to go active, you will have to complete your degree and then enlist for OCS.|`|2zhQznahaa	Either you can join the military as a regular person - enlisted, and then sign up for a green-to-gold program,    Or you can go to US military acadamy {called USMA},    Or get a letter of approval from teachers, and other people that you know who are high up, and apply to the West Point.  But you need like 2 letters of approval, and I think you have to be selected by your congressman.    Or enroll in college, and apply for the ROTC program.  You have to be a US naturlized, or born citizen for all this.    Or you could go into aviation, and become a pilot, train for the summers and at the same time go to school during the regular year, its at a base in Florida by Daytona called Tyndall afb, or any other one.  The pilot training is for the marines, and they have no commitment requirement till like the 3rd year you do it, or the 3rd summer.    The marines pilot program, is where you cross study, and go to college during the fall and spring semester, and go to flight training in the summer, in florida.    Also, if you get a "Airframe and Powerplant" degree from a community college in Aviation/airplane fixing, you could apply for the army to be a warrent officer, and they would send you through enlisted school, then Warrior Leader Course (to become an NCO,) then upon that you would become a Warrent officer, with a Warrior leader course background, (which would basically qualify you to be an E-5, or a sergeant, were you to ever get stripped of the priviledge to your rank).|`|AA10025824	You need a bachelors degree in almost anything first.

Or, you can enlist in the military, work your way up for several years, then apply for an officers program and advance from enlisted to officer that way.

Now, when employees "make up the difference," and then the discrepancy is found, are employees refunded any excess they paid over what they actually owed?  If not, that is a problem.

OTOH if you get caught in a lie, that will be more trouble for you and the kid, since he IS a british citizen.     It might be best to get him a UK passport.

Unfortuneately, most Republican presidents were vanilla wrapped, at best.  A few even had dubious distinction, such as Nixon !  So, this makes Reagan the only real standout in modern times.    To classify Reagan as the greatest American of all time may be a reach, but to put him next to FDR, the other greatest 20th century president, may be reasonable.|`|ciWdKcgeaa	people forgot how awful of a person he truly is, and George Bush was number 6 so the list isn't that creditable|`|RGZ9l6Utaa	Short Answer: Look again at the list. Of the top 10, 7 were President of the USA and two were entertainers.  The top dog was both a President and an entertainer.  Its simple statistical probability.  People identify with entertainers, but they believe politicians are 'great'.  Anyone who could exist in both categories would naturally win.      Long Answer: The discovery story you posted explains some of Reagan's appeal, but I think you have to consider the lop-sided and unfair nature of the contest for "Greatest American of All Time".  The first recognition must be that "greatest" determined in the media is a popularity contest, and therefore the overarching criteria is fame as determined by the media.  The more modern characters have the advantage of radio, television and now internet media forms to increase their presence in the minds of the voting audience for this contest.  There are countless Americans who are great, but not famous, and therefore you will not see their names on this list.  Some of them did far more for America than did George W. Bush, Oprah Winfrey or even Ronald Reagan, but because they were not famous, they don't even get on the list.  Have no idea why Elvis is on the list except for his fame.    Also, founders Washington or Jefferson, like so many other important characters, were arguably 'greater' than was Reagan, but they lived long ago, and the people voting for 'greatest of all time' are living now.  Who are you more likely to know?  This simple recognition plays substantially into a popularity contest of this type.  Don't forget you are going off a list prepared by a major media content provider who caters to a popular audience.  This same list includes George W Bush as  6, Oprah Winfrey as  9 - clearly the definition of 'greatest' includes 'most famous' as a significant factor.  I have nothing against Oprah, but I don't think she belongs in the top 10 of greatest Americans of all time.  I think Bush will be found over time to be one of the worst American presidents of all time and not a great man in any respect except his fame.    Reagan also represented classic American ideals in a number of influential ways.  First, as an actor, he portrayed a cowboy many times, independent, self-sufficient, honest, hardworking and willing to fight for whats right.  These qualities have been co-opted by the "American Dream" so there is a tight mental connection between Reagan and "Americanism".  Secondly, as a politician, Reagan showed his independence when it came to the nuclear issue.  He defied even his own party and staff to pursue negotiations with Gorbachev and came DAMN CLOSE to an agreement which would have eliminated nuclear weapons by the US and USSR.  I think that Reagan's independent stance was one reason he got the top vote.    Reagan was not a genius - or even very smart in some areas. But he was sincere about his beliefs.  That sincerity showed through to Gorbachev and permitted great improvement in the Soviet/US relations, leading to the end of the cold war.  Reagan deserves substantial credit for that.  Some believe he intended to outspend the Soviets to collapse them economically.  I don't know if I believe that, but if true it certainly worked and would be a credit to him too.    He's tough, too -he survived getting shot.  He was loyal to his wife and never had any scandals (that I can remember) until the whole Iran/Contra affair.  But even then, there was enough people who either discount that scandal because of his Alzheimers or because they believe he was played by Ollie North and others, somehow this important matter has not diminished Reagan's image - at least for this popularity this contest.     Personally, I think George Washington is probably most deserving of the title Greatest American of All Time, and I'm glad to see him high on the list, but I am not surprised to see Reagan win.  Just based on the sheer volume of information available on Reagan compared to historical figures like Washington I think gives Reagan an unfair advantage.|`|YkseyT7zaa	He made Russia go backrupt with trying to keep up with us, thus the downfall of USSR|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Only in the minds of some.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Because he was a male Paris Hilton.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Elvis was  8.

A doddering old fool who never understood a single thing that was going on around him. Ronnie just repeated the lines that were fed to him, as any B actor would.    Some of you may have forgotten the Iran/Contra scandal - I have not. Some of you might not know about the mental health institutions being de-regulated, and losing millions in funding, resulting in hordes of seriously mentally-ill Americans being TURNED OUT into the streets (this was the birth of the 'homeless problem' by the way) but I am aware of it and I do not forgive him for it.

Reagan's firing of 13,000 PATCO air traffic controllers in August of 1981 was the signal for a wave of corporate union-busting and wage-cutting in every sector of the economy. This was accompanied by sweeping cuts in social spending and the gutting of legal restraints on corporate profit-making, including the weakening or lifting of banking regulations.    The decade of the 1980s saw the elimination of 10 million jobs, on the one side, and an explosion of new forms of financial speculation on the other. There was a marked increase in leveraged corporate buyouts. The phenomenon of junk bonds emerged, along with the beginnings of securitization, in which various forms of debt, including mortgage debt, were packaged as bonds and sold to banks, brokerage houses, pension funds, insurance companies and other big investors. The stock market assumed an ever more central role in determining the investment policies of corporations and banks, demanding immediate and high returns at the expense of research and development and long-term planning. The result was an ever-greater accumulation of paper values and debt, which provided the basis for the enrichment of the uppermost social layers at the expense of the vast majority of the population. To cite one statistic: In 1970, wages and salaries comprised 75.4 percent of national income. By 1986, that figure had fallen to 61 percent. The narrowing of economic disparities that had been under way for several decades was reversed.    In reality, the 1980s saw a catastrophic decay in the foundations of American capitalism. Between 1981 and 1986, the US share of world exports slumped from over 20 percent to 13.8 percent. Between 1973 and 1983, US steel production fell 44 percent. The national debt more than doubled under the Reagan administration.    In October of 1987 Wall Street suffered its greatest ever single-day crash in percentage terms, as equities lost 23 percent of their value. The decade ended with the savings and loans collapse, in which more than 1,000 institutions failed and the government organized a bailout costing $160 billion. The sharp decline in the global position of American capitalism was summed up in the transformation of the US in the 1980s from a creditor nation, a status it had maintained since the end of World War I, to a net debtor.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	The last thing I would consider Reagan to be is the greatest American of all time.|`|aPKW0ljVaa	according to his fan club, not sure if there's a concensus on that one.    must have been the cowboy movies.

I am a hard-line conservative, and I even found myself agreeing with some of Obama's goals last night.  But the difference between him and me is our approach and methodology to achieve those goals.  I believe in smaller government and more personal responsibility; Obama is pushing larger government with more government controls.  Obama talked about reducing the deficit and controlling spending, but he is quick to sigh legislation that is spending record amounts.  So the only way to balance his budget is to raise taxes (more government control) and that will slow the economy.|`|gx3TOrdeaa	<a href="http://gettinginfo.us.to" rel="nofollow">http://gettinginfo.us.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|22de26f75b15a054a9f0b24dec437f77aa	Excited about politics?

But would a person with the best interests of his state actually refuse money simply because the Republican leadership says it should be refused?

They believe that terrorism is some made up facet of conservative mindset so that republicans can keep in office. Ignorant if you ask me.

I can guarantee you that your kids will be around pot smokers before they reach high school. I was around them my entire school career and never touched the stuff.

I am also against alcohol. But I will say that if the prisons would set free those who constantly get busted for having a small amount of pot, it would free millions of dollars for upkeep of these prisoners. Even getting locked up for only 30 days is a big expense in a county jail. I can see incarcerating drug dealers but not the ones with a couple of joints. Alcohol kills innocent bystanders from wrecks, abuse.  Get the drunks off the roads, not pot smokers. But don't drive high on pot either!  Have a happy day.

You disregard the money and famous thing, but seriously, money makes the world go round, and I'm sure many people get into politics at least partly for the money.    But personally, it would depend where you were president of - the USA's far too big and complex - a nice small island with only a few hundred people on it would be much easier.|`|77lIzq4Taa	I would not, I don't want to live in the fish bowl that ANY President lives in.

a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Rather than take the opinions - and you know what they say about opinions - of the people in Y!A, I strongly suggest you go visit your recruiter and talk to him.  Recruiters aren't the double-talking, used-car-salesmen people make them out to be.      I did 23 years in the Air Force and wish I had it to do all over again, if that helps.|`|b01dgtZyaa	Your first step would be to find out where the nearest recruiter location is. Just go in and talk to the guy and he will answer anything you want to know.     I guess your asking about Basic Training? The Air Force basic training was pretty easy when I went through, but I hear that the were recently Re-Buffing it to match up with Army standards. Its tough at first but it gets you in real good shape. The MTIs will be mean to you, but a little yelling never hurt anyone. AF BMT is in San Antonio Texas, which is in the southern tip of TX. It gets pretty hot down there in the summer so I would try and go in the cooler months if I were you.     The Air Force treats their people better than any other branch. (some of em hate us for it) After BMT its pretty much like a regular 9-5 job with weekends off.|`|htaxf1jJaa	You go see your local recruiter and tell him that you want to join. And it's bmt, but it's tough...little sleep, little time to eat, lots of pt [physical training] and running. my boyfriend is at basic right now for the Air Force and he wrote me in a letter that it was harder than he expected but that he's strong and usually everyone who has gone through basic/boot camp said that it wasn't easy but it was the best thing they've done in their lives. [my brother told me that when he graduated boot camp for the Marines]. not gunna lie, its gunna be hard with all the ti's screaming in your face and a lot of running and a lot of pt esp with little sleep, but it's worth it to be able to serve for our country.|`|kbz5S3waaa	there's also a forum on military.com about the new AF BMT - not bct by the way.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Go see a recruiter.  They can answer almost all of your questions.  Then if you still have specific ones, you can come back and ask.    A lot of people really like the Air Force.  The ones I have seen who have been miserable are those who joined for the wrong reasons.  Because they couldn't find a job and they have little or no skills, because they wanted out of the house, because they want the gov't to pay for their education, etc.  It is a REAL service.  It is not an unemployment agency.  So just keep that in mind and consider what your reasons are for joining.

Lying would defeat the purpose.<br>  <br>  Thus, your analogy is completely idiotic.<br>  <br>  Everyone who has either a brain or a heart (and just as some people have neither, some people have both) realizes that it's in everyone's interest that people have health care.<br>  <br>  It's only those with neither brain nor heart who think that a few people should keep all the profit from everyone else's labor, not pay taxes, and be the sole beneficiaries of government.<br>  <br>  Employers who underpay employees, keep most of the money for themselves, and pay a lower rate of tax than their least-paid employees are the thieves.<br>  <br>  Allowing people to die of or suffer from treatable conditions is inhuman. But then, those who have neither brain nor heart are inhuman.

Our nation is really hurting economically and McCain was clueless in his plans to help boost the economy.  What really favored Obama was his reaction to the stock-market crisis.

If he wasn't acting urgent about it, the 24 hour news pundits would be saying that he wasn't taking the economic crisis seriously.  He is.  Besides, every bill a President ever presents is backed up by this kind of talk.  Presidents don't write bills just to do something, they write bills when there is a problem they need to address directly to Congress.  A president's job is enforcement of the law, they are given the ability to introduce bills as a way to expedite crisis resolution that must be solved through legal channels.    I'm curious what would be in a stimulus bill that actually created jobs.  The only thing that creates jobs are 1) a need or service people must be willing to pay for and 2) employees with the proper skill set to provide the need or service in an efficient manner.|`|412f673354a42041faf908ccbc558571aa	It just proves that you just can't please everyone.

It wasn't supporting or going against a leader, it was trying to get elected.  There's a difference between attacking an opponent in an election by saying that you want to win (it's a competition, I would hope you'd want to win a competition), and saying you want our president to fail.  John McCain failed to achieve the presidency, and we have Obama as the president, there's no direct harm through that.  Obama fails in office and everyone suffers, I don't know why people want that.      Edit: I went to your link, and I think the questions there are unfairly different from the situation we're looking at.  So called success of the surge led to a massive death toll in Iraq.  I'm sure Obama did hope for some sort of stability after the surge, but at the same time I don't think he supported the idea of going in and causing mass murder to bring peace to a relatively small portion of the country.  There's a difference between supporting a large death toll for peace and hoping a domestic policy that you may disagree with does what people says it will.
hwGUthV2aa	People who are stuck in dualistic thinking (rightly so, as fueled by our propaganda machine the media) can not help but critisize what they have read. Bushy didn't even give us the option of reading through and making up our own mind what we like and don't like. What dualists don't understand is that Obama is chosing to inform us, and for that alone he should be held in high regard. But dualists (obviously primarily neo cons) still can not even see past the labels that come with the name Obama. <br>  <br>  The more the USA is associated with the name Obama the sooner worldwide respect can be accomplished, regardless of what neo cons like or don't like.

The Associated Press is a "liberal" media, by the way.<br>  ===<br>  FACT CHECK: Obama<br>  glosses over complex<br>  realities<br>  By CALVIN WOODWARD and JIM KUHNHENN | Associated Press Writers<br>  WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama's assurance Tuesday that his mortgage-relief plan will only benefit deserving homeowners appears to be a stretch. <br>  <br>  Even officials in his administration, many supporters of the plan in Congress and the Federal Reserve chairman expect some of that money will go to people who should have known better than to buy that huge house. <br>  <br>  The president glossed over a number of complex realities in delivering his speech to Congress and a nation hungry for economic salvation. <br>  <br>  A look at some of his assertions: <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money does not go to home buyers who used bad judgment, it hasn't announced it. <br>  <br>  Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it's important to save some of those people for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. <br>  <br>  "I think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed." <br>  <br>  Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it's not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn't afford. <br>  <br>  "I think it's just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans," Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don't mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. <br>  <br>  Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won't be 10 years from now. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn't only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That's all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama's proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	I dont think anyone has criticized Obama for issuing rebates to taxpayers. If they have, its the method (reducing payroll tax over 40 weeks) and that the amount is not large enough. <br>  Bush's TARP plan was specific to the banking industry. It was written and passed by the Democrats. It is they that are now complaining that the bill they wrote and passed provided for too little oversight. Bush spent only half of the TARP money. He did not release the second half until he received Obama's approval to do so, 3 weeks before inauguration. Again Bush's program was aimed specifically at the banking system, not the general economy.<br>  Here is the fundamental problem with Obama's cap on salary at financial institutions. There are still very profitable divisions within these banks, like wealth management divisions. If the EVP of wealth management at Bank of America whose division made 500 million in profit last year, is no longer allowed to collect his profit generated bonus plan, he will be recruited by a foreign bank, such as RBS or UBS and paid for his ability to bring that profit base with him. He will still make his salary and bonus, and he will drain a profit center from Bank of America. It is a ridiculous plan, and expect Obama will see the light soon.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	The Bush stimulus package went to the banks because it was the government's fault many of those banks went under to begin with.  It was only right for the government to pay them back.<br>  <br>  Back in 1995-1996, Congress and the President (both controlled by Democrats) forced banks to issue housing loans to lower income families.  The banks reluctantly did so knowing that the people would not be able to pay them back.  The houses ended up in foreclosure and the banks lost their shirts.  It's only right that the government make up for thier mistake.

They don't want to be like the democrats who were for the war and then against it.

When will you people get it?|`|Fy54FMemaa	It's only scary if she makes another guest appearance on SNL|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	It scares me, and I'm not even American.    The woman is insane, and an idiot. Seriously, a goldfish knows more geography and international politics than she does. She won't beat Obama (and I'm no fan of Mr. Obama) - she probably wouldn't even get elected as the party nominee. She's appalling at making speeches, rubbish at debates, and the media hates her. She doesn't have a chance.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	No, I personally hope Sarah Palin challenges the president in 2012 because that will just guarantee another term for Barack.    The  1 reason people didn't vote for McCain was because of Sarah Palin.|`|zjpB2GARaa	The media absolutely hates Sarah Palin.  They are not going to engage in shrill attacks unlike any we have ever seen before.    If she comes out with a principled limited government platform in 2012 and nominates a VP candidate who has an unblemished (or nearly unblemished) record of support for limited government (some good VP picks I can think of are: Ron Paul, Gary Johnson, Barry Goldwater Jr., Jeff Flake), I think she has a chance of beating Obama.    Part of the reason Palin looked so clueless during the campaign last year was that McCain was putting all kinds of crap into her head.    The Republican ticket in 2012 has to energize both the Ron Paul movement (and of course, we actually mean it when we say we're for limited government and free markets) and the established Republican base in order to beat Obama.  If the 2 factions opposed to Obama end up feuding again, we're looking at a 2nd term for Obama.|`|rl11rrqVaa	NOPE!|`|PD85QwlJaa	This will only assure a landslide for Obama in the next election.|`|MWY6yAyraa	I don't think she "scares" liberals...I think she represents a lot of attributes that many liberals hold a lot of hate for...i.e. traditional values...monogamy with a member of the opposite sex...Christian beliefs...etc    Besides...most liberals don't care enough to get their fact straight...THAT'S WHY it sounds like a "smear"....    Liberals should simply be honest and say "I don't like Christians", " I think a Governor has less experience than a community organizer" I think families that look like the Waltons with surfer names should have no say so in politics", " I think that ANYBODY that is not an Atheist and a social liberal should sit down and shut up.    BTW...The fact that Sarah Palin is hot...I'm sure rattles a lot of the "all natural" hippy types...|`|y3hRdUI3aa	I think we should all be scared.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	No.  We just don't want to see her pitiful face again.  Go away, Palin.  Go back to your cave and never come out of it.|`|us6s78pWaa	It should scare them. Even though she would definitely lose. Haha    But on a more serious note, I would like to respond to your questions with a question of my own: Why does your "heart soar" to see Obama as President? He's more Caucasian than African-American. Genetically, he's 1/2 and 1/2, but he was raised by a white woman and has never actually been exposed to Black culture. The only thing Black about him is pigment...and even that is debatable.|`|8pzX7YYPaa	Please, mrs soccer mom. HA HA HA. her reputation is scared for life. Her vocabulary and conversation is limited.

I mean she didn't know that Africa was a continent until she was 44, the idea of this woman becoming one of the G8 leaders terrifies me.     Anyway, Palin is not a senator, she will find it hard to stay in the public view for 4 years.

They will go-on thinking she's too stupid to worry about.  About 1/3 of liberals already forgot who she is.  About 1/6 of liberals, know, understand and are afraid; very, very afraid.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	Not me, I love Sarah!|`|EsHsmwDiaa	I don't think it scares anyone.  She wouldn't stand a chance against Obama.  She needs to just go away!!|`|AA11148986	Not really.    Palin helped kill McCain's presidential hopes after people got to know her better through various interviews ("In what way Charlie?" and the infamous Russia rant during Katie Couric's interview)    If Obama's policies don't work for America, I think he would still win in a presidential run against her.|`|mkCjcG5oaa	Yes but, probably not in the way you think it does.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	The 'liberals' are not going to be contesting the 2012 election. The only two organisations with a hope of getting a candidate elected are    1) The Republican Party    and    2) The Democratic Party    On the grounds that it is both destructive and dangerous for a country to become a one-party state, it is to be hoped that both parties put forward electable candidates.   In particular, the demise of the GOP would be a very serious loss to America, no matter what Gore Vidal thinks.  An unfettered autocracy of the Democratic Aristocracy (Clintons, Kennedys, and the others) would be a nail in America's coffin.    Until the Republican Party wakes up, faces the fact that they treated the voting population of the United States of America with contempt, they will betray everything anyone who has ever worked for them has achieved.    Sarah Palin was presented to the voters like something out of a bad ad-campaign, with the slogan 'LOOK - this is like you.  This is you, this is.  All dumb like yourselves. Now go vote for her.'    Firings should have taken place, and if they don't the GOP will go the same way the British Conservative Party did after they lost Margaret Thatcher.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	yes they are scared, thats why they talk so much smack about her....|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Man I am so sick of hearing about her from BOTH sides.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	It should scare everyone.  We just went through 8 years of total incompetence and, by any rational accounting, Palin is dumber than Bush.  God help us if this lunatic gets control of the country.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	It scares me. And I didn't vote for Obama.    She need's to give up.......SERIOUSLY.|`|IUw5Z395aa	You have a refreshing sense of humor|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Nope.  If she ran and actually got the nominatino i would be thrilled.  Come on, she has no chance against Obama.  She is a loon.

Both sides are guilty of this and the collapse of our freedoms is eminant as government only grows larger trying to find a solution for us by spending ourselves out of debt.

There is ONE right wing news show. Fox. EVERY other news show is for the left. Now lets go with MTV, Comedy central and other main stream shows like that. Where do you think the 18 year olds in this nation who know NOTHING about politics got their info? MTV. This election was sooooo bias to the left on news channels, even the Today Show brought it up and they are for the left! Did you see how many negative adds and clips were put on about McCain on the left wing news shows?? Could we go back and find any negative clips on obama???? NOPE! well, yes, on Fox. So for people to say that the mainstream news are not bias....I'm going to their high school and kicking them in the nuts for letting them graduate.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	The Matrix has them!  Liberals worship the media like Christians worship their Bible...  It is somewhat of a double standard if you ask me.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Why would our corporate media have bias towards the LEFT?  ----    The claim of media "liberal bias" is a myth used by conservative politicians. Propagating this myth serves three functions. First, it creates reluctance among mainstream media outlets to cover issues that conservatives don't want them to, for fear that they will be accused of having a liberal bias. Second, it allows conservatives to deny or dismiss reports in the mainstream media, regardless of whether they are true, because they have discredited the source already. Third, attacking the media can be effective at increasing conservative voter turnout.|`|pGAUjHwvaa	If this is indeed true, your point is very well taken|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Oh, there are bias on both sides, that's for sure ...    That being said, we have to agree that the right wing bias is somewhat more evident than it is for thei opponent.    For exemple, when you hear a documentary by O'Reilly on how liberals see the world presenting the city of San Francisco, composed only of bums, gays and pot smokers ... you wanna say "is it really what liberals are about????"    Believe me when I say that, Fox News is by far the most biased media i have ever watched ... it's unbelievable!!!|`|VR7JfxM4aa	On January 20, 2000 there were protesters standing 3-deep around the Supreme Court Building.

8gnp5Kkjaa	He talked mostly about the economic stimulus package that he just signed a few days ago.  <br>  <br>  Basically it's like this:  <br>  <br>  The US economy stopped growing like it had been doing every year for the last ten years.  Houses aren't being sold at the same rate.  Home values are declining.  Banks are not lending like they were which is hurting the ability of small business and individuals to get loans to purchase houses, cars, equipment, etc.  So that slows down the economy even more.  And since the US economy is so big, it effects the rest of the world as well.<br>  <br>  What the stimulus package is, is a big gamble on the ability of the economy to recover if enough money is invested in the right places.  They are betting our future on whether or not this stimulus works.  They are trying to create jobs and stimulate economic growth by giving tax breaks to the vast majority of tax payers and also spending money on public projects like road and bridge maintenance and construction and various other programs as well.  It is a huge (1,070 pages!) bill that no one really read through before they signed it into law.  Which to me really does not make sense.  There was this huge sense or urgency that if they did not do something right now then everything would come crashing down on top of us.  It was almost as if some people were trying to scare the populous into supporting the plan.<br>  <br>  Some say that this stimulus will result in greater dependency on and expansion of the federal government.  Some cry socialism.  Others believe that the free market needs fixing.<br>  <br>  So who knows if it will work and what the results will be?  That's the thing about gambling.  You don't know the outcome until it happens.  And it will take a while to see results from anything that happens now.<br>  <br>  It does not really matter though because all of us are along for the ride whether we like it or not.<br>  <br>  Oh, and he also plans to try to have all the troops out of Iraq in 18 months and is sending an additional 17,000 or so to Afghanistan and will also be working with Pakistan on their terrorist problem as well.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	It's purposefully unexplainable. It meant nothing. It said I know you guys don't like the whole bailout thing, but I'm doing it anyway. I promise to fix the economy but have no real plan. Obama is the President of the corporation of America stationed in the White House. Presidents of corporations have an allegiance to it's shareholders and the bottom line.

That cannot be allowed in the New Obama Republic.    Obamerica. Dig on it awhile. And in two or three years, we will see what people are saying.

T0pkW783aa	The libs are out to destroy freedom of speech and many other freedoms that we have had in the past; those which our Constitution was based on.      Every day you see more and more people trying to take away the things that we once held dear.  They try to take prayer and anything to do with God out of the picture.  They disrespect our rights and try to diminish the things that should be important.  If someone doesn't like something; they are permitted to make changes that affect us all. (Saluting the flag, reciting the pledge, saying a prayer, speaking your mind about something that is important to you, etc.)      We have to start standing up for our freedoms and stop allowing the minority groups from taking things away from us.  One person can object to "a moment of silence" in school and we bow down and allow them to take it away.  Some object to "in God we trust" and it is an issue.  There cannot be "fair and balanced if we continue to allow the media to make the choices for us.      We are turning into a Socialist nation where our freedoms are being taken away and it is being allowed.  We need to make our voices be heard before the government takes over and makes every decision for us.      Stimulus package??  This is just a way to reach into your pocket and rob you while telling you a fairy tale about where the money is actually going.  They aren't going to tell you.  Look at where the money went that was supposed to bail us out of trouble!!      When you vote for people who believe in tax and spending you into oblivion, this is what you get!!  When we get so offended by someone's opinion that we have to remove it from view, then we are in trouble!!  Both sides of the issue should be heard.  Talk radio is fine and shouldn't be limited because you don't agree with an opinion.   You don't eliminate something because you have a difference.  You can object, debate and offer your own opinion and it should be permitted. I don't want to live in a world where you can only express your opinion if you agree with one group.  That is a dictatorship and it is not what I want.  We should not continue to allow this to happen.|`|aI6QFXClaa	YES Racist WHITE BASTARD!|`|vzNgMUdBaa	Limbaugh is too stupid for watchdog designation.

9RXS67Mmaa	The delay was not accepted because the bandwidth from the lower VHF channels is being allocated to EMS, police, government services, and better mobile phone coverage (4G service).    I think the public is procrastinating in their preparing for what has already become a real disaster in the making. Folks who have no idea whether they are "good to go" all the way to folks who have no clue as to how to hook up the converter boxes, let alone how to program them and operate them. It is bound to be a huge mess for the electronically illiterate consumer (Grandma, and grandpa, for instance).    I have an aunt in her 70s who has all but given up looking at her TV since she has no idea of how to operate that converter box, for example. I had to go to her house to install it and program it so she could still have her TV. She just does not understand why she needs a box, and why her TV will no longer operate without it. I told her she must either learn how to operate this box, buy a new TV, get on cable, or get a satellite system (yet another confusing box). I don't think a couple of months is going to make much difference in the public perception of how this is going to finish unfolding.    There are going to be a lot of questions and the learning curve is going to be steep, but we must move forward to free up the bandwidth that has already been auctioned off and contracted for the uses that were stated earlier, otherwise the new equipment that has already been installed will sit idle and cost the companies who bought the bandwidth more money by waiting to launch new services.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I hope it puts the analog media out of business.

The "on his watch" argument also sticks, but Bush and the Republicans did nothing to stop the madness of zero down, 40 year loans.

Sadly, most voters just take sides and blindly root for their "team", justifying and excusing the actions that don't fit in with the party platforms or even the basic tenents of the Constitution. It is one of the most unfortunate pitfalls of a two party system and divides the country.

Neither I nor anyone I have ever met, regardless of ethnicity or religion, has any problem with the word "Jew".|`|mdHqr17kaa	????    why do you feel comfortable in plainly writing the word "Jew" in your question, but uncomfortable in plainly writing the word "Israel?"|`|pnpkJKvpaa	It's not, but it has been used in the past to justify terrible things.     Remember the Holocaust?|`|kE29abUUaa	The word Jew isn't offensive. Saying something like "You're a damn Jew!" however, is offensive because it's used in a negative way.    I also don't see any Jews saying the word Jew is offensive when in some sort of defence of Israel? That just sounds idiotic to me and you have no idea on what you're talking about.|`|98JZcrO6aa	it depends whether you are using it derogatory or not.     For example, if you called a jewish person a Jew then it isn't offensive.     If however you said " you effing Jew" then yes that would be offensive|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	Because whenever someone rants about Israel they usually act like it's the fault of every Jew in the world.  I don't have any more control or influence in Israel than your dog does!  It's not Jews they have a beef with, it's the Israeli government, and they're not all Jews, believe it or not.  There are Arab Israelis (both Christian and Muslim) and they can vote and serve in the legislature.  Yitzak Rabin's government was criticized by radical Jewish extremists, before his assassination, for not being "authentically Jewish" because his coalition depended on Arab parties for support.  So the Israeli government isn't all Jewish, anymore than the American government is all Christian.  Yes, they predominate, but it's not an exclusive club, you know?|`|hdcLCk8Faa	Consider this in the same way the "N" word is construed.  If a black uses it, it is OK, if a white uses it, it is racism.     It matters the context in which it is used. Just as the "N" word can be used in a racist way or for humor among blacks, the word Jew can be as well.     As for the Jews being Jews, they see themselves as Jews-not Israeli-European or Israeli American (as the blacks do), they are all Jews no matter their country of residence.

BLMh0dG6aa	First of all; I'm certain that youre wrong, because I saw many interviews with him before he even ran for president.    2nd of all, a majority of people, who voted, voted for him and therefore- hopefully- already knew about him; this after debates, and after both his and his family were interviewed numerous time during the campaign.    Thirdly, as many of your (I assume) fellow conservative republicans have commented upon, the press couldnt seem to get enough of Obama after the election; (believe some of your more conservative comrades even called it a the press having a love-fest with him).|`|azypqsphaa	i think it's funny...|`|7zf05NWsaa	I believe we all saw this coming.

I don't think that he's not going to change many Islamists minds but I know he's not making a stupid mistake. By the way, I'd still vote for Obama again because I am so relieved that Bush is out of office.|`|VOfRarrhaa	It shows diplomacy and respect. Intolerance breeds intolerance.    Also he's only been in office a week and 1 day, not a few.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Welcome to the new world my fine neocon! The US will no longer stick their nose in everybody else's business and demand that they change their ways for fear of military action. The US will now lead the way by example and hold all responsible for their actions. The US will concentrate on taking care of us, as in US.  Of course the sore losers on the other side of the isle refuse to recognize this evolutionary process and have vowed to be a nuisance in the process. The old guard is afraid of change and it will prove to be their downfall.  The current mess we find ourselves in has evolved over eight years and wont be solved in a week. But for the first time in a very long time America is confident and hopeful for the future.|`|zt6fnzK3aa	Because at the end of the day whether Republicans or Bush fans want to admit or not, Bush's policies toward the MiddleEast dragged the American name to the ground. Obama has to go and clean up the mess that Bush made by doing whatever he can to show his understanding of the trouble that Bush's leadership has caused and how he truly wants to work with other countries in the world rather than speak and act as if Americans are the only people whose future  matters the way that Bush did.     And to answer your second question, yes I would vote for him again because the man stands for the exact ideals that this country was built on and is proving to be the first US President in God knows how long whose mission is to unite the US with other countries around the world rather than simply start wars to accomplish a personal agenda the way Bush did for 8 years and the way McCain would have continued to do had he won the election.
a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I live in a large city but have many friends who live in the country--some of those are farmers.  You are correct that there are more conservatives in rural areas than urban areas.  If you look at my state's election map, you can see exactly where the cities are in the states because they are blue spots in a sea of red.<br>  <br>  I can only write about my personal observations with those that I know.  My rural friends are much more independent and they are very against what they see as government intrusion into their lives.  Even simple things like the fact that I have to pay for a permit and comply with city standards if I want to put up a fence around my yard.  I have to pay and ask permission.  Even then I'm not allowed to have a fence over six feet high.  My frinds in the country are astonished that I willingly go along with this.  They're more used to making their own decisions and doing what they want on their own property.  They are very against losing that freedom.<br>  <br>  Overall, they simply want to be left alone.  They often have an attitude of, "Get out of my way and let me do it myself".<br>  <br>  Many of my friends are hunters.  When the farmers are in the fields, they normally carry a gun with them just in case.  They want to keep the right to own guns and use them---and they don't want to have the government know everything about their choices to own guns.  I live in a city and don't own a gun.  I don't hunt and have few worries about snakes.<br>  <br>  If you think about something like the stimulus bill, what benefits will rural people get from it?  Probably very little yet they'll be paying for it.  The programs for family planning and STD's will mostly be spent in cities because that's where the percentage is higher for the need.  The programs for youth services will mostly go to cities because that's where it's supposed to be needed.    Running internet into rural areas is an interesting idea but all of my friends already have satellite for the cable service.|`|qai8pcnaaa	When you're exposed to many different things that change rapidly in a city, you tend to be more liberal (like the person above me just explained).

Un3YxFvRaa	If you haven't read the Associated Press' article about O glossing over (aka lying) about the major issues, please read below.  It's enlightening.<br>  <br>  FACT CHECK: Obama<br>  glosses over complex<br>  realities<br>  By CALVIN WOODWARD and JIM KUHNHENN | Associated Press Writers<br>  WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama's assurance Tuesday that his mortgage-relief plan will only benefit deserving homeowners appears to be a stretch. <br>  <br>  Even officials in his administration, many supporters of the plan in Congress and the Federal Reserve chairman expect some of that money will go to people who should have known better than to buy that huge house. <br>  <br>  The president glossed over a number of complex realities in delivering his speech to Congress and a nation hungry for economic salvation. <br>  <br>  A look at some of his assertions: <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money does not go to home buyers who used bad judgment, it hasn't announced it. <br>  <br>  Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it's important to save some of those people for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. <br>  <br>  "I think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed." <br>  <br>  Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it's not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn't afford. <br>  <br>  "I think it's just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans," Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don't mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. <br>  <br>  Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won't be 10 years from now. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn't only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That's all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama's proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress. Second, waste, fraud and abuse are routinely targeted by presidents who later find that the savings realized seldom amount to significant sums. Programs that a president might consider wasteful have staunch defenders in Congress who have fought off similar efforts in the past. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "Over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: This is a recurrent Obama formulation. But job crea|`|zmmP52P3aa	that's just the normal liberal double-talk.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Why wouldn't you invest in the future?|`|eulMjLtPaa	He was referring to Bush's squandering the budget surplus.

ITS NOT FOR U..|`|81fffddd6bb0bf3234c91426166d23c5aa	Yes, I notice the clip of President Obama's union of speech. I did not watch the whole of it. I see bigger government means get involved and build new more programs. So has President Obama done that with massive spending ansd open new programs last month. President Obama just hope to give you a pep talk to encourage you to think he would not add anything to make a bigger government to get you excited and forget the values of the foundation of constiution.<br>  <br>   Go back to history that started with the founding fathers. Benjaim Franklin, stated that he argued to the nature laws- A rule is  "must think throughout before saying" as he and the others wrote the Constiution. The freemasons grew rapid with any means of conception of mind, spiritual, and character, as they fought to be indepedence from Britain , because of having the Church of England beinmg preoccuppied to many degree of laws- controlled over human beings and Tax.  They see themselves became the surempe beings.  Build upon liberty on simply freedom from English restrictions, perarhaps nothing more than freedom from Stamp Tax. It means compelte freedom from England. It means for over hundred ages, After the country became America, we are entitled to have the free self controlled government where don't need to govern you as the way they want. It means you are entitled to self govern. What do you think why IRS and tax codes added after 200 years of free tax. Primarily trade for ages which given many people the propersity. Today it calls small businesses or mom and pop businesses which mainly create economy in this country, which President Obama could not say that.  On his part, he made it a big deal about the rich people or corporation/Wall street/banks which thought to create economy. which is not the ones to create the economy. With trade unions and Global trade  it becomes a different country than it was. You notice almost of everything made in China, because we made a deal with them having theirs exports into our country while borrowed their $$$. Probably going to ask China to buy debts,then owns us in a way,  if so, the next generation will still have to pay forever, not much having propserity.

Wright instead of digging a bit deeper to learn more about the man and his viewpoints.  If racism didn't exist, the focus on Rev. Wright wouldn't have been a caricature but would have pointed out that the infamous "GD America, Chickens have come home to roost" sound bites were from sermons where he was repeating the words of a (white) UN Ambassador concerning US foreign policy.  The CIA calls it "blow back".  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/042520...</a><br>  <br>  I saw him on Bill Moyer's Journal (PBS) one Friday evening and he struck me as a very learned and thoughtful man.

R5Tn1aXEaa	I don't know what to tell you - I lived within my means & did the right thing until I was injured & lost my job. Now, I'm losing my home & all I've worked for these last fifteen years - can't even sell it for what I've got in it.If I can go under, so can those other guys. Let those assholes sell out &  take the loss like a lot of us out there are having to do. Hard working even minded people like us will always be in the middle of this tug of war between the rich & the poor. Nobody is safe when you walk the straight line it seems. Just look at the payoff. I don't want to be like them. I can lose & move on - I don't need govt. money nor do I expect you or anyone else to bail me out. Although I didn't purchase a million dollar home, I knew what I was getting into & my luck just changed. Nobody's fault. I'm man enough to take it on the chin & move on. Not beg for taxpayer money to keep me at a standard of living that I no longer am a part of. Life throws you a curve sometimes. You just get back up & do it again. No stimulus.|`|EObwbJgUaa	Its called socialism, and its what obama wants.<br>  Here's a little story:<br>  Once my dad was talking to a friend, about houses.

And I'm with you. <br>  <br>  We work hard, bought a house we could afford even though we would have liked one bigger.  We live within our means, don't have credit cards or other loans, and pay our bills on time.<br>  <br>  Then there is my next door neighbor whose yard is a pit and she is almost in foreclosure, and SHE is getting bailed out because she prefers to have a big screen television and an XBox and a Wii rather than to pay her mortgage.<br>  <br>  Some people say that it adds to our home value when her house is not foreclosed on, but her house is such a pit that it brings down the whole neighborhood, and if she can't afford the house, she shouldn't be in it.<br>  <br>  That is not my fault, and I should not have to pay for her bad decisions.  We get nothing for playing by the rules.  Just higher taxes.|`|R7Hexutqaa	What you fail to take into account was that your neighbor's loan was made by professionals following the rules.  One of the rules was:  "The value of real estate always goes up".  It was not a gamble - as it had been essentially a sure thing for 40 years.  That rule changed and made millions of good loans go bad in the process.  And that is not your neighbor's fault.  <br>  <br>  The only reason that you are not in the same boat is probably due to when your bought your house, not how much you paid for it.<br>  <br>  But I have to ask, if your neighbor's house caught fire and the fire department came to put it out, would you be resentful of that tax payer benefit he got that you helped pay for with your taxes?    No one plans to have a fire but we have a plan in case there is one.  No one plans to have a housing price bubble burst, but there is clean up to be done when it happens.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	It’s good for you, because if his house sells at 60% of its actual value it'll decrease the value of your house|`|PCVJg5ieaa	Do we even realize how much WE ALL are getting screwed over by the top 1/10th of 1 percent here?

Your neighbors house is not being paid for.  They are going to be able to refinance it at a lower rate than the original thus keeping it from being foreclosed.  The fact that it will not be foreclosed is actually helping your own property value|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	They are not being bailed out.They are getting to refinance their home at a price they can now afford per month WITHOUT the balloon payments that caused it to happen.Not everyone can be saved,if they have no job and no prospects of a job in the near future,they may not even qualify.Obama made sure they must qualify for these loans.If you want to blame,then start with the bank,the realtor and wall street they are why this happened.In my opinion the banks should have and could have helped their clients but did nothing except take the first money and did nothing.That's who you should be mad at.You can also refinance but that is not always the best way to go and so you know that of course.Why so much hate? Do you honestly think that sometime in your lifetime you will never need help of any kind?And just for the record in many many cities you can buy cheaper than rent so they thought they were doing the best thing.I know of a family married 22 years,worked the same job with pay increases for 17 years,another for 10 both got laid off with only 2 years left on their mortgage going into foreclosure,bank refused to work with them they did nothing wrong either is that Right??The bank is literal STEALING THAT HOUSE! I don't know about you but that is certainly wrong!!! There are millions out there,I don't say all deserve saving but I certainly think most did nothing wrong,you can't say they bought more house than they needed they bought it 15 years ago.So yeah guess if you don't walk in those shoes you have no compassion even for the ones who did everything right like you claim you have.Sad our country has come so low.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Who said life is fair?  <br>  Your neighbor’s house may be bigger and better than yours.  That’s a good thing, because he’s going to be living in that house for the rest of his damn life.  He will never, EVER get another mortgage.  According to the latest plan, if his lender has to write down his mortgage so he can keep “his” home, if he ever sells it for more than the amount to which it is written down, his lender will be entitled to recover all or part of its loss.  He will never, EVER qualify for another mortgage.<br>  <br>  The “predatory lenders” we have heard so much about made bad loans because they were forced to do so by politicians and special interest groups like ACORN.  According to the “rules,” a bankruptcy follows you for seven years, then it is expunged from your credit history.  That’s pure BS.  I was in the commercial finance industry for more than 30 years.  I had a prospective client who lost his home in a foreclosure more than 25 years ago.  It was easy enough to find, and it was easier still to tell him to take a hike.  <br>  <br>  Your neighbor may have a party to celebrate his “windfall,” at your expense and mine, but he will pay for it.  And he will pay dearly.  If his employer decides to lay off some people, he will probably be one of the first to go.  Companies don’t want deadbeats on their payrolls.  They are too big a risk.<br>  <br>  In business, integrity is everything.  If your neighbor took advantage of the “system,” it’s likely everyone knows about it.  He will pay dearly for his “windfall,” believe  me.|`|AA12377116	I understand your position. It was difficult to naviate through the financial choices of the past decade, and to avoid gambling in the real estate market, and I do resent anyone who gets bailed out after taking advantage of loans they knew they would never be able to repay.<br>  <br>  I believe that the lenders and the borrowers should realize the same result for their endeavours, that is that the homeowners who gambled should lose their homes and return to renting, without penalty against their credit. I believe that the lending institutions should be forced to take the properties they hold as collateral and, if they bottom out then so be it.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is ideal, but this is not capitalism, this is a whole bunch of greedy people trying to manipulate the system in order to realize as much profit as is possible and, they failed.

Na7NqZnMaa	"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die, so that you may live as you wish." ~ Mother Theresa|`|ikpKEqIlaa	I had an abortion yesterday. I think it's a very personal decision.  Prior to having it, I was the kind of person who was always against abortion, but then I found out I was pregnant.  My boyfriend (who didn't push me to have the abortion) made it clear that if I had the baby, I'd be raising him or her on my own.  I'm already a single mom of 2, and I felt having this baby would be irresponsible.  My 2 kids that I've struggled financially and emotionally to take care of, would struggle more if I had chosen to keep this baby.  I wouldn't have been able to take care of them financially or physically and work full-time if I had chosen to continue with the pregnancy.  My decision was not selfish, I wanted that baby, but I did this for my kids, because it was the responsible thing to do.<br>  <br>  Is killing a baby wrong? absolutely!  But this was not a BABY!  I was 5 weeks pregnant.  I saw the ultrasound, they had to do a vaginal ultrasound b/c they couldn't see anything from the regular ultrasound (that rubbed on your stomach).  Even from the vaginal ultrasound, all you could see was this small empty black space (this was the sac), you couldn't even see the fetus, it was literally smaller than a pin prick.  Yes, I know it had a heartbeat, but so does a spider and I'm sure you've killed a spider before.  A spider is probably 1000 times bigger than this fetus was.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying I agree with abortion in every situation.  My boyfriend knows this woman who over the years has had a total of 6 abortions; I think someone like that should be sterilized!  But I think each situation is different and every woman has the right to choose what's best for her situation|`|ljRE5MeAaa	There are valid arguments on both sides and zealots on both sides.<br>  Ultimately, it comes down to where people believe life begins, conception or birth.<br>  Personally, I think that it is disgusting when used as contraception and a abomination in partial birth.

c3vPZfghaa	Because they serve a functional purpose in foreign relations just like anything else.  Many things have a functional aspect that is worth exploring before making any radical decisions. Most things don't become a problem until the people who control them, want to make them become a problem.    And no, 95% of the things you enjoy, would not cease to exist.  They would just be made by other types of large business, that were doing the same things we dislike about the large corporations.    And no most of the workforce would not become unemployed. 70% of America's labor resides in small businesses.    incorporation is more of a legal condition rather than a physical condition.

The problem is allowing our public servants to violate the Constitution, and get into areas they are prohibited from.  For example, our public servants are prohibit ted from subsidizing or rescuing private interests.

463627b217c197488cffa6458dc9337caa	If you're still a Marxist you're a typing anachronism. Firstly, the 20th century proved that no industrial state's working class was able to achieve class conciousness. Maxism-Leninism proved that provided the right push and touching ideology that that group could be beguiled into a dictatorship of the proletariat, but admittedly not to full Communism even then. Socialist policy is correct policy. The means by which to administer such a just society are not beyond us today, but are, sadly, beyond the vision of most of today's leaders.|`|1ba155ac9fa4edffa0138bf7c0afe188aa	On paper Socialism and Communism look great, unfortunately in reality it is detrimental to those who work hard to achieve their personal and monetary goals. These forms of society reward those who will blindly follow rather than being innovative and it rewards those who do not have the intestinal fortitude to struggle and achieve goals to obtain the station in life they desire.Socialism rewards laziness, Communism kills individuality.|`|PKzE3AVBaa	I am a believer in the free market. I own a small truck company. I served in europe and saw Democratic Socialism at work for the outside. I don't know which is best.

I also know that people MUST believe in what ever they do. Which system is better, NO ONE knows. neither have been given a chance to stand on their own. I BELIEVE that helping my fellow humans survive is my responsibility on this earth. I also know that any group give ultimate power over others loose the compassion needed to help others and not just "theirs" I would also like discussion on this topic.|`|TA1zYlYraa	I am a Socialist, that is to say I support a worldwide society without money, governments or borders.

Which I believe Karl Marx and Lenin had in mind.  According to the doctrine, the prolatariat would eventually giveway to a social domocracy once the needs of the people and society as a whole are met.  Essentially creating a level playing field for all.  Unfortunately, those successes were corrupted by individuals that sought to pretetuate thier power.  But, here in America, any thing that is not pure democracy is labeled as evil.  Interesting how Russia and China were under evil rule, but Sweden and the Netherlands also socialist countries never get the positive press.  I believe that to be a result of how Socialism was inplemented.  It is interesting that if you look at the two political idealogies, thier purest forms seem to be unmanageble, but mixture of the two provide a delicate balance.|`|k6hicodfaa	I think it's interesting that we still rely on the two dichotomies of Marxism and Smith's Capitalism.

Marx wasn't so much expounding his ideas as gauging trends and predicating what will come.|`|9CoaKELzaa	Socialism is such a broad idea so it's hard for me to fully support or reject its ideals.  On the one hand, I support some aspects of Socialism such as a more equal distribution of wealth (capitalism's distribution of wealth is a complete joke), but I don't other aspects of it like the extensive role the government plays.  I feel like Socialist governments possess a bit too much power and this can limit the freedoms of a country's citizens.  Overall, I think Socialism is the most fair system to operate under.  The collective utility of a nation's people would probably be higher than that in a Capitalist society where only the wealthy maximize their utilities and people at the "lower" end of society typically struggle to make ends meet as they work for the rich and make them richer.|`|JoVbT4noaa	Socialism sounds nice, and preys upon the jealousy of those who fall in the 'have-not' category by telling them that they 'deserve' what everyone else has.  Jealousy is a human instinct, geared towards survival.<br>  <br>  The problem is that true socialism eventually strips away self-determinism, and that is the aspect of humanity that has been causal to the overwhelming majority of our societal progress.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I will relent that some 'socialistic' policies have merit, in limited instances.

GcQl76mfaa	The Drug War is the most spectacular failure in American History. Just legalizing all drugs, without even taxing them, would stop a massive big government intervention in our bodies. But if you want a more moderate answer: As long as alcohol and cigarettes are on the shelves, causing cancer and cirrhosis, I can't see the harm in a plant that makes you relaxed and then hungry. the market for hemp alone could create millions of jobs because it can be made into just about anything - clothes, paper, hell, even fuel. But it doesn't even have psychoactive effects, it's just guilty by association. So yeah, to remove all federal penalties on pot would be a positive thing. Polls have shown that Americans favor decriminalization/legalization. We're a democracy, let's act like one.|`|Zr0fShabaa	They should legalize it, but it will never happen.  There are too many people making too much money from the "War On Drugs".  There is currently too much profit in the current system for the drug dealers for the system to go away.|`|WnlYQecTaa	I think that they should, They will NEVER win the war on drugs, no matter how much money and manpower they throw at it. It would be a good source of tax revenue, and, it would lower the prison population dramatically.|`|pMzq6B3paa	I don't smoke marijuana but I do think they should legalize it, and tax it high. Because that way they would take that off the streets, and that's more money for the government. They should however make the retailers have a license to sell it, like with alcohol and cigarrettes..... It might be a good thing for the economy, there are tons of potheads in America.

If Israel was targeting children, as you imply, I would want my President to  stop support immediately but if Israel fires at missle launch sites that happen to be in schools and hospitals because the people firing them at 100% Israeli civilian targets are hoping that the presence of those children will keep them safe from retaliation, permitting THEM to kill Israeli children without being targeted, I guess I would support the people who regret civilian casualties as opposed to those who SEEK civilian casualties.  Frankly I see both sides of this one as unwilling to stop the violence.  At least Israel has tried several times to come to a peaceful conclusion...|`|Q3TGJMdkaa	I think it is kind of hypocritical|`|GNNh52OMaa	according to his sheep that were opposed of bush and his pro isreal stance...... it's ok.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	You'd rather he support Palestinians that kill Israeli children, I suppose.|`|uZEmRPBFaa	When you put your ammunition stores in schools and where places children tend to gather, children will get killed.

Then again, he probably thinks that it's the closest the US is going to get to an ally in the middle east, as most of the people there aren't too happy about the Iraq invasion, and so support for America is very low in many other Middle Eastern countries.     Hopefully he'll use his support of the country properly, and put pressure on them to end illegal occupations, and work with the Palestinians to create a legal Palestinian state, and reduce the hatred and tension in the region (which would probably then lead to a less extremist group than Hamas being elected). Either that, or support neither, and stop sending money and weapons into Israel (especially after we've all seen evidence that they have broken international and humanitarian law - just shows how little justice there is that they haven't been hauled up infront of a war crimes tribunal.).|`|3wyxasucaa	He has no choice but to support Israel.  Rahm is his lord and master.|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	I think that the Arab world supports Palestinians who uses palestinian children as suicide bombers. Honestly, Israeli and Palestinian leadership are both at fault. As I have said in previous posts, I have no sympathy for either side. (I feel for the civilians that have done nothing) Both sides launch a rocket, holds up dead babies, and then retaliates. Wash, rinse, repeat. I am sick of both sides. They are all to blame and they cry and try to gain world support, because they can't play nice in the sandbox.    If Obama supported the Palestinians, there would be a post stating why is he supporting terrorists and suicide bombers? He is trying to support both sides and posts like this aren't helping. There has to be an even handed approach. We should not abandon one side for the other.    Edit - I am sorry for your losses and what you had to go through. However, you said Hamas defended you. Isn't it just as important for Hamas to provide you the opportunity for, since they were elected, with a secure, safe, and prosperious life? As Obama said, they will be judged on what they build, not what they destroy. Hamas needs to stop attacking Israel. Violence begets violence.    Hamas should learn from Martin Luther King Jr. MLK promoted non violence, and because of non-violent actions, our President is now black.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Yes.    Ummm, what about the Palestinians that kill Israeli children.    Here is the difference - HAMAS the terrorist ELECTED government that the Palestinian people elected - are the ones that shoot missiles into Israel DURING EVERY CEASE FIRE!!  Israel waits and waits for months to respond - thinking they will stop.    ISRAEL has EVERY RIGHT to DEFEND them self!    How about hits - HAMAS purposely sets up the citizens to be hit.  HAMAS cowers behind the people and uses them as a shield.  THEY ENDANGER the very people they are suppose to be helping.    They make a choice over weapons instead of food and medical for their people.      ISRAEL allows so much down time so that ISRAEL can bring over the border - food and medical for the Palestinians.      ISRAEL has made every attempt to work with them - HAMA will not because HAMAS doesn't want to work with them, they want to wipe them out completely.    ISRAEL has lived on this land for over 3500 years.      The land belongs to ISRAEL!!|`|y3hRdUI3aa	everybody hates the jews in the middleast, but they are unbeatable.

b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	The bailout of the banks was a political decision, because no president or congress wants it said that our economy collapsed on their watch.  My fear is that it will only delay the inevitable.  If people don't start buying again (and they won't -- not like they've been doing, anyway -- for a helluva long time) all this stimulus money is just going to prop up dying businesses.  It will delay their demise, but it won't prevent it.

C7wjR42Daa	Both are very challenging, but you can not honestly compare the two. Like someone mentioned already, you do not train Airmen to do the same thing Marines do,  therefore this training called the BEAST will not be as much as a challenge. I am sure each Airmen feels like  its the worst thing in the world and it is a great challenge, but this is not the mother of courses.    Just read here about it. How in the world does it even compare to the CRUCIBLE??  http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforcej...    And don't forget when you do the crucible, its not like this BEAST thing where you happily hike out to the area and then relax and have briefings and things like that. The crucible is just another thing you have to go through. It's not seen as a cool trip to go play warrior. You are already exhausted by the time the Crucible comes around and you are messed with in ways that you will never see in AF basic.    Look at it this way. For the sake of your argument lets assume both are equal, which they are not by a long shot..But in the Crucible you have USMC DI's pushing you and you have the USMC intensity present, in the BEAST you have TI's pushing you, now which do you think is more intense? Those 3 meals a day you get during the BEAST says it all..|`|kbz5S3waaa	i haven't been through either, but I'm going to say the crucible is harder. At least I hope it is, I leave for the AF in april...|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Crucible. Easily.|`|B7fS9hWOaa	Beast. why? Because it's newer, and harder.|`|1AwB73H5aa	The Beast is longer, but the Crucible is more intense|`|raImBqwraa	Crucible is infanantly harder than the "Beast."    Being newer does not make it harder, if anything, the fact that the Marines have been running the crucible for awhile now and have figured out exactly how to make it is painful as possible lends credit to it.     The Air Force weren't ever intended to be the ones starved, beaten, and tired on the front lines - so why would they train them that way? The Marines are the ones meant to be abused :D.

I am not wealthy, but we are a 6 figure income household... we do ok.

However your point is well taken.  There is only one problem with it, conservatives outspend liberals in dramatic numbers on benevolent and charitable acts.  They actually put their money where their mouth is.  If everyone spent like that, then we wouldn't need the American welfare system.    Also, don't dramatize the "plight" of poor Americans.  The poorest Americans are in the wealthiest 3% of people in the world, and America's poverty line is above the average standard of living in Europe.|`|IIYxx7eGaa	I fail to see how we don't help Americans who are need?

We don't need someone making the choice for us; after all, God did give us free agency to make choices.  My choice is that I don't believe in abortion unless a pregnancy has been the result of a rape or the mother's life is at risk.  I also believe in loving my neighbor but my neighbor has to exhibit some form of responsibility, not sit around and wait for the government to provide for him.  I don't think that we should be allowing illegals to come here, work here and break the laws and then be provided for:  free health care, food stamps, hospitalization, driving privileges, housing (sometimes going so far as being given free housing), free schooling and discounted rates for college.  Are we insane?  That is not being compassionate, it is being stupid and also being used.  I want to make my own choices.  I want my government to follow the law, not look the other way while people break the law.  There are many out of work in this terrible economy and if the illegals weren't taking so many jobs, maybe we could actually find work for our own honest citizens.  If that seems cruel; so be it.  It is reality.    This has nothing at all to do with my religion.  By the way, I am sick of people trying to take my right to pray, to pledge allegience to MY flag, to display the Ten Commandments, to say Merry Christmas and have a nativity scene on display for my religious holiday while other religions have those rights without question.  Even those at Gitmo were permitted to pray, follow their religious menus and read their scriptures.  Does that seem fair and just to you??|`|b0t2vx2Haa	True conservatives show "Love thy neighbor".  They do not believe in being forced by the government to have their hard earned money taken from then to be given out however the government wants.  They choose to give their time and money to those they think need the help.  Conservatives give a much greater percentage of their income to charities than do liberals.  Joe Biden I think has given less than one percent over the last several years.  President Obama traditionally gave around three percent until he started running for office and then it went up to around five percent.  So, conservatives walk the walk.  They just do not believe government is responsible enough to handle their money.|`|LLh7PAkaaa	well i see your point and i think your very right, not just for republicans but Americans as a whole, if I could classify myself it would be a liberal republican haha, but i believe in separation of church and state like its supposed to be as written by our founding fathers|`|QU7es4Q3aa	I'm not one of these people, but I'm going to go ahead and wager on "because it's easier"?  2nd choice, because they don't believe the words of their religion (how could you?), they just really want to.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Ah, studies have shown, that Conservatives on average,     Give 30% more to charities than liberals do.

There is a large base of "neo-cons" in the republican party, but they do not represent all of us.  The government should stay out of people's private lives.  The government is not intended to be the moral authority.  If people want spiritual guidance, that is fine. But it should come from their chosen church, not Washington DC.  By the same token, Washington should never encroach on the rights of individual churches.    If you ask me, there is a growing branch of young republicans who believe in social rights, small government, and fiscal conservatism.  I am one of them.  I am pro-gay rights, in favor of legalizing marijuana, even though I am not gay and I don't smoke marijuana.  People should have the right to live their private lives the way they see fit.

I've been listening to Rush Limbaugh just to see what the opposition might be saying but let me tell you... he acts as if he were possessed or something.    It's not healthy at all to indulge yourself or even give a listening ear to this out of control, hypocritical radio personality. (Aside from him really feeling slighted to see a Black man president I think his ratings are very important. (stir up a little emotion - it's good for the ratings)    There are quite a few people that carry those same sentiments and we don't know who they are until they say so... some are blatant and some are more discreet... maybe voting down his stimulus package will be the way they accomplish their goal.    What ever happened to people proudly supporting and defending this country and our way of life. This is America... you don't have to like the President but there's a certain amount of respect that should be given to the position. "The President of the United States"  Come on people we all need OUR President to succeed.    O, "stand strong" means to stand firm in your beliefs.|`|AA11148986	Never listened to the guy. I've read plenty of reports on the guy and heard Keith Olbermann's stories as well as quotes he made about Donovan McNabb receiving special treatment from the media because he was black (and getting fired from ESPN for saying so), and he blamed the victims of Hurrican Katrina for FEMA's disasterous response after the flood, and then he spouts off on how he wants Obama to fail.    The dude is garbage, basically.    I've never seen or heard his show, and I don't really care to. He says outrageous and racist claims in the hopes of getting people to listen to the crap that comes out of his mouth. And there's no doubt that he'd say his Constitutional right to talk his nonsense, and continue to be the money-grubbing attention whore he is.    Screw him. I'm not going to write a letter. He isn't worth my time.|`|ef5e7522911c0c07508f67134050536daa	It means there is strength in numbers. Rush Limbaugh is a master baiter. He says outrageous stuff to keep his name in the public eye. Unfortunately he has a large audience and many of them are sheep. Few on the airwaves challenge his outrageous comments. They tolerate him and he generates excitment in the media so he keeps his job. This site wants  to challenge him and get their message heard, that he is a dick and obsolete. They are not challenging his right to free speech. If you disagree w/Rush Bimbo you are not alone, they are putting together the comments of many who disagree to overwhelmingly get their own views heard and let him  know his vileness is not acceptable and there is loyal support and confidence in President Obama. They're saying don't be apathetic, don't be a wimp. One voice in the wilderness can't do much, but many voices can. One horn blowing can't accomplish much, but stand strong(everyone blowing their own horn)will make a great noise and walls (and obsolete, redundant, radio hosts)will come tumbling down!|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Oh yeah, I just linked from Rush's website and wrote the DNCC exactly what I thought of them playing a tiny portion of an entire conversation which he explained that he doesn't want the Liberal Marxist agenda that exudes from Obama's every pore to succeed.|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Big Bro is here.

5syj6Uzaaa	While Nixon later said something similar, the phrase was first attributed to Milton Friedman in a December 31, 1965 Time article [1].|`|5ac2dCxJaa	It wasn't an economist it was Richard Nixon    During an interview with a reporter from Time magazine, Friedman commented that "in one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, no one is a Keynesian any longer." The two senses were identified in his subsequent elaboration: "We all use the Keynesian language and apparatus; none of us any longer accepts the initial Keynesian conclusions" (Friedman 1968b, p. 15).   The full quote which you are taking out of context is obviously not what you had in mind.    The quote the way YOU quoted it was Nixon.    By the way I am sure that you think you are clever but your not. Friedman was the driving force behind the Argentinian and Chilean economies neither of which you would want to live under.    And so you know the quote by Nixon was prior to Nixon taking the U.S. off of the gold standard which Keynes instituted kicking off the worst round of inflation in U.S. history.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	Nixon???    your answer to the "new girl on the elections catgeory" was hilarious.

It is however supposed to be hidden.  Nevertheless, while thieves can replace the 1st VIN, the odds of them being able to replace it with the VIn from the same make, model and year of the car that's purchased is low.

It is absolutely insane, Nancy Pelosi is the worst thing that could ever happen to California and the world along with Obama:    The word is out about the $825 billion "economic recovery" package. $200 million for lawn care in Washington, D.C., $360 million to potentially be used to put on transsexual beauty pageants and erotic art shows. These are a few examples in the $825 BILLION (and counting!), over 1,588 page stimulus bill. Nancy Pelosi argues this bill would stimulate the economy, however only 7 percent of the legislation actually goes towards infrastructure - the rest of the bill reads like a taxpayer funded payoff to groups that have supported liberal interests.      And what a pay off! ACORN, the long controversial group that purposefully tried to muck up last year's elections to benefit the liberals is being rewarded by Pelosi with potentially $4.19 BILLION in taxpayer funds. And more than 10 percent of the proposal-$87 billion-would be directed to groups like Planned Parenthood!     What a scheme!

It is going to drive inflation WAY up, hurting the poor and lower middle class.  But since T-Notes (T-Bills with terms of 1 year or longer) should start to pay really well, I am really happy about it. During the Carter Administration 5 year T-Notes paid over 15% and are not subject to state taxes so this is good for anyone who has some money to invest. That was a great return and I expect that it will be like that in 2 or 3 years, people can cash in the gold and silver  (that they have been buying, instead of stock, when it became obvious Obama was going to win last summer) and buy T-Notes and be set, this is a great investment opportunity.

It would allow a majority of American voters to guarantee no taxes for themselves going forward.  It would burden the private sector and put the public sector in permanent and firm control of the economy. Put simply, I believe his stimulus is aimed at re-establishing "eternal" power for the Democrat Party rather than stimulating the economy because anyone with a brain knows this is NOT how you stimulate the economy. If I can be made to serve as a distraction, then there is that much less time debating the merits of this TRILLION dollar debacle.        Obama was angry that Merrill Lynch used $1.2 million of TARP money to remodel an executive suite. Excuse me, but didn't Merrill have to hire a decorator and contractor? Didn't they have to buy the new furnishings? What's the difference in that and Merrill loaning that money to a decorator, contractor and goods supplier to remodel Warren Buffet's office? Either way, stimulus in the private sector occurs. Are we really at the point where the bad PR of Merrill getting a redecorated office in the process is reason to smear them? How much money will the Obamas spend redecorating the White House residence? Whose money will be spent? I have no problem with the Obamas redoing the place. It is tradition. 600 private jets flown by rich Democrats flew into the Inauguration. That's fine but the auto execs using theirs is a crime?

George Washington, to Benedict Arnold, September 14, 1775 from The Washington papers edited by Saul Padover    "The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretence, infringed.'' - James Madison (Original wording of the First Amendment; Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).)

Transgendered people DO NOT decide one day to start presenting as the opposite sex as a way of getting their jollies.  Nor do they do so on a whim.  Transgendered people have a gender identity that is hard-wired into their brain from the prenatal stages of development and have no control over it.  Medical science has proven this.  To ensure that no misguided people attempt to go through the transitioning process, transgendered people must go through extensive psychological counseling by a licensed mental health therapist.  Any sort of physical transitioning must be overseen by a medical doctor, and a doctor will only approve such after the person has been thoroughly psychologically evaluated.  BTW, for biological males, the hormones taken as part of the transitioning process destroys their ability to sexually function as such.    Most states and even the federal government legally recognizes transgendered people who have been through the proper steps as their new sex, Massachusetts included.  However, they all require documentation of having gone through the proper steps before a legal recognition is given.  A gender recognition is not handed out like candy anywhere.  If you look into the actual regulations of what it requires, you would probably be surprised.  I would also put money on the fact that you've probably met a transgendered person and didn't even know it.    Being transgendered is about gender identity, not sexual orientation.  Transgendered people who live in their new gender role do base their sexual orientation around it, but they can be straight, bisexual, gay, lesbian, or asexual just like non-transgendered people can be.  Also, there are transgendered people who were born female as well as male.    Any law passed to protect gender identity from discrimination and hate crimes is done so in order to ensure that transgendered people have the same opportunities like everybody else and anybody who attacks them because of that issue is punished.    As this is America, in the end you have every right to ultimately disagree with me.  However, it is ill advised that you do so by hearing only one side of the argument.

The substitute bill, sponsored by House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, would create 6.2 million jobs through 2010, according to its Republican backers, compared with just 3.2 million jobs claimed under the House Democratic bill to be voted on Wednesday evening.     Democrats rejected the analysis, saying the plan's reliance on tax cuts amounted to the same old song we always hear from Republicans, according to Rep. Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat.     But the analysis by the Ways and Means Republican staff relied on a formula used by Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, to estimate that Republican-backed tax cuts of nearly $400 billion over the next few years would produce at least a 6.1 percent increase in GDP.     Using a jobs formula endorsed by Mrs. Romer and Jared Bernstein, now Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s top economic aide, that GDP boost translates into 6.2 million jobs over two years.     For half the cost, we can have twice the impact, said Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Republican.     The amendment was given virtually no chance of passage as Democrats expected to pass their version of the stimulus bill Wednesday evening. The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the stimulus program next week, and lawmakers want to have a bill to the president by mid-February.         http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan...|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Hes just another guy in the White House.|`|doLyOac0aa	I don't,|`|lNhUgQnuaa	THE MAN!|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	I dont like his ideas.|`|j1A24TFeaa	I think he is wonderfully intelligent and has his heart in the right place and he wants to do right.

Right now he is having a tough going because both sides do not agree.  Also its a matter of both sides having great ideas that can be used.  Not all Republicans have bad ideas and the same goes for Democrats.  There are plenty of Dems and Republicans that have something to contribute equally.  That has been the problem for so long, no one wanted to work together, because they have the attitude, "I'm right and your wrong".  Well its time out for that nonsense and its time to work together in bi-partisan ways. No one side has all of the answers.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	He's reaching out, because in the end he knows this stimulus package will fail and he wants to amke sure he can blame it on a "bi-partisan" (read that as republican) vote!|`|eiVlnKgNaa	Obama's plan would buy votes for the Democrat Party, in the same way FDR's New Deal established majority power for 50 years of Democrat rule, and it would also simultaneously seriously damage any hope of future tax cuts.  It would allow a majority of American voters to guarantee no taxes for themselves going forward.  It would burden the private sector and put the public sector in permanent and firm control of the economy. Put simply, I believe his stimulus is aimed at re-establishing "eternal" power for the Democrat Party rather than stimulating the economy because anyone with a brain knows this is NOT how you stimulate the economy. If I can be made to serve as a distraction, then there is that much less time debating the merits of this TRILLION dollar debacle.        Obama was angry that Merrill Lynch used $1.2 million of TARP money to remodel an executive suite. Excuse me, but didn't Merrill have to hire a decorator and contractor? Didn't they have to buy the new furnishings? What's the difference in that and Merrill loaning that money to a decorator, contractor and goods supplier to remodel Warren Buffet's office? Either way, stimulus in the private sector occurs. Are we really at the point where the bad PR of Merrill getting a redecorated office in the process is reason to smear them? How much money will the Obamas spend redecorating the White House residence? Whose money will be spent? I have no problem with the Obamas redoing the place. It is tradition. 600 private jets flown by rich Democrats flew into the Inauguration. That's fine but the auto execs using theirs is a crime? In both instances, the people on those jets arrived in Washington wanting something from Washington, not just good will.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	Bush didn't reach out? Hell, he bent over backwards.

I think many Republicans were deaf to what they were saying. But in some cases, they were deaf for mutual reasons.     When many Reps opposed expanding sub-prime loans by lowering the bar on qualifications for a sub-prime mortgage, the dems raised the roof and squashed a lot of that. That was in 2003. Then in 2005 McCain tried to squelch the out of hand sub-prime lending and he was drowned out by the dems.    So they weren't listening to each other basically.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Its for the good of the Country If we are going to move forward we all have to work together Democrats Republicans and Independents we are Americans One person sits on the Sidelines without being Hurt Sick or Injured they are hurting America, we are have to do our part for our Nation.|`|EhQhbrMkaa	Rule  1 in politic is.........turn your enemies into friends|`|Aw10iRBIaa	because he trying to bring to country together the quicker he do that the better he can get our economy rolling, if we all work together.|`|IdXK9m76aa	He has to ask repubs because they are the only ones that knows whats going on .Btw why do you say we are rude for A$$HOLE!

Rush doesn't believe in liberal social views.  What Obama is going to do...spend a bunch of money...has already been tried, it didn't work.  It won't work now just like it didn't work for FDR.  I know liberals are in a worm hole when they start thinking that the NEW DEAL got us out of the Great Depression but it didn't, it prolonged it.      Rush doesn't want social policies to succeed!  There, you get it?  He doesn't think Government is the answer, liberals do.      What's so hard to get about that?  He disagrees with EVERYTHING Obama stands for, as does 46 % of Americans that voted against Obama.|`|3GozGfwraa	Limbaugh is an entertainer, nothing more.

UIhn5LCHaa	Most JPA's know that I appose them on the topic of Yeshua hamoshiach but today I have found a common ground to agree with them against you and all of those like you.     Your doctrine is like that of a virus which spreads in order to kill. Therefore G-d says: "cursing I will curse you".     Your hatred isn't G-dly nor your motivation to arouse hatred towards us either. Those who think like you only loose there souls in the end.

In my 61 years of experience with Jewish people, a lot of Jewish people, I have never encountered the phenomenon of Jews (which should be capitalized) treating Gentiles like dirt.    2. The reverse is actually true. For about 1,500 years, Gentiles have been trying to eliminate Jews from the planet. Whether you're a Christian or not, I suggest you read Michael Brown's, "Our Hands Are Stained With Blood."|`|Fmo4ZgYjaa	Don't believe everything that you read.  It just make you look stupid.

And the same applies to this question.|`|bpgxWYKRaa	--That link you've posted?  It comes from Michael Hoffman.  Michael @ $%^&*! Hoffman.  Have you bothered to look this guy up?  He is a conspiracy theorist.  He thinks that Satanism is what motivated the construction of Route 66 and that such films such as "The Matrix" film trilogy are trying to tell us (in, of course, "twilight language") that we are being lied to, and he refers to our government as "the establishment."  That's the source credibility you're dealing, and apparently you have no conceptualization of "FACTS."  My guess is, you're an anti-Semitic racist who was simply looking for a link (ANY link at all) that shared your evil beliefs.  You probably would have cited a blog, if you had seen one first, but you found Michael Hoffman instead.  Way to go, s--t head!
VjgqZetcaa	Whether or not you can legally use the clip is up for debate, at least where you may have some defense of "fair use" or other exemption.    It would be pointless to "disclaim" ownership or give credit to someone else. Would it be okay to drive a stolen car if you told the police, "No, it's okay... this isn't my car and I never said it was."    However, it is clearly and undeniably a separate federal CRIME to falsely place a copyright notice on copyrighted works owned by someone else, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).|`|asX2hxFXaa	Yes, and illegal.    A copyright is a legal proceding.  Saying something is has a copyright doesn't mean it is.|`|vFHXrOHNaa	If the song is in the back ground and is not the main subject of the video you are fine. if song is the main reason for this video you can not.    Hope above makes sense.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	you need the permission to use the clip if you don't at least credit the song's artist in the comments and before or after the video. make sure that people know that you do not own the clip|`|1MlrO4Uxaa	it depends on how long the song is, how important the song is, and the way the songs used. It would NOT be right to say you have a copyright on the video unless you actually have a copyright. youtube WILL call you on that and they might take it down.    however, its fine to put the song in the video as long as you credit the artist and disclaim all unowned content.

AA11540917	causes - No Legitimate Causes.  Iraq was a massive blunder.    Effects - we are going to find out over the next decade or two.    effects so far.. other than 4,000 + Americans dead and a Trillion dollars wasted  None to speak of.  sure Saddam is dead and gone, but they still don't have a stable government - so we shall see.    I forgot Iran - it gave Iran the opportunity to fight an covert war against the U.S.  -------------  more schools, hospitals and roads where open before the war.  Iraq WAS a country with a large middle-class.  Now they don't even have electricity 24/7  and women are losing many of their rights !!  (hopefully the many negative "effects" wont be permanent)|`|Iwtv6QyIaa	The causes are questionable.  My son served proudly.  The effects...... there are many good things that have come about that the media doesn't share or report on.  Alot of things are in operation such as schools, markets, neighborhoods, sewers, water, and everyday life things.  The only thing is that it is sporadic depending upon the region. Our soldiers, Marines, Sailors, (Yes, sailors) and Air Force are constantly  making sure all is secure.  Let's not forget the Iraqi troops who are taking on a big job in our stead when we move on.  We are not the only ones over there.  We are called Coalition Troops. Americans are not the only ones.  God bless all of them.  We may have gone in with questionable intentions but we have provided otherwise.|`|HpvXq9pAaa	Causes:  To protect the Iraqi people like any respectable country SHOULD do.    Effects:  EVERYTHING is better.  It is safer, the Iraqi children do not have to be scared all the time anymore, education is better, etc.     The day we lose our will to fight is the day we lose our freedom.

Last time I got referenced in a subject line - someone was propogating for me to engage in homosexual activites with other Y!A members. True story :P    Short answer - None. The Marine Corps PFT (Physical Fitness Test) consists of 3 events - Pull ups, Sit-ups/crunches, and a 3 mile run. I got out right as they implimented a new Combat Conditioning Test, so I don't know much about that, but I doubt it's made it's way to boot camp yet.    Long answer - you'll do millions at the feet of your Drill Instructors. However, pushups on their own aren't bad, it's when they combine them with mountain climbers (Push up position, but bring your knees to your elbows alternatley, like you're about to start a race...but just keep doing it) and all sorts of other little "Exercises" that really make the party at the Depot memorable.    EDIT - Rich: Might have, been awhile since I was in boot, but as I remember, there were a lot of things that were 'banned' that seemed to happen from time to time just the same... :D. And everyone has shin splints, that'd be a weak excuse to get rid of good training, lol.
5B5pirFWaa	It will prevent you from being able to get certain jobs, regardless of how long you have not been on it. For example, you can not be assigned to a submarine. Any medication or drug that alters how your brain works is Submarine disqualifying. Many Submariners have been medically disqualified for certain drugs that help people stop smoking, because it alters the mind. This has become a huge issue as of late.    But specifically what jobs in the USMC it will prevent you from getting, you need to talk to a recruiter.|`|kbz5S3waaa	I'm pretty sure if the doctor signed off on you, you should be okay|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	You'll be fine.|`|QzBgeyKeaa	dont worry about it
AA11021960	I am sorry... the answer is no.  I feel your pain a lil.  My hubby wanted to be a firefighter, passed all the testing - physical and otherwise.  But, they found out he is epileptic and that was that.  You can not be in a position where you hold another person's life in your hands.  It isn't fair to you or the other people depending on you.  In a war zone, if you were to seize... you have now put other peoples life in jeopardy because they have to get you out and get help without getting themselves killed.  I know it is hard to hear... but I can tell you that there are many other careers that you can get into and you will live a full life doing something else.    Good Luck to you!!!!   :)|`|Wvuj8VIHaa	no ma'am|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	Simply put, no, you can't join.  No ways around that either, sorry dude.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	No. The Marines will not take you if you have Epilepsy. In fact I'm pretty sure none of the branches will. Epilepsy is a big deal.|`|2wyDALHgaa	My nephew was trying to join the air force and was denied because of his epilepsy and he has had it controlled for years now.

Especially if you want to an MOS that involves combat.|`|2oUhQQ5Raa	I don't know much about epilepsy but I really really really don't think you can get in. The Marines are strict about who they let in and epilepsy is a serious condition that could endanger you or other Marines.    Don't count on getting in man.|`|WUWrCOwBaa	nope, my husbands getting discharged from the Army for it, if they dont for the Army then they are not going to for the Marine Corp.|`|9Ge9DnLjaa	Being around a MEPS all the time, i can definitely tell you a flat out. No.... None of the branches will accept epilepsy. It is hard even if you have ADHD to get in. Sorry, bout that. There are many other ways to work with the military though, and those are through the many government jobs available. You would start out in a GS4 or GS5 position, but getting that typ of experience and staying with govt. jobs can only get better. I would try that route. There are many websites with government jobs on them. If you have a military base near by then look for that base's web site and look for the employment links. You should be able to find a GS-5 or GS-4 job available. There is a long hiring process, but once you are in the system then it is easy to get a job with the government anywhere. The pay and benefits are good, and there is lots of room for moving up, especially if you get a good degree. Good luck!
AA10025824	Keep trying.  The only problem with a medical condition in the military is that there may be no one available to take care of you if you have a problem, that's why they won't let you join.  But Asthma isn't necessarily that much of a problem unless you have it really bad.  You may get by it but keep trying.|`|2oUhQQ5Raa	keep trying man.  If you do join up, become a Navy doc. The Navy has the best medical personnel.
mfYfeFCgaa	I used to work for Walmart too and when I was hired, they couldn't stress enough to new associates how strict their policy is on theft. Technically, they are not only within their legal rights to terminate any  employee caught stealing on the spot, but they can also have that employee arrested immediately. However, I did learn of instances at our store of people doing things like stealing a dollar from the register and only getting a verbal warning or a write up for it, so I don't see them making a huge deal out of something like that. If they knew and wanted to say anything to you about it, they probably would have already, so I wouldn't worry much about it, That said, it's not good to steal from your employer, so I wouldn't do something like that again, as you might get into real trouble next time. Just always make it a point to routinely carry a pad or tampon with you, especially when you know your time of month is coming, and if you're in a situation where you really need something like that, just talk to your manager first.|`|3zLRA1JBaa	Ouch, I would have connected with your manager first then taken the tampons (if I were a chick lol), or at least asked to borrow like $3.  I don't know if they will fire you right away, but you might want to fess up and state what happened.|`|GZXDHVkXaa	thief. and you will become their sex slave....|`|cEZ3T6iyaa	Feeling Guilty?  Go pay for them.  Try telling your supervisor next time you have a problem.  You have a proven history of having little or no respect for others and their property.  You took the tampons, if you need tires, are you just gonna steal them? Would you keep you?
gasquENMaa	If you are looking for one specific inmate and this is NOT a juvenile facility, call the facility, ask for visitation, identify the person and ask if they are currently incarcerated. This is considered public knowledge ( for adults, not juveniles) and they are allowed by law to tell you over the phone.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you
ElvQTpUVaa	Being a runaway is not a criminal offense - you wouldn;t get any punishment for it.  They'd just return you home or, if they were convinced that it was better for you not to go hom, they'd put you in some kind of protective residence.      Your parents, on the other hand, would face charges for kicking you out.    You should talk to the agency in your city (should name this) that monitors children for signs of home abuse.|`|X25iYK97aa	just wait the few months untill your birthday.. than get your parents to say you can leave. you can live alone at 16 if your parents agree.
ElvQTpUVaa	Anybody can be civilly liable for defamation, however they can always use as a defense that their claims are true.      Also, you would have to show that you have been harmed by the defamation.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	FIRST of all, it is defamation of character, not deformation. Sorry, had to correct that.     This whole investigation thing sounds really fishy. I'd hire an attorney  and find out if you have grounds to sue (I would guess yes?) Also you need to show that your business has been harmed because of their actions.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Call the cops, more specifically a detective. Get a cease a diciest order and then file small claim paperwork on the other business owner. Then drag them both to court! Maybe investigate them, see how they like it.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Depending on her motive and the impact of her actions, it sounds like it could be slander and the result would be defamation (not "deformation") of your character.     You should document everything that you know both about the incident in question, her activities, and the impact of her activities on you and your business (damages), e.g. your friends and customers becoming suspicious of you, etc. Then talk with an attorney. The attorney would be able to advise you and to use the court as needed.|`|7Wdwo9W4aa	PIs have to follow strict guide lines before conducting investigations,by the sounds of your story, she hasnt,Facebook,What an idiot!!!!!!Shes screwed!!!!!!!!!!!!

1zEBwBRPaa	If your employer is sponsoring you for the Green Card, you should speak to their immigration services provider because most providers will include spousal applications with their services.    Anyway, assuming she here in the US in legal status, she will need to file a Form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) along with Forms G-325A, Form I-131 (for travel authorization), and Form I-765 (for work authorization). She will need 6 passport photos, copies of your I-140 (or I-130) and I-485 receipt notices, copy of marriage certificate, copy of your passport, a copy of most recent IRS tax filing, and copy of her passport.     Again, if this is an employment based petition, you sould speak with your employer's immigration attorney. Go to www.ailalawyer.com to find a qualified immigration attorney in your area.     Lastly, do this NOW because it will be nearly impossible for her to get the green card if you get approved before you file her application.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	I am assuming you are asking about a green card to the USA.

0Yyl68oDaa	Germany signed an Armistice, yet France and the UK entered their country.    Read  Paris 1919 by Macmillan for a view of things|`|rttm1SLaaa	A general but interesting question.  The Treaty of Versailles was often referred to as a farce.  The issue is that that treaty led to a precipitous bankrupting of Germany, as they were forced to print so many marks to pay off the debts accrued through the treaty that they became worth less than the paper they were printed on.  Other European nations slipped into poverty as well, as did the U.S. eventually, after international trade came to a standstill.  It was only in this environment that WWII was created.  The reason people rallied behind Hitler in Germany was because he promised to revitalize the economy and make Germany powerful once more.  People were desperate, they were scared.  Many of them simply averted their eyes when they saw the cost of those economic gains - the Holocaust, the massive war - but Germany did actually do a lot better after Hitler came into power, up until they started losing the war of course.  If not for how the treaty was phrased (out of enmity towards the Germans for starting WWI), and how it ruined the European and thus world economies, WWII likely would never have happened.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	The treaty of Versailles was a harsh treaty Germany was forced to sign making them not only take the blame of war but also pay the winning countries an astronomical figure it could never repay.     The huge debt which created economic ruin in Germany created a hatred among the populous for those foreign powers at that time. this was a oppressed country. The inevitable fuel of dissent and disgust Germany had just needed a spark to ignite the building up of arms and secret militia, that spark was Hitler. Hitler ran on a propogation of change and entitlements, this was a socialist society.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Do you know that history is written by the winners?  Try to think about that.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	because it completely strangled germany economically and when the depression came it hit germany harder than anywhere else which led to the rise of hitler and his promises of a stronger germany|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The reparations Germany was required to pay ruined Germany's economy.  To buy a loaf of bread took a basketfull of marks.  Hitler took advantage of that, but he blamed the Jews rather than the countries that had demanded the reparations.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Great economic hardship and mega-inflation resulted from onerous conditions imposed on Germany.  That led to resentments and conditions in which a tyrant could rise.    We should learn from history.  The way to prevent future conflicts is to build sustainable economies for everybody.  The Marshall Plan after WWII and the subsequent development of the European Union thereafter was in part because people had learned from history.    But we always seem to forget these lessons.|`|2b7VqUXXaa	The French were ruthless in their desire to forever cripple Germany after WW1. They took things way to far. Their desire to totally destroy the economy of Germany led to tremendous resentment, and the rise of Hitler|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	France and Britain demanded crushing reparations from Germany after the war. They even went so far as to remove industrial plant from the industrial areas of Germany. This made it impossible for Germany to pay anything. Germany became a economic basket case, which made it easier for Hitler to be elected, and eventually to become dictator.      He promised to make Germany the world power it once was, and the people followed.        Hitler had charisma, and had some credibility from his service in WWI. He was decorated twice. Desperate people have a tendency to support anyone who promises security, jobs, and greatness as a nation.
LX6AQ4kuaa	Hungarian immigration to the US had 4 main waves and all of them had different reasons: mostly political and social though. Like most immigrants, Hungarians typically came to the US for a better life in the 19-20th centuries. There were 2 social layers that tended to emigrate: the poor and the Hungarian intellectuals whose work and achievements were not appreciated in their home country. Most immigrants in the 1940s were Hungarian Jews escaping from Nazi Europe then a significant number of Hungarians left for the States because of Communism after 1956.    I personally came here because I got married to an American. I don't think these days immigrants coming here for a better life get what they want...they wanna pursue the American Dream which does exist but it is getting harder and harder to get a piece of it. America is not the sole land of opportunities anymore and this fact will probably the shape the way potential immigrants think about the US...some of them will opt for the EU instead.    According to Wikipedia, there were approximately 1,563,081 people of Hungarian descent living in the US as of 2006.     This is also from a Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_A...    "The states with the largest Hungarian American populations include:    Ohio 193,951   New York 137,029   California 133,988   Pennsylvania   132,184   New Jersey 115,615   Michigan 98,036   Florida 96,885     "The highest percentage of Hungarians in any American town, village or other, is in Kiryas Joel, New York (The great majority of its residents are Hasidic Jews belonging to the Satmar Hasidic dynasty, originated from Hungary) where 18.9 of the total population claimed Hungarian as first ancestry. Other places with over 10% are Fairport Harbor, Ohio (14.1%) and West Pike Run Township, Pennsylvania (11,7%). About a hundred other places have +5% of Hungarians, but the highest number of Hungarians living in the same place is in New York City."    I hope this answers your questions.
AA11696297	yes, legalize it man.  interesting obsevation from a guy with Rastafari avatar.  too bad i cannot see your TV show, though i don't doubt you.  you don't really say much but seem to indicate they very wild, but lately i been getting the idea that London has some serious problems.  so, i'm not surprised.    doesn't have to be like that.|`|Cx9c6KrVaa	While this might have been relevant 10 years ago, it's much easier to answer the question now. The increase in levels of THC in skunk is causing problems with psychosis among users. This alone is enough to warrant its categorisation, although I don't agree with it being made a class B as happened on Monday.    The real answer is that comparing it to alcohol is not correct: legal alcohol is terribly flawed (as you point out), so that is not a good argument for legalising another intoxicant. The correct argument is that because the effects of alcohol are so negative, we should continue to ban weed.|`|AWSmknxLaa	110% yes it should be illegal|`|aCdya2qkaa	This depends on how the cannabis is used. If it is used for medice then it should stay legal but if its used for a group of 5 lads who want to smoke hoops and magic dragons and go home,with red terminator eyes, then it should be illegal.|`|t0gChuAUaa	No, haven't thought that for a long time.|`|qVM9OUtOaa	yes i do|`|mr9Zb9biaa	I cant be bothered switching on the TV.

Also cannabis is actually used medicinaly to help soothe pain and ease stress. Stress can cause many hard, blood and brain related problems... it can even cause death, so isnt cannabis a life saver?    On the other hand it shouldn't be legal, some people are stupid with it, they get too easily influenced by it and that makes them commit other crimes. Also it is quite addictive and therefore could put the user at risk of commiting crimes to pay for their addicition. Another argument against cannabis' legalisation is if cannabis can be legalised, why can't cocaine?    On balance i think that cannabis should be legal as a perscription from a GP or doctor, but i don't think it should be legal to buy over the counter or without  a perscription. This wil ensure people that need it recieve it instead of people that would misuse it or commit crimes under cannabises influence.|`|GGpRsuppaa	yes|`|ZzknHgU1aa	Until you can converse intelligently about the difference between ectocannabinoids and endocannabinoids, you cannot offer an informed opinion.

Due to this, many hospitals changed to using morphine instead of diamorphine. Although there is no longer a problem with its manufacture, many hospitals have continued to use morphine    The medical use of diamorphine (in common with other strong opiates such as morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone) is controlled in the United Kingdom by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

The fairness doctrine is a strawman, and you're being a bit paranoid.    And second:  It's a totally reasonable policy to say that when an institution uses a public resource to "inform" the public, that bias be known and countered.    The airwaves belong to the people.  And Rush Limbaugh is a nobody, he is not a journalist, nor a qualified analyst on anything.  He's entertainment for some seriously misguided people.    Obama doesn't want to bring back the fairness doctrine, because it's the wrong solution.  De-consolidating ownership of airwaves, media outlets, and newspapers, is the right answer.|`|diZoW49Zaa	Of course it's going to come up again, it has been revisited on many occasions with no support but now the left owns congress, so they stand a good chance of reinstating the "Fairness Doctrine". Just their way of going against the first amendment and making people believe they're not.    All of you people seem to forget Pelosi is in charge in this regard and she would love to bring it back. I doubt Obama would veto it, he also tends to change his mind about what he says (major understatement).|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Obama has been attacking conservative media for as long as he has been in the spotlight. He has on at least 10 occasions mentioned Sean Hannity because Hannity has questioned him. Oh, he never took Sean up on his numerous offers to come on his show, Hannity and Colmes, to explain himself. Obama just allows other news outlets to speak for him i.e. MSNBC.

We have a sheriff who was native American by the way, who was doing a bang up job of being a cop in Phoenix.  Phoenix was the car stealing capitol of the world.. the world.  You went down there and they had their cars in corrals with fences sos the illegal aliens couldn't steal them.  Janet was incensed that Sheriff Joe was getting all the attention, and cut his budget.  The car thefts went back up.. the murder rate in an area that had a lot of illegal aliens in it went up.. the people began to turn in their keys to the mortgage lender and take the loss.  In some areas of Phoenix, they have a 30% vacancy rate.  Ah yes.. the illegal aliens with ITIN Mortgages also started turning in their keys and leaving town and the rate of vacant homes went up even more.    She is also the idiot who said.. show me a 50 foot fence, and I will show you someone building a 51 foot ladder.  Two journalists went down to that area and spent four or five days looking for someone who could build a 51 foot ladder to cross the Border Fence and they could not fine a one.    My crystal ball is boiling... wow... yes.. it predicts biiig trouble with that woman in the coming days.

So to expect them to read a 647 page piece of legislation is a serious reach. That is why our legislators have teams of people who read these wastes of paper to re-write a brief description of the contents of the actual legislation. Then it is up to the aids to go over it with the representative. This was actually admitted by numerous reps. in interviews time and time again. Oh and for the record, every time they decide to print more money, we are BORROWING it from a private bank. Not using our own money. The Federal Reserve is a private bank, and is directly connected to the world bank and numerous people in Washington who have served in the White House have been on the board of the federal reserve and have had enormous power to make sure we kept taking loans from them so that they would continue to become wealthy. So just remember we have not been in control of our own currency as a nation since 1913. We have officially been using a fiat currency system since the 1970's. (we don't back our money by use of precious goods, ie: gold silver copper). So look at every piece of legislation that is over 300 pages and then ask the question, who gets paid? Who does the paying? The answer is always the same. Because if it is 300 pages or more, they are hiding massive expenses in it that cost this nation to go further into debt every time. Oh and one more tidbit, every time they print a billion dollars they decrease the value of our dollar, and the current value of one dollar (due to interest and principal owed) is .03 cents. .97 cents of every dollar is owed to a select few people and their companies. There is a way to end the problem though, but no one in Washington today has the brains or the ba**s to do it, except one man wanted to but no one would listen.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	Just like all the economics "experts" agree the stimulus plan is needed and will work. Of course they never tell you that all these so called economist "experts" are all Keynesians! And Keynesian theories have been failing our country ever since they were accepted and applied!    Sure, Keynesian theories look great on paper, but fail to work in the real world. Government bureaucrats just love Keynesianism because it suits their lust for power and money to control everything without the burden of being liable for its failures.    Keynesian policies are a zero sum game. Government does not, and never will, create anything! All it does is reallocate and redistribute resources and wealth. Their job creation doesn't create any knew jobs, it just takes jobs out of one sector of the economy to where ever the government bureaucrats want those jobs relocated to. It's all smoke and mirrors, but they use power words and slogans like "create jobs," or "jump start the economy."    Whoever said that the Cato Institute is far right wing either suffers from an intelligence deficiency or has been totally and effectively brainwashed by left wing hacks like moveon.org, MSNBC, the dailykos, or the Huffington Post....|`|1nt5jpZraa	Government wants to control everything we do.

We've been headed that way for decades.  An expanding government + inflating currency to pay for it.  That's the only way it can possibly go.  Unless, of course, we cut spending, government, and get rid of the Fed.    --    http://www.321gold.com/fed/greenspan/196...    In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves.    This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard.           Alan Greenspan  [written in 1966]    --    "Experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor." --Thomas Jefferson to Edward Carrington, 1787.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	I'm just wondering if Republicans get to pick the color of the mark we're getting.|`|xNsJqTgaaa	Well he didn't say that, your article actually gives his direct quote.  I think you misunderstand the comment, and honestly, I think you are trying to misunderstand it.    Plus, when he says there is no disagreement, he isn't talking everyone on the planet.  Right wing nut jobs can't even agree on the color of a stop sign, but that doesn't mean they are blue.    I mean the list is even wrong, the first thing I noticed on the list was that James Buchanan was on it.  I just read a quote from him the other day saying that we really need tax breaks if we want to get out of this mess, which means that he DOES agree with Obama's quote that..."we need action byour government, a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy."    a little reflective thought can be a good thing.|`|qWNcOhJJaa	Obama thinks we are all fallling for his cult of personality crap.

I don't pay much attention to what that right-wing organization says because they have always been wrong.     Most economists agree that the government has to do something rather than just sit idly by and let the economy collapse without at least trying.|`|rttm1SLaaa	The majority of economists agree on one thing: that the government is, by far, the most powerful economic entity in the country.  Using that power, it has the ability to build infrastructure better than anyone or anything, and as such is the only thing with the ability to create a massive amount of jobs in a short period of time.  I wonder if that's what he was referring to, because economists tend to agree on that point.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	because right now, it is. gov't needs to regulate everything, or corporate greed on wall street ***** ppl over and we all suffer. the gov't is in place for a reason. im canadian and last year our conservative party wanted to deregulate the banks. the liberals stopped them, now in the crisis, a poll from the IMF declared that canadian banks are among the safest in the world. now the conservatives are trying to take credit for that..|`|D2YaTaUIaa	Just got to love history repeating itself yea?

We haven't given it to them. The government's money is our money. So, when they spend money like this, they have to create additional imaginary money to be able to spend it.

American citizens run the economy not the government,when we dont buy everyone around the world that we buy stuff from have lots-o-stuff not being sold and they go bust to.we are the biggest consumer in the world.we dont make things anymore because all of our industry has been moved to cheaper countries because its CHEAPER.our government did this thanks to taxes which is the highest out of all the countries.business cant survive with 35pct tax.yet obama will not reduce it to even bring jobs home...he would rather fill yer lil lazy asses with inflation money to make you socialist slaves.|`|1003eb21bd98cd41c4dd726752cefafaaa	How I feel is not relevant ! Feelings/ desires/ hopes and the possibility that I may get "something" I didn't actually earn (need or want) IS what the crooks in Washington used to sell their scam!!!  ...Most "folks don't ever actually bother to read the legislative text; They "hear" all about it via the well parsed "SPIN" complete w/the "proof" via the statements claiming that xx (i.e. economists/studies most of which are unsourced) has "determined that without this $$ stimulus we will all drown/the nation will collapse/people will face hard times....etc Most like some on this page believe what they hear and parrot it back as a means to appear knowledgeable or "on board "with the change "we need".   ..Since you asked, I feel that the US and its unique (and successful) form of government is in danger. The desire by many of the current "politicians/legislators/ so called leaders running the various gov programs/created oversight agencies/organizations etc is to use their power to IMPOSE THEIR belief (s). Many BELIEVE that the GOV should NOT be constrained (per constitutional limits). The USA is the ONLY country whereby which the POWER is controlled by the "people"!   -Other NATIONS IMPOSE Laws which can ONLY be voided/amended if THE Government (be it a king/  dictator/ ministry/president/ etc) CHOSES. The US Constitution was designed to protect the people from undue oppression by a GOVERNMENT . I believe that "the people" of the USA have forgotten or never learned WHY this country has achieved it's success. ....  ...WHEN A GOVERNMENT HOLD ABSOLUTE POWER, IT RULES everything ! It can and does TAX everything and every one!

AND the people ELECT who is empowered to serve as a legislator . Should the legislator NOT serve "the people" he/she can be removed..Sadly ,Congress has the power and does protect itself from investigations which could reveal crimes that anyother citizen would be prosecuted for!! This allows DECEIT/FRAUD which minimizes "transparentcy" such that members may not risk their own exposure by exposing another member's FRAUD,or other prosecutable activity.    This STIMULUS BILL is a farce..full of pork courtesy of the crooks posing as legislators/leaders! IT will not produce what people have been indoctrinated to believe.

Also, I don't believe they marked a box that said "Died in a ditch" as reason for termination.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	That's a weird thing to write on a legal form.  But did this statement harm your future chances to get a job?  Only then could you sue.|`|cEZ3T6iyaa	If you have that in writing, definitely give it a shot.

Then he can not without violating the order.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I would think that as long as the payments are being made, the loan company would tell him to forget his evil plan.

To the other person stating that he can get in it and drive it if he wants -    No he can't, ownership and loan paperwork are two separate things.

Be careful to keep all receipts to prove you are the payer so he does not try to take it from you at a later date.
AA10783710	The country arrived at a political impasse.    The North didn't want new States spreading slavery, which was repugnant to them.  Many (privately) probably didn't mind it so much if was relegated to the Deep South, but they didn't want slavery in their own State, or in a neighboring State.    The Missouri Compromise was supposedly the answer, but the South felt that it would doom the future of slavery (especially because Congress and the Senate would have lopsided representation in Free (non-slave) states).  That would relegate them to a position of weakness.    Abe Lincoln most certainly did not believe in the true equality of the races.  He opposed slavery, but he considered n.egros to be inferior, and could not even contemplate them co-existing in society.  Here's what he had to say about the matter:    I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing   about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black   races - that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or   jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry   with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical   difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever   forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.   And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there   must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other   man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.   I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is   to have the superior position the n.egro should be denied everything."     Abraham Lincoln  Source: September 18, 1858 - Fourth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas   at Charleston, Illinois|`|VOccyg7daa	That was not his primary purpose, his purpose was to preserve the Union. If he could have done that and kept slavery then he probably would have. He despised slavery but would have sucked it up to maintain the Union.|`|IbyxsgHhaa	He wanted to unite the country, and keep union together. Lincoln was one of the first presidents who disagreed with the concept of slavery, and advocated for the end of slavery. He didnt make that his primary or ultimate goal though... it just happened in the uniting process.|`|diZoW49Zaa	It was just an excuse to wage war. The real reason was to prevent the secession of the South.|`|VYtW0uRiaa	Yes it is true. The North needed the blacks to fight and hurt the South even further as they could not have them work the fields,etc.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Most anything is true about Abe.  He was quite remarkable.|`|BQQLZa7Baa	he was against slavery and the issue of slavery definitely contributed to the civil war, even if it was not the main factor.|`|aTAUOI8caa	It's difficult to tell what his purpose was, but overall it appears he wanted to end slavery.    He just believed that it was so ingrained into the culture that it was going to take a while to end it.  He believed it had to be eased out of the national consciousness.    When he was running for office, his stance was that he would leave slavery legal in every state in which it was already legal; only making it illegal in new states coming into the Union as they were entering.  In other words, new states could not accept slavery and be let in, they would have to go without slavery before being allowed into the Union of states.    The slave-owning states felt this would eventually make Congress lopsided against them when all new states coming in would have only anti-slavery Representatives and Senators.  So they seceded when Lincoln won because they didn't want to be forced out of their way of life by Congress influenced in such a way.    Eventually Abraham Lincoln outlawed slavery during the war to bring abolitionists into the war on the side of the North, along with those who were already fighting just to keep the Union together.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Slavery at the time was a very bountiful business for both Northern and Southern states.     The North sold the slaves to the South (northern slave trade) , the South used them a cheap labor source. Getting rid of slavery for Abe was a personal choice for him, but his priority at the time was keeping the union together.     The secession of the Southern states wasn't over slavery, so that wasn't the initial concern for Lincoln. LAter he gave the emaciation proclamation declaring slaves free, hoping they would rise up against their Southern slave master and revolt, thus shortening the duration of the war.

When there is a larger, more critical issue, it is more easy for people to agree on it...as Americans. But when we aren't being confronted with a disaster, then people tend to focus more on the less drastic, dividing issues that separate parties, such as abortion and taxes, etc.|`|VUfhHvjpaa	Well, Obama got elected (a tragedy in itself) and if anything, America is more DIVIDED!|`|aTAUOI8caa	In fairness, that's what comes with Freedom of Speech.  If you allow people to say what they want, they tend to offend each other.  Then they fight it out (hopefully only verbally, of course).      So in many ways, yes.  Only a tragedy can shut us up long enough to bring us together.|`|BQQLZa7Baa	i think, or at least i hope, that most americans view eachother as americans first. the extreme conservatives and liberals are more vocal, but they're in the minority of all people.    i guess in politics it's much easier to group people than to think of them as individuals, so people that are into politics tend to get into that kind of thinking. it's too bad though.|`|oNEi61iLaa	I don't know if 9/11 united us in a good way. I think the shock and tragedy made many people blind to what really happened and to what their government was doing.    It's sad that people are wishing for Obama to fail, but they are a small minority. Obama's approval ratings remain at over two-thirds of the nation, and I believe that MOST of the remaining third expresses their dissent respectfully. I would rather have a president with a 68% approval than 91% (like Bush after 9/11). That kind of popularity is dangerous.|`|sVPToYvKaa	I think that America is truly united; however, I think that we sometimes get lost in events such as the politcal races and such. When a tragedy strikes, in my opinion, America forgets the silly races of RED and BLUE, and snaps into "America is ONE" mode.    I love America [:

y0jL9n6Taa	Not sure what you mean by "sat out 2 years" but if you mean he was in jail for 2 years awaiting trial or sentencing usually that counts towards his sentence.  It's called "time served."  But that all depends on the judges written sentence order.    If the judge credited for time served he would be out in 6.5 years.        Parole is usually specified in the sentencing order or by state statute.  There is no parole in the federal system.  A common estimate for parole is after 33-40% of sentence served but again there are a lot of variables.    And to wise guy Lilliard or whatever his name is, parole is completely different.  If he is released at 8.5 years he is done.  He could be paroled earlier in which he is out but under restrictions.  So hey Lillylard - COMMON SENSE!|`|27722e46d7e1a47f6c3e2edef016aa14aa	6.5 years if they have a good behaveor.    If not.... Maybe 10.5      Hope I helped.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	A lot would depend on their behavior and if they have good behavior and good records and if they attend church and do schooling to show they are trying to improve their life. They need to go to AA and church and do school classes and learn a trade. They need to show good reason for parole. They can work and try to improve their life and their case.

rHwE5Rkbaa	Fudgems is close to being accurate...    Rescue swimmer is both a position as well as a career field.  AST's are rescue swimmers - and there is a position on cutters and small boats for a rescue swimmer.  AST's get months of training to do what they do - and they are the absolute experts at it - but other rescue swimmers get about a week of training and will be the ones called out if someone needs assistance during normal operations.  It's a collateral duty for them - like they are a full time boat mechanic... oh, and they also are a rescue swimmer.  For an AST, it is a full time gig.    There is a LOT of maintenance work for AST's - and they are also expert tailors, as they have to sew their own equipment and harnesses.    Navy and Coast Guard rescue swimmers (the full time folks) are essentially the same.    Fudgems is also right about not being able to enlist directly into the CG AST rating.  You come in as an unrated worker - and after you are promoted to E-3, you can put your name on a waiting list for the AST "A" school.  From there there are physicals and physical tests before you are actually accepted.  If you are accepted into the program, you are transferred to an aviation unit and work as a crewman on a Helo - until you go to school.    I have a good buddy that is an AST.  There is NO way I could possibly survive what he went through just to pass the qualification process.  If you fail, you lose the rating and get involuntarily retrained.  Ouchies...|`|0szdPqI0aa	Yes AST is the coast guard rescue swimmer. There job title in the coast guard is not rescue swimmer though, it is Aviation Survival technician. (AST).    I do not believe there is too much maintenance. but there is maintenance. you will be working on survival equipment, etc.  you will also be training pilots in swim testes and helping them out as an aircrew member.  you will not be doing really any mechanical work on the air craft, for that is for the AMT"S.    but take this into consideration.    You will not enlist into this job.  you cannot. first you have to enlist in another job, then you can put in a request for AST school. the reason you cannot just enlist in this job is because there are so many people wanting it, that the school gets filled up fast.  so before you can even get into AST school, you will be doing another job, like mechanic, or boatswains mate, etc.  only when there is an opening for you, will you go.    I know the Navy has Rescue swimmers. but i am not too sure about them.
xWSIIOpaaa	First of all, it's not up to you to apply for her visa. She would have to apply in person to the Visa section of the British Consulate-General in Rio de Janeiro.  You could eventually sponsor her application by providing a declaration stating that she will live with you and you will provide for her living expenses during her stay in the UK. Check with the UK Border Agency (see website in sources).  As a general rule, Brazilian citizens can travel to the UK and stay up to 6 months without needing to get a visa beforehand. However, if you plan to marry your girlfriend, or she wants to stay longer than 6 months, she will have to apply for a visa and your sponsorship will be required.

AA10123414	"Can an employer decrease your pay at will" - Yes after notice is given as long as the decrease does not violate the minimum wage laws.    "force you as an employee to resign without any remedy.?" - Sort of. they can give you the chance to resign. You can refuse. They can fire you. They will report that you were fired for cause to unemployment thus you will still not get unemployment.    "...manner that forced the people to quit voluntary..." - This statement contradicts it self. They either quit voluntarily or they were fired. There is no  "forced the people to quit voluntary".|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	It depends on a lot of things, such as whether you have an employment contract and what the state law is. State laws on "at will" employment vary alot. At my company, we were all given 10% paycuts this year, without any consultation with us. The alternative was to see the company go bankrupt.|`|AA11098866	I know in my state, all employers and employees are considered 'employed at will'.  They have it set up so I can leave whenever I want, and they can let me go whenever they want.  Now, most companies would want to create some kind of paper trail to prevent any legal disputes.  You should check into your particular state's laws to delve into this further.|`|hCr7Vlxkaa	You can be asked to resign. That would for most people be a dumb thing to do. You can't file for unemployment if you do. You might give some more specifics.|`|AA11150795	There are many cases where employers have to bring about across the board salary reductions. Everyone affected is usually informed ahead of time. On the other hand, if an employer is singling out individuals to cut their salary, or threatens termination for no seemingly good reason, you may have a case to take to court if they proceed with that action.      Read your contract clauses/company policy, which should have been given to you when you first started working at a particular place. Many contracts today state that you can quit without giving notice, as well as the employers have the right to terminate you without any notice. If you decide to seek out an attorney, bring a copy of the companies policy with you.    If you are not in a labor union, this kind of thing can happen and you won't have any recourse, short of hiring an attorney! Unions keep their members informed of their rights in the work place, and also act as advocates for them in many instances. I am not endorsing nor taking away from Union membership. It has it's pros and cons.
