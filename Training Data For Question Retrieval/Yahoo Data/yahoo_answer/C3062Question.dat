There is something fishy going on at my BF's place of employment. New employees are being brought in. He is kind of concerned that they are out to get everyone that's a senior at the company.

I am a former Marine out here in Detroit looking for security work. Either overseas or here in Michigan. Honestly I am so sick and tired of applying to these jobs on the internet. I do at least 20 a day and still get nowhere. My resume is Golden. I even tried cold calling and actually going to companies but no days all they want you to do if put in an application online like the other 2 million people. I mean WTF! I am so frustrated! When I was in Iraq at just 21 years old I took squads in the middle of Baghdad and was in charge of a million dollars worth of equipment. I did everything. And if I didnt know how to do it I was showed once and from then on I handled it. This has to be a damn joke. The most incompetent people out here have jobs and my *** cant even get my foot in the door! I'm sorry if I dont have that much college exp since I was in the sandbox getting mortar throw at me trying to serve this country. There right about that saying its not what you know its who you know. Sorry I had to vent. But if anybody knows any good companies that are hiring armed security here in the Detroit area or a company overseas please let me know.
