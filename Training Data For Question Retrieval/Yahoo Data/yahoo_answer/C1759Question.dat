LONDON: A British boy made a big deal out of Happy Meals. Luke Underwood, 11, had his 5,000-piece collection of posters, Happy Meal boxes, toys, and promotional displays auctioned on Wednesday night, selling for USD 11,500, which includes a 15% buyer's premium.       Luke, who is from South Clifton, Nottinghamshire, 220 kilometres north of London, said on Thursday it was tough to put the collection under the hammer.    "It was sad to see it go," he said on a telephone interview on his way home from school. "We just needed the room. It was on the landing. It was everywhere."       Unique Auctions' owner Terry Woodcock said he had no idea the memorabilia would sell. "I didn't think people would be interested in McDonald's toys. I've never been so wrong about an auction in 20 years," he said.       Woodcock said that people from around the world — including the US, Germany and Australia — bought pieces of the collection. One man paid USD 420 for a 101 Dalmatians toy to finish his own collection. Luke's father, Philip, had bought most of the collection for his son four years ago for USD 350, and they've been adding to it.        http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World... 
20090227131117AAUSHIy	News & Events;Current Events	Is the Fred Goodwin pension affair a smokescreen for the government?	While there is much discussion about the Fred Goodwin's overly-large pension, it has distracted the public's attention from what the government is doing to further prop up proven-incompetent banks like RBS.  This includes measures such as the UK Treasury agreeing to take on ￡325billion of RBS's toxic assets into its insurance scheme, and pumping a further ￡13bn into RBS to strengthen its balance sheet on top of the ￡20bn the government already injected into RBS last year. The bank will have access to another ￡6bn should it need it.       Of course, we as tax-payers will have to pay heavily for all this at some point, which is why the government is keen to divert attention from this. It is possible that RBS can be made profitable enough to repay all its debt at some point in the future, but I wouldn't hold your breath!       http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7911...

At what age do you think children's names have to be down for a good infant school if they have the slightest chance of getting it?? It's when they're 2. 2 years, 9 months old, just when most start preschool.      Did you know that even nurseries and preschools have "feeder schools" and that if your child went to the wrong nursery they're unlikely to get into a school other than the feeder??      How is it that the governement get away with such blatant "school lotteries" from such a young age. Essentially in the area where I live, unless I move the kids nursery now (they are 1 and 2) they will likely not get into the best secondary school in the area. It's shocking!

We dont want to get married because we think we will not break up if we live in sin,really?Maybe you are just afraid of real commitment and care more about your money and assets than you really love or trust one another,if that is so then why have children together.   It is a sad state of affairs that the so called civilized world has become this and the only ones who seem to want to commit to marriage are lesbians and homosexuals,please people do your home work no matter how accepted or popular God ordained marrriage as between a man and a woman ONLY!   Why is there just no standards any more and every one does every thing backwards putting things first like buying a house or doing whatever before marriage,that is not what God wants us to do,in my opinion any way.I think we are setting a awful example to future generations by accepting and condoning such flagrant disregard for truth and living according to Gods laws.

Remember hearing a black comic telling us the only time a person of the same colour would be picked for president would be when North America would be '...worth sh.it!' - well, with the unemployment figures and economics reaching worrying levels, he sure has a job to do.  However - would Obama had been voted in if his country was as powerful as it was during the eighties. How will he be seen if he (along with his colleagues) turns the country around, improving employment and Wall Street reputation? It's just a shame he has become the President in such a time as now, as he will be open for abuse...and perhaps even blamed for any future hardship Americans may face before it gets better.
