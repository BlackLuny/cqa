It's amazing that ancient peoples were able to engineer and pull off that kind of construction without machinery.  Where do you think the design, etc originated from?  And stonehenge?  That's amazing, too!
20090225081040AA6WOuH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read a book with this ending?	She sat in her car and stared at the house in front of her. 204 Mockingbird Lane. She glanced down at the sheet of paper in her hand. It matched. This was where her dad told her to go. She thought back to when she had told her father that she wanted to find peace and happiness. He had smiled at her and said “Baby girl you won’t find peace until you go home. But remember home is not where you left him” and that is when he handed her this sheet of paper with the address. She had not come right away. She wasn’t sure about what she wanted to do. But this morning she knew that she needed to come here.     She got out of the car and started up the walk. When she was halfway up the sidewalk the door opened up. She stopped in her tracks. She had not expected him to be here. He looked better than she remembered in jeans that seemed to be molded to his body and a old tee shirt that clung tight to his chest, outlining his muscles. He stood on the porch and stared at her. His eyes seemed to burn into her and she felt naked as she stood in front of him.     “Hello Jake. How have you been?” Grace spoke trying to ease the tension of the moment. “I’m fine Grace.” Jake answered. It was obvious to Grace that it was not going to make this any easier for her. “My father mentioned that you had moved.” Jake continued to stare and did not respond. “The house looks nice” Grace tried again. Jake appeared to be trying to make a decision as anger appeared to flash in his eyes. A moment later the look was gone and Jake spoke “Would you like to see the inside?”    Jake came down  the steps and took Grace by the arm. As he led her inside he spoke. “It is not completed yet. There is still a lot to be done on the inside. I have a phone call I need to make. Go ahead and look around.” Then he walked away.     Grace fought back the tears. It was harder seeing him then she thought it would be. She wanted to jump in his arms and have him kiss her the way he did before. She wanted to be the light of his life, but it was obvious that he had moved on. The house proved to her that he had put her out of his life for good.     She wandered around the house and was amazed at the design and the layout. It was the perfect house. He had put in big picture windows throughout the entire place to allow lots of sunlight in. She walked through  the kitchen and found the living room. She gasped and put her hand to her cheek. It was perfect. It was everything she had ever dreamt about. The living room itself was sunken down with three steps on either end of it. On the far side of the living room was a spiral staircase that led to the upstairs. The top of the staircase opened up into a loft area.    She felt a hand on her shoulder and jumped as she turned around. She saw Jake standing there and she felt the tears come to her eyes. She tried to fight them because she did  not him to see her cry. She turned away from him and walked over to the window. “Did you get your business finished?” Grace asked. “I told them I was busy and I would call them later.” Jake answered. Jake crossed the room and stood beside Grace.     Grace waited for him to speak but he was silent. He just stood there staring out the window. Grace was torn. She wanted to tell Jake that she was sorry and that she still loved him, but it was obvious that he had moved on. She felt a pain in her chest but she knew that it was a pain that only time would heal.     “I designed this for you.” Jake spoke so softly that Grace wasn’t sure if she heard him right. She turned to look at him. Her eyes wide in amazement. “I had hoped you would like it.” Jake continued without looking at Grace. “The first home I built obviously did not work for us. I had to sell it. Every time I was there I thought back to when we were there together. I am sorry I hurt you. I guess I can never make it up to you.” As Jake spoke he clenched his jaw together in an effort to remain in control.     Grace broke down. The tears began to fall down her face. “Jake I am the one who is sorry. I never gave you a chance. I never gave us a chance. I just left. Every day I think about what I did and I regret it. I should have stayed. We could have worked it out. But I was too weak, too scared to stay.” Jake turned to look at Grace as she spoke. “I guess I should leave. The house looks great and I am sure that whoever is lucky enough to be here with you will love it.” Grace turned to walk away but Jake put his hand on her arm and stopped her.     “Grace I” Jake started but Grace interrupted him. “Jake please.” She sobbed. “Don’t say any more. This is already hard for me. I had come here hoping for another chance with you, a chance to make things right. But you have moved on and I realize that there is no longer room in your home or your heart for me. I don’t blame you but it still hurts. So please don’t say anything just let me leave.” Grace walked away. Jake watched her and when she had her hand on the front door she heard him say “Grace I built this h

20090227122929AAMWDEq	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Education + Becoming an actor.?	My dream is to be an actor, but education is also vital.  Is doing a degree for example Chemistry or Maths a good idea. Because going into a fall blown acting degree would mean your not guaranteed work, but on the flip side you get the intensive acting skills/time needed to perfect their craft.  I hear a lot of actors are in jobs or working in some poxy bar and restaurant.       So my question is will doing a degee like maths or science be good for some thing to fall back on. If  acting  does not work out for me?. I think a lot of other people should consider this option.  What do you think?

20090227122757AAw7a2Q	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think this is a good opening for a story?	Chapter 1   He was coming closer, his eyes like frozen balls of ice, his devilish smile expression was enough to make anyone scared. He was so close, I could feel his breath on my face, I could feel the fangs cut into my skin like a sharp blade. I screamed in pain and slowly fell the the ground.      I woke up, sweat poured into my four poster bed. Another nightmare about vampires. Terror of crawling out of my duvet and seeing his porcelain face and fangs again slithered through my veins. Who is he? What is he doing inside my head all the time? I was breathing deeply, my throat was tightening up. I gulped and wiped a tear that was dribbling on my face.    “Morgan, come down now.” My mum shouted from the kitchen, most likely to be baking some pancakes for my morning breakfast. I scrambled out out bed, walked cautiously down the stairs, gripping tightly onto the rail, walked quietly into the dining area and sat obediently at the narrow, glass table. My mum placed down my plate, and left me alone in the dining area. As I was slicing my food, a slideshow of flashbacks ran through my mind. The softness of his voice, the smell of his breath, the sharpness of his teeth. It was all coming back to me, the terrifying images blinking one-by-one. My nails were digging into my hands – just like the fangs had done to my neck. It felt so real...so believable. It must have been a dream, right?         Critism is accepted :-)   Tell me the truth.

Summer was over   And soon it was fall   I hadn’t a clue   No, none at all      It was on that old school playground   Either first or second grade   When memories are born   Where memories are made      From top of the jungle gym   I could see   The prettiest girl   Staring back at me      I soon slipped    from the monkey bars   She was laughing at me   But I was seeing stars      She came over to me   Barely could I exhale   Either love or something   Made me go pale      I thought, “Baby oh baby    She knows I just fell   But she’s coming over   Man what is that smell?”      Something foul and horrid   Attacked my nose   I shrugged it off   And tried to recompose      She flicked her hair   And offered a hand   But pulled it away   I went into the sand       Laughing hysterically   At my dismay   She went back to her friends   There I lay      I thought, “Maybe oh maybe   She’s just playing it cool   She must like me   To pretend to be cruel”      Smiling with hopes high   And heart so bright   I jumped up   With cries of delight      She was back with friends   They looked at me   They were all giggling   So we must all agree      They must all like me   So I walked straight ahead   To her and her friends   To her only I said      I said, “Baby, oh baby   I think you’re cool   I really like you   Out of the whole school”      You see Love is a mystery   Of sweet relief   Someone stole my heart   But I caught the thief      A comfortable pause   And then cries of delight   They were all giggling   So I must have been right      She said, “That’s nice, but really   Who cares bout you   You’re not cute at all   And dumb as a mule!”      To this I replied   “True but think   You’re not cute either   And you kinda stink”      At this the girls screamed   And all ran away   Screaming “You’re a loser!”    To my dismay      Summer was over   And soon it was fall   I hadn’t a clue   No, none at all      I’ll always remember   Before all other school junk   That old playground   And the girl who stunk

Greatest Fear      One day the mentor asked,   “Children, what is your greatest   Fear?”      There was shuffling and mumbling   And some giggling in between   Then, finally, some work done   Though it was not fun      There were silly questions asked   And some stern looks from the mentor   But still, everyone answered   Their first thought came to mind      “My greatest fear, Mentor, is death, why, of course,”   The children state, and then turn back to jibber-jabber.    The mentor stands up and looks around   Perplexed by the answer, for why would it be death?      “But, Children, Dear Children, death is your greatest fear?”   If our greatest fear is death,   How can it happen everyday?   If our greatest fear is death,   Why don’t we try to stop it?      If our greatest fear is death,   Then why do some force it upon themselves?   If our greatest fear is death,   Then why do we have wars?      “Do you see now, Children, why our greatest fear couldn’t be death?”   The mentor agonizes over their bored, confused faces.   The children turn away and nod, although they don’t agree.   One raises his voice, “Mentor, death is my greatest fear, for I don’t want to die!”      The mentor looked beyond the boy’s stubborn expression,   Trying to entangle is thoughts but not succeeding.   “How?” the mentor asks. “I do not understand.”      “Do you want to die, Mentor,” the children ask quietly.   “No! No! I do not want to die, but how can our greatest fear be…   Something that happens everyday.   For we will all have to endure it.”      The children glance back to each other.   The question a lost cause, still no change or flaw in their lives   Why, Mentor was so wrong…   Or was he.

Daffodil hair over cloaks of lace,   And long silver arms that cradle our death.      The echo of a sigh that drapes the sun,   In waterfalls of empyrean silk.   Meadows of flowers, the warmth that begun,   In a golden cloud of sunflower's ilk.      Spinning on her toes that hail the sky,   To fall and rise in a shower of songs.   With a push from earth, into heaven they fly,   The angel of our tears, in heaven she belongs.      Your laugh that cracked into a billion stars,   That fed the white feathers of your guardian's wings.   Shimmering waves of what was ours,   Satin clothes from the night she sings.      To tread the air like a lake of water,   To turn and drink the cascading light.   She plunges through as freedom's daughter,   The battle that does not dwell upon a fight.            i'm a young teenager, and i have heaps of room for improvement! so i don't care if you want to be mean. it'll help me   xxxxxxx

20090306172939AADSqqT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What turned you from an atheist?	This question, posted earlier today was removed by Yahoo without explanation.  Why do you think it was removed?  Has this ever happened to you?   =====================================      In college and graduate school, then owning my own business,  I was an atheist.   What swung me was my realization that science is not reality.      I used to think there was no God since humans would have seen positive proof by now and  if God was real, why are there dinosaur bones for instance?  I then realized that religion has nothing to do with God and that I was making a mistake in logic.  If there were no humans, if there was no Earth, would it matter in the question "Is there a God"?  No.  In fact, since man has intelligence, why can't another intelligence exist?   If the universe was created 13 billion years ago, did it really happen by random chance?  Where is the scientific proof for that?        I found science has failed me on many things.  What about ESP and remote viewing?  The science community says they are bunk since it cannot be reproduced in a lab.  However, they have no explanation how someone can remote view a place 1,000 miles away, draw it and be accurate.  They have no explanation on how some psychics can help solve murders leading detectives to the crime scene.  They, instead, imply these people are frauds fooling the public, are unreliable and the thoughtful person would ignore such people. Science and the media go hand-in-hand with this belief.  There is even a TV series about a "pretend" psychic detective showing how mysteries could by solved by more carefully looking at clues.  There are a couple of other shows with goofy ghost detectives shot in infrared light.  The reality is that science, universities, the media, the government have no idea what is going on about these subjects and at this stage can only lobby us to ignore reality.   In truth, to recognize such things are real is to conclude we do not die when our body dies and that the popular atheistic scientific explanation repeated over and over by the science community, the media and the universities is itself the fallacy.

20090306212953AAvMnFO	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Layers of perception- best answer 10 points?	There are plenty of reasons and results, along with choices and answers. The decisions and conclusions anyone can make up will provide a false sense of understanding and contentment. A physiological and poignant trick one will play on his or herself to bear the possibilities of how it may actually be. The cause, the purpose, the explanation and the justification- all of the options you can settle your head on. No need for truth if there’s room for a flight of fancy. Besides, at one point all the steps will fade away, anyway.       what do you think?
