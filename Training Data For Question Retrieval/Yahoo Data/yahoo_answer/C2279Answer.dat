5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	You've asked several questions.    First, any 2-part epoxy glue (including the brand made by Loctite) will cure hard, as will other regular** 2-part epoxy resins (which are usually sold in plastic bottles).    Epoxy resins are quite adhesive which is why they're also sold in small quantities as a "glue."    There are various kinds of releases one can use with both epoxy resins and polyester resins so they won't stick to things, and there also are various kinds of materials which are naturaling-releasing (silicone, polyethylene & polypropylene, etc.) that can be used as molds and things for resins.    If you want lots more info about both epoxy resins and polyester resins, check out this page at my site for explanations, advantages/disadvantages, uses, lessons, examples, etc:  http://glassattic.com/polymer/other_mate...    However, I don't think that the "Kiki Kannibal" jewelry is made with resin, though similar things could be I guess.  I looks more like the basic shapes are made from shrink plastic, acrylic sheeting, or polymer clay, then various kinds of "jewels" etc are glued to the top.      HTH,    Diane B.    **  ...the epoxy resins called "floral setting resins" which are used as fake water inside clear vases for holding artificial flowers don't cure as hard as regular epoxy resins though  ... and the brand of regular epoxy resin called EasyCast can be a tad softer and be a bit flexible compared to other brands of regular epoxy resins like Envirotex Lite, Ultra-Glo, Aristocrat's Liquid Glass, etc.      .

gkoOThQAaa	I hate one word answers:    PS3:   Free online gaming  Bluetooth  4 USBs  HDD out of the box  Wi-FI  Mem Card reader  More variety in games  Internet browser where you can watch youtube, etc..  Blu ray  Divx  Less likely to have malfunctions  wireless rechargeable controllers out of the box with rumble and motion control  Exclusive games (Metal Gear, Little big planet, killzone 2, heavenly sword, uncharted 1 & 2, resistance 1&2, ratchet and clank, God of war 3, Heavy rain, Infamous)    Xbox 360:  more exclusive games but most of them are sequels and can get them on pc  better online experience but costs money  you have to pay extra for HDD  pay extra for wi-fi  HD-DVD which is dead  More likely to get RROD (red ring of death) and you have to replace it.  wired or battery wireless controllers which are going to cost you money  no motion control  Exclusive games (Halo 3, Gears of war 1&2, Fable 2, GTA IV DLC, Tomb raider DLC, Ace combat, left 4 dead)      Bottom line, if you're looking for a cheap way out with similar graphics get the xbox, and if you're looking for a reliable console get the ps3. The xbox has already a wide fanbase which will be better for you if you care about playing against friends online. However, I got the ps3 which is the best piece of gadgetry I'm going to own.    --------------------------------------...  I just got it off another answer I wrote, also I want to say that it doesn't matter which console you choose as long as you love it. The major reason why I chose the ps3 was I already had great experience with it since the ps1.

It should help you in connecting and whether or not it is correct.    Hope this helps.    Sorry if I didn't answer you question correctly.|`|KXH3vokFaa	First of all make sure you have everything listed below:  - a good internet connection which is connected to your 360  - created a Xbox Live account  - have adjusted your network settings    If you have done everything above, then something might be wrong with your 360 (cant connected to the internet maybe?).|`|X5ZwTtPHaa	1st get a ethernet cable or wirless internet thing and connect it to your xbox  then go to connect to xbox, configure net work(must have a linksys or something of that type) and find your signal, enter the code such as a wep(if u have one) and test connection, it should connect, if not go here if you have a link sys (pass is admin   no username and there u can change things arround like security and what you have to type in    hope this helps|`|qbtwhWRqaa	first you need 360  next you need a multiplayer game  third you need a high speed connection going to a working wired or wireless modem (depending on what connection you have)  fourth, from that modem connect your xbox  fifth, start the xbox and attempt connection  when you get to the connect screen, the xbox must go through several checks, if a check dosnt work, either put it on auto connect or manually imput the ip adress etc  also, when I first hooked mine up, I found I hate to give the connection a couple minutes before the xbox realized it was connected  after that you need to but a gold membership if you want to play live    if that doesnt work you probably have a problem with either the modem (which by the way is required to play), the wires, your internet, or the xbox itself|`|qACzan5Faa	you need to attache your internet to your xbox and then when you are attache to internet it should sign up to xbox live.

YljHCeSUaa	^  Rotom is NOT a legenadary.Its far too weak and has very low stats(All below average except speed).    The third gym badge is Fantina in Platinum(ghost type user).She has a Duskull, Haunter and a Mismagius.Duskull and Haunter are at Lv 24.Mismagius is at Lv. 26.Umbreon should defeat her nicely.Rotom is a good pokemon to use against her too.    So train your pokemon(On the 3rd gym,your priority is Umbreon and Rotom).Train them up to Lv.25 or 28.    Good team.But you'll eventually have to give up on some of those.Rotom is not really the best pokemon to have.Rampardos(cranidos's evoloved form) is the 2nd strongest pokemon in the whole game(nest to deoxys attack form) when it comes to Attack.But it has horrible defenses and speed so it can easily be defeated.    Train Grotle too.It'll prove to be a worthy addition to your team.|`|Pv6n2pGAaa	Hey nice team man! Out of 10 I think that would be a 8.5. But really focus on Rotom, he is a legendary after all, so he would be the best to train because legends always get the best stat raises. Also train your grotle too starters are almost always the best to train. The most fun thing about pokemon is training, so do NOT rush it, just have fun. Good luck man!
YljHCeSUaa	You must first beat the WHOLE game up to the Elite four.You have to be become the Pokemon Champ.The key is that you have to PROVE to the game that you can already take on a certain level of a pokemon.To do that,you have to beat the elite 4 and cynthia thus proving your pokemon is Higher than Level 60    The first pokemon in your party should be at lv.61 or higher. The 2 rich couple gives 24,000 each(give amulet coin to the first pokemon in your party).|`|w4qS66aqaa	i really doont know, i never knew they could get to 40. google/youtube it :]
KXH3vokFaa	This is a excellent product and I couldn't live without it as a Xbox 360 owner. If you look at the back our your 360, you will notice two "indents" above the serial code and near the USB slots. Where the indents are located is where the adapter would go.    The way how it works it once you push the adapter into the indents, you need to attach the USB, which is part of it, to the USB slots underneath it. Once you have it attached, a light on the fronzt of the adapter who appear; Red=No connection,Green=Connection. To make your light appears, green you will need to edit your system network information on the 360 dashbord until you find a wireless network. Other than being able to connected to Xbox Live, the product also allows to sync "stuff" from your computer. You can sync music, photos, videos, etc from your pc to your 360 once you have followed all directions.    To answer your other question, you are going to need to have a wireless network for the adapter to work. If there are no no-password networks, then you'll need to buy a wireless-internet router which would then produce a wi-fi signal for your adapter to intercept.    Trust me, you will love this product. If you don't get it, then you'll have to buy a long ethernet cable to plug into your 360 then to your internet modem. And if you don't want to trip on it, then you'll have to drill holes through your floor....you get the picture.    As a fellow owner of the adapter, i feel you should get it and will LOVE it and will LOVE the results of having it.|`|83vhCGW1aa	An X-Box wireless adapter connects to an existing wireless network.  Most people achieve this by having a wireless router in their home, which they use to connect multiple machines to one internet modem, and to each other.  If your xbox isn't close to your router, you will lag.  If you are interested in better wireless internet, check out WiMax from Clear.  It is high speed, long range wireless that isn't too expensive.  Unfortunately it is only available in Portland, Oregon right now, but it will be coming to other cities soon.|`|CyGyZDNsaa	You need a wireless source to internet (a router). Then you get an internet adaptor for your XboX. I cant exactly remember how you set it up to where the two connect, but if you google it im sure youll find your answer.|`|TXPJHBPraa	if u have a broadband connection at home u just plug it in and go to the settings it is easy enough just common since.    hope this helps you deiced.        plz put this as your best answer|`|ASsciJ4Faa	you must have a network flowing through your house which involves Step 1 Internet source/can't have dialup  Step2 plug Internet source into modem  Step 3 plug modem into router  Step 4 plug router to modem  If you did everything right then you should have a network  Then you go buy the wireless adapter which is a $100 and you plug it into the 360.  The 360 should recognize the adapter and then search for connections  You then join your network and if you have xbox live gold you can go online and do anything that you want on xbox live|`|0C2DAt6caa	You need to have a router/gateway hooked up to your internet connection. The xbox 360 adapter is basically just an antenna that searches for a wireless internet connection. If you don't have one, you're SOL.

Some games that I've played that I like are Mario kart, Cooking Mama, Nintendogs, and Brain Age. My favorite, though is Animal Crossing Wild World. It's $35, but well worth it. You could probably buy it used at Game Stop.

dXEWsMLBaa	I would sell it on ebay,or amazon, because you'll probably make more that way. But if your looking for a quick sell, they'll take it for about $30, throw in a couple of games and it'll be a bit more, proly about $40. I think they'll take the blue controller, not sure though.|`|RndmS49Yaa	Oh well that probably wont make a dent in saving for a ps3 cause theyre around 400 for the 40 gig or 600 for the 80 gig but if you sale it it will probably be sold for around 50 60 or 70 maybe 80|`|FoxTcv4Zaa	Hm.. Try calling a local store near you.  They would possibly have that answer for you.  The lowest price for a PS3 is about $400.  Selling your PS2 definitely won't pay for it all.  Gamestop offers crappy prices, and sell for a bit higher; its just the way they make profit these days.    Most likely i'm guessing around the range of.. $20-$30 to be honest.  They sell used PS2's for $50-$70 the last time I went to Gamestop and saw a PS2 Box saying the price...    Good luck on your PS3 :)
e664f1de73150453313a8e7469e837dbaa	Why would you agree to buy a Webkinz from the store if the code is missing? Check for the code before you buy the toy. If it says you are already logged on, it's possible someone stole the code before you were able to use it.

piZ4xDBqaa	Did you buy the game itself, or a prepaid time card?  To upgrade from a trial account, you need to buy a copy of the game, which should come with a manual and a CD and stuff.  If all you got was a scratch-off card, then what you have is a prepaid time card...  which you'll need eventually to add more time to your game, but won't work for upgrading a trial account.    The other possibility is that you're putting in the wrong number.  When you buy the game, besides the code for the game itself, there will be card with a code for a trial account that you're supposed to give to a friend.  Make sure you're putting in the actual game code that's on the CD sleeve.|`|gdD36vidaa	call the ppl u bought it frum and yell at yther asses

There actually is a cheat to get friend relationship better. In 10 simple steps. They might take a minute or to, but it's worth it    INSTRUCTIONS:    1) Press Ctrl, Shift, C then you should see a white bar at the top of the screen    2) Type in "boolprop testingcheatsenabled true" then press enter.    3) Press Ctrl, Shift, C again and then type boolprop testingcheatsenabled on    4) Now exit the house you are at.    5) Then once you in the neighborhood again, do both of the cheats again.    6) Now enter any home (or the preious one you were at)    7) Then go to the friends section, (like to see who you are married to, or related to)     8) Now click and drag the bar the shows "Daily relationship" to how far you want it to be. And also do "Lifetime relationship" to how far you want it    9) Now whoever you made in a better relationship with you, will now like you. After that, invite them over, then your sims should like eachother    10) Although, if you do bring the bars all the way to 100, you will have the option of "kiss, makeout, smooch, etc" So be aware if your friend kisses you or does anything "adult like" to you.|`|lUjjfS4Raa	GOOGLE|`|GOqQ7mL9aa	motherlode for money|`|L4Thk5Bfaa	There is no cheat that does that, so your just going to have to try different interactions until you find one that works.|`|lYZ5OSkjaa	Bring Up The Cheat Box On The Neighbourrhood And type in - boolprop testingcheatsenabled true - just the bits inside the -'s. then go onto the family you want to play on. then go onto your sims interests and pick and choose what you want them to be interested in and then the sims date press shift and make selectable if they arent yours and then do the same though if they are yours.

Hand destruction could go well with either a stall or a mill deck.    Cheap Strategies  - Gravity Bind + Robbin' Goblin + Direct Attack  - Helpoemer  - Card Destruction + Serial Spell  - Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower + Zombie deck  - Dark-World Deck + Appropriate    I utilize some of these ideas in my zombie mill deck. I bought the Zombie Madness and Zombie World theme decks, and they had pretty much all the cards I needed.    If any of these didn't help, here is a web site that can give you inspiration.

fPavekfeaa	Snake Cult Initiation adds poisonous 3 to the creature. If the creature already has poisonous 2 then the creature now has two separate abilities of poisonous. One rated at 2 the other at 3. Both abilities trigger when the creature deals combat damage and then when the resolve the end result would be the player hit would get 5 poison counters.    The abilities being separate would come into play if your opponent has some way to counter a triggered ability. He would have to counter each instance of poisonous separately in order to avoid gaining any poison counters.    However, if he has a card that removes the poisonous key word from the creature then he only needs one as any alteration of keywords always affects each instance of the keyword.|`|AA11442085	The creature will have poisonous 2 and poisonous 3. If a creature has multiple instances of a keyword each triggers seperately.    From the Comprehensive rules:  502.69. Poisonous    502.69a Poisonous is a triggered ability. Poisonous N means Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player gets N poison counters. (For information about poison counters, see rule 102.3d.)    502.69b If a creature has multiple instances of poisonous, each triggers separately.

I can't name any specifically though because it's been too long since I've played.  Resident Evil 4 had great boss fights as well, especially the first boss you have to fight in the lake.  Striders and gunships in half-life 2 are a blast to fight.  Other than those I can't think of any modern games with good boss fights.  They all either suck or are non-existent.

ickyq53aaa	Here are some kits for begginers:  http://www.electronickits.com/robot/robo...  If you want to build a robot from scratch you'll need the following:     Design and build a base. Locate and purchase drive and steering motors. Have access to drill press, band saw, sander (and often a milling machine). Design and build motor drive circuit(s). Design and build a micro controller. Design and build sensor circuits. Learn to program and write programs from scratch.     This is a task that would take a normal person several months or years. In fact, I've known professional engineers that spent several years just to get a mobile base working.     I'm not trying to discourage you from taking the 'from scratch' approach, I just want you to know what size of project this is. If you are willing to spend many months, much money, and potentially disapointment and discouragement, then design and build your own robot from scratch.|`|653899f3da14fe16dab0886bd25fbc3eaa	wrap tin around your body and take on a monotnous tone... meep yes master....bleep bleep

You went to Atari.com and you found a game that you like, but you absolutely REFUSE to click on the link "What is EDS" when you were given the opportunity... because you didn't want to pay the extra 3.95 and you didn't want to see what the 3.95 was all about... then.    Or did you read that "What is EDS" and not understand it?  Here's a link... http://www.digitalriver.com/addons/eds/  But, the only text that exists on it is very short... so I can copy it here.  "When you purchase downloadable software you have 30 days from the date of purchase to download your order.  If you purchase Extended Download Service, we will keep a backup copy of your software for two years.  Should you need to re-download for any reason, it will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week up to TWO YEARS from the date of purchase."    So, if you didn't read this when you had the chance.. shame on you.  If you did read it then, and you re-read it now, and you still don't understand...    If you don't buy the insurance, you have 30 days to re-download it if necessary.  If you bought the EDS, you have 2 years where you can redownload it.  After that, no, you can't re-download it for whatever reason.|`|rvMxaNAraa	I cant say for sure with atari but with everything else I've downloaded, When you first get the option to download it a small window will appear the says [OPEN] [DOWNLOAD] [CANCEL] If you select download then it will download the game from the source. If you select open then you will download the setup file to your PC. Then you will have to run the setup file to download the perspective application. This set file can be saved on you PC or CD and at a later time you rerun it to get the download again. However the setup file may not work if the application has a built in time limit or run limit. Either one will prevent you from running the set up file again after a period of time. I would say just download the set up file and save it.
oPdufaIfaa	well here are a few good ones lord of the rings conquest, rock band 2, Mk vs Dc, mirrors edge, COD world at war, LBP, resistance 2, bioshock, fallout 3, far cry 2, and killzone 2 will have trophies. also every game that comes out from now on will have trophies

w6weeb7Daa	Yes this is all possible. Get a free program called ImgBurn (google it.) Then, place your disc inside your computer and run ImgBurn. On the menu, click "Make Image File From Disc". Switch the read speed to 4X and start. It will make a .iso file that's about 700MB. Go on google and search for a playstation emulator. This will require a BIOS file which you have to figure out how to get yourself. When you get the BIOS and playstation emulator, run it and select "Run ISO File". Select the file you made earlier with ImgBurn. Voila you have playstation on your laptop.|`|LwdRHE4Zaa	Yes it is! but not by converting, you can play it through PCSX emulator (this is a Playstation Emulator) you can download here below    http://www.pcsx.net/    you need plug-ins and BIOS to setup in order to play ",

Iva8drdfaa	Okay, is this a campaign issue, or a online battle issue, or a custom battle problem?      I really can't help unless I know the composition of the armies that are fighting, or of the area they are fighting in.    And, Which faction are you playing as.  This is all crucial information.          I can try to assist though, with vague units.      Okay, use your missile units to fight their missile units, with a missile battle.  And lock your infantry in place with their infantry, using large fighting blocks, not thin lines.    Then try to neutralize their cavalry, by luring them into a trap, with some fast moving infantry, or cavalry, that can be spared.    The cavalry should go after the bait, leaving their rear, open for a cavalry strike.      Move your cavalry around the flanks of fighting line, in which your infantry is hitting theirs, and position your cavalry behind their infantry.    Then charge their rear.      If done correctly, they should be startled, afraid of the battle at hand, and rout almost instantly.

6N3yjlXhaa	There is no special setting.    Use a darning or free motion foot.   Hoop and stabilizer.    Drop or disengage the feed dogs.     If you cannot drop or disengage the feed dogs, set the stitch length to zero.    Use a straight stitch.    Position the fabric under the presser foot, lower the foot, lower and raise the needle to pull the bobbin thread to the top of the fabric.      Take a couple stitches in place and begin to move the fabric with your hands.      After you have moved from the starting stitch, snip the thread tails and continue stitching your pattern.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYgFWrxD1...

Yu69syOEaa	For approx. prices on Breyers go to http://www.ponylagoon.info/ it has *most* of the Breyers. The suggested prices are for mint horses, horses with minor flaws will go for less, horses with several larger flaws will only go for body prices.     If you feel like selling them yourself you can do so on http://www.modelhorsesalespages.com/sale... You can post text only ads for free and get photo uploading for $8.50 a year. You are much more likely to get a proper and fair price from a fellow hobbyist then a resell place that wants to make a profit off you.

Students that sleep in class or cheat homeworks will receive detention and have to stay a school."    there will be fish but not cats or dogs, that'll most likely be an expansion pack. i think you can also collect bugs, read this article: http://www.infinitesims.com/games/sims3/...    as for money cheats you just have to wait until the game comes out.|`|cesTfRKPaa	I dont think you can follow your kids to school.

CKRfaRYvaa	In addition to the Lockpick Bobblehead, there are 25 Lockpick skill books scattered around the wasteland.  These skill books are worth one point each, but if you have the Comprehension perk they'll be worth two points each.  If you need the specific locations, I suggest buying the strategy guide or searching online to see if anyone has a complete list.  Also, if you still have your vault 101 utility uniform it will add 5 to your lockpick skill whenever you wear it.|`|IRF8xiBuaa	That's Impossible. Sorry dude. Every XP you get goes towards your main level.    Just find a Bobble head relating towards your goal, it should raise your stat by 10. Without leveling up your main.
BaAAGIspaa	you could play butt ball, i no it sounds funny but its really fun first you get a small ball like a little smaller then a base ball and hit it against the wall you cant let it touch the ground and if someone drops the ball the other players can try to catch them before they touch the wall. if someone catches the other person than they lose a b which are your lives you have to spell out butt ball whenever all your letters are gone you loose.

PAv7xQjSaa	You have to have a human Sim selected, then select one of the dogs. I have also only heard that it's supposed to only work with the most expensive dog house, but I usually do it with the little one that has wood siding and looks like a miniature house with no problems, so I don't know if they updated with with an EP or if I have a fun glitch. One of the options for the pet should be "try for puppies with..."  You also may have too many sims on the lot. If you have 8 sims, you can't reproduce puppies or babies. So if you have 6 sims in the family, you can't try for puppies. (One EP changes the allowance to 10)  You should also check their ages. If they are close to elder, the female may be too old to reproduce.

But I do agree that it will be the most awesome game ever! I even have my first people planned out!|`|ysiE6IDjaa	Just look at this feature-    Securom, the most invasive DRM yet conceived that means you will be in effect only renting the game, not owning it, and by installing it you will be potentially allowing all your personal information stored on your computer to be transmitted to Sony, including banking details. It does this by communicating encrypted data to remote servers . Securom also interferes with your Firewalls, disables legitimate programs already installed on your computer and can cause your drives to crash.     Yeah, bring it on.|`|j1fUNvmFaa	The Sims is an OK game.
pBDed3tnaa	Don't bother with pvp gear, most of the stuff in heroics will get you better damage anyways. Start with heroics.   Heroic Cot drops mail elemental shaman pants also a haste/spellpower ring that is great.   Heroic Old Kingdom drops epic elemental shaman hands  Heroic Violet hold drops a nice spell hit trinket for casters  Heroic Utgarde Keep drops a nice ring similar to the one in Heroic CoT  Other than that, I know there is some decent BoE stuff on the auction house. Also, run Vault and OS every chance that you get. Once your gear is a little decent, just try to get into a 10 Man Naxx. Gearing up an elemental shaman is easy sauce. Good luck!|`|h4cdmgbIaa	First off, I would suggest getting the adon called Atlasloot Enhanced. Atlas is an in-game map for dungeons, and atlasloot will show you what each boss drops in a particular dungeon/raid.  OR  Do an armor or weapon search on www.wowhead.com. You can specify what gear you want, and see where it comes from.    Generally, though, and this is assuming you're starting as a fresh 80, you'll want to start with heroic 5-mans. That will get you a good start, and allow you to start collecting emblems of heroism, which can be traded for nice gear at your faction's area in Dalaran.  You'll want to get into the Vaults of Archavon every week, as he is a pretty basic and easy boss to kill, and he'll drop a random class's Tier 7 (on normal/10-man) or Tier 7.5 (on Heroic/25-man) in addition to random classes' PvP gear.  If you're in a raiding guild, your next stop is Naxxramas and Sartharian (no drakes to start).  After that, your guild would move on to Malygos and Sartharian with drakes.    Sorry I couldn't be more help, but I'm not exactly sure what kind of gear you have now, and what kind of guild you are in (if any).    You may also try reading a bit on WoWwiki, WoWhead, or ElitistJerks about your class and gear, and you can use maxdps.com to check out your damage output and to see what gear is best for you.|`|0T3weRh5aa	Go to champions hall in sw for alliance  or hall of legends in orgimmar if you're horde    Just farm your pvp gear at bg's and even wintergrasp    Dungeons  you have to fight with other ppl for the drops.|`|1OZKlyylaa	To start out i would do various heroics, some have a chance of dropping good elemental gear, but they also drop the Emblems of Heroism which can be used to buy good epics from various vendors. You can buy t7 gloves and chest, a trinket, necklace, and a few other thing for Heroism marks.    After you get a few epics i suggest doing Naxx, VoA, OS.  I wouldnt try EoE till your gear is pretty good because its the more difficult of the Northrends raids.|`|BLwtzGWcaa	If your going at this endeavor alone, PvP is the best way to start gearing up. Takes about 2 weeks of good games to get full epic gear. From there you should get interested in raiding with your guild or other guilds that you are familiar with. It is never idea to be horribly under geared when entering a raid. gearing up is a process of progression.    Start with your current gear ->Get PvP gear -> Raid -> Phat Lootz!
XZlFLecLaa	stop being stupid ... men cant get pregnant... that is SOOOOOO stupid on so many levels.|`|YogATwEoaa	boolprop testingcheatsenabled true  [put in the cheat bar]|`|QNqtthJ0aa	males cant get pregnant|`|yfHAWXLjaa	wtf how do males get pregnant|`|Ul2QmEv2aa	ONLY FEMALE  DUH|`|Dug6yDOLaa	this is possible, 1Find a male romantic partner for your adult female Sim if she is not already married or in a relationship. Work on their relationship until you have them at 75 on both daily and lifetime relationship scores. Step2Instruct your Sim to relax on a bed and click on the male Sim and have him join her. Once they are both lying on the bed, click on the male Sim again and choose "Try for Baby."   Step3Listen for the sound of a lullaby chiming once the Sims emerge from their activities under the covers. If you hear the music, your female Sim is pregnant.   Male Sims  Step1Create a male Sim with a knowledge aspiration if you want to get a male Sim pregnant. A pregnancy can occur with a male of any type of aspiration, but a knowledge Sim will enjoy the activities in which he will need to partake more than another type of Sim.   Step2Purchase the Farstar e3 Telescope, which costs 2,100 Simoleons. Place it outdoors on your lot.   Step3Instruct your male Sim to stargaze with the telescope at night. There is a small chance that when your Sim is stargazing, he'll be abducted by aliens. An abducted adult male always returns to the lot pregnant with an alien baby.
AwWcZb46aa	Saints Row 1 features quite a few characters that appear in Saints Row 2.  It really depends how interested in the story you are. You won't be confused playing 2 without playing 1  But if you play 1 first, you'll get moments when you say  "Oh, I remember him"    Saints Row 2 does feature a few hidden missions that relate to Saints Row 1 though and these will only be understood if you have played the first.|`|JCupeVkJaa	I would recommend getting saints row 1 first just because it was an extremely fun game.  You don't really need it to understand the story of the second one but some tings would make more sense.

4He3bNO7aa	I think I have that pose. Actually there are several variations at the store. I discovered the place about 8 months ago and used the poses on one of my avatars. It got to the point where I was being asked about my AO by so many people that I had to put the place in her Picks.    The place to look for is called MAMASANDO. There are two stores and both have the poses. It's a Japanese store with free Manga comic books on the lower (arrival) area. Fly up a little way and you will see the pose vendors on the circular balcony level.    You may think you've come to the wrong place when you see the pictures behind the pose stands, because most appear to depict mecha, gun-toting or anime biker characters. Look closely and you will see two that are schoolgirl poses and another one of a cute amime-type girl. These are the ones you want to look at.    Now here's the really good news. The individual poses are just L$35 each! Not impressed? Well the ready-loaded AOs with around 25 poses in them are L$600 and you can very easily add more poses for stands, walks, sits and ground sits.    Not only are the poses great, very smooth and very life-like, they are amazing value for money too. The downside is that - all of a sudden - everyone has them.

k13V3Xj8aa	Perhaps the easiest way to answer this would be describing the benefits of angles.  A thinner angle makes a sharper edge (assuming your stone is fine and not too coarse) but a thin angle tends to be more easily chipped or wear quick.    A thicker wedge gives you a more sturdy edge but while lasting a bit longer it tends to not be as sharp.    Consider the use you need your knife for, fine cutting or just to chop off a bit of rope.      I'd suggest getting a sharpening tool too, like professional chefs use to run it on every once in a while to keep it "on edge".  they look like long rods on a handle that have fine grooves like a file.  also a bit of oil on your stone when you use it may help|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Depends on the use, but most knives will have a thin angle except for knives like cleavers and hunting knives that are used for chopping and hacking.

The Gameshark puts stuff into the game thats not in the original data. The Action Replay takes the stuff thats inside the game already and brings it out (Such as: 999 Master Balls).

f6372cf83cc6d3deb50ba8e29fa12f49aa	There are always people who will make fun of you but they are only doing it because they can't juggle. I don't know how long you have been juggling but the better you get the more fun it is. People certainly don't make fun of me when I'm juggling 5 clubs and no one ever made fun of me when I was performing. If you get discouraged just watch some of these videos, especially the Toby Walker video. I bet no one makes fun of him. You also might like Olga Galchenko since you are a girl.

xFvx2DXpaa	I think you should wipe of the petroleum jelly.  Or wash it off for an even better result.  Because different lubricants tend to counteract each other.  If you use Jig A Loo and next day spray CRC on the same cube you would not get the effect some other cubes have.    I tried cube lube on my cube, then without cleaning it off, I applied another brand of silicone onto my cube. The effect was disappointing. I wiped it off and reapplied the lubricant again. It worked better than before.    Thus the next time when you want to try another lubricant, clean the cube out first.

No one goes there..the train goes through the area and there is a little graveyard from god knows when back there. But anyways..that's where our family would go camping and we would find the glass bottles with the glass corks. If you venture enough you can also find Indian artifacts.

eJIucizyaa	I think that the two answers you got are the best that you are going to get, but to add another two cents.  Most people are not active collectors and they seem to think that their collection is worth way more than it actually worth.  Depending where you are at check your local newspaper a stamp club,or check web www.stamp club/your town. If some of them are newer after 1940 use them for postage that's what I did and people thought they were getting something. GOOD LUCK!|`|154dzJ1Faa	I agree with the above.  But want to add that you will get a better deal if you sell to another collector directly.  Find out the value of your collection, and locate a bunch of other collectors, and offer it to them.  You may have to break it up, or insist on selling all or in packets.  Get what you want.  Don't go to dealers, who have to offer little to you, so they can sell at a profit to someone else.  Go through those magazines, find a local club.  You will find like-minded people that way.|`|k13V3Xj8aa	Stamp collecting has gone a bit out of public interest in the last say 20 years, like comic collecting too.  I had a friend that couldn't get much over face value for some of his newer stamps.  It's sort of a "buyers market" even before the economy took a plunge.    You may want to first invest in a book of values of stamps to make sure that some collector doesn't try to fake you out buying a stamp they "say" is near worthless for next to nothing and you might get serious funds for.     Selling a collection at once you won't get as much for as a few at a time.  If your willing to work a bit, try putting a few lots of a few on E-bay and make collectors compete for them.  You can also get a little mark up for your shipping and handling.      Speaking of say coins for example... Grading the things can be hard.  A coin collector might describe a coin as near mint when it's wear makes it fine and that changes the value tremendously.      Just start at the library and ask for a book on stamp values and stamp collecting.  Understanding what you have better is the best place to start.  A little research on your part might pay you back a lot.      Then you can better see if someone on-line (or off line) is offering you more of a fair price or not.

Most experts agree - 3D TV will be commercially available in late 2009! And it is IBM, LG, Samsung and Philips who has taken the lead!  The 3 Dimensions TV will give you a life-like image experience beyond all that exists today.   According to Philips Electronics CEO Rudy Provoost Philips hopes to introduce a high-definition television that can play 3D content within about two years. Although movie studios don't produce movies in 3D consumers will be able to get a 3D experience from these 2D high-definition TVs! And as the technology catches up the studios will likely produce movies made for 3D from the beginning.

(if u have high-speed internet - eg. dsl or cable)     --buy a wireless router or, if you already have one, hook it up to your modem or home network    --once installed and hooked up to the modem and/or network, the wireless router should create a wireless access point in which u can connect your DS to WIFI once you turn the router on and you are within range, or close enough to the router.    routers aren't cheap though sooooo... ya... think about that    your connection probably kept failing because:    1. security on the wireless connection (wifi security or firewall), if so, it will keep failing until you put a correct code in (security code encryption thing).    2. the connection you are trying is just not strong enough or reliable.|`|MWTzRUuQaa	Weird.

Don't stop till he says yes.|`|AEl15Ntqaa	i don't know what else you have played, its not as bad gears of war 2, left 4 dead, or fall out 3. compared to the CoD 4, its pretty violent|`|VL4IouYNaa	Same as watching James Bond, that's it. And you can limit the swearing in-game. Just ask them if you can trial it, show them you are mature, be nice and hopefully they will give in. :)|`|oMNHPDEvaa	Umm..it's just a video game.

MctSGNiHaa	If you're going Beast Mastery, Orc is definitely the way to go, for the +5% pet damage bonus, and Blood Fury, which increases your attack power based on your level. This attack power bonus gets transferred to your pet via stat sharing, and increases your damage even more.  Troll's Berserking, is really not that great. It's a flat 10% attack speed boost for X seconds, and increases the lower your health. As a hunter, you shouldn't be getting hit in the first place. They do have a Bow Specialization which is beneficial, but that restricts you pretty good for weapon type.  Tauren's don't have anything really great for hunters.  Blood Elves don't have great racials for hunters... and don't be a statistic >_>    If you're going Alliance, however, I'd say dwarves are probably best, as they get a nice bonus to guns. Draenei get a 1% hit chance bonus (more of your attacks hit) and Night Elves get...... nothing really beneficial for hunters to be honest.    Realm, does not matter much.  If you have friends that play WoW, ask them what realm they are playing on, and what faction. When you roll your character and start leveling, ask them for character names so that you can chat with them as you level and they may be nice enough to run you through a few dungeons.  If your friends are too cool to play WoW, then pick a server at random, it really should not matter.|`|DdRT7FqTaa	Troll for the increased attack speed (Not sure if they can have hunters though) or an Orc for the bonus pet damage and berserk for extra ranged damage.    The Realm doesn't really matter but everyone in the hardcore RP realms are REALLY uptight.

An Xbox 360 with 20gig HDD, a wired controller and some ok games.    You will get about $50-$80 off the price of a PS3. I know because I was told how much I could trade a 360 for when I bought it and mine was with a 60 gig HDD and wireless controller plus most of the other stuff. I was told about $40 so saying you would get $50-$80 off was optimistic.    Seriously dude, you are better of not doing it and buying s PS3 without trading it in.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	probably make out better on ebay, you're going to get raped silly at ebgames or gamestop.

9ECwMzZXaa	A Planeswalker is a relatively new type of card. The card is in its own special category, called the 'Planeswalker' (just like artifacts, creatures, instant).    To play a Planeswalker, you have to pay the mana cost and play as sorcery, just like creatures.    Planewalkers have 3 abilities, some give you 'loyalty' others cost loyalty. Loyalty is the number at the bottom right corner. For instance, when you play the Planswalker 'Liliana Vess', you start with 5 loyalty.    You can play one of the Planeswalker's abilities anytime you can play a sorcery. You can only play the ability once a turn. Abilities can give you loyalty can increase your loyalty, abilities that cost you loyalty will reduce the loyalty of the Planswalker. You can't play an ability if the cost is higher than the loyalty you have.    Planewalker's are not creatures. They cannot attack or block, but they can 'get' attacked. During the combat phase, your opponent may choose each creature to either attack you or the Planeswalker, and you then block with your creatures as you wish. If the Planewalker gets attacked and is not blocked, damage is dealt on the loyalty just like a person's life points (one loyalty lost for each damage done). If the loyalty to the Planeswalker reaches 0, the card goes to the graveyard.    If thats not very clear, it took me a long time to get the rules too. Just slowly read the rules fomr the official Magic the Gathering website:

cLW7vFUGaa	Sorry, Maya only sells things at the Spring and Summer Flea Markets. The sellers switch halfway through the year. You'd have to wait until next year to buy from her again.    But hey, if you need a Grilled Yam and you're in Fall, you can get one yourself: yams are in season right now. If the Souffle Ranch is at a high status (check the star level on the sign outside - you need 3 stars), you can actually just buy a Perfect Yam right then and there, and grill it with a Match Set (purchased at the General Store) on the beach. If the farm's rank isn't high enough to sell the crop itself, though, buy a Yam Seed pouch from the same place and plant it. When you harvest one, don't ship it; instead, again, grill it on the bonfires along the beach.    The only problem is that, since you're already so far into Fall, if you're soil's not of the highest quality from Fertilizer, the yams probably won't be ready to be harvested in time for the end of the season... And I'm not sure whether crops disappear or wither in this game once their season ends. But anyway, it's worth a try.    Best of luck.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	She only sells Grilled Yams at the Spring and Summer flea markets. Have you looked at Souffle Farms though? I think they sell Yams in the fall. Then just grill it.

isg9i7Z4aa	the paper money please dont wash it...it gets wet and tears of soon...the coins u can wash it by puttin it in vinegar..it shines after that...i read it long bac in a magazine|`|5Vot9j8waa	You can rub the copper pennies with ketchup, my kids loved to do this....|`|tWlWWhTZaa	Dont was the paper Money  as for the for the coins, dip them in a soloution of salt and Vinegar. It takes of all the Rust!!!!|`|AE3lv4pRaa	Hi,    Pls dnt wash the paper money!  and u can wash the coins like this    1. Wash your hands with soap.  Washing up will remove the oils and tiny grit from your fingers.    2.Lay down a soft towel.  Place a soft cloth or towel, folded over a couple of times, on your working surface to catch coins you might drop, and to provide a space for them to dry.    3.Set up your soapy bath.  Fill a small plastic container with warm tap water. Do not use glass, china, or metal, as these hard surfaces can scratch your coins! Disposable food storage containers are perfect for this. Just don't store your coins in them permanently. Add a small amout of mild dish-washing detergent to the container filled with warm water. Don't overdo it - all you need is a really tiny squirt.    4. Prepare your final rinse bath.  Fill a second plastic container with distilled water, for the final rinse. Although distilled water is by far the best, you can substitute hot running tap water.    5.Clean the coin.  Pick up the first coin, and immerse it in the soapy water. Gently rub both sides of the coin between your fingers, paying attention to any stickiness or gunk. Rub gunk near the edges away from the center of the coin, not into it. Always work in an outward pattern. Dirt and gunk near the edges should simply be made to go over the side with your thumb, not all the way across the coin. Don't put all of your coins in the water at once! Do them one at a time, to avoid their coming in contact with each other and causing scratch marks on the surfaces.    6. Rinse the coin.  Rinse the coin under running water, gently rubbing until all soap residue is gone. Always remember, gentleness is the key! Don't rub hard, and if you feel any grit, even light grit, don't rub it into the coin because it will scratch the coin very easily. Instead, sort of agitate the coin by moving it quickly in the water to dislodge the grit, touch it gently only if needed to free it up.    Every motion you make with your fingers should be focused on not causing scratches to the coin's surface.      Thank you!|`|wVyUdJJzaa	dont wash the paper money.

Look at it this way, you can get an edge over others who wait later to buy it because you will be more familiar with it before they are.<br>  <br>  But by waiting you may learn that if there are problems that aren't fixed, you won't be wasting your money and getting frustrated.<br>  <br>  In our home, we wait a bit and see what others say before investing in a game.|`|lLLsX3Efaa	Someone's just posted the same question. I'll give you what i gave them:<br>  <br>  "I would go for it. I played the demo on XBOX Live and it rocked!!! It's basically the Starcraft version with Halo characters. The controller scheme for the game is marvelous as it's very smooth and works very well together. You can play solo missions with objectives or go online and battle with friends. Awesome game all around, well worth the $60 you'd be putting up for it. If you are still unsure I would suggest that you go download the demo off of XBOX Live, It's free but take about 15 minuets to download."

I'm sure you're familiar with it.<br>  <br>  Bowls - <br>  Needed: Paper, Pens/Pencils, A bowl or hat, and a timer.<br>  Combination of charades and catchphrase and a lot of fun. Give each person a piece of paper, maybe the size of a post-it note, have each person write 5 things on the paper, and place them in a bowl. Could be anything - strawberry cheesecake, George Washington, seven and a half, the more random the better - just something that most of the group would know what it is. Assign every person a partner, and have them sit in a circle with their partner across from them. The game starts - one person draws a card and has 30 seconds to get their partner to say, in order, the five things on the card without using any of those words - just like catchphrase. 30 seconds seems really short at first, but it's really a memory game because once you catch on, you can just whiz right through a whole card! If they get all five, they keep the card and draw another until the time is up. When all the cards are gone, Round 1 is over. In the second round, you still have 30 seconds, but are limited to only three words per item on the card... the way I play, we count "uhm" and "uhh..." each as words but you can decide for yourselves. Round 3 is essentially charades - no words can be used, only actions and your memory of the cards from before. Sounds complicated but it's an absolute blast for me and all of my friends.<br>  <br>  Wow, long explanation. Another one I like is called Bang - fast paced and fun. Spread out and stand in a circle, with one person as the shooter in the middle. Everyone has their two guns (their pointed fingers) holstered at their hips and ready to fire. The person in the middle casually looks around, and then suddenly points at someone and shouts "Bang!" and that person has to duck the shot. If they don't crouch to the ground, they're dead and out of the game. But if the person does duck, then the people on either side of them have a duel over their head - the first one of the two to point at the other and shout "Bang!" wins the duel and their opponent is out. Repeat until there are only two people left - then place them back-to-back, Old West style, and the shooter from the middle will tell them to "Walk!" They can walk for as long as the shooter wants, until he yells "Fire!" and the first person to get a shot off at the other by yelling "Bang!" wins the game. Fun to play over and over again!<br>  <br>  If you need more group games, I've got a few more that my friends and I use to keep occupied here at college... but those are some of my faves.<br>  <br>  Movies, I'd recommend something Disney/Pixar recently put out - Shrek 3, Kung Fu Panda, etc. Funny, light, and not just for little kids, although a bunch of tough-guy high schoolers might think differently.

AA12108691	While they both have great qualities, (I have owned both of them. So don't call me a fan boy!) the Xbox is what remains in my entertainment center. The PS3 was quiet, there were great graphics, and of course the Blu-Ray player, but the lack of good games and lack of exclusives drove me towards my Xbox. The Xbox 360 has an extensive library of games and great exclusives (Gears of War, GOW2, Halo). Online play for the PS3 was free, but Xbox Live is only $50 a year (get 13 months for $50 if you buy the card at Wal-Mart!) and infinitely better than PS3 network. Also, the controller for the Xbox is more comfortable to fitting the average size hand. The PS3 controller is too small and almost always ran out of batteries very quickly. And if you like getting into spec details, the PS3 may have 7 or 8 core processors which you think makes it better, but only uses 2 for that "great" Blu-Ray player and good graphics. Why pay for the extra 5 processors? This is why I prefer the Xbox. You can get it for as low as $199! Why not?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: The Xbox Elite (for me and my friends) hasn't broken down ONCE. It has worked flawlessly since Christmas of 2007. Also, the PS3 is a bulkier, bigger system.|`|Tb91H3D9aa	I will go with the PS3.  As far as I have seen, Microsoft has simply stopped caring about its customers and continues to deliver the 360 with substandard hardware.  My brother is currently on his fourth 360 because they simply keep breaking down (and he does take care of them, in case you were curious), and the customer service is terrible: from sending him the wrong replacement parts to nearly losing his equipment, they have pretty much gone down as being the worst customer service I have ever seen.<br>  <br>  As mentioned by someone else, the PS3 has the 360 beat on graphics, and it also supports Blu-Ray format (which is kind of like getting a Blu-Ray player for free at a time when a separate Blu-Ray player can run you up almost as much as the PS3 itself).<br>  <br>  Someone mentioned there is no selection for the PS3, which is not true: the selection might be slightly more limited than that of the 360 but only because it's a newer product.  Most games nowadays are being pushed for both systems.  Those that aren't really won't haunt you for the rest of your life.  360-exclusive titles are constantly being challenged by PS3-exclusive titles.<br>  <br>  Playing online is free, which means you won't have to spend your time hunting down free trial keys or actually dumping money you shouldn't be on a subscription.<br>  <br>  If all this isn't enough to convince you, then I will close with one more thing: LittleBigPlanet.  Whether you're into hardcore FPS, racing games, or just out there for fun, you can't not love this game.  It's the first one I bought for my PS3.  25 games later, it's still one I play constantly.|`|lLLsX3Efaa	I'm a strong proponent of the Xbox 360. Always have been always will be. It's got very good graphics (just slightly less than the PS3 the PS3 wins in the graphics category) and the system runs very well (though it's a bit loud from the fan). I recently bought a PS3 myself and there are like NO games out there for it. the Xbox wins in a landslide in that category. The benefit of the PS3 is the Blu-ray player. if you want a system to watch movies on then go for the PS3 but if you want a game system to play games on (like god intended) then pick up the Xbox360 (the plus side is they're going for very low prices now-a-days about 199 base price i think) One more plus for the PS3 is the free-online play, the Xbox requires a subscription (eiter through prepaid cards or an automatic renewal from the internet). the free online paly is sweet but the quality of the online gameplay and social networking of the Xbox Live system is by far better than that of the Playstation Network.<br>  <br>  if you wanna hear me rant more about it then hit me up on AIM (B3T4W11) or just email me. I've done countless in-depth comparisons and have debated both sides before with my former co-workers at GameStop.|`|CoiSYXR9aa	My 360 is gonna break... It has awesome games, but the fact of being very unriliable is making me wanna sell it (before it breaks) and buy a PS3.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it depends if you had an original Xbox, get a 360. If you had a PS2, get a PS3. Yes, I know that is a dull answer, but I should have listened to my friend when he told me that...|`|1qi6lQfIaa	ps3 because its blue ray and has free online play and free internet, compared to the xbox 360 where you need to pay for internet... how sad|`|WsI2yLCWaa	ps3 is better get what u pay for.|`|b0DXZiwCaa	i think xbox 360. its online services are more efficient then the ps3 and it can play all the cool games for some reason. Just don't get xbox elite cause it heats up and it will soon die out.

Peace!|`|CkDNruLgaa	idk|`|nJCzYIt0aa	no its cooler|`|Z10yThEOaa	not really because you can use the wii balance board thing and the remote and it is a totally different experience then just flicking the analog stick.  and i think the stories are slightly different.|`|nIXWWEQOaa	mm.. its not AS good but is still GREAT!! I loved it!!|`|TOH0uKxXaa	You would think using that it would be cooler with the balance board and everything, but it is hella hard to use it. I think it is better for the other systems.

anCfH4riaa	Rock Band and Rock Band 2 are different games which require the same instruments: 2 guitar controllers, 1 drum controller, and 1 normal controller with a microphone. The core game play in each is similar, hit notes to score points etc. But Rock Band 2 has more modes - tour challenges, online world tour, single player world tour, battle of the bands leaderboards, of which none of these are on Rock Band. Rock Band 2 also has 84 songs (+20 more if you buy it new for X360 or PS3) while Rock Band only has 58. Each disc can export songs onto the hard drive so you can use it with the other game.    To answer your question in brief:  The difference is just the game disc, with SLIGHT differences in the instruments. You can use the Rock Band instruments with Rock Band 2 and vice versa.    In my opinion Rock Band 2 is the better game.|`|wrhRjwKaaa	The second one has a little bit better instruments, the drums were a little defective with the first game, but they're still the same instruments, they just have a different paint job on the guitar and better quality. and a cool thing you can do with  2 is rent  1, and then transfer the songs over to the second game for an additional $5, but with 1 you can only play the ones off the store and on the disk, but  2 can play both disc one(with the track purchase) and all the songs from the store. I would recommend 2, it also has better features on the game|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	there's not really much of a difference except for the songs if you wondering about the instruments the rock band 1 instruments are compatible with rock band 2 and vise versa but i would recommend getting the second one|`|Lppal9NXaa	the main difference is that there are different songs.|`|MwrRCxKGaa	Depends if you are getting a kit or not,Rock band 1 Has crapper instruments Rock Band 2 Has a Steel plated bass pedal And the drum is wireless and so is the guitar. so the main difference is Just track list and slightly better instruments.|`|enk57uOEaa	Rockband 1 is a lil old. but it has great music..you can  play on line with friends and all..     Rockband 2 is a lil better.. it just has more music..and is new music.. when you create a person you can have more options on like more clothes and more cool instruments..you have a drum trainer too it helps you on the drums so you can be better..and it has free mode so you can play with the drums and put your own music so you can go with the beat of the music..it has battle of the bands when you play online.and when you play career it has really cool parts like go to places and make your band better.. so you can have more fans..    Get the instruments from rockband 2 is better and faster.and the drums are not loud and dont brake easily.    Hope it works.!|`|MMXdTHziaa	Rock Band2 has a 2 after the last letter of the word Band.|`|mcb52dmIaa	its just the game that is different, u can use all of the old instruments on rock band 2. and rock band 2 has more and better songs and better graphics n everything a newer game should have :]|`|H1g4A0M6aa	Instruments are the same, songs and features differ.

N47xUTqtaa	there is a video on youtube that you cal make a rapid fire Controller for x box 360 what you do is open your Controller and it shows you how to connect the wires so the Controller is rapid fire. fore example the br on halo in stead of 4 shots then break then 4 shots then break so on so on its rapid fire be careful for moderators on halo and cod because you can get booted but i do it some times ( it does work and it works very good) ill try and find the link and cmnt later but in stead you can trigger walk on the Controller get a piece of hard plastic maby from a plastic box and tape it onto the rb button so its longer and easier to trigger walk.    rate best !|`|6hqmRRzHaa	i would just say skip the trip to the store and order one online.

Otherwise walmart or eBay: buy it now.|`|JXaq4uqBaa	gamespot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is like 30 bucks new and 20 used|`|hHOgmgBKaa	I got mine from Best Buy for I think 40 dollars. This game is for some reason usually on sale here. But I actually didn't get it at best buy, because the closest one too me is about 30 miles away. So if your are as unfortunate as I am you could do what I did, and take the Best Buy add from the Sunday newspaper to Walmart. They will match the price in the add. I also haven't seen it for that as cheap as everyone else is saying from Gamestop, but maybe it is so I would also check there before doing what I said. I would also warn you not to buy it from ebay, or any website that you've never heard of. Just because they sell the game for cheap dosen't mean that they will either send it to you or it even be the game you ordered. You always have to watch out for that stuff. Hope this helped you out bud.
myj319upaa	you should uninstall and reinstall it (your families will be deleted)|`|AA10010715	It means you have to connect to the internet so SecureRom can verify that your game is a legally purchased game.

0DrTOVDiaa	Itachi, sin da piccolo,  stato un giovane dal talento incredibile, secondo solo, per sua stessa affermazione, alla potenza di Madara Uchiha. All'accademia aveva sempre il massimo dei voti in qualunque disciplina: egli, infatti, si diplom all'et di sette anni, nell'arco di un solo anno. Alla stessa et  probabile che abbia appreso anche l'Arte del Fuoco (Katon) e, da quel che si capisce dalle affermazioni di suo padre Fugaku, riusc ad utilizzare la Palla di Fuoco Suprema al primo tentativo. All'et di soli 8 anni attiv e impar ad usare lo Sharingan, a 10 anni divenne Chunin e, dopo essere diventato Jonin all'et di 13 anni, entr nella squadra ANBU, diventandone presto il capitano. Alcuni anni dopo, uccise il suo migliore amico Shisui Uchiha per ottenere lo Sharingan Ipnotico (Mangekyou Sharingan) e, successivamente, stermin il suo stesso clan ad eccezione del fratello Sasuke.    La grande abilit di Itachi  estesa in ogni ramo del combattimento: sia nel Ninjutsu che nel Taijutsu  tra i migliori ninja del manga, mentre nel Genjutsu , indubbiamente, il personaggio pi potente visto finora; la forza delle sue tecniche illusorie ha dell'incredibile, soprattutto lo Tsukyomi, il Genjutsu dello Sharingan Ipnotico. I suoi occhi, inoltre, gli permettono di sconfiggere persino i potenti Genjutsu di Orochimaru. I pochi che sono in grado di contrastare la sua abilit nelle arti illusorie sono i possessori di uno Sharingan enormemente sviluppato. Itachi  capace di lanciare Genjutsu potenti persino con un solo dito. In quanto al Taijutsu, Itachi  anche qui abilissimo: la sua rapidit  eguagliabile da pochissimi personaggi, la precisione e l'utilizzo nelle armi come shuriken e kunai sono magistrali sin da quando era un ragazzino. Un'altra spiccata dote di Itachi  la sua velocit nel formare i sigilli, persino Kakashi, con il suo Sharingan, non  riuscito a seguirne i movimenti. Itachi, per, ha un punto debole: la resistenza, ci  dovuto probabilmente al prolungato uso dello Sharingan Ipnotico e alla misteriosa malattia della quale era malato da tempo. Sta di fatto che ha battuto Sasuke da malato, dopo aver rinunciato ad una parte dei suoi poteri e trattenendosi, per non parlare di quando ha attivato Susanoo, arma che (come affermato da Zetsu) ne rende inbattibile l'utilizzatore (annienta prima la tecnica dell'idra poi Orochimaru in pochi secondi).|`|F8ozIzMnaa	ahah, i remember that game. i used to play it, it was really fun, then i realized it takes up WAYYY too much time to do stuff.  but you have fun.

It is used to apply cheat codes to alter a game, usually by giving the player extreme advantages not normally obtainable. While earlier versions of the software forced users to input codes manually via the DS itself, versions 1.52 and later allows users to enter codes through a PC application, which are copied to the software via USB.     In addition to functioning as a cheat device, with recent firmware versions, Action Replay DS can be used as a NoPass device by holding Select when powering on the system. However, this feature is not officially documented. It was added in version 1.02.    Action Replay DS is sold in stores all around the world with a suggested retail price of $24.99 USD[citation needed], but at "big box" stores like Target and Wal-Mart, the price is often reduced to $19.99. In Australia, it is $49.99 AUD. In Britain, it is 14.99!    Believe it!!!!!!!!!!!    ND if u r a pokemon fan please add me to ur contacts! thanks

9VxZHVUmaa	This is not a difficult question and this is something i've done several times before. Here's how it goes....    1) Both of you must have an account on Yahoo (as you clearly do). If your friend doesn't he can quickly signup from the yahoo website.    2) It's best if you are able to communicate with your friend when you are about to play.    3) At the agreed time, both of you sign into Yahoo chess and decide on a common room.    4) After entering the room, one of you open a table (setting whichever parameters you guys wish) and invite the other to play (or the other may simply join the table).    5) This is the most difficult part!!! Here you simply play chess and enjoy yourselves.     May the best man (or woman) win!

KUcM5UDKaa	Not all sellers charge that much for shipping, and many ship for free. When you're dealing with New game consoles, though, they have a solid value that people tend to sell it for. If you want to buy a console new, you're lucky to save any more than 10-20 bucks.<br>  <br>  Sellers tend not to sell game consoles at lower prices because the demand for them is pretty consistent. Why lower the price when you know it will sell at market value?<br>  <br>  If you really want to save money, you have to buy it used.|`|I4V4q2FEaa	its all the shipping... that is the only way that i see people making a profit off of selling people items on ebay. like i saw a neon sign that was like buy it now for $1 and the shipping was $39 its ridiculous.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	If you look, lots of retailers offer free shipping if you do the slowest. For example, Newegg.com offeres great deals and free supersaver shipping, which is something like UPS or FedEx ground which may take 3-7 days to get to you...<br>  <br>  Also, if you happen to buy more than one thing, say the 360 and several games, overall with shipping factored in, it could be less than what you pay for the same "bundle" from a retail store.
hUEqsYMbaa	La Tale is a nice cutesy game, I played it for a bit, took me 1 week to get to level 40, (that's at less then 3 hours a day)! It highly depends on if you decide to do quests, grind, playtime. But its really fun just to play. :)
EzPYcgQgaa	go to iwin.com    download supple  or miss management or miss popularity .|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	the sims runs flawlessly on my mac!    and laggy and slow on my pc
cLW7vFUGaa	Flea Markets take place in the Town Square on the 22nd of every season.    The Grilled Yam is sold by Maya, who has a booth at the Spring and Summer Flea Markets only. You have to meet Maya beforehand - in a cutscene in the Town Square - in order to see her at the Flea Market.    If you've already passed spring and summer, another way to get a Grilled Yam is to grow yams in fall, harvest one (quality doesn't matter), and use a Match Set (available at the General Store) to grill it on the bonfires found on beaches.    Good luck!|`|AA12370643	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moo...  Somthing here mabey?
8eXOGwLUaa	Only the Andy Murray part wont count - the rest of the bet still goes ahead - Good luck
dRQDKz6baa	Ocarina of time no doubt|`|1O6bbqplaa	the original. But if I had to pick a second one, it would be windwaker or twilight princess.|`|BpXbNjEpaa	I think Windwaker is the best.|`|HobZedDnaa	I would say ocarina of time then Twilight Princess as a close second.|`|CPBstHUiaa	either orcarina of time or twilight princess|`|dvlNp56yaa	well majoras mask is my fave
jqbC4tlpaa	Mine is SCRABBLE too! Unfortunately I can't find much good competition anymore :(|`|vahn499Raa	UNO|`|gSwobfujaa	when i was younger i LOVED playing clue. loved it!  i dont really have a favorite one now. i like backgammon i guess. i hate checkers and dont know how to play chess. ive never played monopoly bc it looks confusing. and that just about sums it up. i do however love cards.|`|VYXh8bRhaa	Well I don'y play board games much but from the ones I did play it would probably  be: Sorry, otherwise Monopoly or Ludo [I think that's how you spell it]. Oh, and I like Chess!|`|AA11656886	Risk but it takes a while|`|h1mG6eI4aa	chess|`|iIYyct24aa	backgammon easily.  It goes fast, anyone can learn (it's harder to be a good player), and you can play for fun or bet (either money or for chores)|`|VFnQsri4aa	i love snakes and laddar.. its fun.. and exciting and full of suspense. theres no way u can get bored in dat game|`|qAiNHpUzaa	Chess<br>  Sorry<br>  Scrabble|`|571QpSNhaa	UNO!|`|1qi6lQfIaa	connect four... anyday|`|kQDWVRvzaa	I like chess.

UVUYG5jaaa	technically, it's hodge-podge. it means mish-mash|`|nocxxts9aa	thats so weird. i say it all the time
ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	www.taliastarot.com is pretty good, readings start at $10 (there are pricier ones depending what you buy.) It's all done by email so you can get them done from anyplace.|`|O5KOwhovaa	You won't find any answers in tarot card readings.<br>  <br>  Tarot is baseless and you'd be a fool to actually pay someone to draw a few cards randomly.
TXPJHBPraa	i would go with resistance 2|`|h1kiAVhWaa	depends. if u like shooters get resitance and vice versa
HTZMJOSXaa	Each character has "warm up" period where they will not accept gifts from you.  You have to talk to him for a few days, with out attempting to give him gifts.  Giving a gift will reset this time period.  You have to go through the waiting period again when you ignore characters for a long time. <br>  Once you can give Mark gifts, he will like anything you give him, including weeds and other trash.  This will add the same amount of friendship points as any other gifts, so I recommend giving him worthless items.  I always feel bad though.|`|BpXbNjEpaa	Gifts add a very small amount of points to Mark's affection since he'll accept literally ANYTHING (weeds, etc.)  You'll want to just invite him to the festivals you can and talk to him daily.  <br>  <br>  If you litter, that could cause his affection to drop, but I can't think of what would stop them from accepting gifts? It might be a glitch.  Harvest Moon isn't the most reliable when it comes to being glitch free.
I2iNfYCyaa	YAHOO!!!|`|RndmS49Yaa	First off puppies and kitties world .com isnt a website address I tried it and it wouldnt go but www.clubpenguin.com is a really good website for kids... you get to chat with kids around the world (that speak english of course) and it doesnt let you curse or anything.

vGu6bcR9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  XBox live costs $50 a year if you buy the 12 month card. You can buy lesser amounts (1 month and 3 month) but they come out to more per month than the $50 12 month card.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  OH!! So If I connect to my modem, I won't need to buy it? Or do I have to connect and buy it? TY TY TY!<br>  <br>  <br>  You have to connect AND buy the membership card.<br>  <br>  S.I. thanks, how much is it? Monthly? Or, do I pay once and get it all?<br>  <br>  XBox live costs $50 a year if you buy the 12 month card. You can buy lesser amounts (1 month and 3 month) but they come out to more per month than the $50 12 month card<br>  <br>  You can get the card at any chain or video game store. For the time on the card (1, 3, or 12 months) you can play online as much as you want. Once the card expires you have to buy another.|`|KUcM5UDKaa	yes. you will need to either connect directly to your modem/router, or wirelessly with a wireless network adapter. and xbox live costs $50/year. You can buy subsription cards in stores for 1 month, 3 months, or a year.<br>  <br>  hopefully you will find people online in Halo 2, not many original xbox players left, i'm afraid. good luck!|`|CoiSYXR9aa	Yes. I know, it sucks... MS should at least allow free multiplayer for their last gen games.
