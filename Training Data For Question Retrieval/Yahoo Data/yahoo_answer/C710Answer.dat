Dh5CUjmkaa	It is natural for Moms to keep all of their kids stuff when they were little. Boxing them and storing them sounds like the best idea for now. My Mom kept tons of my stuff and my kids use it now. So if you have the intentions of having kids someday, you might want to keep it, just not in your room. I do understand what you are going through, that is why I am only selectively keep my kids stuff and most of my stuff goes to a local charity that has a second hand store. I am not going to pass the pack rat curse on to my kids.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Ask that you give some stuff like stuffed animals and old clothes to a shelter so they can go to kids who need it. Get your dad to help you convince her if he is around.|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	omg...i know what you mean...my room    filled with princess stuff    flowers on the walls    eeww!    it looks like a little girls room and i'm sixteen...but i guess i gotta put up with it since i share my room with my 8 yr old sister )=|`|cUfOnldzaa	Put it all into a box and ask her to hang on to it for you.  Ask her to help you shop for new things.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Box the stuff up and either give it to the local homeless shelter or find a friends with younger sisters that would love this stuff... get rid of it the best way you can.  Check with your local assistance ministries.  A lot of big shopping centers have these receptacles for donating clothing and shoes. See if you can haul some stuff to one of these.|`|VczgQUETaa	Ask you mom to get some storage containers and put those particular things away.  If you completely throw them away and get rid of them you'll regret it in a few years even though you may think you won't.  You could donate some things to the Salvation Army/Goodwill.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	I so understand where your ma is coming from. It's like my baby is growing up and you are. It's time to pass them on to someone else. Tell her there are lots of children who could enjoy what you have. Give them away freely. Have fun redecorating and share some thoughts with your mom too. It really is painful for moms to go through these changes in their children.  You are growing up and becoming a young adult. Welcome!|`|x2YuF1pxaa	tell her to store it up for you-honestly, keeping that stuff is good. it'll be neat to look through it when you're older and if you have kids, they can play with your old toys.|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Just say that ur wayy to old to have this stuff and that you bet someone younger would be happy to have it. Then you take it to goodwill or give it to purple heart always works if your doing it for a good cause!Lol but it should work.Hope I helped!|`|oqNnElGEaa	I'm 13 too so I know how you feel,     what I did is start storing stuff away slowly, your mom will notice that stuff is missing so she might take you to go shopping for new stuff.   Than while you're shopping for those stuff pick up some new replacements to your little kid stuff! (I know I say stuff alot :))    I stored my kiddie things in my older sisters room! My mom found out and she finally understood that it was important to me!     So we agreed to a deal for every 1 kiddie thing I have in my room I replace 5 other things with new better stuff.    Its a little wierd and long but I hope this helps!
zLsA6IAPaa	omg, i am EXACTLY the same as you..its pretty hard ay.    i find that no matter how many ppl say 'put yourself out there', i just cant bring myself to do it so im not going to tell to do that ok? :D    but...i find that if you just say hi to someone, then most times they will say hi whats up or w/e back then u can answer and pretty soon a conversation starts :D it is hard sometimes and i get that, but u can also watch other ppl and copy what they say to ppl, i find that that works too, but basically u have find u a way that siuts u cos everyone is different, i hope this helped because it helped for me :D good luck! go make some friends :D:D|`|PNLwOIOraa	I had the same problem, I just hurry up and talk to people before I give my self a chance to think about it and it works sometimes. Other times I just talk to people I know and people they know and go from there. It sucks. :\|`|x2YuF1pxaa	i have the same problem.  Practise! Put yourself in situations where you have to approach people. Your shyness will never go away but you can learn to control the physical/emotional manifestations of your shyness.|`|DU92j3H0aa	i have the same problem|`|glynFK9haa	I'm exactly the same!  I really hate it!  The main thing is to just force yourself.|`|Nngdk0izaa	I'm the same; when it comes to group work or discussions, I hardly ever join in unless they ask, "What do you think?" It's driving me crazy, but I'm finding some ways to start to open up. My advice to you: don't let what others think about you stop how you act. I always make the same mistake to get offended when I say hi to someone and they don't say hi back. But if you keep saying hi to them, maybe they'll respond [because it could probably mean they didn't hear you the first time].     I know it's going to be difficult and hard once you start, but you want to finish what you begun, right? First, set a positive attitude. Don't worry if people notice; change is normal for everyone whether they're quiet or talkative. Start topics like what your favorite band is (don't join in if they're talking about scuttlebutt AKA gossip and rumors!) or that you really liked what the teacher said about your project. If your friends just roll their eyes and say, "Whatever," find someone who will appreciate what you have to say.   Like I said, it may be tough at first but be confident and it'll all work out even if you think it won't! I've still got to accept confidence's invitation to ride her car down the journey of life, but in the end I know I'll accept.|`|WbKu0t5taa	same problem girl i feel for you!!|`|nyeUUojFaa	im the same i hate it!!!!! i dunno what to do it drives me insane and i feel so bad coz people think imrude or seomthing i hate it so much!
ZeFyWGOCaa	You don't need to spend the next year and a half of your life planning an event that will last a half a day. Settle down, consider the number of marriages that end within 18 months, and concentrate on living your life for at least the coming year. A wedding occasion should not occupy so much of your life.|`|DqetlSB6aa	First, Id tell you to buy at least 3 wedding magazines at your local grocery store or where ever.    marthastewartsweddings.com    in the back of the winter 2009 issue- the one with the cake w/ butterflies on it - theres an insert that says BridalResourcess.  It will have a lot of info    Also theknot.com  target- http://www.target.com/registry/wedding/f...  off beat bride http://offbeatbride.com/|`|77YJU6IYaa	www.theknot.com|`|5LT6LRUZaa	Well I am a wedding/event planner and I always recommend that you start with your basics...decide your colors have a back up plan in case this does not work...and visit sites such as theknot.com brides.com weddings.com    you can always go to sites such as Davidsbridal.com to search for trends in styles for attendants...there are many links on all of these sites that can lead you to favor ideas, decor, invitations etc etc    but start with your basics...I take it you have your dress?  remember to design your wedding around your dress, choose accents that compliment your dress, it's style and design, if you have a simple dress, keep your decor simple and clean, a more formal gown?  then bump up the formality of your ceremony and reception a notch or two...another good source for tuxes is the menswarehouse.com  they really do have a great selection of the latest tuxedo styles usually always in stock.    make a list of each detail from the bridesmaids down to matchbooks (ex)  and start looking online for ideas give yourself 3 ideas for each detail...any of these three will make you happy...then look at your choices compared to your budget and other details you decide on...that way if something clashes you have two back ups that you can use...I haven't done a wedding in a while..lol..mainly because of the occasional bridezilla and worse yet, her mother...lol....but I do enjoy planning weddings..I'm just saving my next planning to be my own and am exclusively doing fund raisers and reunions right nowm just keep in mind you can have an elegant wedding with simplicity and you don't have to pull your hair out over every single detail...always designate certain tasks to people that you trust and yes...literally have meetings on the progress of one detail or the next...it's very helpful for keeping you and everyone on the same page!    Congratulations and ENJOY your day!|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	Decide upon the "look" you are trying to acheive and cut out some pictures and put it in a little journal. Check Ebay first. You can save tons of money. I bought my husbands tux and shoes for less than what it would have cost to rent them!
T3b4I4kXaa	So basically, she bought a car and now has that loan and your car in her name. What guarantee do you have that she will transfer the title to your name? You can choose to call her on her control-freak behavior or just put up with her crap.     If you call her on it, just tell her to get rid of the car... it isn't worth putting up with her crap. The insurance will cost her, the plates will cost her, and the inspection will cost her, and if it doesn't get driven often enough, the gas will turn to gunk. Title transfers cost some money, too. Either she wants you to get moving with your life, or she doesn't.    $1,000 isn't much at all... you can come up with that. Look... the big grocery stores run 3 shifts... you can juggle a part-time job while in college. You can pay that $1,000 off in a couple of months. You've got spring break coming up in a couple of months... work more while between semesters.    Get a checking account so you can write her checks for the car payments. The canceled checks will be your back-up. Collect any statements.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Really, you shouldn't be buying anything until you have the money. This is not a good way to begin your financial life, honestly. The biggest problem we have today is credit card debts and loans to people who can't afford to pay this money back. If you want anything in life, you will need to earn it for yourself. This is the only way to financial freedom and 0 stress! There will always be conditions on loans, be it from mom or a bank! Choose your path carefully because this is a very good lesson.|`|inIjc9Eiaa	Sounds like your mother is a control freak. I would tell her to forget it. It's not worth the hassle. If you take a while to pay it back you will never hear the end of it. I've even seen money loans rip relationships apart.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Forget the loan if she is going to act that way. Save up the money yourself and find another car. Don't put yourself at her mercy because you will be miserable.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You don't. This is a perfect lesson in "never mix money with family". Get it paid off super fast and never, ever do it again!
vbznVd6qaa	Her parents will NEVER accept you  we Armenians usually date only Armenians  just leave her alone  before its too late|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Just be yourself. Maybe she's nervous too.|`|lcc7SZAdaa	try to talk to her more often =]|`|k42OcjGLaa	Anything can happen. Gather up some backbone and go up to her. have a conversation|`|PPn9nqpxaa	be yourself. it is really all you can be, and if she doesn't accept you for that, she's not worth it... good luck!|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	She knows you like her and she is trying to politely discourage you.|`|advg14adaa	sure. the fake smile thing- when we see a guy we like and dont know how to react we do a weird fake smile cuase we're nervous|`|cg3iycH8aa	shes not interested.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	she wants you to make the next move. that's house us girls are :D|`|7lkclHF0aa	Flirt sweetie!!!! Complement her and pay attition to her find out what she likes ask her stuff about her self belive me I'm a girl and I love that kinda attiontion|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	leave her alone.. you lost your chance...you only get one time to make a first impression..Women don't like men they can intimidate|`|SoFeInwKaa	She probably just dosen't know what to say.  Ask her to hang out, as friends then take it from there.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	sure why not|`|1GxMGmkqaa	maybe she nervous too? make a point of walking her way again so you can catch up for more convo and get to know each other and take awy the nerves!|`|BhFY6gdxaa	i asked my armenian friend. and he said fake smilies is armenian for i dont like you. get to know her more and treat her like a princess but at the same time dont let her walk all over you
X88lyKHoaa	ah. Thats seriously gotta suck.  I feel so bad for you :(  I would ask her why she doesn't like you.  and TRY to talk to her.  or most likely i would have one of my other friends ask her for me.  ah good luck(:|`|3lPL6pVBaa	What's so amazing is that everybody wants to be liked.  And nobody wants to be disliked (even the most self-confident people in the world).      So you're not alone, in that regard.      I think you're worrying too much about this one, though.     You and she were talking and laughing and having a good time.  There's nothing better!      Everyone in high school is anxious about "looking cool" for some reason, so probably she just had a moment of feeling very self-conscious.  But that's something she did wrong, not anything you did wrong.      I would say: give her 24 hours to calm down and she'll completely forget all about it.      Being a teenager is just an incredibly emotional time.  Your feelings are all over the place . . . but remember that so are everybody else's.      The truth is that the judgment of high school students sometimes isn't very good.  Sometimes you find that people who were popular in high school turn out to be awful as adults and people who were unpopular can turn out to be Nobel Prize-winning scientists.      So, keep your sense of humor about it all.      If they had any sense at all, the whole school would hold an election and make you their QUEEN!      lol
DcVoq5Tuaa	when the kids are out of the house for the day|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Late|`|vSJIorF7aa	WRONG SECTION!!!!|`|hWuS3AlLaa	You are waiting for the Billy Goats Gruff.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	on an airplane.|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	asleep|`|MVxFOI5naa	On the computer|`|n2GzyCm2aa	When i am on vacation,and i am on vacation this week and the week is almost over.oh no!|`|DlBeFoKcaa	when you are having hot lustfull sex =)|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	time flies when am on my day off from work
MPtt9wPjaa	haha yea unless he's a real dork i dont thnk he calls just for your ringer..  thats cutee :)  he's interested  good luck with that :)|`|bf1Wsfq0aa	ya he totally likes u|`|5YEKmHqyaa	He's definately into you.  It seems like he was trying to flirt and play games with you. (flirt games--not games with your head)  He definately has an interest in you or he wouldn't have called..and once you didnt answer he would've never texted you if he didn't like you.  So i'd say yeah he likes you and sounds like you like him too..Good luck|`|SeNb5iFDaa	awww that the cutest thing ever......yeah he likes you, no doubt :]|`|uKYPmVG0aa	cute.. yes he's totally flirting. he's finding every excuse to talk to u.|`|rO0nsbs4aa	he definitely likes he says he is calling to listen to your music but that is just an excuse to talk to you.answer his calls or he will think you are not interested.or you can text non stop to get questions out of him and it will help him not feel embarrassed.this has happened to me before when a guy i liked said he dialed in the wrong number. he did it more than once so i know he was lying. it was so obvious.we text and i got to know him.he wasn't so embarrassed because he can ask anything and i got confidence i didn't expect.|`|Isl4B5rYaa	awe yeah he deff does. just take it easy though you dont really wanna rush things. good luck =]|`|sjCYYl9haa	ugh... he just likes your song... or he wants to be in a conversation with you. he tried to call you wth any time he has but you sadly don't pick it up. i think he likes you as a crush as well.|`|wmWr88Isaa	yea he likes you...prolly unsure about if u like him or not though if u missed his calls. guys are funny like that. so i guess just wait a bit then text him again...i mean of course he likes u! no guy in his right mind is really going to call u just to listen to your music =P he is flirtin for sure! gd luk!|`|IzP50gNIaa	yes it sounds like he's flirting if the guy wants to here music he'll turn on the radio play the game and good luck it sounds like you're move .

Emeralds are not great stones for everyday wear.  They are prone to chipping and cracking.  Read the links from Dollar Store - they give good advice.    Once you are married, you may wish to get an alternate 'engagement' ring for everyday wear and only wear this one part of the time.  A green garnet is also a beautiful green stone and more hardy for everyday wear.|`|MdhRRPHjaa	go to link below and find how, each website usualy teach how to take care of our jewelry
Fsu8u4aiaa	I would give him a call or email and plan something amd offer to do something, Make it sound like you'd like him to join you but if he doesn't, make it sound like its not a big deal. It shows that you are a little assertive and confident and men like confident women. If he denies it  and you want to ask again then maybe offer to do something friendly like with a group or something...     Good Luck!!!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	yeah, he probably thinks you're not interested. E-mail him.|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	More than likely yes.  He's probably waiting on you to email back with the plans.|`|8h2P3Gyyaa	maybe. you should try to talk to him and see whats going on.|`|2jkZD3e5aa	call him and say youre free and want to catch a movie or something.|`|zH80yyDQaa	He may think your avoiding him.  Give him a call or send him an email.  He tried to set up another date but you told him you were busy.|`|SsvwdhsPaa	probably. he wants to give you some space, since you said you were going to be busy. he doesnt want to come off as annoying you or something|`|NOYOgHIEaa	yeah he prob just doesnt wanna sound desperate... or he thinks UR not interested! either way you have to call him to set something up :) good luck |`|wmWr88Isaa	yea i reckon he is just unsure of the plans. like think about it he asked u out for another date...but u said u busy for the next week. some guys are wierd and kinda take it like a rejection if u arent available at every beckon and call...so just email him again sayin summin like 'so shall we organise something for next week then? how about we do 'this', what days/times are u free?' then at least he knows your interested but its not too full on...and if u get a reply then he is interested! =oD
VNX7eSYJaa	Get "balls deep" a often as you can before she moves on!  Just use protection.|`|AA10250709	If she had sex with you on the first date you know (or you should know) she is also having sex with the others.  Dream girl or not, she's whoring around which is gross.  Call your Dr., lose her number and move on.  Your genitals will thank you.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Do not allude to what she does w/o you at all. Enjoy your time with her and be comfortable and do not brood about what she does with other guys. If you ask questions or even comment on what she does with her time away from you, that may put her off and queer the whole relationship before it even gets off the ground.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	sound to me like she is easy and get around alot.i wouldnt was my time if i were you,just take it for what it is........a f*ck|`|vSJIorF7aa	Approach with protection! You need it. Who knows who she is with. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time and make a doctors appointment. If she had sex with you on the first night...well...that doesn't really speak for her character!|`|H2bpuDsKaa	Just let her tell you what she wants you to know.......|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Your setting yourself up for a great big broken heart. This girl is trouble. Find yourself a girl who is willing to commit to just you .|`|AA12272885	She is a sleaze, not  a dream girl. You are right, if she will dive into you she will do it with everyone she dates.  Sounds  like you should move on and find someone who is willing to take it  slow.|`|AA12110359	go for it !!! don't make her feel uncomfortable|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Funny, you didn't mention anything but the superficial things that you are looking for in a woman. Smart, rich, good lookin, etc. If you aren't looking for a person who is good at heart, why do you think she won't be screwing around all the time?|`|MVxFOI5naa	Best approach is to pretend you are really busy yourself with other friends and not be there like a doormat waiting for her to call and maybe even go out yourself. Don't bring anything up -she'll wonder why it doesn't bother you or act cool a bit and not needy.|`|6aVtiTKiaa	I don't know ... I think it's gross for a woman to have sex with more than one man at a time.  Heck, it's gross for anyone, male or female.  If I knew a guy was off having sex with someone else while they were seeing me, that would be the end of it.  He would need much more than one day and a shower between me and that other woman.|`|aCePLit5aa	I feel that this lady has started this with how she intends it to go on. I don't think you will get a serious relationship out of this as it does not seem she is looking for one or I doubt it would have started with her seeing multiple men??
H7Q5IBI0aa	I agree completely. Marriage was a term MADE up by the churches and needs to go back to being so. What we should do is call them civil unions and let the churches call their own members' marriages what they really are.|`|vSJIorF7aa	Because it doesnt work that way! Marriage was here before all this other crap and it isn't just going to hide behind a church or religion. Its between a man and woman. Period.|`|MVxFOI5naa	You make me laugh! I don't believe in the social structure of an organized church that only wants to take my money in the name of God. God is everywhere and he is free and unjudgemental-you should try it.
9TWdWoTwaa	Option B. The first one looks like a Squirrel. Like seriously.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	Which one are you??    The other one.  At least she isn't petty and vain, looking for cheap compliments and turning looks into a competition.    It's the stuff inside that matters more than the outside.  What you have asked is equivalent to, "Which one would you rather have sex with, without ever getting to know."    That's why the other one is "hotter" to me - she'd be more interesting to me because she's not hung up on looks and popularity.  Yeah, it's brutal, but truthful.|`|COmp4sIuaa	A - I don't like the face on b, sorry.|`|GQb8llTlaa	choice A|`|vvxKhHIJaa	u guys look nice  so, noone's ugly!!|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	option b. nice smile and good personality. i think option a girl is way too young.|`|m4geUBLTaa	option B, option A looked kinda fake, i like option B better shes prettier and her makeup looks nice|`|9nMOFOoQaa	Both pretty cute, but im gonna go with B    Better smile and eyes... oh and, Never mind|`|PNLwOIOraa	you both look similar and equally unattractive, to me anyways.|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	I choose option A, because she is hotter|`|jxseTHg7aa	its a trick question and im going with c. jesus|`|fe73ce81dfcc877ddc8594063a1d9ba1aa	FACE OF "A" AND BODY OF "B" !!!.....|`|v4YswWpJaa	definitly B|`|UtTv0we8aa	Option B, She just looks better I guess.

7e8NN8saaa	I told a friend that her husband was abusive - he calls her names and treats her like a child and tries to control everything she does - any way - she got very nasty with me and that was the end of that.     We spoke about a year ago briefly - but it's never been the same.|`|Y08YLysXaa	My fiance absolutely hated emmalina, who was my best friend. They got along occasionally, but generally just couldn't stand eachother and were always saying bad things about eachother. Turns out my fiance was right, and she turned out to be a total *****. She betrayed me in a lot of ways. I should have listened to him.|`|3iNobwVraa	Yes, maybe, I presume that's why...I don't really know...    It sucks and it made me sadder than I would have expected.  But, that's life, and I can deal.  The world is full of amazing people, and there is all kinds of fun to be had.  I choose to be happy, so I am.  Truly.     Hope it is the same for you. :)|`|F1TFSVRBaa	This has happened to me twice.  Friends with a male and their jealous overprotective partner comes along and shuts it down.  Even though I have my own partner and he was friends with him too.    I have let them go.  It has not been easy at all, but I had to accept that he chose her and thats just the way it is.  I also thought that if we were to be friends again, she will always be the shadow of insecurity hovering around.  I talked with my partner about it, whilst it doesnt make it any easier, having two of us dropped by our friend made it a little more bearable.    However, if the future presents an opportunity to cross paths again, I will be sure to ask the whys...|`|kTLIj0rmaa	No but I lost a good friend because of MY husband, ex husband that is.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	I have lost 2 friends because of their partners infidelity and abuse. One kept coming to me when her hubby beat her. I'd patch her up and try to help her. SHe kept going back and after 3 years she finally gave up and stopped coming to me and just laid down and took it. He hated me cos he knew she was coming to me for help. She wanted him so much that she stopped talking to me., The other ones hubby was having anal sex with a prostitute on a weekly basis and she came to me. I was the only one who knew. She went back to him and cos i knew he didnt want her to see me anymore and so she cut off contact. I still see her out shopping sometimes but he walks away and calls her over after about 2 mins. Women who do this drives me nuts! I have never rejected my friends or put pressure on them to leave or confronted their husbands but the mere fact that the wives trusted me and I knew everything was enough for them to demand their wives have no contact with me. It is very sad and I miss them.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	I had an ex who chased my friends away.  He cussed and threatened them, especially if I wanted time away from him to be with them.  They got away from me, then I got rid of him, and they came back.  Controlling partners will inevitably attack the friends/family of their spouse to get them out of the picture.  Your friend will eventually come around.  Until then, you have to protect yourself and walk away.  Don't put yourself in a toxic environment.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Yup.A girl I could have been awesome friends with had this dick of a guy as her bf and father of one of her kids. He was always exalting his child and putting down her other one that was from another guy.He was also controlling of her and he would put her other child down as often as he could. He had a short temper  and honestly I didn't want my kid around it.I told my friend what was up and she listened but she didn't really do anything about it.Plus, he acted ghetto.It made me super uncomfortable to no end.The last straw was when he told me she had a fat pussy and that he wanted to punch her 1st kid in the face because of how much she resembled her dad.That was it for me!I broke off all contact.Not to mention, he had pulled a gun on her before and he had an addicition to pain killers.Idk how she could stand it.|`|Ub1IOPsraa	As you get older, you will come to realize friends come and go for many reasons.  Sometimes you just outgrow them.  Losing a friend because of a spouse is very common.  Too bad it happens.  Enjoy your friends while you have them, because that's just the life of it all.|`|MVxFOI5naa	Friend was hooked up with a prison guard and was going to marry him -he did drugs and treated her very badly-i told her i thought it was a huge mistake-needles s to say I did not get invited to the wedding and she called me a year later and told me I was right and that they were getting a divorce-I missed her that whole time but I am glad she is away from him now.|`|U88H6YlEaa	Never been in that situation........but my relationships with my friends are with my friends, not their spouses. If their spouse was to cause drama I would suggest that they focus on their relationship with the person who we have in common and to stay out of my face! It's not up to spouses to vet who you can and can't be friends with. Surely it's up to the friend?|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	When I was married to my (now ex) husband, I lost every friend I had, but I thought it was normal grow-apart loss.  Twenty-four years later, when he left me to marry some whore, I had to re-evaluate things...    Listen to your friends and family. Their objective opinion is always more reliable than your heart!
5DJzp6bMaa	Move on|`|rx20pKgOaa	I'm curious, just what is "the next level?"  If, after a year and half no one is talking marriage or a future life together then face it, you are both just killing time.

Sorry if that sounds harsh but you need to know you can do better! Take it from someone who knows from experience! Love is a two way street!

Tell him how you feel, if he says the opposite, say "I've enjoyed my time with you and thanks for listening" and let it go. If you don't tell him how you feel, you'll never know if it would have worked out.
AA12108398	I went through the exact same thing. My two friends ruined the 1st half of my freshman year. it was ridiculous. do not hurt yourself its not worth it! talk to your parents, teachers, anyone. they will keep it confidential. you need to do this no matter how much you don't want to. if you need help getting through this tough time please don't hesitate to visit my website  frighteningtruth.webs.com/    take it from someone who has been through it-don't wait to find help or security.|`|RwtHiQufaa	first off stop cutting yourself and staving yourself. You might think but you can. I had that problem many times. My advice is to just agnore them. I know its hard but thats what i did and the most popular girl in the class above me just stopped makeing fun of me cause i just agnored her and you should talk to the schoo lif its that bad hat you cant got to school. Just agnore or tranfer schools.
ssbKJ6fCaa	wow seems like you've been through a lot...well here are a few sayings of mine and im sure you have heard them "in a relationship trust is key"..&.."everything happens for a reason"...now if you really care for her that much and want to give her another try, start things off slow start talking to her again in person not just im and stuff like that, and don't rush anything just go with the flow of things and see what happens =]|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Put yourself in her current boyfriend's shoes.  How would he feel about her being friends with an ex?  I think you should leave her alone.  Too much temptation.  And she ain't shy....she seems to get around just fine.|`|uZDEa2Bcaa	I think I kinda know what's going on... only, I'm talking about being the girl part... I didn't cheat on a man, but I unintentionally and unknowingly led him on. But the thing about that is that you're questioning US what you should do now. And in reality you tell us that your "heart wont let you" fall for her again. So if you dont want to be with her again, why are you asking us this question? If you want to be friends with her, why not? better friends than enemies. Just learn your distance and don't be THAT guy that is a good friend to her and she ends up cheating on her current boyfriend with you. Treat her like you would treat all your other girl -friends.|`|CS9qmGHtaa	I know that when you have been with someone that long and loved them that much it makes it harder for you to see the bad in them so you say hey here are the good things about being in the relationship...but you have grin and abre the fact that she cheated on you.  and if she has a boyfriend right now and he finds out that she is talking to an ex his alpha male side will kick in for sure...that is never good thing...and if she is willing to break up with him for you than that doesnt mean that she loves you more(allthough she probably does) it just means that she is kinda inconsiderate of peoples feelings...now i dont know the woman but i really dont like when girls cheat it is really non classy and inconsiderate=[|`|5bZ2sPO3aa	There are many women out there that don't need a second chance because they would NEVER have done that to you in the first place. There is a huge difference between faith and stupidity. There is nothing shy about her based on your own letter! She manipulated you, used you, cheated on you and is doing her damnedest to cheat on her current bf with YOU!  She isn't happy and misery loves company. She knows how you felt about her and she's trying to manipulate you for her own game. She doesn't know how to really care for or about someone and she has no respect for you. She is missing something and it's not anything you can fix. She WILL do the same thing to you again. But if you're a glutten go for it but you been warned many times over.|`|e66728d356242647c23f9d56b0c67289aa	She's a user and you're being a wimp. Get that ***** out of your life, she emasculated you by cheating on you and you shouldn't take that **** from a woman.|`|NdEubhZhaa	Move on. That's the best advice I can give.|`|NOYOgHIEaa	dont go back to her! tell her if she wants to still be friends (which she prob won't...) u can be but u just dont trust her enough and its over! it might hurt her but she hurt u and u didnt deserve it |`|AA12255146	Sorry. she just isn't that into you, if she's been sleeping around, ya think? there are gals out there, that won't cheat you know. besides, do you want to forever live with the resentment that she has been sleeping around, and even HAS a current BF?are you that weak kneed? plez, just let it go, and find a great lady who deserves you. Obviously, this one doesn't.|`|4aqY30xaaa	one thing u have to realise is that when u really love someone u cant just be thier friend.and if u are thinking that u want her as a friend then i do not think u are into her.why waste ur time then with some one u are not into.move on man.u have the rite to miss her after all u once loved her.but it does not mean that u have to go back to her.|`|1V3mDqeuaa	Truthfully it sounds like she wants what she can't have. And i am familiar with this situation because i was the girl that did that before, but when i started to talk to my ex the only reason i started talking to him was because me and the new boy were having a little problem and i was just thinking about old times. But then when me and my ex( which in this case prob would be you) got back together old problems started to show up again. I wouldn't get back together, truthfully.  It's just another chance for heart ache and you might still love/like her but if she really loved you before she would have NEVER cheated on you. It sounds harsh but its true.We just want what we can't have or for some girls in that case. Just be careful and think carefully about everything before you make a decision that can end up happy or an even harder break up for you.|`|cGpC8547aa	Well, if you really love her and you would do anything for her, do it before her boyfriend dose it. If she is your true love then why wont you do the first call, email or anything to get her full heart to you. Talk to her in privet or send her a note. Tell her how you really feel about her. And tell her things she wants to here. You should always stay positive  and stay strong. Always be one step over her head. I have the same problem but you know im a girl and i liked a guy and still have the same feelings for that guy. Do what your heart tells you to do. In this problem listen to your heart and not your brain. :) This will show her that you still love her and you will never forget her in any way. I show her how you feel about her. :)|`|XLhl1uHqaa	sorry mate, but i dont think you should give her another chance.   As hard as it has been for you, it will be harder for you to be with her again. Not only will it bring up all your past feelings from when she was cheating on you but you will never fully trust her again. and even if you think you can, it will take alot of hard work to get there (and not just on your part).  If she is messaging you and saying she misses you while she is with another man then, personnally, I wouldnt touch her with a ten foot pole.   There are PLENTY of nice people out there (even if it takes another 5 years to find her).|`|AA11595860	Damn love always makes us do stupid things don't it?     Sounds like you didn't listen to her when she said she wanted you to be with her. Maybe you should have listened...     But that didn't give her the right to cheat behind your back. She should have been a real woman and ended it the right way.     Only you know if she is truly sorry, and only you know if you want to risk maybe going through that business again. You might get your   heart broken.     Go with your heart... and if you do go back forget about what happened and dont rehash the past. Start fresh... GL!|`|4JPJzcuraa	im going through the same thing right now. i had suspicions of my boyfriend, but i never said anything, and later found out he had cheated on me with one of my friends.i think you did the right thing by taking a "break" from her, but if you do want to get back together with her then make sure that if you have any suspicions that she gets rid of them immediately, and you won't stick around to be hurt again.|`|uRHVCvNPaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater......sorry to disapoint you.|`|PNLwOIOraa	I think you should just be her friend, and if she has a bf and is willing to leave him for you she might do the same if she finds someone else she likes to you?|`|fSQfmCUbaa	if she has a boyfriend let her be with im and cheat on him.. you can do better im sure|`|tCoSuDYdaa	You need to move on.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Come on bro us guys are smart dont let her play you move on.|`|briRpzL1aa	I guess you are one who likes punishment dont you??      In short... She is toying with your emotions because she is one who apparently likes drama.  It has been my experience with these type of women that they are only happy when drama is around.    Meaning, feel free to do as you like, but do not expect to keep her for long..  Also, I have allot of experience with this type of woman.    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|gSdSRceRaa	Think with the head on your shoulders and NOT the one between your legs ! A leopard doesn't change its spots. If a person, man or woman, will cheat on you once, then they will do it again. PERIOD. Move on ........as fast as you can.|`|mcywqcHuaa	Similar thing happened to me, only it was my best friend instead of one of hers. I since stopped talking to both of them, and have no regrets. i was completely wrong about both of them. they defended their innocence to the end, until i had heard of it from others. listen to me very closely: be glad she's gone. there are better people out there. i know, because i found her :)    leave the *****. enjoy only pleasant company.
WoAAdxHEaa	you shouldn't have been drunk when you're 14...though i was too at that age. that's odd, normally i don't remember anything sexual after being drunk. did you say no? I'm not sure just don't let it bug you. Think, "alcohol makes you act stupid..."|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Let's see...you remember.....she remembers. What's your question? Sounds like the whole thing was mutual and you are trying to bleme it on being drunk. Bible verses won't help.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Friends don't take advantage of each other.|`|PNLwOIOraa	LMAO. Do it again ;D|`|VCB4M6LGaa	This is a good bible verse about temptation:    I Corinthians 10:12-13  Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesnt fall.  No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.    Sounds like you are doing a lot to be on ly 14. (drinking, being ate out, etc.)  I'm not sure of your religious affiliations, but try to hold out and save some things to experience as your mature in age and wisdom.  They will be so much more enjoyable then, trust me ;)|`|AA11342893	thats weird  talk to her about it (and being homo or by)|`|hfNXDCPQaa	Woah. I think she remembers. Might want to pressure her more on the subject. That's sick.|`|RQFmnpSaaa	aye lol rite though|`|d40k56HHaa	well you knew it was going on so...........................don't blame her|`|zLsA6IAPaa	ok, first question, why were u drunk in the first place?? you should talk with her about it|`|AHeLeaMBaa	Sounds like she waited until you were vulnerable, and true friends don't take advantage.

Give him examples like you did in this question and say that it needs to change if we're going to stay together. Make sure you also let him know how much you care about him, but that he's frustrating you. Then if he doesn't want to address any of it you should say goodbye. He doesn't sound worth it. Good luck!|`|CmDR4MOeaa	You should kick him out your house    I mean not just the FREE food and laundry    He made a promise and broke them three times  a relationship is all about trust and i think you've lost  your trust for him ,so there is no relationship here    and he is totally using you,i'm very sorry but your love is a jerk  and dont worry soon enough you'll find someone who is going to be good enough for you    Good Luck

If you have things in common, talk about them. DON'T lie. Relationships can't work when they're based on lies.  3) Exchange phone numbers, IM screen names, E-mails ect...  4) Every OTHER day, start a conversation on one of those  5) By the 3rd week, if you're comfortable with her and vice versa, ask her on a date or to a party (Private Dates are better- pizza is a good first date choice and a movie.   6) At the date talk and by the end, it'll all be good :)|`|rzHRFEvjaa	if ur ex's friend is really close, its gonna be tuf to get her just b/c of the whole dont d8 ur friend ex bfs.

Then you have to flirt with her on the slide but don't make it to easy for her to notice what you are doing. when you do that you gotta have her wondering, have her asking her self qustions like do he like me or something. After that she will do the rest but if she is real close to your ex girlfriend you out of luck cuz your ex will find out and she might not want to mess up her friendship with her friend.|`|rSQjhXbUaa	Well be friendly toward her but not overly friendly. Nobody likes someone all anxious and pushy.. Let her realize you sort of like her but don't make it so obvious. If you're cool and relaxed when your together, she'll find that much more attractive than if you're nervous and keep talking to her like a begging puppy..     I hope she likes you :) peacee.|`|uRHVCvNPaa	Thats tuff a rebound relationship, they don't usually work from what I know from my friends.But if you must just be yourself and if she likes you you will know. Girls always talk and there friends always tell you like,she likes you. do you like her?
DcVoq5Tuaa	play peat-repeat with him. repeat everything he says back to him and see how he likes it.
Ikd9cppcaa	It's unlikely you will find a big brother. Most men are very skittish about getting involved with a teenage girl as a big brother for fear of sexual harassment lawsuits. It would be a big concern that you would say they acted or talked inappropriately with you. I realize this isn't what you want....and what they wouldn't want but it is a real problem with all the lawsuits in our society. Sorry. Maybe you have a friend with an older brother you can consider a friend.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Sounds to me like you are looking for a protector, your knight in shining armour. Unfortunately most people are looking for someone to give their time as a big brother or sister, not take it.  And what on earth does celibacy have to do with any of this!|`|tYhkdr63aa	There are no websites like that.  If you look for a guy like that you'll only get guys that are looking for girlfriends or you'll get some guy in trouble with his girlfriend.    Maybe myspace or facebook.  If you're artistic there is a feature www.deviantart.com/ in which you can find all the people near you that are registered on that site.    for best results either look on the internet for someone not local that you could just chat with.  There are alot of non-wierdos looking for friends on the internet to chat with.  if they want to meet, be scared.    or look locally irl.  goto fuctions that you would find people with your interests ie concerts, community/school functions
wvN4HLhLaa	Uhh it goes against the friendship code. People arent allowed to like the brother or sister of their friend or bestfriend. Period.|`|DF49SpO9aa	one word.

Anyway... usually hot breakfasts on the weekends, when we have time to eat it and clean up afterwards.    I make a mean biscuit, cinnamon rolls, pancakes...  Hubby makes awesome bacon, eggs, omlets....  It just depends on what we're hungry for.|`|9KMPOJf3aa	Almost never have hot breakfast in the morning....only on weekends. I make pancakes. My wife tried once, and .....didn't work out too well.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	We don't have the same schedules.  I make my children breakfast, sometimes hot, most times not.

Otherwise, I don't eat breakfast.|`|4POGapREaa	Never because we don't eat breakfast.

9boiaLi8aa	Feeling hurt is part of falling inlove...Telling him how you feel might just complicate things...you're too late, he already have a girlfriend.  Just respect their relationship for now... Endure the pain, time can heal..believe me...don't put so much hope on him...|`|8nexYdUjaa	=(  If you're going to tell him how you feel about him, I suggest doing so when things have sizzled out with him & his new girlfriend. You don't want to cause any problems by telling him how you feel while he's dating someone. so when they are no longer together, that's the best time to let him know how you feel. i'm sure that you're amazing and that this has nothing to do with you at all. he may not know at all how you feel about him ! Good luck*|`|7QYTlHDlaa	talk to him... tell him how you feel.. and talk to this girl,, she totally knew how you feel for this guy and yet she is actually flirting with this guy...  she's not a true friend...  bettre get rid of this kind of people...
f4wDSdyPaa	well i wouldnt say that you are stealing her crushes her crushes are just liking you more than her,and you cant stop people from liking you. but if you dont want to hurt your friends feelings then if one of her crushes do ask you out say no and show no intrest in him while you are around him. but if you do like the boy that ask you then go with him just ask her is it ok with her if you do go out with him.      hope i helped|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Talk to your friend about it and I am glad that you are being very mature and hand the situation very well.  If her crushes are asking you out, talk to your friend about it, after all, communication is the key to friendship.
7e8NN8saaa	Talk to an attorney before you do ANYTHING.     It's tough financially but it was worth it in freedom.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I'm going to get all "Dear Abby" on you but have you tried marriage counseling yet?  Since you have a two-year-old, I'd give that a try before up and leaving.  If he won't go to counseling with you, go alone.|`|MVxFOI5naa	I found that was the best way to leave-swiftly and quietly and travel light-take only what you really need. But get a free consultation with an attorney before hand just to be safe

bFJQyRusaa	Oh yeah, he definitely likes, or should I say LOVES you.And seeing how he's acting, I don't he's got the guts to say it (yet, in a few weeks, maybe, but u shouldn't wait too long or someone else may steal him for good). That's why u should try to give him a few hints also. Try asking him to a study date or movies. Or just for ask him if he wants to grab a pizza at lunch with you.     Trust me, I know how it's to have a HUGE crush on a girl. Oh yeah, it's probally gonna take him either a few weeks of 1 or 2 months, but make your move quickly if he doesn't. Because some other girl may ask him out. Or worse! he may lose intrest in you for good so MAKE A MOVE AND MAKE IT FAST.    Good bye.  Good night, and  Good luck!!! :)|`|cG2UKGQRaa	I think that you try to live with it but if he dosnt ask you on valentines day you should in his locker /or something put like a think of chocolates and a card ! thanks ! But dont ask him out !He'll think your verry desperate|`|PMU4lIedaa	Most guys are to scared of the answer that there crush will give them if they ask them out or to become bf and gf. So you might want to ask him what the hell hes doing and if hes ever going to ask you out. Then you will have him off guard and he will really start to think about you.|`|41gXHJE3aa	He definitely likes you.|`|WORwR8UTaa	well i definetly thinks he likes you cause this has happened to me before. But he might be to shy or afraid of ruining your friendship if he asks you out. But i think he will soon, Just flirt with him alot, invite him places nad take him up on his offers of you coming by to check out somthing, this will show your interested but dont seem to desperate but not to distant. if u know what i mean????  hope this helps you out|`|ZiBFta8xaa	he really do like you but he is making it where you would noe. but i will say give him about a week to ask you out but if he dont he just waiting on you to ask him out.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	it sounds like he really likes you! :) yay so i would just be very flirty and show him that you are also interested!  hope it all goes well!|`|stv1JMXNaa	He definitely likes you. I'm 99.9% positive :)  I'm a 14 year old guy, so I know what it's like to like a girl.  Unless we're really good friends, we don't usually ask girls for their numbers or give them ours.  Staring at you when you come into the room would definitely be a hint that he likes you, if he didn't, he wouldn't acknowledge the fact that you walked in the room and would have kept doing whatever he was doing.  We joke with our friends, but when we touch them if we're talking to them, it's probably a sign that we're interested.  If he shows you he cares to talk to you right in front of a group of all of his friends, then that's a big hint.  It is possible he considers you as a best friend, but since he does all of that stuff, I think he likes you more than that.  Give him hints that you're interested in him.  Try to tell him that you like him, without actually saying it.  If you guys are walking together, keep bumping his hand against yours as you walk, and he'll get the hint you want to hold hands with him.  I'm sure once he knows you like him, he'll ask you out.  Probably very soon.|`|cNySQ2axaa	i think he does and just keep giving him hints tht u like him and hopefully he will ask u out =)|`|WQOC6ILMaa	I think he does really like you. It is likely he is just scared to make a move. Try and encourage him by mentioning activities that would be fun to do together. Like when you were talking about movies say something like "We should go see a movie sometime" or stuff like that. Try and hint to him that you want to go out and spend time with him.|`|vNzc4RnAaa	he likes you  try to get it out of him. ask him why he wants to hang out so much and why he walks and talks with you all the time.  be flirty and he will ask you out sometime|`|Hj5sXNI7aa	Jane,   You are so funny. Of course he likes you. Im guessing he is trying to figure out if you like him back. My son is 15 and they have to work up the courage to ask, they fear rejection. It sounds like he is just making sure you like him back. Have you not heard any rumors about him? I guarantee everyone knows he likes you. It wouldn't hurt to ask him if he wants to do something with you, you will find out sooner. If he says no, (and I don't think he won't), then just say, "that's okay". and smile.   But, I bet he is getting ready to work up to asking. hang in there. Boys are funny creatures. ha ha .|`|5POoQJVpaa	omg he definitely likes you. no question at all, whatsoever. and i quit reading halfway through. lol|`|etfpaqgzaa	dude he totally likes you     you don't even need to ask     don't worry he will ask you out soon   and if he doesn't then just go up to him and stick your tongue down his throat|`|xwrnY4PEaa	You know the answer, don't do this|`|ROeq8hkWaa	As a guy, I would have to say YES.  If 100% likes you.  Expect him to ask you out in the next 2 to 3 weeks. Maybe earlier.|`|fXmUiAYPaa	yeh! long question but sounds like you got something happening there so you could wait for him to ask you out. or you could take the initiative ad see what he does?   how long you been waiting? if you been waiting a long time then jsut ask him out or coffee if its not taht long then wait a little longer for him.|`|0dd0cKUGaa	How about the tried and true method of determining someone else's feeling...get one of your girl friends to ask him. Not only will you get an answer, either yes or no, from your friend, but you will also put him on notice that he has to act. He will either have to ask you out or stop all of the little things that give you the impression that he has feelings for you.|`|fH8unJ3Jaa	He deffinatly likes you. But with the way i ask girls i do the same thing and i am 16 he is probably going to ask you very soon(1 to 4 weeks) if not he is just really nervous and is scared to ask you out because besides a girlfriend guys also want a best friend they can tell anything to but he might just be having trouble and you might have to drop a clue or too in a note or while talking like "i want to go see this movie but it looks kinda scary, will you come watch it with me so i will not jump at every scary scene? Pleasssssseeee???" and it will be a 99.9 percent yes unless he has to go to a funeral or something like that. If he likes you enough he will make the time to see it with you.
FiCl71flaa	Honestly, you need to ask her out again. She may have seen you in a different light when she saw you with friends, realized she would like to date you ; or she may just realize that you are a terrific person that she wants as a friend. There is only one way for you to find  out  and that is to have a conversation with her. You can casually and simply say where is (the guys name) , also if you have the time and privacy, tell her how you feel about her  and ask for a response. All of your immediate questions will be answered by the response she gives about whether she loves you or not. While I wish you all the best , I also urge you to deal directly with her since she is the only one who can give you a correct answer.|`|BvgMVNk5aa	dont ask her out again, she doesnt deserve another chance.|`|8O4ttgGMaa	maybe she just wants to be friends. I'd say start looking around at other girls, then SHE can approach YOU|`|0dd0cKUGaa	Invite her to more things "just as friends" and flirt constantly. You should be able to tell pretty quickly how she feels. If that doesn't work you could just ask.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	If I could go back to my teen years and I were you.....don't waste time with any girl that is not interested. If you are attracted to her and vice -versa then you have something as a basis to have some form of relationship there. Go ahead and ask her out. The worse thing she can say is no. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.|`|XUUGN0E7aa	To be honest, she probably isn't looking at you a lot. It just seems like it because you always are.    Try to find someone else to go with.|`|a3gFZur0aa	well if u only asked her once sure try again just dont seem mad desperate wit her or anything and dont ask sooo much that it gets annoyin|`|7mQNq9ceaa	just wait for her to approach you, don't worry about it, just act cool and be nice to her, dont show that you like her until she shows some interests good luck buddy|`|9a29ff9d83b4bd07e03cf4ccfb727231aa	dude maybe u should talk to her alittle more and ask about that guy...but like as a friend...if she has something with him then just back off for a bit....shell probably be over with him soon...but if she says nothing then she will ask if u still like her...then u tell her what u think u feel...  good luck =]|`|ZiBFta8xaa	well wat you need to do is give her a chance because you dont know what's going on she probably aint even talkin to dude the way you think she is.|`|LrMG7L7iaa	She will always have feelings for the other dude, but maybe not as much as she does now. I wuld ask her if she still likes the other dude, even text and ask her that. But if she says  yea-dont ask her  no-ask her  im not telling- dont|`|Bh82isDSaa	Of course, you must not pass up the opportunity to seek out the truth. When you meet up, ask her just where she is with the other person. That will clear up the situation one way or the other. If she tells you she is no longer involved, then simply ask her to join you in some refreshment. Then you can take time to talk the scenario through and through. Be positive and exciting. Tell her how you have been attracted to her and would like another opportunity to take her out if she would like to consider it.  Good luck.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	Dude don't fall for it trust me she like the other dude but if she sees you like this she will be asking you to hold her books buy her lunch etc use you as the kind helper...She likes the other guy but she thinks your sweet and kind...Just Friends
q2tT8ecraa	You should forget him (not completely) in the sense that you should get to know others and go on with your life.  You should do things that make you totally happy!      That will really be a test to see if he likes you or not.  Give him some time to come around.  If he does, then he likes you, if not, well at least you are out there being happy!|`|96RDuDofaa	I'm afraid you are lacking the information needed to really determine what you wanna know.

FVDTXM68aa	Must be honest, fun, polite, and have a job/potential! Must pay for all dates, and open all doors at all times! My fiance (recently engaged) and I have been dating for almost 6 years and he has paid for everything! He opens all doors (I am trained to wait until he opens a door...even when walking into a mall or something, lol), is totally fun, and treats me like a princess! I'm sure you are a great guy and I'm sure you do all these things to! Just be open to her feelings and have fun dating! Live, Love, and Laugh! :) You'll be fine ;) Good Luck!!!|`|FXCoGD44aa	The first piece, and probably most important, of advice I can give you is to truly get over your ex. If you "just got out of" a 3-year relationship, you are not ready to jump back into the dating scene just yet... at least not without bring some ugly [[and unattractive!]] baggage with you. Truly embrace being single for a while... re-define your life, goals, direction, etc. Be confident and self-sufficient with yourself first. Also, evaluate your past relationship and try to find out where your mistakes were, what you would like to do differently, etc. and keep that in mind.    When you do start dating again, here are some things that I [[and I would assume most girls]] like and dislike:  * DO be courteous. Girls appreciate chivalry... open doors, pull out chairs, give complements. It's basic, it's noticed and it's appreciated.  * DO NOT be clingy. Do not get attached to someone too fast... it really does scare them away. Continue to busy yourself with your own life... remember, the next special girl should have to earn her way in.             - once I went on a couple dates with a guy, who was actually very sweet. But the big turn off was that he was treating me like his steady girlfriend after the second date.  * DO come up with some unique dates. Any guy can pull dinner and movie out of his ***. But if you truly want her to remember what a great time she had with you, then you are going to have to be more creative than something she's already done dozens of times. A bike ride, go-carts, paintball [[if she's into it]], arcade, etc. would do better for your cause. Women like FUN.  * DO NOT brag about yourself. There's a difference between answering a question about your recent achievements and going on about how you single-handedly saved 10 orphans. Most girls know that if a guy has to talk himself up that he probably isn't as good as he says he is. Putting other people down doesn't work well for your cause either.  * DO ask lots of questions about her. People naturally like talking about themselves. When she tells you about something, whether you think it's interesting or not, ask her to elaborate. Say, "Oh yeah? How'd you do that?" or "Wow, that must have been really ___."   * DO NOT ask her to go back to your place for a least a few dates. Even if a woman agrees to go - and even suggests going - after the first date, the next morning she is likely going to think you are a sleeze-ball. She'll wonder, "Gosh, if he to me home the first night, how many other girls did he take home? OMG... I just got used. He's never going to call me! Oh great, I totally blew it." Just don't do it... she'll want you more if you hold off anyway.    Hope that helps!|`|yqKi9l9laa	lying is the absolute worst thing a guy can do.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	I could sit here behind my laptop and list all of the things that annoy me about guys I'm dating.  However, it will differ from the list that OTHER girls will give you.  Every girl is looking for something different.  Some girls want a guy to call them all the time, on a daily basis.  Others want their space and get annoyed with their partner calling them regularly.  Some girls want their guys to validate plans with them first.  Others prefer someone more spontaneous.  We're all different.  That's why we're dubbed as "individuals" ;)  As long as you're being genuine, as long as you love YOURSELF, as long as you know what you want in a girlfriend, then you'll be fine.  You can't mold yourself into someone you're not, based on characteristics that you'll get on Yahoo Answers.  Just spend some time figuring out who YOU are and what YOU want.  Everything else will just fall into place.|`|umoq8bjIaa	Don't act like an ***, it's just not cool. Begging, a big turn off. Just tell her that you want everything between you two to work, and you want to make it right, and just tell her everything you're feeling.   And if she says she needs a little time, give her time, don't call her every five seconds, or follow her or do anything like that. Give her space.|`|N2xzSXosaa	The best advice I can give you is, find a girl who really cares about you, and will put up with all of your faults and mishaps... but don't make her have to deal with all of that.    Love her unconditionally. Treat her right. Spend time with her. Hold her. Let it be known to other around you that you feel lucky to have her.  And above all else, DON'T CHEAT ON HER!    Best wishes!|`|awbCfN7Iaa	a liar for me is tops....be real and if its not working say it...but a lie is the worst thing a man can do.....|`|fElrYibYaa	I hate it when guys act like jerks and stuck up like theyre better. Just be nice and every thing will be OK|`|dLeRiM76aa	I hate it when guys act like jerks and stuck up like theyre better. Just be nice and every thing will be OK|`|tVBgqys9aa	The worst thing that guys do is when they act different from who they really are when they are with their friends. Guys like that never seem to stop coming, and when I date a guy like that and his friends come over, it's like a totally different guy, and I don't think any girl likes that :P|`|fY68d3mAaa	yeah, lying is horrible. but mostly, it depends on the girl. I mean, i absolutely hate being ignored and i can spend a ton of time with the person i'm dating. and i like that. My best friend on the other hand, cant stand being around the same person too much. I'm pretty sure no one likes to be ignored. and funny is a must. and you should always try to be cute, like with flowers for no reason and stuff. hope that helps =]|`|K5BLCZPkaa	Number one problem would be a liar. Another thing I hate is when guys get annoyed with me because I'm so shy. I can't help it. I think the guy should be more understanding of the girl if they are shy, and not get annoyed and frustrated. It takes time for some people to open up and show their true self's.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Hmm...he should be pretty confident, so he's not looking for my approval all of the time. It'd bother me more if he talked negatively about his ex a lot, because it's like he's still sore over the breakup, in comparison to if he was still friendly with her. I don't like it when he gets jealous over everything, it sends the vibe that he doesn't trust me. Also, I don't mind light teasing and sarcasm, but if it's so excessive that it gets mean, it's a turn off. The only other thing that bothers me is when a guy is down on everything, I understand everyone has their off days, but that day shouldn't be every day.|`|s9Pb6MnYaa	clinginess is one thing i HATE. and there's one thing I hate about my friends boyfriend...he knows she loves him and uses her for it...like when he came out of a bar, he called her to pick him up at 2AM, cause she had a car. like he didn't have any form of public transportation available. If you're lucky enough that she loves you, don't take advantage of it. just show some respect to a girl and give her some space. Keep your own life and let her have hers.  OH, and for many girls, one major turn-off is a roving eye. you're basically telling your girl there are other ones that you'd prefer to spend your time with. there's no point telling her you think she's the most beautiful afterwards to comfort her, because you've basically proven otherwise.|`|50fc8503a82ad4a3d7a2568f22b34236aa	Such a wonderful question! ha ha    I HATE it when guys are cocky and really into themselves, when they try to say "i love you" after like two weeks, and I also can't stand when guys act overly insecure...like if you aren't holding hands in public then you are being "distant"...ha ha that one seriously happened....it was pretty weird to me. Also, when guys act different around their friends like they don't care compared to being sweet when you are alone...that's really frustrating. But the absolute worst thing a guy could do in my opinion is be dishonest. Because getting trust and maintaining trust is one of the hardest things to do.    But some great things are just being open and honest with the person you date...always make sure that she knows how you feel, and also keep in mind that if she does something to upset you...you should tell her. It has to be give and take.    Good luck with everything!!|`|B5AP22RQaa	Guys piss me off when they don't pay enough attention to what there women is saying straight out of her mouth. Guys tend to want to do there on thing, I can be about you, it should be about we... most of the time women will tell you everything they like and dislike in the first few conversations...PAY ATTENTION!!. I know for me i hate for a guy to tell me a lie or even think that's it best to tell little lies to cover up hurting, in the end it hurts the same. try to share everything. be open and communicate often. Be her best friend and things should just flow naturally.|`|49We7buoaa	I hate when guys lie, or treat me different when he's around his friends BIG TURN OFF!!! Or when he seems like a player, blows me off, or only hangs out when there's nothing else to do, what I love is a guy who is not too sweet (women will walk all over you) but not mean, wants to hold your hand and hug you, says he like your family even if he doesn't      My biggest deal braker is when a guy tries to have sex with me way to soon, he tries really hard and that's all he talks about *ugh* and he keeps touching you and insinuating sexual movements.

a1upKHDUaa	Well you just told us you love your bf.  Plus how long has your bestfriend been around? Im sure he isnt going anywhere, let your recent relationship work out. When it ends im sure your bestfriend will still be there, he has to understand that you have a bf now|`|UThG15FLaa	This question all depends on ,   How long have you been dating your boyfriend?  Do you still have an attraction towards him?  Do you see yourself with him forever?    Comapare those question to your bestfriend, and your "Awsome" boyfriend. Come up with a conclusion. Because! you obviously can't dat both hun.     make sure you make the right decision, once a decision is made, there is no going back !    Good Luck  ? Deee|`|iUO6XjSEaa	You need to tell him how you feel. If he doesn't understand, well that's his problem. It depends on who you think would make you feel like you guys belong to each other.|`|a3gFZur0aa	u never leave the one you love for the one you like because the one u like is going to leave you for the one they love|`|ihPxVG6Uaa	Its allright to have a crush on your best friend but ask yourself, do u really love him???  If you do... then think about it is that love more than your love for your BF?  Someone's heart will definitely broke in the condition you are.... also never ever think of cheating on your bf... it will make your life miserable.     But believe me girl... Once you cross the line with your best friend there is no coming back... you will have to be with him, treat him as bf as well as best friend. i have been in the same situation...  Once a best friend becomes BF, then things change. Either its the best or if it doesn't work out ... it becomes the WORST !!!|`|KlBn8R5Gaa	ask yourself if you were happier before yuor boyfriend or now.    do not cheat      just foloow your heart|`|SF5WnQFQaa	Its ok to have a crush just dont so it unless you break up|`|RAxe7X3xaa	Well, if you like your best friend and he likes you, you know you are compatible.

Anyways...Just figure out who you like more. Your boyfriend or best friend? Anyways if you go out with your best friend and then break up it could ruin things. You know what I mean?|`|KifasiMraa	crushes come and go.  You need to honestly asses your relationship and decide if you are happy with your bf, independently of any other potential love interests.  Be true to yourself first.  If you do want to break up with your bf, don;t rush in to anything with anyone else. And don't cheat.  Your friend may not be able to trust or respect you if he knows you were willing to be dishonest with your bf to be with him instead.|`|lFcwzrDFaa	make a list of good and bad things about them both then if the good out ways the bad then dump one of them and date the other|`|krkpHSOhaa	Honestly apparently you don't love your b/f or you wouldn't be asking this question!|`|b2zSN7wkaa	think about who makes you happier. then make your decision.|`|N97lSGuxaa	can you see yourself in the future without your boyfriend? .... if yesss then is it dark?      can you see your self living without your friend as a boyfriend?... if yes, is it dark?      if its a dark future without both of them then which is darker?|`|x09r4OVdaa	Okay, you gotta think to yourself: who do you love more?    Your boyfriend. Or your best friend.    Or, think of it this way: who couldn't you live without? And, if you like your best friend, (this is from personal experience), I would reccomend to not date him. Because no matter how hard you try, if you break up, it'll ruin your relationship with him. End of story. And that's not worth losing your best friend for.    Hope I helped! :)  ?Bri|`|LVcgfszBaa	Do what your heart is telling you to do. I think it is normal to have crushes when you are dating, but nothing to serious. it sounds like You're really torn and thinking about it really hard. Maybe the best thing for you to do is to call it off for a while with your boyfriend and see what the best friends has to offer. you couldn't be that happy with the bf if you are thinking about possibly being with someone else. Take in to consideration all parties feelings, and just move into the situation really slowly. Maybe take some time to yourself to really think things through. good luck.|`|swiZhUN7aa	well arnt you lucky !  well if you dont act fast one of them youll loose  which one do u like better|`|f6o0ufjxaa	well chose the guy that ull think is best for u and then if that doesn't turn out then uve learned to go with what u already have .

62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	And your question is what.  I picked a friend up at her house at 3:30AM last weekend so that I could drop her off at the airport by 5AM. When she thanked me I said I was raised to believe that that is the type of thing you do for friends.  I volunteered to take her rather than have her pay to leave her car at the airport and maybe have problems with it starting when she gets back.  Another friend is picking her up because I'm busy when she is coming back.|`|RjF7TmvTaa	it could just be a favour she might not want to leave her car in the airport,  if this is a regular thing with her and she only contacts you when she wants something and she would never do anything like this for you then shes using you!    if not well then shes just a friend asking another friend for a favour|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You should talk to her about it.  Seems that she is taking advantage of you.
bwl9nr8Maa	You obviously love him. Give it time to cool off, and tell him how you feel. You have to both reach some compromise if you really want to be together.  Most importantly, you BOTH have to want it as much as each other or it won't work.|`|92yiQo7uaa	It's really simple==hubby is over. New guy is needed.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	you have alot of thinking to do.. it seems there isnt much communication and trust between u two.. if he met  u being a dancer  he has to understand  his daugter has to have food on the take as well.. if he wants to dictated what u can do and cant then i dont think u should get back together with out the  theraphy u both need to work things out.. good luck|`|Bh82isDSaa	Hi,  It sounds like you have a barrier between you. Most couples would be insecure if they were married to a partner that was a "dancer."  Would you be comfortable if he were a "dancer" like you?  Admittedly, you must recognize that it is not a safe occupation. If you stopped the dancing, would that make things right between you?  Actually love is about meeting the other partners' needs, yet you have chosen to carry on in an activity that is so  damaging to your relationship. The old question is, "Do you want to be loved, or do you want to be right?"  You have to decide.  Best of luck.
869bb7a223baecd52d10fd82a9beab0caa	Talk to him, tell him about yourself.|`|0128ace84ef892d02fe82e156e193d12aa	Just start talking to people and stuff with come out. You have to be able to open up and let people get close to you so that they can get to know you. I'm not saying that you don't let people get close to you because of course i don't know you but really they only way people get to know you is by being close to people and opening up. You could also ask people questions that you want to know about well they will answer and ask you questions in return to get to know you better.     I hope I helped   Good Luck|`|8O4ttgGMaa	ask him questions about himself. what he does in his spare time. where he works. what his fav things are. and he should return the questions|`|SlkKa1jsaa	I dont feel anybody can truly know me,mmmph|`|AMDs8X0Raa	You have to have a willingness to open up and share intimate details of who are truly are.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	U have to show yourself as the other person wants to see u. U must edit yourself to eliminate your darker side. No one wants to see u the way u r, it would be very boring. Just show small and attractive parts of yourself to make your image mysterious and glamorous|`|fRREBCxSaa	it's sooooo simple. all you have to do is talk to him. wether that be online, on im, on phone, whatever. when i first got to know this one guy that i eventually started dating, we played this game thing on im where you would take turns asking a question you both had to answer. that way you get to know your similarities and differences.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	ask him to talk about his self first :D|`|8Klo9G6waa	you just talk to him and tell him about yourself, let him ask questions. also do the same back to him.  you 2 will know each other pretty well pretty soon|`|BO4ND6x5aa	star a conversation with him a few words so a long way don't be shy to ask.. no matter what|`|dLeRiM76aa	talk to him and talk about yourself|`|ZiBFta8xaa	well just ask him wat he wanna noe about you. than just tell'em wat he wanna noe.|`|33O1Ceklaa	when you guys talk let it slowly come out like he is like I play fotball and then just say like I play soccer or whatever you do also flirt a little like laugh at things he does and say nice one|`|5e9013e4acd951c6275d5a2e7e92b516aa	Well first of all you got to truly be willing to share your personal life. Opening up to someone can be very hard, especially if you had past problems with letting people in your life and than something goes wrong.     Probably the best thing to do is tell the guy if he wants to get to know you better... let him ask questions. And you ask questions about him likewise.    Also if the guy is not really willing to open up to you, then of course you will have problems with opening up.     Take your time to really get to know and make sure you make it clear that the guy needs to take his time too.|`|OmWamvEvaa	well just like give him your number and text him, and talk on the phone and get to know him. then once you become better friends you should hangout
gmr6GiyZaa	Being in this situation I know can be rough.  I am unsure if this was a planned pregnancy or not but I can tell you from experience that if you are not getting along before the baby comes it's just going to get worse when the baby arrives.  It could effect the way you treat and raise your baby too.  I am all for the fact that there are  thousands of wonderful single moms out there.  However, nothing can beat a loving mom and dad in a good relationship raising a child they made together.      You might consider getting some counseling regarding this matter.  Ask your ob/gyn at your next prenatal visit about this concern you are having with your boyfriend and maybe he or she can recommend someone for you to see.  Also realize that your hormones are on super overdrive and that really makes you more agitated with your partner too.     I understand that you want to work things out because of the baby but please don't get married unless that's really what you really want.   Almost every couple I know that has gotten married because they got pregnant never ever worked out in the end.      Maybe the both of you could use a break from each other say a couple of weeks or so.  That was always the perfect way for me to see if my husband (then boyfriend) was the one for me....  My favorite saying was, "If you love something set it free...if it comes back to you it's yours forever, if not, it was never meant to be."      The important thing right now for you is to be healthy mentally and physically so you can deliver a healthy child.  Everything else must (even a relationship for now) must remain secondary. You owe your child that much.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	You obviously are very unhappy.  The time to end it is when you honestly ask yourself if you would be happier with or without him. If it is without - then go.  Your baby will not be happy in an unhappy home.
ODf41iN4aa	Uh, oh.  This is bad news...starting with hanging out at a frat house when it's not a party with ladies invited.  Doesn't seem right.      Maybe you need to take a break from guys for a couple of months until you establish your own identity.  Talk to a school counselor or a shrink at the campus medical clinic about meeting guys & taking your time getting to know them on a different level & taking your time about it.  (Maybe the clinic has some chat groups to discuss these issues.)     Maybe hang out with people who have the same major in college or the same interests.  Invite people to go have coffee or study together after class.  For instance, when I was in college, I hung out with other people who were into creative writing or literature or the arts.  We always hung out at the same eating area between classes.  That way, it was easier really to get to know each other on a deeper level & know if people had some substance.  Before that, I was into activities with our church's college age group, but I got tired of those guys & went for other interests.    It's true that I wasn't a model of good behaviour, but at least that was a tad better than just hanging out a frat house.  Give it a try, & good luck.  You gotta improve your self-image.|`|Ut750mzQaa	id slap that mother father|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	if you are going to play two men you need to own up to it. don't be embarrassed about it, if that's what you want to do. personally, as long as you aren't in a relationship with anyone else I don't see anything wrong with it.

But you can go have the ring appraised and send a copy of that to your insurance...homeowners or renters insurance and then if something happens to the ring they will take care of it...if it's lost or damaged bad enough.

You've seem them play the other girls don't have him do that to you.  --The  more you ignore him the more he'll probably want you.

uzVMSVJpaa	hmmmmm, the gym story: sounds like he definately LIKES YOU ! ;D  haha  so what if on the bus there werent the usual ppl yu guys talk too, he still chose to talk to yu..he couldve gone and sat by himself,, or sat next to yu and not have said a word..lol    wait a week, or a few days, maybe hell bring it up?  perhaps ask you out?  [[:  good luck!|`|jyseac8eaa	He could be crushing on you!  Keep talking to him!  Flirt! You two will get close!
ZGvpWQ1Aaa	oh gosh... well i'd tell her just what u wrote there.. that wasn't too controlling... just tell her how u feel and how u care about her. just warn her... its great of u to care for her that much. wow.|`|XQH72YZWaa	dont seem protective lets say they wer in her room make up a quik snack lets say 10 minutes in and slowly and quitly make ure way to her room if u walk in and nothing is happening then just say i brought u snaks =D with that face on lols|`|EgUxu5kjaa	tell her that you really love her and that you're just looking out for her safety!  maybe you should take her out for a day, go looking for a new puppy, take her to the beach, shopping etc..  and tell her then! that way, you and her will get a chance to really bond (as a family) and she'll probly take in what you're saying to her better!|`|KiaoDGGZaa	i would just trust ur step daughter u said she is pretty level headed  trust her  cuz trying to but in will only make her turn away from you|`|GUNSTG6uaa	the most important thing is to keep her talking to you openly and willingly. the last thing you want to do is for her to stop wanting to talk to you.   you need to trust her. talk to her and let her know your worried and tell her the consequences of what could happen, but dont talk down to her. let her know that you are there for her regardless. possibly even talk to her boyfriend if she is willing|`|xpiGWrdMaa	they are having sex|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	her mother should be handling it.
r7tllHjuaa	Yes. Very rude especially if you were not properly dressed.  No one has a right to invite someone to your house without asking.|`|O282hR68aa	Depends on who's house it was. If it was your's I'd probably be annoyed she brought people over without telling me, especially people I didn't know. I'd consider that rude.|`|MHvoXi7Zaa	Yeah that's definatly rude. If i were you, I'd be mad.|`|AA12275607	Absolutely. i hope you reprimanded her|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	OMG, that is super rude.  that is one of the rudiest things ive heard.  and like u dont even KNOW them is another thing that just isnt ok.  comfront this girl, that is horrible to do.|`|5igBFOIPaa	YESS! I would be soooo annoyed. That is rude. Like u can't just be like, "hi! here are some random ppl u dont kno...just 3 random guys!" ummm, no. you should tell her that that is NOT appreciated.
jmtbtVYsaa	Get counseling while you guys have time.  You two need to talk more.  Before I got married, those are all things I used to do and thought ...I carried that kind of mindset into marriage and family but I was totally wrong.   These days, all I do is not just work, but my mindset is, I work for my wife and my kids.  It's all about family.  Being the man of the house you can say.  Maybe involve someone close to him or her to get them to think about what they're doing is wrong.  Marriage/family works as a single unit.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	sounds like a roommate more than a spouse. he needs to take a parenting class and learn how to interact with his kids. Some men just don't know how to do that when their kids are young but do become more involved as the child ages and starts school.|`|AA10373027	Find a new spouse!  That's a bunch of crap.  Who wouldn't want to spend time with there kid unless he was a total jerk face.      Good luck sista!|`|EvlPzrVOaa	so why did you have a kid in the first place. he works and brings home the money to pay bills, so you can stay home. women like you shouldnt be having kids.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I would be furious if my fiancee came home and completely ignored me and our daughter! It took two people to make the baby, and it's going to take two people to take responsibility for her/him. He may have been working all day, and so have we! Being a mother is a tough job, and some men don't realize it. Talk to him about it again. Tell him that you don't feel like he's spending enough time with you and the kids. If he once again, refuses to do it.. that just shows immaturity. A good father looks forward to coming home and spending time with his spouse and children! Children don't deserve a father who comes home and completely ignores them.    If you HAVE to talk your spouse into spending time with you and the kids.. I'm sorry to say but - he can't be worth it.|`|an1EMiFkaa	What can you do? Nothing  What you end up doing?  Resenting and hating and move on...|`|bnFcjEptaa	He calls spending time with his children , "work".    Hmm...I wondered if that was the way it was in his family while growing up.  There are plenty of men who work full-time yet spent time each evening and on the weekends with their children.    Other then asking him to spend more time with the children, have you had a discussion with him about your feelings and the children's about his lack of involvement.    If he refuses to talk about it, then I would suggest that you get some counseling.    Are you willing to live like that until the kids grow up without the influence of their father showing them he cares enough to be in their lives?|`|b5a53add137e28d77c3cdf426b5f6a2aaa	Are we married to the same man?? LOL my husband is the same way.  I have talked to him about it repeatedly and it does no good because he thinks is not doing anything wrong.  i just ignore him and take care of my kids and know that one day I will leave his sorry butt.  Good luck
2D6rM8Z0aa	Try this site.    http://www.weddinginsight.com/attendants...    You have heard the expression it takes a village well depending upon the size and expense of a wedding nowadays weddings are paid for by any number of people, from the Bride & Groom and Parents to Grandparents.    The first step of wedding planning would be to sit down with the prospective "payors" and decide on a budget then hash out who is paying for what.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	They are mature adults, independent and working. They should be paying for their own wedding, budgeting what they can afford then planning from there. I was 28 when I got married, and we just handled everything.  Offer with the planning, etc., maybe throw a shower, if that's done in your part of the world... mostly they will just need your love and support.  My mom was amazing through our wedding planning! Absolutely invaluable.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If you want to offer them some help, go for it. Otherwise, assume they are paying for everything. Nowadays the bride and groom take financial responsibility unless a family member offers a gift. They shouldn't expect you to pay for anything unless you offer. What you contribute is entirely up to you!    Good luck!|`|MkErhX7Haa	Well the good news for you is most people pay for their own weddings now.  If you want to contribute, that's really sweet of you; just be upfront with your son and future daughter in law about what you can contribute, that way they can plan.  As for the other parents in the picture, if they want to contribute, they will offer.  It's in your son and his fiancee's best interest to plan the wedding they can afford on their own and graciously accept any gifts offered to help.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	this day in time the couple getting married pays unless their families offer to help. Even my granddaughter (19) and her H2b (20) are helping to pay for theirs.|`|AA10440098	Sorry to be the sole dissenting voice, but almost all my friends are in the process of getting married, and generally the parents still pay..  Many if not most still hold by the silly rule that the bride's family pays, and some do it half and half. When splitting it people often take into consideration the differing financial ability of different families. So if the bride's family has more money, they pay for more, and vice versa.  The only couple I know who paid for their own wedding were older (in their thirties) and financially stable.  The bottom line is always that he (or she) who pays has the final say, right?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I think the groom's parents help with the rehearsal dinner and honeymoon or something.  there's really no tradition anymore, it's just whatever goes.  if you're helping 50/50 with the bride's family I would hope your name goes on the invite as 'hosted by' or 'requests the honor of your presence' you know?|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think it's nice when the bride and groom pay for their own wedding, however, it is not always feasible.  My husband and I paid for our photographer, videographer and flowers.  He's a pastry chef so he made our wedding cake.  Our families very generously paid for the entire rest of the wedding.  I don't think that happens much anymore but we were and still are, eternally grateful.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Nowadays, it's whatever you wish to pay for. As parents, you don't owe your grown kids to pay for their wedding - however, any contribution would be appreciated, I'm sure. Decide how much you can afford to contribute, and write a check. My parents-in-law wrote us a 5K check as a wedding gift, it was their contribution which was much appreciated but by no means expected.|`|nqINitkmaa	It really depends on the family. My fiance is 29 and I am 23 we have both owned our own homes and have lived away from home for a long time. We are doing it the traditional way, my parents are paying for the wedding his for the rehearsal dinner. But our parents are financially able to pay and want to pay for it. It is a destination Wedding so we are paying for every ones rental cars and our wedding pictures and that's it. If you and your husband want to contribute just say I'll give you$xx xx for the wedding. But you most certainly don't have to, but it is proper etiquette if her parents do pay for you and your husband to pay for the rehearsal dinner.|`|qtAOHZ0Daa	For the most part the bride and groom pay for the entire thing and usually the parents pay for the rehearsal dinner.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	now a days, there are no rules.  everyone contributes what they can afford to.  these days more and more brides and grooms are paying for the bulk of the wedding themselves, and anything parents throw their way is just a happy bonus.      so contribute whatever you can, but dont drive yourself into debt over it.    start the conversation by stating "i have looked over my budget and here is what i believe i can contribute to your wedding costs" and then give them the number.      try to work with your ex as best as possible.  avoid trying to make any sort of compition out of this and dont feel bad if anyone tries to put in more than you or something.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	i am not sure, but all of your expenses to get there & stay there should be considered when deciding who pays what & how much|`|di6p10Ifaa	My fiance and I, I am 20 he is 25, we are paying for our entire weddings ourselves. We believe you should never plan for anything you couldn't pay for yourself. Why should it be someone else's burden? So we plan for what we can pay for and if anyone wants to pitch in down the road, great but we are not unloading our plan book and dumping it into someone's hands and say here write the checks. We are considering this our "first big financial responsibility" as a couple. We know we are going to have other financial responsibilities together later on in life so this will be our first one, kind of to prepare us for things like buying a house, if we move, and having kids. Hope this helps. I am not trying to discourage you from helping anyone, if you want to pitch in that is wonderful! :)|`|dPULl5hjaa	Well, Ok both people work - that means they SHOULD HAVE been saving some money.  Why not ask them do they have any money saved?  If so, they should PAY FOR THE MAJORITY OF IT!    Yes, I think it "still stands" - as you mentioned!  What bride pays for, etc.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If the couple is old enough to get married, they are old enough to figure out how to pay for the wedding themselves. The parents are under no obligation whatsoever to pay for anything.    The tradition of the bride's family paying for everything except the rehearsal dinner is leftover from the days when women were considered property and they were traded and sold from her father's household to her husband's and she had no rights at all, including any way to support herself.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	As somebody else said, it's whatever you wish to pay for.  The bride and groom are no longer supposed to expect anything from either parent, but to be grateful for whatever help the parents want to give.  Since they live on their own, and say you're not hosting the wedding, you definitely wouldn't be expected to have to provide for any of it, though offering any help would be a nice gesture.    My husband's parents are divorced as well.  When we got married last summer, his mom sent us a check for $500.  She was going to offer us even more, but then we asked her teen-age children to be in our bridal party, and she had to spend more money on their outfits as well as her own so that was her total contribution.  She is not that wealthy so we considered it to be a very generous offer from her.    His dad and step-mom did not offer any money for the wedding, but they hosted a casual celebration in their area several weeks after the wedding.  They invited many friends and family and paid for that.  They had young children who were our ring bearer and flower girl so they paid for their outfits as well.|`|w1necKzYaa	Usually now adays the bride and groom pay for their own wedding!
q2tT8ecraa	NO No NO.  I don't think you should.  You might regret it.  That is only something you should do when you are in a committed relationship with someone (if then, even).  Otherwise you look like you move pretty fast.  And, if this is just a crush, you might feel stupid about having done it once the crush is over.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Not if you dont want him to think that you are a slag|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	if you guys were together then yes but if your not its kind of whoreish|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Sure, if you want to come across as being easy. You don't just go around sending every guy sexy pictures of yourself. Save that for when they are actually your boyfriend.|`|258mrT2Paa	send it to me first and i will tell you if its good enough for him. lol|`|lVNYRSs8aa	no    but he'll enjoy it nonetheless|`|xO0IjDpNaa	no,because pictures can lead to many other things and people are going to think that you are a sl*t.|`|wlvKveAXaa	uh no that sends a mixed impression and he might start thinkimng ur a ****|`|hH76CdQ1aa	no|`|Qbczt3ivaa	no, that will make you look like a....yea...just dont do that.|`|3WeAfZNraa	send him A PIC so he will like you for your body ?  UH no!    if he really like you he shouldnt need a pic!|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Nah, it just makes you appear easy, do you really want him dating you for that reason? Besides, can you really trust this guy? What's stopping him from going around showing it to all his friends? Wait 'till you guys are officially together.|`|6o4iqjPgaa	so u rather send him a picture that he can show to everybody that will embarrass you   rather than just asking him?|`|XsYrhdY2aa	If your ok with him sharing it with all of his friends then sure why not?  But don't think your pic will just remain between the two of you.  Good Luck!|`|a1e2d7101918d2594211708e234882fbaa	No. Too many girls have gotten into trouble because of this.  It'll never happen to you though...|`|xTwWM6UFaa	sexy pictures are fot boyfriends you trust not to do naughty things with...so i suggest not sending him a pic.|`|fFBFDIpSaa	Don't send a sexy picture. You want a guy to like you for you, not your body. If you do that, he'll either stray away from you, thinking you're inappropriate, or he'll go after you to get to your body. It's not a safe thing to do.     What I would suggest is start emailing him/texting him or talking with him in person. It would give him an insight to your personality, what you should really be showing guys.    Also, what if the guy likes what he's sees, takes the picture, and posts it on the internet? Other guys will see...and some may even want you for their own. It's a dangerous thing to send a guy a picture like that. Save those sorts of pictures for your fiance.|`|Z7F6h8t5aa	No, you'll give him the wrong impression of you.|`|Xe6XVvf5aa	No Sexy pic shouldnt matter to him at all if he really need a pic of you that bad just send him regular pic no need to expose yourself!|`|9b7b6a295fcf6719be11cc7dbad52abfaa	no silly....  just text him and ask him if he thinks you cute or not.|`|J9uxN55Laa	ahhh.... HELL NO NO NO NO!!! Why? Because I did this many times and i noticed that someone later saw me and they like started making of me and telling bull s**t stuff and it was just a mess. And by the way you only say that you liked him, you didn't say that you loved him. And if you love him, then there's no reason why he should not understand you if you say no and honestly there's way much better things to do to show the love you have for him than doing that!!! And I think that the only thing this guy is looking in you is for sex! He only wants to use you for sex and I'm sure that he will later leave you. I don't think that he loves you, he just wants you for sex and use you. Is that what you want? I'm telling you cause I've passed threw this once. Trust me, but if you don't want to believe me and make yourself look like a **** and a b***h then go ahead. Not my choice, is your choice. IDK!! Do what you think is the best!! Good luck!! LOVE IS NOT SEX!!=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=...|`|XRy10CPDaa	if youre not naked i guess theres no harm...just dont make it obvious that youre trying to be "sexy"|`|6PVFDHnzaa	depends. if you are ok with him showing it to all of his other guy friends then have at it. that's the inside circle these days for guys to get girls to send them sexy pics and then they do there "guy thing" and the pic gets sent around.     personally, if you have to send a guy a sexy pic to get him to notice you then your putting your own self down. let a guy who truly thinks your amazing with your cloths on, come to you. then you'll know he really likes you for you and not just your your body. :) hope that helps.
5PBfj1EEaa	i know what you're feeling. i'm having the same situation with my best friend, we go back and forth from being friends to being a lil more. it is rather confusing but i think it happens that way because we're best friends. we have such a great friendship that what we have when it gets taken passed the friendship stage we dont let it affect the friendship. the part that takes you to the next level is because of how strong of a friendship u have. u feel that comfort and security that you can express yourself no matter what it is and that developes affection and attraction. dont know if that helps but thats what happens with me and my friend|`|nIzhk3dJaa	Well it seems as through being in a relationship with her doesn't work but you can always just have fun while you're in between relationships. I'm not gonna say friends with benefits but that's basically whats happening.     That really happens sometimes, you can't work out when you're actually boyfriend and girlfriend but you like each other on and off.    It's fine. haha  as long as this sort of relationship works for both of you then there's nothing wrong with it.|`|h35tvTR8aa	Kiss Her|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	use each other while youre in between relationships|`|Nxvkwz3Baa	Maybe guys want to like each other but it's just not working out whenever you guys try to date, because it just seems awkward. Maybe you guys are afraid that if dating does end up in a bad breakup, you two won't be best buds anymore......  It's a difficult situation. You're just going to have to do what feels rights. Whether you are willing to put effort into a relationship and maintain friendship in case a bad breakup does occur..... or just set aside your feelings and simply be friends.
h9z1DRUyaa	definitely not, especially after she did that to you. you'll just end up hurting yourself more|`|hSOYndoxaa	I would not want to be friends with her. Leave her alone. You can do much better.|`|3RDOPzGeaa	nope. it never works out.|`|sC0jiUYDaa	I mean, you could be friends with her alttle, cause she really did break your heart by cheating right? So I think you should be a little nice to her, and be her tiny friend, but not friends, and not great friends.
fNdKyJGeaa	No get a new friend. A friend is a person who you get along with all the time and never have fights. Your scenario is not a real friendship. Sorry to say.|`|Hx47O8llaa	haha yes that's normal.   don't worry.    p.s thats how I am with my frnds.     |`|2esGKO2Caa	Yep The Definition of a friend is a person that knows everything about you ,but still likes you anyway. I would try to keep the fighting to a minimum however.|`|hRXGHnnNaa	sure....|`|bKwQyCEHaa	Yeah its normal all friends fight all friend cry and we all have our ups and our downs!!!!!!!!!!! :]|`|L4RAKdbSaa	yes veryy|`|sR7jM0UCaa	Of course. That's what makes your friendship much stronger.  =]    Best wishes|`|IaIl5xuHaa	totally i am going through the same thing , we hate eachother right now.|`|1qXLDOiPaa	thats soo normal ...   its probably cuz when you know someone for a loong time you kinda get tired of them so you try to stay away from them but when you actually have love for eachother then its really hard to stay out of each others lives!! i hope ya'll stay friends!! :D|`|uzVMSVJpaa	i almost have the same problem !  :O  im in 8th gr too [btw]  we fight ove rteh stupidest smallest stuff...  we go days without tlking, weeks?  she comes to me whn she needs me, so do i..  we try to be SUPER BESTIES again, but now were jst friends.? best friends?  its not normal, cause it hurts both of yu..and thts nvr good..  but she is your friend....maybe thts the way yer friendship is...  but if yu ever think its jst too much, maybe decide to jst be friends?      gahh, i dnt think i helped.. O___O    srry :P|`|u5RlhfF6aa	That's strange... you like arguing with her, then making up?    I dunno, maybe it's a relief factor in your brain when you make up that is making you happy. But, don't push her out. It's genuine friendship. It has its ups and downs, and that's okay.    Friends are meant to feel things together, and it's pretty neat you two can be so okay after a year or so.|`|plJ4GFSOaa	Yes -- PERFECTLY normal. This tells me that you and your friend are very, very close to one another. All friends have differences, and therefore all friends have ups and downs, and even times when it hurts to be around each other.     Coming to a disagreement in a friendship is also normal...how much do you guys talk about what separated you two after you come back together? It might be time to consider working out your differences so that you break up a little less. :)     I wouldn't say it's perfectly normal, exactly, to love the rollercoaster nature of your friendship with this other person, but I must say, if you two keep coming back to each other as friends after a falling-out, you're obviously destiny pals!    Please continue to have a wonderful relationship with your friend with less breakups!     Kat|`|Eez1cQfEaa	Yes this is normal for girls. Not for guys, it will seem gay. But for girls it is okay. you two obviosly know each other enough to do this. If you did this with a new friend, she will be totally freaked out. Dont mes thing up by fighting to much or not talking over long periods of time,like 2-3 years. Try not to lose her, i know how it feels to lose a close friend.|`|GdnsL5E1aa	Almost the same thing happened to me! I didn't speak to my one of my buddies for three years, then i saw him in high school (we had a huge fight the three years back, thats why we stopped talking) and we hit it off like we just hung out the night before. Completely Normal! Sometimes friendships can't really be explained, but it is fine!|`|k8zvtOifaa	Me and my friend are exactly the same. Its normal. She has tried to push me out of her life, and I the same. And we have been out of each others life's at one stage but really, I partically broke down when we weren't friends. I guess I didn't notice how much I actually wanted her in my life. We've been best friends since we were 4! She probably knows me, better than anyone, and I know her better than anyone too. I'm always going to be there for her and her for me. I guess the up's and down's are what make friendships genuine. Whats a real friendship without never fighting?  :)|`|Qe5k0iLLaa	yeah thats totally normal (:|`|CwFVgcGbaa	Well, sure. Not to be rude.. but i guess be a little more mature and im sure you guys wont bicker anymore.    Ive learned the hard way. Now i act older than what i am.   meaning im mature.|`|ulmzCJ5aaa	yeah, you dont really wanna push her out, you have to accept that|`|CSFlbIKAaa	Totally normal! Just a unique, but very strong friendship. Consider yourself lucky to be involved with such a good relationship. Good luck =]|`|ZR25pTOYaa	u two NEED space from each other|`|UE9Jq7H2aa	It's perfectly normal. I have a friend just like that. Don't worry about it. Good Luck! =]|`|8szFciqnaa	You are both just having one of the most real and greatest friendships because no matter waht happens or what you both do to each other you will both always be there for each other and stick together no matter how harsh you treat each other.|`|NLkiaIIUaa	yes thats how every friend relationship goes|`|J1bjIJ13aa	lool me and my bestfriend used to be the same ! Yes , you guys need each other so thats why you guys always want to patch up again .. its normal (:|`|AcWx41gQaa	Well there is that saying that "birds of a feather flock together" it's a common thing for people who have similar issues like yours. Although there are people who you see in "happily ever after" stories where they're just the best of friends and never get into a single tough spot, while there are those of the exact opposite, which in this case, your situation. It's not as common as the former, but there are those who Simply seem to step on the wrong foot constantly yet still be the best of friends, and because of your long experience with this person, you have developed a strong sense of connection, of course this is just a generalized statement best to describe your situation to a person who isn't taking psychology. It's perfectly normal in the way that you never truly want that person out of your life forever, it's more rather subconscious that conscious thought. It's really more about the connection you see from a loving mother to her infant, no matter how fussy the baby gets and no matter how upset the mother becomes, you eventually calm down, think it over, although there is still resentment and troubled water, you still have this connection which no matter what happens you tend to just get back to them. Again to answer your question it's perfectly normal. Not every body's life is a fairy tail you'll bound to have something that seems out of the norm.
uhW7pqKcaa	It might be the routinesometime it seems like the days repeat itself over & over. Find something that would break the routine; participate in some activity or try something you usually wouldnt do.    A very helpful thing would be surrounding yourself with good support system; friends & familyif for any reason you dont have any, then participating in an activity would allow you to meet new friends.    Hopefully that helps.|`|aDl1kZa6aa	Can't really help you if you don't know why you're sad lol just be happy and smile :)|`|5XyBxxYAaa	Maybe you are a little depressed, see your GP.  You could think about a hobby, join a club, gym etc and make new friends.  Exercise releases serotonin in the brain which makes you feel happy.  Give it a go you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

WZVz5jWHaa	Take a calendar down and assign a specific task(s) for specific days and you should be able to organize your time better.  If that does not work, rearrange for better days/times.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	This is what me and my cousin do right now were both stay at home moms.    Every Sunday I clean my bathrooms from top to bottom.   I do laundry when ever a hamper starts getting full so I stay on top of it so it don't pile up.  I sweep the carpets and mop the floors every Monday and Friday. This way it stays cleaner for some reason.  I go shopping in the morning to avoid big crowds and before I go shopping I clean out the fridge and freezer every week before going to the store. I take everything out and wipe the inside and put everything back in.  I dust every Wed this might all sound weird but trust me if you get you a plan and stick to it your house stays in tip top shape.  I also never leave dishes to be done later in the sink. I wash as I'm cooking and right after we eat.   This all works for my household very well.|`|3secB3Smaa	you are your own boss now. you are in charge. it is your new job. You can do it .|`|AA11674544	Hi, yes, you need a schedule. The BEST website is www.flylady.com. she has excellent advice and she will tell you exactly what to do to keep your home organized. Also, she has a woman named Leanne something that has a cookbook called "Saving Dinner" it is great! It will help you plan meals every week. I like to work for 2 hours in the morning and then about 15 minutes at night to clean house. It used to take me 3 hours, but I am getting better at it, and I think it will eventually take me only an hour as I get more efficient. Things that take up time is looking for supplies and running out of stuff or getting overwhelmed and stopping. Good luck! Have fun, and don't forget to schedule time for you alone once a week!|`|CyS0OlOzaa	Being a stay at home mom is not hard at all.Housecleaning does not take long to do.If you clean daily it only takes a couple hours a day and then you can do whatever you want to do.YOu can work part time or join your local ymca or some club and have some fun during the day too.I know this from experiences,I have cleaned all my life ,not only my home but others as well.It is an easy task to do.Don't panic.Women are born to do this.Good Luck.
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	If it doesn't sell before our wedding we will be using my fiance's 1966 Ford Fairlane.  Which we will drive.  If it does sell before our wedding, we will probably end up using my car - 2006 Chevy HHR.    We are asking our wedding party to drive themselves as well.    Why?  Because renting a car or cars and paying a few hundred bucks for it is something we cannot afford at this time.  I was unemployed last year for a couple months, my fiance is unemployed now.  We are hoping he will have a job before we need to cancel our current plans because we need the wedding savings for our day-to-day expenses.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	(Oh, 'badmonkey', I'm so jealous you are getting married at the Banff Springs Hotel!! It's so beautiful there!)    We wanted all of our attendants and us to be together, so we rented a really nice white van - there were 10 adults. Plus, I had a big, traditional wedding gown, so it was nice to not have it squished.  We travelled together from my mom's house to the ceremony, then for photographs, back to my mom's for a break, then on to the reception.|`|AA10378447	You have to think about what type of style your wedding is, and what you like. Do you want a classic Bentley, do you want a more modern limo like a Hummer, or a classic limo? Some other type of sports car? A convertible? There are a lot of possibilities. Some may be limited on what you can get in your area, and of course, what you're willing to pay for.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	We will be booking an Executive Bus. Fancy word for party bus, something like this:  http://www.123limo.ca/party-bus/    My fiance and I both have large families and don't want them or our bridal party to have to drive that day at all.    The cost is around $1,700.00 (CDN) for the day. Which is a great price for transportation for approx. 22 people.    We booked 1 year in advance of our wedding date.|`|7CKipTZOaa	We are simply decorating my own car which is a hybrid and having a friend chaffeur us around, its more environmentally sound, and two family vans will also be decorated for the guests (very small family only affair), transportation is just not something I see as necessary but you could probably rent a mini bus or limo for the entire bridal party if you really want it|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	We rented a hummer limo six hours.  The wedding party and I drove to the church in the limo.  Then hubby and I from the church to the park for pictures.  From the park to the reception hall.   I booked it three months before the wedding.     I loved it. It was a lot of money.  But I love my pictures with hubby and I on the limo.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I didn't think we needed any fancy transportation but my fiance's one request that he stood firm on was that we have a nice limo. So he was put in charge of finding the limo. He booked a 15-passenger limo to pick me and my girls and my mom up at my house and take us to the church. Then it takes the entire bridal party and parents to the reception. It seems like a waste of money to me, I feel that the mini van my mom has would work just fine but he insisted and I am told it looks nice in pictures. My brother had a classic car, a 1944 Pontiac something, it looked really nice. You kind of have to work with what fits the number of people you have to transport and also fits your budget.    Other ideas:  trolley car  mini bus  sporty convertible  classic car  Rolls Royce  horse and carriage  horse drawn buckboard    Good luck!|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	We opted to use my husband's car. It's nothing special, just a nice car. We paid for our wedding ourselves and decided that since nobody would see what car we drove anyways, we chose to spend the money we would have spent for a different car on our honeymoon. You figure, we left the church after everyone else (since we did our pictures after the ceremony at the church) and we got to the reception site where everyone was already inside.    *We were considering a classic, chauffered Bentley. Gorgeous cars!|`|gli7SbBoaa	My fiance and I are having our wedding at his parents' house.  We're just going to drive down there and everyone else can drive themselves.  I know it might sound mean but it's cheaper to print out directions than it is to pay for a car to pick everyone up and bring them back.  I find it pointless to rent or borrow or whatever you call it a car just to drive to and from.  Of course I drove myself to my prom so  there you are.|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	We took seperate cars to the ceremony. I rode in my parents car.  My girls rode in my car.  My husband drove his car, and the guys went in their own car.  On the way to the reception, we rode in my husband's car with the best man driving.  We did not have a lot of money, and it was not something that we could justify spending hundreds of dollars for a few minutes getting to the church and the reception.  It would have been nice to have a limo, but was not practical for us.  No one said anything negative about not having a fancy car to go in.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Nothing - we're having the ceremony & reception at the Banff Springs and everyone is staying over there the night before and the night of, so there's no transportation needed!
qVgr5OBeaa	I think it is how you feel about the tradition of not seeing each other before the ceremony. It is personal beliefs and preference.    It sounds like this is the right way to do it for you. If it will feel more right for you doing it this way then go for it! If you cry then you can fix your makeup before the ceremony and the two of you might not be quite as nervous when you say your vows.     I think it sounds like a good idea because you will be able to savor the moment. When you walk down the aisle and say your vows it can all be a big blur (or that is what I have heard from most people).    Supposedly it is bad luck, but of course all the wedding traditions are superstitions. The veil, the color white, the bouquet, the bridesmaids, the groomsmen, the rings, the flower girl are all part of superstitions.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	Actually, a woman I coach with did this, and she said it was the best decision they had made.  She said, he cried, and she doubted he would have had everyone been there- it was so special to her.  She said it was the most amazing feeling, and it was only for the two of them to share.      The way they did it was, he had his back to her and she walked up behind him, tapped his shoulder and they were both in tears, she said it was great pictures too.  I am honestly thinking about doing this.  It seems awesome, and I wont have to miss ALL of the cocktail hour.    EDIT: and by the way.  She said it didn'tt take away from the magical feeling they had when he first saw her walking down the aisle.  Regardless of if he saw her in her dress or not, he still realized at that moment she was walking down the aisle to HIM, and that they were going to vow to spend their lives together.  That was enough to make the moment special.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	oh I think that's a baaaaaaaaaaaad idea.  aside from bad luck, which I don't put much stock in, I just believe the groom should have no idea about the dress before the ceremony.  the look on the groom's face is always priceless when he sees the bride for the first time with complete hair, veil, makeup, flowers, etc.  make sure the photog has a clear shot of his face as you're coming down the aisle, or an assistant who can focus on the groom while he focuses on you during the ceremony.    instead of a first look, have engagement photos taken and use them at the reception, on favors, or save the date cards or your engagement announcement in the paper.  just wear plain clothes for that.  out of all the weddings I've been to I only know 2 brides that had pre-wedding formal pics taken in their dresses and the groom was NOT there.|`|nqINitkmaa	I am a firm believer that the groom should not see his bride until she walks down the aisle. So no I don't think its a good idea.|`|55zWUXcUaa	I like the fact that the first time my fiance is going to see me in my gown will be when I am walking down the aisle.  The ceremony should be when emotions and anticipation are at their highest so I feel like it's a big deal for my fiance's "first look" to be when I am walking down the aisle towards him.  He feels the same way as well he doesn't want to know what I am wearing at all, if someone asks a question about my gown he leaves the room!  He doesn't even want to know about the gowns I didn't choose.    A pro for the first look pictures though would be that as you said it would be very intimate.  That is really the only one I could think of though.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Well I am a practical woman and had no problem having photographs done before the wedding.  I did not want my photographer to rush, and I did not want to leave my guests waiting at the reception for an hour while we get our church photos done and the bridal party and family shots too.    My sister is getting photos done before the ceremony too.|`|Cjof0OLtaa	if i survey all the married people i know regarding this, it will be a 50-50 answer.     you should take into considerationt the timeline for your wedding.  for afternoon/evening weddings, a first look would be great.  for example for my wedding (which will start at 9:30 am), a first look at let's say 8 am would just be stressful for both of us.      also for some cultures, letting the groom see the bride before the actual ceremony is a no-no.      so i guess it really depends on you and your fiance.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	We did photos before the ceremony, and it was just fine.  He still cried when I walked up the aisle.  I was still excited and happy.  Our photos of me walking up and he greeting me are great.  Having seen each other earlier didn't diminish the moment in the least.    My husband moved in with me a couple of weeks before the wedding, so the not seeing each other before the ceremony thing would have been difficult.  It was comforting for both of us to have the other around, and did a lot to calm my husband's nerves (he's more emotional than I am).    It also was much easier to have most of the posed photos done before the ceremony.  We also did the family photos before the ceremony, and they could then enjoy the cocktail hour.  Our venue was an unusual setting, and a guide took us around the area to have photos taken on the gorgeous grounds after the ceremony.  That was also easier to do with the family photos already done.|`|ACecbVghaa	I want my fiance to enjoy the anticipation of seeing me walk down the aisle. We are very traditional and I want that walk to be the first time he sees his wife in her wedding dress. I want his reaction as I walk toward him to be genuine and amazed. I am not one to want to have an encounter beforehand, the aisle walk loses some magic to me. But if you both think this is a good idea, go for it. To each his own!|`|MG8MwZrIaa	I don't think it's really bad luck to do it, but we have chosen not to.  He wants to see me in my dress for the first time as I'm walking down the aisle, and I want to see him for the first time in his tux then too.  I can't wait to look out over the grass and see him over there, looking back at me.  Sometimes I imagine myself not being able to wait and running over, dragging my poor dad behind me!!  Haha... But if you guys think it's something you really want to do then go ahead!  A lot of people do it as a great time-saver, so they don't miss out on their cocktail hour.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	Actually, I enjoyed the anticipation of seeing my groom standing at the end of the aisle waiting for me.  The look on his face was priceless, and something I'll always treasure.  My photographer actually got his expression and mine in photos.   I'll also remember my feelings of seeing him for the first time.  I still get butterflies thinking about it now. And the fact that our eyes were locked on each other during my walk down the aisle. And the realization that all our plans and dreams were finally coming true. Trust me-you don't want to miss that.
fH0cZIy1aa	I think you should go for it. Talk with him some more then exchange phone numbers. This could be a great way to get over your ex. I know it must've been hard for you two to break up but wasn't those 9 months worth it? I've currently dating a man online and we're both really happy. Our first year anniversary will be in two months and he might be able to visit me. Just take it slow and try really hard to get really attached too fast. Just incase things dont work out. Good luck and don't let the dumb people on here get you down. We never asked to fall in love online.|`|1R1tYAbPaa	Sure why not if your interested talk on the phone. If you want to be extra safe either block your phone number and / or get a disposable cell phone. Maybe safer if you call him that way he doesn't have your number.  What do you have to lose from a phone call?

apbuHIJOaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask. By asking, you can be sure the answer is sincere as it came directly from said person (unless they lie).

KwNpyp3saa	Does your mom receive any kind of income? Does she depend on you financially or does she just want a little extra spending money to have? If it is the latter than you are going to have to explain it to her again. If she still doesn't understand then you are just going to have to accept this. There is nothing you can do. I am in my late 30's, married and have kids and my mom still tries to tell me what to do. It's just they care about us so much and want the best for us. They don't want to see us hurting or doing without.     If the former is true and she does depend on you financially you should see about getting her on social security. There are other programs available. Just google low income assistance. I wish you luck.     Side note: It is easier to read when it is not in all caps.
AA12278670	Are you sure you want to lock in this chick? We would love an early ask, but only as long as its a sure one--don't want to be left hanging after denying others only to have you change your mind at the last minute...but, if you're sure...ask on a Friday, that way the girl will be so excited she'll be wanting to go shopping that weekend and start her search for the perfect prom dress! ;)

He is being unfair.    Do not acknowledge the step family  Tell him he is still invited to your wedding and the new wife (you have to do that if you want him there).  No invite to any step siblings.  I am sorry.  Very tacky of your father to allow this.  He should have told the step daughter he was previously committed to pay for your wedding and could not help her.

I wouldn't go to the darn wedding, furthurmore, I wouldn't feel guilt or any other emotion, neither do you have to invite anyone you don't need to be at your weding. do what makes you happy. don't worry that she set her date before yours, just dismiss all those little stuff and concentrate on your day. your dad is a different matter. how to handle that, I have no idea. well, either you confront him about it and mabe he might think you are petti or you don;t and let it continue eating at you. be gentle with him. he probably don't know how it's affecting you, don't think he is doing anything wrong.|`|AA11138696	You do not need help.

Your stepsister had every right to pick the day that she wanted and it has nothing to do with you and your day.  The date is two years from now.  You could save up enough to attend if you wanted to do so but you don't so be honest.    Your dad is slipping you money you say yet you also say you are hurt because he wants to help pay for the step sister and not you.  I thought he was giveing you money.  You also said that you told him that it was not necessary for him to pay for your wedding so what are you beefing about?

But he should not neglect you in any way for your his true daughter.  Sincerely talk with your dad about your feelings.  If he does not want to help you and chooses to support the wedding of your step sister over yours, good riddance.  Move on and start your life with your man and be a better parent to your kids when you have them.  Just send your step sister a card, congratulating her, but then letting her know you can't make.

jD0nfrIBaa	Screw that!  You're his girlfriend.  If he was having a party, you should be first on the list, whether it's supposed to be a guy or girl party.  If he didn't want you to be there, I think that's bullcrap.  That's bad enough.  If he honestly invited some other chick though, after making a big deal about it being a guy party...wow.  You should be completely pi.ssed off.  I wouldn't put up with it.  It looks like he would rather spend time with her than with you...almost like he enjoys her company a little more.      Confront him about it.  Tell him how you feel.  If he still acts like this...then I dunno.  I'd be suspicous.  If your dude would invite her and not you...there are some issues here.  Don't stand for it.|`|KifasiMraa	Having an all guy party, I would understand, but saying that and then inviting another girl?  Sketchy.  He's lying to you and that's not cool.  Its up to you to decide if you want a relationship with someone whose willing to lie to you.|`|KPR0tQtfaa	i would definitely talk to him. thats a little hypocritical of him to say its an all guys things then invite your best friend who is a girl.|`|6QmKgpZUaa	I don't think you're paranoid.  I think it's weird that he would tell you that you can't come because it's a guy party and then invite you friend.  Maybe you should just ask him why she can come and you can't.|`|AA11577613	lol its ok im like tat too! lol nobody should tell you if you should be mad or not... it all depends on what YOU think. BUT if it was me I'd me mad as hell! if its a "guy" thing than why would he invite a girl... maybe he doesnt want you to go because you'll feel left out and like he's ignoring you, that's what my man tells me. You know how us girls are and we like to be with our hubby sometimes all "lovy dovy" lol by that i mean you like to be next to him with his arm around you you know stuff like tat, but if it really bothers you talk to him, every relationship should be open and honest, that's one of the most important things.. just tell him why you cant go and why he said its a guy's thing if he invited a girl|`|xTQPiA6Yaa	I would ask him why he didn't invite you and invited her because if he said it was a guys party then i don't understand if he invited her but i hope everything works out! good luck!      ... (Superbowl is going to suck this year! no one good is in it!)|`|jpMoKkAkaa	she probably likes bukake|`|VBZjzR1saa	yes u shud b mad cuz if he can invite a gurl  2 his so called "guy party" dan u shud b able 2 go 2 bt dat jus me bt it also depend on how much u lik him 2 so think bout it
OBLFw6Claa	i have the same exact problem ! i told her i can be friends with whoever i wanna be friends with and i ll find out for myself if they are really that bad. later on, she told me that she doesn't really care if im friends with her. ur friend is your firend.if she was really your friend she would let you be friends with the people you wanna be friends with.HOPE THIS HELPED ! (:|`|AA10455206	Well I would try it for myself and if your friend is right, you will find out with time and if not, you would have gained some new friends.|`|M91KFwdgaa	be friends with that person if you want to!  just because your friend doesn't like that person doesn't mean you don'tt have to like them ether. that person ha not done anything to so maybe you should just give them a chance and see what happens.  don't be a follower choose your own friends and don'tnt let your friends choose who you can talk to.

Pathetic.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I think you need to begin wearing old man nappies|`|3QpAqd1xaa	that is weird, if she likes you enough then she will be ok and will understand, if now she will be so scared she wont want to see you again|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	uh huh, i bet. well if this is real, i think you blew your chance, and you should see a doctor about that|`|GAMypxIFaa	I would have puked on you!|`|c4a36c088096bec045e2051f20d57305aa	You pooped on her coach, he's probably madder than she is.|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	say sorry|`|7miBbkR1aa	LMAO wtf....is this a joke or are you srs? if your serious then theres a very high chance your little fling is over|`|Ir8YhECQaa	hahah!

"you wanna go get a bite to eat? i promise not to **** myself this time, just no spicy food ok?"     joke about it one time, then let it go and forget about it.     if she isnt interested anymore, let it go.|`|3bzKMy8haa	doubt it

pDqsFgjyaa	I'm a guy, and it's still hard to tell. It would all depend on if he still has another girlfriend or not..|`|Pg3voqXkaa	I think he's interested in sleeping with you...either that or he's just generally a nice guy.  If he's been doing those gestures lately, like holding the door open for you when he didn't before and he's with someone right now...he's probably just looking for have fun with you.|`|dNJG3EDCaa	HE WANTS TO GET INTO YOUR PANTS OoO|`|euOtDB3Baa	If it took him that long to come around, I don't know how much I'd trust it.

If you are just going on looks then you are shallow and you should let him go because he deserves something better. If you like him for other reasons (which i doubt because you are asking us and our basing your opinion on his stupidity and looks) then you should date him or talk to him about it.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Not necessary but a nice bonus if you can afford it. The planner does all of the legwork and saves you a lot of time. But it is easy to do it yourself if you have time to do it.     Good luck!|`|0Id85yiYaa	depends on the wedding. it's necessary for my wedding b/c i'm getting married in another country. as far as having a local wedding, if it makes your life easier and you can afford one, why not? i actually like DIY'ing it, so i wouldn't do it.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	not at all.  my daughter's getting married this year and she & i are doing the planning.  takes a lot of research, so be sure you have the time and stamina for it!    also the venue you choose can offer a lot of help, so be sure to take that into account in choosing the place for your big day...make sure you click with their coordinator.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	If you have the budget for one. They can be expensive but have all the contacts and coordiante everything. If you can't afford one, go to www.thebigday.com there's tons of great tips and planning help|`|k6F9zkIRaa	I don't think it is necessary. I personally don't have the money for a wedding planner and I'd rather plan it myself with my relatives help. The only way I'd get a wedding planner is on the day of my wedding so no one has to worry about all the details and can just relax and have fun! But it's completely up to you, if you can afford it and you need the help/don't have time for a lot of the planning then hire one! Good Luck!|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	no, if you get married at a place, they make it really easy now.|`|FfeKzUycaa	It depends on your needs.  Wedding planners are very helpful and can keep the families from fighting over who does what, etc.  Wedding planners will also help you break down your contract and point out things you may not see or understand.  Some places recommend that your vendors have insurance, etc and your planner can help bridge the gap between your vendors and your venue location.  Also, they will run the day of for you so that you and your family can relax and enjoy the wedding without having to work.|`|ZadDprTxaa	No it is not.  if you know what you want then you can can go about getting it yourself, or recruiting friends and family to help you get it.   While I understand the purpose of a planner, I think many people get them because they feel they are supposed to.  Make a thorough to do list and be sure to prioritize things, then assign them to people who are going to help you out.  Just be sure to stay on top of things (and people) to make sure they are getting done the things you want them to get done in a timely matter.  Good Luck!

It's sort of like a very sisterly bond. But what they have to think about is when one of them passes away, and then what will they do? They can't be too dependent on each other or other people.|`|p4EllAkBaa	i have a fraternal twin, we still look insanely like-but we're not identical.  We do do a lot together but nothing to this point, we're actually very indapendant. But because of growing up together, doing so many thing together my sister has never learned to properly talk to strangers/ask for advice, and i've found it kind of hard to trust people.      Have you ever had a frinend who you felt insanely close to? Well they feel the same way-i guess they did get married-to each other (not in that kind of grose way) but in a way that's like they prefer the lvoe of a sister over the lvoe of any one else.    The fact that they have to be togetehr 24/7 isn't entirely healthy, i'll admit.
HOK5C8n4aa	If you just want a temporary fix, ask a jeweler to put a ring guard on the ring that is too big, they can probably connect the two, but a ring guard is a cheap and temporary fix, usually 5-10 bucks.    If you want it sized, ask the jeweler if they have time to do a rush.  Depending on the jeweler it would usually cost $20+ in addition to the size down.  If you call around and are very nice about it and make an appointment, you should be able to slide in.  Some jewelers would especially do this in this economy, because they hope if they please you now, they can get you in for more jewelry purchases later.  It doesn't take long to size a ring, depending on the material, usually about 10-15 minutes, it's usually just the work load that makes it take so long.|`|ZbCLP2Kxaa	You could get them soldered (melted) together so they never slide around and are always facing the right way.|`|DqetlSB6aa	You can have it sodered together|`|aOd0Djkaaa	I did see something at Walgreens yesterday, but I forgot the name of it.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	yes, have it resized to fit property (try jared -- www.jared.com for location) and then soldered.  that's the typical thing to do.|`|fUBWB88laa	Well you should have your wedding band on your finger first and then your engagement ring behind that. So then I guess it would fall off, but honestly if it's that much bigger, I'd get it resized. There are jewelers who will resize it in a day....you just have to find them. That's really the only (SAFE) option you have unless you want to have them soldered together but then the jeweler will tell you that you should have your e-ring sized down.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	the do have a plastic thing at walmart that might help its to help ur rings stay on if there to big but there a real pain i would just give it up for 3 weeks to have it sized

ebc5e2e4098b7079e0c6cfb2ee412605aa	When 25 people tell you "NO" and not 1 single person tells you to pursue it, I truly hope you get the point........    You've asked this question 4 times now, and EVERY single person has given you the same answer:  "No!"    I can't believe you're actually thinking of doing this?  1st, HR will know you're primarily doing this to try and get her in trouble as a last-ditch low blow. It would be hard for them to even take you seriously.  2nd, if she is leaving in a week, HR wouldn't even have time to fully investigate before she is gone. If they process a term form for her, they aren't going to write her up after a term form is already in process.  3rd, you'll be scrutinized for all your past emailings. It is kind of HR's job to eliminate idle employees (haven't you heard of the millions of job cuts in the past year???) Employees who have a lot of time to email will be 'watched' -- or on the mental list of HR.    It was actually a nice thing of her to care enough to say goodbye, and to try and leave on a good note.  You are either 1) young (professionally immature) or 2) old and cranky|`|5BOZ2ryLaa	Let it go.  Holding on to past grievances does nothing to improve your life.  She's moving on to a new company; why cause trouble for her now?|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	No, you would be a rat!|`|vWrpyzQZaa	I would ignore it and let her leave. If there is another communication, I'd report it, but give it a week.

fLF2VM8uaa	It is a little different for men than it is for women. There really is no "bad in bed" for us. Sex is good. Bad sex, for us, is an oximoron.    That said, there are things that make sex better. The single best thing you can do for a man in bed is be willing to do what comes up next. The more things you are willing to do the better off the sex will be for him. Taking things off the table (e.g., "I'm not doing that") takes away from the experience, because in the heat of the moment that may become what he wants.     I think most men like the idea of women making some type of noise. Laying silently is almost universally not so good. Communicating that you are having a good time or you are enjoyuing sex is an art and a huge turn on. Saying, "That feels so good!" is probably better than nothing, but usually not as good as making sounds that indicate you are having a good time.     Everyone wants to feel desired. Letting him know you want him before and during sex is always going to make for a better experience.     Other than that different men like different things and what works for one man may not work for another.|`|eO8dsJvJaa	lose some weight.

AA10952386	You already seem to have your doubts, so I wouldn't do it.    If there are too many differences in how you want to run a business, that will cause a big problem. Him being a good friend has nothing to do with the way he conducts his business and the deicisions he makes professionally.     If it isn't difficult to have a trial period and merge temporarily, you can do that. But take all your differences into account and the problems that might come up. If your losses are worse than your gains, that's your answer.
zzaScg0haa	I wouldn't if I were you
f6YsGOynaa	I don't think any judge in his right mind would penalize you for the fact that your ex-husband is an idiot.      It sounds to me like you have a good chance of fighting this.  However, have you tried pushing this through with your insurance company?  It's the policy of most insurance companies to deny all claims at first, but if you're persistent, you may win.  It won't cost you any money, but it may cost you a lot of time on the phone and doing the legwork.    ETA:  Is he invoicing you himself or does he have invoices from the provider?  If he does not have invoices/receipts, he may be trying to bilk you.  Be sure HE has the appropriate documentation.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	oh, and by the way, how's your daughter doing?|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You should be able to file on the insurance since your child is insured. Send them the invoices he sent you. What he is probably going to do is collect half from you, then file on the insurance and he'll make out like a bandit. Let him take you to court. Tell the court that he has insurance and won't use it. They won't do anything to you, and he will have wasted more money!|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Your Ex was negligent. He should foot the bill for the first 10 appointments.
4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Why don't you just try calling the court house and asking?    Are you sure you're mature enough to get married if you don't even know how to use a phone book, pick up the phone and ask a question?|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	I believe that you need to get a marriage license.  When you get that (check your the city you are getting married in for the length of time it is good for) ask them to schedule you and your boyfriend's wedding.  You will need witnesses, pry at least 2 other people.  It is just very official.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	When you go get your marriage license they will give you days and times a judge marries at the court house. Some do it for free usually others might charge a very small fee. If you don't have witnesses they will have people there anyway so you don't really need to bring your own with you.    My husband and me did this.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I don't think you have to have anything but a whiteness there. My sister got married at the court house and that is all she had to have. We live in tennessee and things may be different here though. Hope it helped. Congratulations!|`|a4uru6nbaa	ya you do need witnesses you need two of them|`|Slr6jtMGaa	my brother and his wife got married a year ago at the court house....all they did was dress nice....go up there....and they did it....and yes..you do need witnesses......also, if you want more fam there....then it is possible....you just have to tell the people at the court first|`|evlzeZohaa	Getting married in a court house is very common and all you need is your everyday clothing.You will have to sit in front of a computer and fill out the papers then take them to the first available window. The Clergy will preform the ceremony as soon as you fill out the paperwork. Not a problem. A wittiness is not needed there.
C2olZsNiaa	I think as long as they can still do it then they will.  My mother..hold up I just threw up in my own mouth...said that her 60 something year old husband still wanted it more then she did.
HZ7Dlz3kaa	it doesn't matter.  engagement rings come in all forms.  yours probably looks more like a wedding band tho - wither way it sends the same message - you are taken|`|0jUGSaZPaa	No, of course not!!

Whatever ring he gave you when he proposed IS your engagement ring - it doesn't have to look a certain way or be made of a certain material or cost a certain amount.    Plenty of women don't get engagement rings at all - because of money, because they don't like jewelry, etc. All that matters is that he asks and you say yes - THAT is the engagement. Not the jewelry.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	That is a personal thing between you and your fiance.  My sister didn't even have an engagement ring!  She was not interested in having one, so they skipped that.  If you like your silver ring, then that is all that matters.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it doesn't matter a bit.  and it's just a tradition anyway. you can still be engaged without a ring for that matter.  if you want the symbol, you can wear a cigar band if you want. (lol)|`|oMIxJTO1aa	just because its sterling silver doesn't mean it isn't a real engagement ring, engagement rings can be made of silvers, golds, and platinum, and yes you wear it the same as any engagement ring haha.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	In the end it doesn't matter what kind of ring you have. If he proposed to you (will you marry me) and gave you a ring. If you and him are happy, then the ring doesn't matter.     The ring is just a symbol of one day you and him will be married. It could be a ring from a cereal box, as long as the two of you are in love and happy.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	it is not the cost of the ring that matter. it is the love behind it. my engagement ring did not cost that much and the diamond is only 1/4th of a carrot but I love it. he gave it to me with so much love. i will never upgrade my diamond|`|sLLgERQWaa	It only matters to the couple....good luck.|`|x1Jh7sCoaa	does that mean if you lose the ring, you're not engaged anymore?  silly question, you can be engaged without a ring dum dum|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Of course it doesn't matter what kind of ring it is, and whether you even get a ring.  It is the commitment behind it that matters.|`|RhNo30Ofaa	My fiancee got me a sterling silver ring at first until we could afford a diamond. I was engaged a whole year before I got the diamond. lol. It really matters what is in your heart. Who cares how much he spent on the ring, what it looks like, or if it has a HUGE diamond!!!..(or if he went to Jared's ;) lol)|`|Dv7340P0aa	Since you couldn't afford a real ring, you actually aren't engaged.    Once you fix that the engagement can start.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	shouldnt base it on cost, just that you have to look at it everyday, so make sure its something you like!|`|AA11293866	I have a really quick question: If you are on the streets, how are you even writing this?|`|CJHGKG1Faa	I guess it does matters to you...but the fact is that you can still get married even if you did not get one.  So if I did not get a gift on Christmas does it means Santa doesnt loves me :(  same thing here.  O well, it sucks he is cheap....|`|6q10fKXbaa	You can use what ever you want for your ring. Or not have one at all.    My mom didn't get her ring til I was 4... and they'd been married for 10 years.    You don't even really need wedding rings...
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You could have those sleeves or something similar added to a dress if you find a tnak style or sleeved one you do like. Or, have the entire dress made for you. Look in the pattern section at the fabric store under Costumes, they have Colonial period clothing patterns that look strikingly similar to this!    Good luck!|`|hkwBR1moaa	This one is pretty  http://www.edenbridals.com/2141-p-270.ht...  THis one is too...  http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...

Some designers that offer them are Katrina Marie and Uptight Clothing. Also the ladies at http://www.midnightgarden.com/wedding/bo... are helpful at finding that style since it fits with the theme of their community (medieval/Renaissance).|`|WzAHKILcaa	If that's exactly what you want then take the pic to a talented seamstress and she can make it for you exactly. Yes it'll probably cost more than David's Bridal but nothing compared to some of the really expensive alternatives.|`|7CKipTZOaa	http://www.medievalbridalfashions.com/go... , http://www.fairyfashion.de/frame.html  http://www.westchester-weddings.com/fash... the renaissance gown    my apologies if someone already posted this, http://www.alfredangelostores.com/Collec...   this is just a jacket with bell sleeves, that can be work over any strapless dress to give it that look :)|`|by9KuBizaa	These sites might be helpful:    http://www.westchester-weddings.com/fash...    http://www.lofbridal.com/weddinggowns.ht...  The first dress looks very similar,  Perhaps the designer/dressmaker could make the sleeves more lacey    http://www.lofbridal.com/gallery.html|`|fMFzwb9Laa	ebay.. no joke.|`|rxyRdd5Oaa	Here are a couple options:    http://www.bridesandjokers.com/Colonial_...  http://www.katrinamariedesigns.com/colon...      But I think your best bet would be to go try on dresses you like, especially ones with corsets similar to what you like, and you can always have a tailor edit the dress for you or create one from scratch.    good luck!
o8NPR0PNaa	I live 150 miles away from my family.  When my Dad was in the hospital, then the nursing home, I made sure I drove there and spent every Saturday with him.  Also called him couple times during week and nurses would prop the phone up to his ear so he could hear and talk, but they could escape.    When he was still at home, I made sure I visited him at least monthly.  In fact, I saw him more often than my brothers that lived nearby.  In short, I made sure that I got to see and talk to him as often as I could, when I still could.    Good luck!  Best wishes to you and yours!  ~ Suzi :)|`|1D2UiAJeaa	Damm that is hard. Try to get a ride from someone whenever you can. Call the hospital once in a while to check up on him and ask if you guys can talk. Not much you can do but hope he gets better.    Hope I Helped  09!!!|`|kGFtUZaiaa	Write him letters- every day, every time you miss him, anytime you need to tell him something just let the words flow through the pen and paper. Of course call when you can but writing is a long lost art that heals more than imagined- even if you never send him the letters pour your heart out- your worries, fears, anxiety, how much you love him- etc.. Good Luck and God Bless you and yours.
c52cbd262f9bbe8b25813042e1adaf6caa	While it's normal for most people to look for the approval of their parents when it comes to a future spouse, it is not necessary for you to be happy unless you base your entire existance on their opinion.  If you are an adult however, you will do what you please and marry the man you love, whether your parents like him or even ever meet him.  If your parents love you (which I'm sure they do), they will eventually come around because they will realize it is not worth losing a child over.|`|rcut6bhoaa	You are not marring your parents,  don't worry about them.

1YdeUn1Caa	Don't be silly.   My father smoked 3 packs a day around my sister and I, plus we had 3 grandparents smoke around us too. We turned out normal healthy kids. Don't listen to the lab rats or the non smokers. They're just paranoid.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	Obviously, it should not. Entire generations of kids were exposed to smoke in the home, in the car, and everywhere else. If the fears about secondhand smoke were accurate, there would be no one alive today. Thus, obviously, the fears and risks are overblown.    Child abuse is a serious matter, and a serious crime. If you make smoke exposure a crime, you are dooming untold thousands of children to foster care and many otherwise good parents to jail. The system can't handle it - there are already too many Americans in jail and too many kids without two parents.    Let it go.|`|9cBLKOe8aa	Where I'm from, Ontario Canada, you have to be 19 to be legal to smoke. Also if you're caught smoking in your vehicle with a child you will get a huge fine, and possibly a charge. They're trying (or may have already) banned smoking in homes with small children. That's tricky though because in your home you don't have people watching you to make sure you abide by the law.   It's a horrible thing when people smoke around children or when pregnant. I'm a smoker and I still think it's wrong. We know the effects smoking can cause and we should do what we can to prevent minors from being subjected to cigarette smoke.|`|XzScEyQZaa	Basically, yes it should be. You would not give a child alcohol or subject them to prolonged sessions of loud music would you?|`|yRbfz6Tcaa	In many ways, it's already portrayed as such.  Many nonsmokers believe it is.  Smokers, however, will ever defend their habit as completely harmless.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	there is no legal age in the UK to smoke you can smoke when you like you just cant buy fags till your 18.  well i think a person who smokes in the same room as a baby is a child abuser|`|zWB3jHHPaa	not really. but common sense would tell anyone that they shouldn't smoke around kids.  Not just cause its bad for them but if they look up to you and see you smoking they're gonna want to do it... i know that cause my little niece walked out and saw me smoking and ever since then, she keeps wanting me to let her "hold" a cig so she can "look cool" with me. It broke my heart but i still smacked her for saying it.. lol
PjjEpWw4aa	Throw her a party! Every teeanager loves parties!!|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	manicures/pedicure/beauty treatments|`|wscyjkPAaa	Hmmm... I think it is more important to her that you spend time with her because she's turning into a "teenager" and it means a lot to her.  I think any activity will be fun as long as you're there with her also having fun.  You should take her to a variety of places that you and her can both enjoy.  Maybe get both of your nails done and get them painted all silly.  Something harmless that adults would normally do but could also be fun for a kid.  I think your dinner idea is cool especially if its someplace where you have to dress up.  When I turned 13 my dad took my friends and I to an "All guys only" outing, a baseball game, then go karts and pizza, we flew kites at the park, and  a bb gun shooting range.  Nothing extravagant, but now I'm 28 and I still talk to my dad about that day when I shot better than him.  Just remember to take a lot of pictures.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	Throw a dance party with really cool lights.
dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Men are simple.  Sex works.|`|rcut6bhoaa	A BJ first thing in the morning always works.    Be attentive to his wants and needs.|`|aHjXZEzoaa	ummm...duh...they are guys!  sex...my man loves it when i text him that i am DYING to give him a ******* when i get home from work! (I just sent him that text like 5 minutes ago).....    cooking, cleaning too......|`|tZ4Kyc0Waa	Nice breakfest, nice lunch, nice dinner, no chores and a blow  job|`|asX2hxFXaa	We're guys....we really don't want anything done for us or bought for us.  What we do, we prefer to do ourselves.  What we want to buy, we prefer to buy for ourselves because women never seem to get it right.    EXCEPT sex.  Yea, that's pretty much it.    In the morning, a BJ in the shower would be an awesome start to the day.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	My wife asked me the exact same thing, and I told her that sex should be her first choice. We guys do appreciate little things like some cookies, a warm dinner, a clean house, a small present, etc... but if you want to cause an "impact".. you know... to leave an impression that he won't forget easily, go with sex: waking him up with a bj, touch him down there while he drives, wait for him completely naked when he comes from work. be wild! You cannot loose!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Cookies....any baked goods actually.    Extra points if they're made by her personally.    Good Luck!|`|zFwjZy53aa	morning sex|`|iVHfNbAMaa	It's inevitable, most guys want wives to have sex with you more often.|`|wdJcfniBaa	I disagree, not morning sex. I'd say, get a skimpy outfit, and show it to him BEFORE he goes to work, not on you though. Then say "when you get home from work". This way it will give him something to look forward to throughout the day, then he comes home and SHABAM! :)|`|AA11383443	Her coming to bed and telling me she is horny or saying when you get home from work do you want to make love, now that's something to look forward for all day. We both take turns cooking and what not so it's not a real big deal.|`|z36j8rmRaa	I'm not a guy but I can tell you what will please a man...A man desires RESPECT above all.  The Bible is clear on this fact and puts it like this:  Easter 1:18  Before this day is over, the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done...they won't respect their husbands, and their husbands will be angry with them.       Ephesians 5:33  However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.    Respect is huge for a man.  This is why he does what he does.  Just as you, the wife, have a great need to be loved, the husband has just as great a need to be respected.  Try it out...it works!|`|BSKJdZK3aa	playing video games 4 hours a day and not video games on nintendo wii and not video games on the internet I MEAN REAL VIDEO GAMES LIKE HALO 3 OR METAL GEAR SOLID 4 AND NOT SIMS AND DEFINETLY NOT SPORE    or to give a blow j*b    or do normal everyday thing around the house but nude for 1 hour    understand what your husband thinks eg: if your husband doesnt go to a party with you and plays video games instead then MAYBE ITS BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO AVOID SOMEONE THERE all women think that men are addicted to video games thats a huge lie and im not saying this happened to me before its just an example    its obvious|`|wZaWDgeMaa	wake up with a nice *******|`|sM6sIjhBaa	There is lots of things that my wife could do for me that would make my day wonderful.  Mine sends me a love letter to my cell or email while im at work that definately brightens my day.  Or cook my favorite meal for diner.  Breakfast in bed on a weekend is great way to start the weekend.  But my favorite thing mine does for me is that unexspected gift that she hand makes she is big on arts and crafts so every once in a while i get a card or little doohickey she makes for me.  I love it because its personalized and she puts alot of thought and energy into them.  I hate the generic store bought gifts.  Just do something from the heart and he will love it
Lsa2LPrMaa	so he wanted to makeout with his girlfriend.  at least he showed up, because he didnt have to..  everyone saying he didnt cheer for you kinda means they were watching him the whole time & they weren't watching you play.  seriously dont ruin a good friendship over something dumb.  sounds like you did kinda overreact but i understand you had your feelings hurt, but just talk it out and go from there.  he didnt do anything wrong.  and its his birthday!   that would be kinda messed up if you didnt call him or do anything.  so go talk to him.|`|KBCFVZVNaa	Just apologize and try calling him and tell him happy birthday.! good luck  hope i helped. add me :)|`|mYAbq6fnaa	you should just explain to your friend why you were upset and tell him that you would appreciate it next time if he actually watched you when he comes to your games.|`|9jyEBW3Kaa	ok i used to have a guy friend just like that we were amazing friends until he got a girlfriend then he started talking to me less and less and ditching me for her and i have a wonderful boyfriend to but i still make time for my friends so tell him that. be like, ok i may have overeacted but it just upset me that one of my best friends ignored me at my game and then jsut left without even telling me bye. dont forget to mention that ur ok with him having a g/f but he has to make time for friends b/c thats just the right thing to do b/c if she ever breaks up with him and he wants to come crawling back to you its not gonna work that way. he should hang out with u both equally just as different people (: hope this helped.|`|636b11ae9a5dec8bb1462f22524dc0bfaa	I think you should apologize.  He did make the effort of showing up at your game, even if he was preoccupied. It sounds like you may need to consider the possibility that this guy is more than just your best guy friend and that you may want him to be your boyfriend. Sure, he could have been a little more attentive to the game, but he did come when he really wouldn't have had to, especially if he had already planned time with his girlfriend.|`|e8ef425b76319bea89cafc0909c72a9daa	dont cry over that.lol,  thats what bestfriends do.  they argue and you need to let him know that that happens from time to time.  just forgive him.|`|J1bjIJ13aa	Hey i get how you feel .. everything is obviously his fault .. but give him another chance , if his smart he won't make the same mistake twice ! One you'v apologized try to get you guys to talk why you told him off .. if he dosn't understand or atleast try to then mayeb you should think about option two : just ignoring him . . ur not overreacting , you were jst actting from being hurt .. good luck though !
q3FDAQ9Baa	Well,  you have to ask your self  if it's the first time  or  is it the first time she got caught??   Maybe the pregnacy is what made her tell you this time!!I Isn't she kind of old to be getting pregnant?    I suppose it's up to you to forgive  not all of us on here.  My ex's cheated on me, I couldn't forgive  nor did I forget. Which in itself   hurts everyday, even though I have now been single 22 years.  Good luck with your choices|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You were to easy on her especially since she got pregnant by the other guy.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I think it's beautiful when a married couple can pull together and get through things like this. You know whats in your heart and hers. So just enjoy each other and be happy that you are still together.     You said you've been married 25 years, so I'm going to assume that you aren't a young buck, so all the more reason to just enjoy each other, cause life truly does go by way to fast, and before you know it your loved ones are passing away.        UPDATE********************************...  Don't answer his questions he nothing more than a troll. and i fell for it! To proove it, look at all his other questions. here is one that he posted and I just copied it to post it here to show you all.          Resolved QuestionShow me another ?   A love affair helped me, but wife disagrees?  Yes, I had an affair with another woman that was also married and we actually helped each other. She help me get my confidence back and it helped my relationship with my wife and we are doing better now. My wife totally disagrees that sleeping with another woman helped me at all or my marriage. She claims it just gave me a chance to have sex with someone else outside of the marriage, but we have worked it out and we are both doing better.    Why can't she understand my views?  1 week ago|`|c0p2BYwnaa	You are to be commended. That is true love. To look past one's faults and forgive them anyway. It reminds me of the love God has for us. Can you imagine getting what we deserved for all the bad we've done? I cheated and my husband forgave me and our marriage has been so much better now. I wish i had never committed that sin against him and my family. I regret it so much. I am so grateful to have a loving husband (such as yourself) who was willing to forgive me and move on in our marriage. I didn't want to break up the family, divide the kids and all of that. In the end, that fling was not worth it at all. I am so glad that the two of you moved past it and are celebrating 25 yrs. That is so awesome and I know with perseverance that my husband and I will make it to 25 yrs also. Marriage is hard work. I didn't realize how hard it actually was. Congratulations to you and men and women like you.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	All good except murdering an innocent child.     There is absolutely no reason to kill the child.

Good Luck!|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Lets just say you were much more gracious than I am.I would have kicked her on her *** not only for cheating but for getting pregnant too?

But then again, welcome to the Marriage and Divorce Section.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	I do believe people can make mistakes .. if she is sorry and really loves you I am sure this has happend to many couples before. One has to be able to communicate then one can learn to trust again... usually there is a reason why such things happen. Often if one is honest with oneself.. the fault that affairs do happen lie with both partners.. because they either take each other for granted after a long time of having been married or they don't bother to communicate to each other how they feel about something and just let it slide and so for some reason they are not as close to each other as they used to be.. they keep their thoughts hidden from each other. Sometimes everybody does something that is annoying. We should be able to talk to each other about everything in a relationship and respect is important...to be equals and to take the effort to spend quality time together... to make time for each other but at the same time everybody also needs some alone time.. to pursue their own hobbies.  I believe what you did, is what a person who loves his or her partner would do, forgive .. but then you also both have to make an effort to learn to trust each other again.. because it would not work out well if you kept your wife on a short leash and checked on her.. either one can trust each other.. or one can't...if one loves one has to believe one can trust each other and that this will never happen again.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Cheating and abortion were good attempts, but you should have worked porn into your question too.

Forget her man, yes its hard, but be a man, and when i say a man, i dont mean to have Arnold's muscles, not at all, I mean have a rational decision and stick with it.

It isn't the baby's fault that your wife messed up. If you and she do not want the baby, give it up for adoption, there are plently of people who would love to have a healthy baby.|`|uJB3Yet6aa	no to the abortion  is it the baby's fault she slept with some guy? no  does it get to choose if it dies when it was not its fault? no  you said you had a family... what it that baby was one of your kids, you did not know them when your wife was pregnant and now you love them  what if she had had an abortion then? you would never have gotten to have them in your life.  if you really dont want another kid, give it up for adoption  there are milllllions of families out there that would LOVE to have a kid and cant    abortion is murder, no matter how you look at it  you can forgive your wife, that is your buisness, not this babies  if any one should be punished it is your wife for the mistake,  not an innocent baby    and if she wasnt thinking then, shes definately not thinking now

Don't take it personally, she is just talking trying to make you feel bad because she feels so bad about NOT raising you.|`|dVlLahozaa	ignore her remarks and don't allow them to hurt you|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Hon she is what she is.Why are you surprised and why do you expect different from her?Some of the things she said may be true and some of it may not be.Try being honest with yourself.<br>  Next, your kids behave they way they are raised to behave.<br>  If your kids misbehave it is the fault of the parents,no one else, this "no fault "crap is the reason kids turn out the way they do because parents do not take responsibility for their parenting,or lack thereof.

sgW0Tf9Naa	There is no question..YOU HAVE TO LEAVE!!!...It is not healthy to be in a relationship where there is no equal love, understanding, or  respect from the other partner. You will be unhappy for the rest of your life if you stay in this relationship. I hate to see woman fall apart after all the good things they have done for their husbands and their children. For the sake of your children and your life, please leave and find someone who share your love not throw it away. Good luck!|`|2wzGwV5daa	I agree, mental abuse is very bad for you and the kids. If you have a way to support yourself and the kids, whether going home or have your own job or whatever....get out and move on, and fast.|`|Dr2wwH3jaa	this guy doesn't love you if you don't leave he may start to hurt you and maybe the kids. if your not happy leave. get on with your life your young and it sounds like you can do much better then this guy. sorry but this is what i really think.|`|aFFGfGvTaa	I feel in our society divorce is too easy    you made a promise, so stick to it.    confront him about the pills and friends, but stay calm even if he argues with you    and think about your children! you would not be able to support them if you left him  and your chances of going back to school would be even lower.    also talk to him about how you hate california and tell him to look into getting transferred.      confrontation may be hard, but its the best way when dealing with these things|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	I think you should try to work it out with your husband any way you know how -0-if anything for the children's sake.    I know being young, and being married is tough, especially when you feel you are bearing the entire burden.  However, your marriage really could be good if you got him to work on it.  It sounds like he's done enough to make you give up on him.    I would say that before you decide to leave, try to work it out first based on confronting him, telling him exactly how you feel and telling him you are contemplating leaving if he doesn't stop the behavior you dislike.  It's for your kids.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Honesty, what would you do if you left him??   You'd have to put your kids in day care all day while you work at some minimum wage job to survive.  You won't get much if any child support and your kids will never see their dad.    I say stick it out until the kids are in school.  You'll have some education then and be able to support yourself.  Right now, it just seems you'd be going from one bad situation to another - and for what?|`|Y08YLysXaa	I personally don't think you two should be together. You obviously have a bad influence on eachother and drug addiction and cheating are the last straw... I think you should get out and take time for yourself, your child and focus on that. You can't be happy being a mother when you're just full of resentment and hurt. Get away from him and enjoy your toddlers, I'm sure they will be better off without him in their life every day too.|`|FslUZLsyaa	wowwww.  if u really luv him, then u should want to do whatever it takes.  but if ur just NOT happy u should leave.|`|aWFiwSwRaa	Whatever you decide, make sure you get your education.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	a couple things wrong with this menu<br>  <br>  A) it all seems vegetarian.  unless ALLLL of your guests happen to be vegetarian, your going to end up with a lot of hungry guests, or at least guests who are not happy that all the have to eat is vegetarian stuff.  even if you yourself are vegetarian, you should try to cater to the tastes of others as well. <br>  <br>  B)if you plan on inviting any kids to your wedding, you may want to consider some more well known foods.  i watch a lot of food network (like, there are weekends when that is all i watch) but i have NO idea what jicama is, so i cant imagine what any small child would do with it.  <br>  <br>  C) even if your not having kids, a lot of those flavors are really exotic.  is this something your guests are prepared for? not everyone has the stomach for curried things, not everyone likes asian inspired stuff, honestly, i dont know anyone who likes either of those two deserts, and my family LOVES desserts.<br>  <br>  D) meat eaters try to cater to vegetarians tastes as much as possible at weddings, so i think its only fair that vegetarians would do the same<br>  <br>  yeah i know its supposed to be your day.  but your feeding guests, and its going to be very hard to please anyone but yourself with those dishes.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Honestly, I wouldn't eat any of it and I'm not a picky eater. It's not that appetizing and seems too pretentious while not taking into account what your guests normally eat.<br>  <br>  Edit: the drinks sound great though|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Unless all your guest are vegetarians, this menu is not good. I am an adventurous eater and would probably eat everything except the mushrooms. But, my boyfriend wouldn't touch anything on this menu. You need to have food that everyone can eat, not just you. The menu is better than your last one, but still needs some meat, and quiche is not a meat dish.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	i think the amount and number of selections is appropriate.<br>  These foods all seem very strange to me, vegetarian for sure which is fine. I like vegetarian food, it can be very good, just some of the items I am not very familiar with.<br>  I would just try to feel out your guests by word of mouth and see how receptive a few of them are about your choices, or consider adding a couple more common items to the sides.|`|blxlNHeCaa	I think it sounds lovely ^_^  (sounds almost like a vegetarian menu, but those can be great too :D)<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I think the entire idea of a wedding is that it's a special occasion. Why have normal food on such a special day?|`|DWeGV8Akaa	unique and yummy ;)<br>  <br>  can i come???|`|7Is37fRmaa	it sounds like you have picked a very exotic menu which can be fun especially if many of your guests are adventurous in what they will eat. If you are having children at your wedding I would recommend that you offer a kids menu(it could save you a little money anyway, and I doubt they will eat any of those things unless raised on them). Also you may want to add at least one simpler side for those less adventurous folks. It sounds like a nice balance in general though.|`|d5kt46e5aa	That sounds absolutely DELICIOUS! i wish i was going to this wedding!

His wife of 70 years recently passed away, making the move necessary. After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home, he smiled sweetly when told his room was ready. <br>   <br>  As he maneuvered his walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of his tiny room, including the eyelet sheets that had been hung on his window. <br>  <br>  'I love it,' he stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy. <br>  <br>  'Mr. Jones, you haven't seen the room; just wait.' <br>  <br>  'That doesn't have anything to do with it,' he replied... ‘Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged..It’s how I arrange my mind. I already decided to love it. It's a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice; I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be thankful each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open, I'll focus on the new day and all the happy memories I've stored away. Just for this time in my life. Old age is like a bank account. You withdraw from what you've put in. So, my advice to you would be to deposit a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories!  Thank you for your part in filling my Memory bank. I am still depositing.' <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Remember the five simple rules to be happy: <br>  <br>    1. Free your heart from hatred. <br>    2. Free your mind from worries. <br>    3. Live simply <br>    4. Give more. <br>    5. Expect less.|`|Enlj7cQzaa	life is so depressing becuz we ppl go through ups and down without expecting it.|`|AA11611389	Cheer up Sarah!  There is an awesome happy girl in there somewhere.

877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	You're right. He is an a**. A self-centered a** who only think of himself.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you realize your mistake and most of all, realize how much better off you are without him.<br>  <br>  Yes, you do have a right to be pissed. However, that doesn't mean you NEED to be pissed. Don't be pissed at yourself - you've learned a valuable lesson. A don't be pissed at him either - that means you have to think about him constantly, which is exactly what he wants.<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is to forget about it and move on. It sounds easier than it really is. Keep yourself busy - clean your room, make dinner, hang out with friends, watch a funny movie, exercise. Keep active so you don't have time to think about him.<br>  <br>  Slowly, you WILL move on from him.<br>  <br>  And when he sees that he has absolutely no effect on you, he's going to think twice. Plus, he's less likely to talk to his friends about you if you don't show that he's gotten to you.<br>  <br>  As for next time, look for guys who are truly nice - guys who open the door for you, who help you carry your heavy textbooks. Because guys who show respect in little things are going to respect you in big things - like sex.<br>  <br>  And don't fall for anything a guy tells you that you don't feel comfortable doing. Having sex or going any further will not make your relationship more "mature", it will not bring you "closer together" unless you're BOTH ready and you do it because you WANT to - because you care and respect each other. :)<br>  <br>  Consider this a truly valuable lesson and I'm really glad to see that you are an intelligent young woman who knows what's right and what isn't. :)

tCiVuFK9aa	Leave her a lone.  Let her think about what it is that she wants.  Maybe she really is ready to move on and if that's the case, you are just going to have to let her.  Sorry it hurts but believe it or not in time you will heal and you will move on too.  For now, as hard as it is, leave her alone.  If she wants you, she will begin to miss you and she will come back on her own. That's the only way you would want it right?<br>  Red|`|0Id85yiYaa	give her space|`|OSSRoUs2aa	You should give her the space she needs and then you should try telling her how you feel just like you wrote, possibly propose if sje feels the same...

There are other fish in the seas.|`|tbJraueLaa	move on, it hurts you are to young.|`|BVVxH7UKaa	I'm going through the same type of thing. 4 years things get comfortable. If you guys are still young she is probably wondering if she is missing anything? She will come to realize she isn't....trust me. Especially if you are totally sweet to her and a complete gentlemen. I would tell you to let her think for a little bit. I know it hurts but try to get something positive out of it. Be strong and show her that you will go through anything to be with her.  Then she can't deny that you are the one. Good luck!  Everything will work out for the best...it always does! :)|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	i feel you because im going through the same thing right now and while im so heart broken all i can say is dont call her....let her clear her mind and if she decides she wants to come back think about it real good because it hurts more each time.........good luck and keep your head up|`|OuTHGkoiaa	hi Sam<br>  <br>  What You need to do is take a completely fresh approach.<br>  Begin by breaking contact off for a while, doing your own thing.<br>  I know its hard but doing this will give you a much better chance of getting her back and improving your relationship.<br>  At the time when you are having no communication between you and your ex, you should be focusing on ways that will improve your own personal life, rather than focusing on the relationship issues at hand.<br>  This is going to be a challenging time, and it is going to require discipline to prevent you from returning to your old ways.<br>  <br>  When you break off communications with her, she is going to start wondering why, then she will start to realise how she feels about you, since you are no longer communicating with her.<br>  Human nature takes over and You become mysterious to her in some ways, because she is not sure what you are doing or feeling.<br>  This actually starts working in your favour.<br>  Now your ex actually starts to miss you, because she hasen't had time to miss you as you have been around chasing her so to speak.<br>  <br>  This really worked well for me in same situ,<br>  Regards Bob

S1jddreQaa	Wow, We had assingned lunch seats in middle school of like one week, haha then people started to leave for lunch because people didn't like who they sat by. This one girl got sat by a bunch of people who "picked" on her or something and she was crying everyday after lunch. I seriously don't see how any school would think assigned lunch seats is a good idea. Anyway my guess is that you actually get to pick who you want to sit with...so just tell her. Its like ripping a band-aid off, just get it over with. Lol, I mean it might hurt her feelings a little, but it will get your pont acrosss.|`|mgAh2Hc3aa	tell her to go away. it seems that you hate her so much, why would being a little mean back matter if she's already been so rude to her? tell you you're not friends, and she should go sit with people that actually like her. lol.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	You can either just ignore her and not talk to her at all and hope she gets the hint or you could sit outside in the grass outside the cafeteria if it's allowed.|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Let  her sit  at  a table  first on Friday before  you & your friend & then you & your friend  go sit at a  different one.

And she should get it. <br>  Or your could just say, because you want to. or something like that. <br>  Well this is something that me and my friend do, when ever someone sits with us that we don't like we just quickly switch tables, before anyone notices that we switched and it normally works!|`|LbQJVQFLaa	tell the ***** you dnt lik her nd to find ppl who will enjoy her company<br>  if she refuses to move, then you move<br>  if she follows point, laugh, nd say loudly how shes so pathetic tht she cnt find other ppl to sit w.cuz no one liks her<br>  <br>  <br>  learn to be a *****, sweetie=)|`|yoh34atoaa	wierd. do you go to bernotas? cause at my school there is a lena gril and a shelby. <br>  anyway, last year this girl shelby kept sitting at our table and like you, we were switching seats sooon, and we pretty much just told her, leave and sit somewhere else because it was crowded and we dont like you. mean, but affective. <br>  tell me how it works out. <br>  email me at cmvowels06@gmail.com|`|4RDReOBxaa	as hard as it may be, you may just have to tell her straight up that you have issues with her. yeah, its nerve wracking but its worth it in the end because then shell leave you alone and shell know how you feel about her.|`|Nb7X3YBMaa	lol, talk to the person who chooses the seats. Or ask you parents to talk to the teacher who does it. they cant say no to a parent......|`|nqjAed6Paa	i know how yu feel. okay so what i would do is jsut dont talk to her and ignore the fact that she is there. and just ignore her|`|r6P8RCUbaa	Give her laxative brownies on the day of the seat switch.<br>  <br>  I've had to deal with these types of people before. Just get into serious face mode and tell her, without any unnecessary insulting, to GTFO your table because none of you can deal with her anymore. Make sure all of your friends tell her that they agree with you and she'll probably feel emo and find another table. But that's okay, because sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, so don't feel bad.<br>  <br>  Or just punch her in the face.|`|rEh0mhezaa	Alright, first off, you are in SIXTH GRADE (according to another question of yours)! ELEVEN! YOU SHOULDN'T BE DIETING! THE GIRL IS RIGHT! Sheesh, you won't need to diet for another few years!<br>  <br>  Now that that's out of my system, do you have any friends the irritating girl doesn't like? You could sit with them. Or maybe you could tell her that you and your best friend want to sit alone together (are there any other people at your table?). Mabye you could encourage her to go and sit with her crush with comments like "well, if you sit with him, the two of you could get closer. Can't hurt, can it?". Please, don't break the girl's heart and tell her to get lost. If she sits with people she barely knows, she probably doesn't have many friends. I have friends who I don't like sitting at my (highschool) lunch table. Of course, we don't have assigned seats, but lunch tables usually don't change much anyway. But possibly, you could just deal with it? Is she really THAT terrible?|`|AA11400470	Don't be shock but I am annoying to a lot of people, and I am almost never went through what you have been.

Or, if you are in high school, and she drives (i dont think you are though), go out to her car, and kindly slash her tires, and then politely tell her, B*tch, next time its going to be your f**king throat. Hope this helps!
zVjCUUAmaa	well It is extremely rude of her to interrupt you. I have a friend who's good friends with a dramatic, interrupting girl. She annoys the hell out of me. Every time i have a conversation with my good friend Anna, this girl starts talking to her. I just say EXCUSE ME!?!? very loudly. she usually gets embarrassed and shuts up. just tell your friend to mind her own business and stop judging others.|`|o837KjToaa	Don't ignore the problem cause it might not go away as easily or fast as confronting her. Just talk to her and tell her, im only telling you this because im ur friend i care.. when u elbow me interrupt me as im talking it comes off as annoying and rude and since you cant see that yourself im trying to help you so maybe if you stop doing those things we can have a better friend ship. now you don't have to use those exact words but at least just don't keep ur feelings bottled up inside, confront her in a positive and helpful way. also, if ur other friends see this problem you all can confront her at once like intervention lol, i hope this helps!|`|yPTfp6NKaa	omg my friend was the same, after a while of pondering that question i realized to just say "can u stop" wen she hit me and "when she says mean things give her a look of disappointment and say"that's not nice" ur probably thinking duh but the look is the most important, i would say stop being her friends but ive been there they can be nice fun to hang out with and a good friend, so keep her just give her a push with just saying no.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	i would just ignore her for a while.<br>  if you do that, she will realize that it REALLY WAS mean.|`|Nb7X3YBMaa	both of you go to a counselor and talk about it.|`|JcsELAGNaa	just ignore her. dont acknowledge it<br>  roll your eyes<br>  she just wants attention so if you ignore her she'll eventually give up<br>  or when she interrupts you, pretend she didnt and just keep talking<br>  and when she says it isn't mean, just be like, oh your so cool cuz you can make fun of other people. eventually, she'll realize how immature it is and stop
AA10255555	i would say YES , most boys are too shy to approach so they do "wierd " things to get ur attention. i bet if u asked him out he would say yes OR jsut ask him if he has a girlfriend, if he says NO, simply say "want one?" trust i love it when girls apporach me in a cute way!<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|rYdsywgyaa	I'm a guy, and that sounds exactly like what I'd do.<br>  Ask him out of the blue: "Do you love me?  Are you playing these love games wwwwwith me?"<br>  <br>  No, don't really say that.  Make the first move.  Or be romantic and one day, while no one is around, and you two are walking together or something, stop, and kiss him.  That would be soooo romantic.<br>  <br>  I'm not gay.|`|4VIjILk1aa	Yes he likes you. He is probably afraid to make the first move. So do things that will make him think you like him so he won't be scared to ask you out.|`|DxohE884aa	I would say so. That sounds sweet!
CyZtHtveaa	First off, im gonna tell you that strangers cannot "vote" on where you should go. This is a decision that you have to make. There are plenty of people who can help u make this decision thou. Talk to you parents!! They definatly can help you. Also, talk to your guidence counselors and teachers. They know your abilities and school personality best,so they can help you. You say that you dont like the jacka**es in your school. Hate to break it to you, but there are some in public school too, however there are more kids and less time spent with these people. You will encounter drugs, sex, etc at any school you go to (including private), so dont make that a factor. If you do change schools, people will like you. Remember when you were little and you got a new toy? At the public school, you are like the new toy. The advantages about going to a private school are that there are smaller classes and better chances to succeed. This is not saying that you wont do well in public school, just that there is more one on one time with teachers at private schools. The bad part about having less kids at your private school is that you are more likely to be put in a setting where there are people you dont like.<br>  <br>  sorry for such a long post!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|N4X8VSUvaa	Go where ever you think you will get the best education.  Public or private shouldn't matter.  You can have good teachers in both and you can have less than perfect as well in both.  I don't think going to public means you have to give up all your friends from private and you can never have to many friends.   Remember what you learned in private and take it with you when you go to public.  You have good kids in both and you have the annoying ones in both.   Look ahead to college what school is going to help you to reach your goals.  Check out the colleges and see if you can talk to a counselor.  Then make your decision,    Oh I went to a private school we had drugs, sex etc there too. That shouldn't be a reason to stay in private or go to public.
Q1waNmwwaa	nahh they wouldnt call you up for one little thing that they didnt even put on record. they dont pay attention to those little notes. I guarentee theyre will be people there that have done alot worse then you and they dont say anything to them<br>  <br>  But also it depends on what you were taking. I doubt it was big though i would say definately no|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	No, you should have a valid passport and they will just check this to make sure it's real. The city building would not have issued you a passport if you were unable to leave the country.<br>  <br>    Some countries do run a felony background check but don't worry, shoplifting is not even close to being a felony.

UAYBbTFqaa	yes i get jealous 2:)
Sl0iE8cbaa	Your mother favors your brother!! I know it's hard, but try not to let it make you feel any less. There are thousands of people who are going through the same thing. I think it has something to do with the way the mother bonds with the child at birth. Most of the time it just doesn't make any sense. My sister has two boys 7 & 12. She totally favors her younger son for no reason that I can see. If anything her older boy is better behaved, but it has nothing to do with him, it has to do with her. I wouldn't cut off your relationship with your mother, just accept her and the situation for what it is.|`|akmV55dvaa	don't care about her if you being nice to her someday she will know !|`|trZ1NRLbaa	Just need to make your own life and dont worry about her. Sorry
4rLdaCNHaa	Ya, that pretty serious, but there's nothing you can do. That is usually up to family and unfortunately he doesn't have one, by the sound of it, at least not a real family.<br>     The most you can do is back off and hope he misses you enough to ask why, if he does then tell him the truth.<br>      But i doubt it will help, he now has 2 addictions and chances are he'll go through yrs of it, before he hits rock bottom enough to want help.<br>      His second addiction, the porn, is almost worse than the drugs, it will change him sexually forever and normal sex with a woman won't do anymore. And if he's already watching young girls, then they'll have to get younger and younger to satisfy and keep the thrill. This is how it works. Does his parents also get him these movies?<br>      If this porn is as you say, you could ask to just sit down with a detective and have a "hypothetical" discussion on the issue and see if there isn't an anonymous way of making this attempt at saving your friend. They will not force you to report anything, although if it were me i'd be dam tempted too.<br>      If the actors are quite young, this could lead to even younger kids, i should say it usually does and you know well the results of child porn.<br>  This you need to put a stop too, before your friend ends up a predator or worse, some kid ends up hurt.|`|EyKmEptVaa	If his parents are enabling him and aren't try to get help for him i don't know if there is anything you can do,if he doesn't want to help himself.Try talking to him and or his parents  about his addictions if possible,if this is not an option i would distance myself from him.Good luck and bless you all.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	have an intervention.|`|cggkcAC5aa	You dont need a friend like that. just leave him be.|`|QkOeODxLaa	his parents are buying the drugs 4 him?!?!|`|5mMCeQedaa	Just stay away from guilt by association. Tell him you don't want t be friends with him if he is going to be a druggy. And if you don't want to talk to him just avoid him. Do you really want to be around guys like that?|`|XKRvc2HOaa	well hes kinda 18 and he should be able to do wat he wants.  i know its not right to do any of that stuff. u cant tattle on him. i say u just stop being his friend|`|JAL0HMWiaa	contact a doctor or the police to help him <br>  it looks like he might need some rehab.|`|0pbQXujjaa	go strate up to him and say get off the drugs!!!!!!!! or sit down with him and have a talk . show him pics of what his Heart looks like and how it could kill him! make sure he understands!!!|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	Stay far away before you end up in deep trouble.  <br>  Or call the cops and let them know what is going on.  <br>  I personally would walk away.
HnEcgVGiaa	You're suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). What you experienced in your past was a very unfortunate circumstance. It's just horrible. Because of your experience, your ability to trust the male gender has been compromised. While it's possible for you eventually trust them, it will take both the time and effort for you.<br>  <br>  For your sister's friend, take your time in getting to know him. Ask your sister about him to learn more before  meeting him physically. Get to know guys without actually seeing them - perhaps through third-parties or over the Internet. Phone calls might be too much and is probably suited for later. <br>  <br>  There are professionals who help women deal with experiences that you had. They operate on a fully-confidential basis. You can either visit their offices, talk on the phone, or receive counseling and support online. <br>  <br>  What you felt was normal given your circumstance. But of course, no one really trusts 'strange' people. Forging a trust takes time for anyone, but an extra effort on your part, but it's very possible.<br>  <br>  Be strong.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|zVjCUUAmaa	unfortunately, you were raped. That is a very difficult and complicated situation, and I am so sorry it happened to you ... I can't imagine the pain you had.<br>  Fortunately, they have services and counseling that will help you overcome it. Unless you can start reintroducing yourself to new men gradually, and let yourself heal with time, i would recommend counseling.

Second of all, why are you going out with a seventeen year old? When he found this out he probably figured out that you were not easy like some other girls i know.

Boys are pains in the but.|`|qWgY02Guaa	honest answer?<br>  1-he doesnt want to have to go through the "work" of getting you to want to have sex with him<br>  2-he doesnt want you to fall in love with him so that you will have sex with him because then he wont be able to break up with you that easily<br>  men are dogs.|`|VTixPge9aa	wants that fresh pussy not your sloppy seconds|`|mJNRM44Aaa	Cause he doesnt want to be the one responsible for you loosing your virginity when he tries to break up with you and you flip a ****, or if ur parents find out, he doesnt want to get his *** kicked because he was ur first and popped ur cherry|`|FNp57KlYaa	cuz hes a jerk and all he wants is sex...its good that u dont like him anymore. he probably thought u were naive since your a little younger and that if you liked him enough you would give it up. dont let guys get to you stay strong and pure. dont let peer pressure get to you ok.|`|zIBOtiKTaa	clearly he was hoping you were not a virgin because that would mean that you were easy and he would be able to get laid easily.|`|qNK9FFEFaa	well  they say that once you have sex for the first time your vagina starts bleeding many men don't want the woman's blood on them the guy was probably thinking ah ed|`|otLRZB5Taa	because all he wanted you for was sex, and he probably doesn't want to waste his time trying to get in your pants if he can find another girl that's easy. your much better off without him.|`|zScMcD09aa	some guys r just into one thing if u see were im going any way just keep looking not every guy wants a loose girl|`|RoqxGbgRaa	he's probably used to going out with girls who are sexually active.  it's a fairly easy experience for him, and he doesn't have to carry the burden of being a girl's "first," which usually comes with certain emotional expectations and difficulties.<br>  <br>  at your age, girls who are virgins are usually still committed to the idea of "not going all the way."  he probably finds this a bit off-putting.  forget him, and wait for someone who won't be bothered by your virginity.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	I wouldn't care if a girl was a virgin or not unless I was hiring her as a prostitute.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	that's being a tool to him|`|mDJInjEaaa	umm i think its bc hes a boy and boys are messed up|`|mYmR5cX5aa	You weren't offering what he was looking for. <br>  Consider yourself lucky that he showed his true colors this early in the relationship, and that he never tried to take advantage of you. You are better off without him.|`|T0pkW783aa	His intentions were not honorable!  He wanted you for what he could get and decided you weren't worth the effort it would take to take your virginity.  Consider yourself lucky.  He sounds like a real jerk.|`|AA10255555	umm. it think the main reason is he grew some morales, he could be charged with stataotry rape despite the fact taht he is not 18 yet.

These are all possible options.   sorry abuot that!  :(|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Well either he's just a pig or maybe he doesnt want to get into a relationship because he doesnt want to be your first time. <br>  Either way Im sorry that happened to ya. <br>  Im a 16 year old guy and i would never not date you just cause  youre a virgin thats fine with me.<br>  Sorry again|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	because he wants to have sex ONLY and he doesnt want a commited relationship. it doesnt mean rejecting you because who you are, it only means he wants to date for sex and run and he cant do this with you. it is not fair.|`|kRGLfo0haa	He sounds like a jerk, forget about him.

I know many other guys that do that just because they are horny.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	It may be more that you're underage and he could be convicted of statutory rape if things heated up between the two of you.|`|eF2OkxMqaa	He obviously only wants sex. Otherwise, he won't bother.<br>  <br>  What a ********.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He may have just said that to be mean because he is just not interested in you, or he only goes out with skanks he knows he can screw and dump.|`|qFYCJ01laa	because he's stupid.<br>  it seems like he didn't like you for you, but for your body.<br>  :/|`|GiaVm26baa	Well at least you know exactly why he was dating you in the first place. Sounds like a jerk to me. Now you can spend your time with boys who will just appreciate being with you for who you are.  Don't have sex just to make someone else happy. You need to be ready to accept if you get pregnant, if you get an STD, etc.|`|HmJnOoNIaa	He is a Jackass|`|YMKNOUZTaa	It's because he's a scumbag.  He's probably thinking that if you're a virgin, you won't know how to have sex, and the sex will therefore be bad.  Or, he might think you're saving yourself for marriage and he's just trying to have sex.  Good for you to get over his sorry butt!|`|fs4Z2le9aa	strange|`|mVUpt8waaa	Maybe because he is used to having relationships where sex was a normal part of it.  He doesnt want to deal with the hassles of dating a virgin and all the emotional issues that go along with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  To all the people calling him a jerk.  What would be worse, him turning her down now, or pretending to be a nice guy just so he can take her virginity?  Answer me that.|`|iv5E4C93aa	because hes a pig and wanted sex|`|cce9d5d3e1f6a8bafb5bad987d7a425baa	wow hes a homo.<br>  id rather have my girlfriend a virgin...thank god she is ^__^<br>  hes just stupid|`|Ev0H3ulraa	because hes dumb|`|ZcScrnVwaa	He most likely wants to sleep with you. And maybe, sex is a big part of relationships to him, and he doesn't want you to feel pressured. Maybe he doesn't want to take your virginity.|`|QmO7kF1faa	If he is bringing that kind of question up.  He is fishing to see if you are easy.  He is playing mind games with you.  I know your smarter then that.  Stay a virgin until you marry.|`|UHQGlOPlaa	that guy dumb going out with a virgin i think might be the best. but im not advising you to have sex you are still young. i stared when i was 16 though.so if you do make sure its safe sex|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	Because he's a jerk and that's all guys want most of the time.|`|qDII8luraa	That's dumb. Just forget about it, virginity is special and he is being a jerk.|`|7OuNY2q9aa	yeah you despise him because he won't go out with you|`|AA10887474	This guy is not worth your time.  He sounds confused about why two people date (the long-term reasons).
SHARt1k3aa	Let him, he'll look like a total idiot in front of the judge and they'll determine that he isn't fit to even have custody.  Tell your friend not to let his stupid threats scare her.   Have you ever heard of any child being taken away from parent because their friend said something bad about the other parent?  NO, he is an immature loser and tell her not to be scared.  The more this guy talks the more the judge will see what an idiot he is.  You can say what you want about him.  Slander is a whole different thing.  You can only get charged with slander if what you say financially effects the person.  Like if they worked at a school and you said he was a child molester, then .. he may have a case, but you are in-titled to your opinion of him and from what you write it sounds true!|`|0Id85yiYaa	you can't get sued for calling someone a cuss word. what an idiot that man is.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	He's issuing threats that he can't follow up on. When someone hear's the word suit, they automatically become concerned.<br>  <br>  Explain to him that threatening to sue without grounds is in and of itself grounds for a suit for harassment, emotional and mental distress, and that YOU will in fact take HIM to court.|`|GvamTVqAaa	No - just ignore him.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	No.|`|AA12202402	Slander is way hard to prove. Him being a booty isn't. No worries....Most of the time be it unfair the woman gets the children....Sad but true......Also He would actually and legally have to spend a small fortune and prove I mean really prove she was a unfit mom......<br>  He will also have to prove the child is in danger. <br>  See what I mean.....<br>  If mom isn't willing to give up custody......<br>  not a really really bad mom<br>  No worries<br>  He is just mad right now and threatening court this court that because he can...It is just words. So what if you called him a booty! You have a right to a opinion.....<br>  He would have to spend a huge amount in lawyer fees to prove that effected his life. Now, these fees are totally different than the one He is dealing with in divorce court......See what I mean. Just tell your friend be a good mom provide for her child and the rest will wash out
eYQMygJnaa	Just that you are a very generous person, that you give willingly to others and you are not the least bit selfish.<br>  <br>  It can also mean you are very sensitive and emotional, which is not a bad thing at all.|`|goe3y4FPaa	that ur too ''Emotional'' Earth is ruled by walking ''Mike Myers'' u feel me ''dawg??|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	people tell me i have a big heart all the time.<br>  <br>  its because your nice, caring, kind, loving.<br>  You treat everyone equal.<br>  <br>  Are you the kind of person who would give a stray cat/dog food?<br>  <br>  Are you the type of person who would give money to a homeless person?<br>  if so, you have a big heart.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Warm heart?
ipuFCeYhaa	Well when I like a girl I tend to want to be around her more and talk to her more often.  Also pay attention to how he acts around his friends and how he acts when you are there.  We guys have a habit of changing from our normal behavior whenever we are around someone we like.  Also see if he tries to get close to you and or touches you more often.|`|YweJ1PfUaa	when he tries to spend as much time as possible with you.|`|xyQRD8ahaa	there are many kinds of like...<br>  <br>  1. flirting - acting amorously without serious intentions<br>  2. crush - willing to be around<br>  3. love - wishing to be your partner for life<br>  4. friendly - trusting you a lot as a friend<br>  5. pretending - you would already know it!<br>  and may be more...<br>  <br>  figure out - what sort of behavior he has for you?<br>  <br>  then you need to confirm if he liking you is true from heart or its just pretending -playing pranks<br>  <br>  he would talk with you mostly when you are with friends - he flirts <br>  <br>  he would talk with you mostly when you are not with friends - he is falling for you! he might start loving you soon..<br>  <br>  he would talk less with you when you are not with friends but would never talk when you are with friends - he has a crush for you..<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|da5wRmlRaa	there are 2 different types of guys when it comes to crushes.<br>  <br>  there is the quiet,shy one who admires you from a distance.<br>  there is the loud obnoxious one who keeps trying to talk and impress you.<br>  <br>  maybe theres another group of guys.<br>  so if the guy you are referring to fits in this category,<br>  there is a 75% chance that he has the hots for you.<br>  <br>  hope i answered your question :)|`|85YtzzKraa	Here this video explains everything perfectly!

rQlptNZxaa	I know what you mean just try and keep yourself busy and try to get something like a job, march break/summer commin up soon so yea. What i'm trying to say focus on something else.|`|QtvmjOh9aa	Your in love
OGIuahPNaa	Anything is possible, and if she is shy then maybe she never trusted herself with a guy before. Try to start talking to her, eventually (after you really know her) bring up your past first and maybe she will bring hers up too. But I would wait a while in case she gets nervous because it could be a touchy subject with her.|`|nNYBhelGaa	yeh. <br>  ok so i know that i am only 17 but everyone tells me that i am so beautiful and that i should go out with more guys. everyone tells me that i could get any guy that i wanted but i am unfortuantlally very shy and i have never had a boyfrined or been kissed eithor<br>  <br>  i dont mean to sound consided just trying to help|`|mDJInjEaaa	yes very possible|`|ojAo1U1caa	I am confident I am a good looking girl, I didn't get my first kiss till my late teens.<br>  <br>  I was too friggin' scared!!! I would run from any opportunity cos I thought It would be horrendous to be a bad kisser at like 17, so I wouldn't do it : P<br>  <br>  She might be a bit self conscious!|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Um what are you waiting for..........id be all over that girl..........shy means she wants people to start the conversation.|`|zvHYxpVCaa	yup.|`|jQHZsNENaa	Yes this is very possible.  You just said she seems shy.  Maybe she's shy and maybe guys are intimidated to talk to her because she is pretty.  Often times a shy demeanor is misinterpreted as being stuck up or intimidating.  A lot of guys wouldn't want to approach a girl like this for fear of rejection.<br>  <br>  Just because she is pretty doesn't mean she has had the nerve to approach any guys that she's been interested in.  Just because a girl is pretty doesn't automatically mean that she should have the most experienced dating record.  In fact, I'm willing to bet this girl probablly wonders why guys don't approach her.|`|f42e47f206c8c121c24937f3cbafcc22aa	of course it's possible, there're a lot of girls out there like that too, just that they haven't find their mr. right yet, or they just not into relationship at that time. You can try out for yourself. :)|`|bNqnj42Taa	Probably just cause she's shy... I mean I'm reeeeeally shy, so very few guys want to make an effort to talk to me, and I'm not ugly. And I've never kissed or dated, of course it's possible (I'm 17). Make an effort! :D|`|OIOebJyIaa	Definitely possible.  Not typical, but definitely possible.|`|cJd4SRL9aa	Lol uhm, yeah.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of absolutely gorgeous girls who haven't kissed anyone.<br>  <br>  THey just choose not to kiss anyone|`|lMu2J3pNaa	like u said, shes probably just too shy to try to make a move on a guy, and thats probably why she said shes never dated...|`|T0jeHlJ7aa	yes its possible. people just havent asked her out.<br>  and why do you keep saying Really pretty! pretty! you sound kinda shallow looks arent all that matters ya know|`|qlCwiXpyaa	yes.|`|QJRlEZvEaa	Ummm yes! That girl is smart cuz shes putting her educuation b4 relationships! I think u should go out with her
CBa9G4j4aa	You are definitely correct. Guys who get in the sack a lot are known as the top dogs but the girls are "sluts" and other things. I truly believe that a girl isn't a **** unless she runs around looking for someone to hook up with. It is usually the boy that pursues the girl though. Guys are really dumb.|`|kLK2peV1aa	actually. it's true. except, females talk about men with multiple sex partners not gratefully.  I see it around the school all the time. i used to have a few regulars before i fell in love, 3 of them didnt care, one of them wanted a change of heart, and another one said she was tired of being talked bad about and all the names.<br>  <br>  i'm in love now, but my friends did congratulate me for it and the girls, well some, found me as a manwhore.|`|otLRZB5Taa	i think its b.s. that girls are called names for it, but guys just get a pat on the back. it actually really pisses me off. i don't think its good for either gender to have multiple sex partners, especially if they are still young.|`|vRfeCzCMaa	Double standards.
jA1bdyyHaa	File for custody again, see if you can get it back, as long you have the income to support them the judge should give it back to you.<br>  But get a good lawyer not the one who will want money but never did the job.|`|SHARt1k3aa	I think the main goal of any child service is to get the children back with their biological parents.  Of course you have a great chance of getting your children back and good for you for getting your life together.  children need to know their loved by their biological parents, it messes them up for life if they are always wondering if their parents loved them.  Especially because both of their parents aren't in their lives.  That would be my number one goal to get my children back and they will love you for it.  Please never go back to addiction, be there for your children and love love love LOVE them.
TqWXXZ34aa	Give the poor girl a break.. Try to put behind you all the bad things that she may have done to you in the past. Don't be telling her father how bad of a daughter she is. That is mean and selfish. It wasn't her fault that he had to go to court and pay lots of money for her. it was between her father and her mother. That's it.. It isnt her fault that she may act out in a way that you dont like. matybe she feels the same as you do about her father. That "YOU" are trying to steal him away from her. I mean you get to spend 365 days a year with him. IM sure she has some jealopusy for you as well. The reason why she acts like a brat when she stays withyou is because she is scared that her father doesnt love her as much as you. There are two sides to the story always. She feels just as you. She is most likely dreading coming to see you too. She knows the stress it puts on you and she knows that you dont like her . She can sence it just as you can..  My advice is to try and talk hwith her. Open up to her and tell her how you are feeling. You will be a bigger and better person if you are able to get the strength to do this. it will show you that you are brave, and show here that you are not intimatated by her. And the way thaty she acts. For the next coule of days let her have her way with her dad. It's her dad! You praents dont love you less. They are trying to treat you both equal.. that is what you 2 are "Equal". noone is better then the other. You both need to grow up. When your parents pass on. It will be just the 2 of you. And I know that you dont think of stuff like, that but be happy that you have a half sibling. Someone that you should be able to confide in. someone that will always be there when the world isnt. I would sit down with her and tell her that you want to make a mends with her and that you want to start from scratch. Tell her that you dont want to take her "BOND" away from her and her dad.  YOU need to focus on you. Don't be jealous. That will get you no where.

rh12tX8Naa	I hated school too, but you have to do it if you want to be successful. I dropped out of school when i was 16 and got my GED 3 months later. Now, i'm 5 weeks away from getting my Associates. Think about what career you want to do and let school be a motivation to be successful. Good Luck!|`|WVwjKYGZaa	that used to happen to me. just try not to think about it, maybe just think about something you are really looking forward to doing once you get home in the afternoon. last year i left school (i finished year 10) with absolutely no close friends whatsoever. after a while you just get independent, which is great for a young person. it's kinda funny how many people you see that MUST have someone with them by their side 24/7. you might want to get counselling to help you with your anxiety. i did this and it really does help. good luck|`|kK8JAMvUaa	it's a phase.  you'll get numb from it, and just get up everyday and go to hell.

m9haNjVZaa	If you're over it then maybe it's best left, I know it's difficult when people lie to you but if you aren't intending on a relationship with him it's probably best to let it lie.<br>  Besides, if you were on a break then he'd probably say that it didn't matter because he wasn't with you at the time. You're not likely to get a conclusive answer.<br>  <br>  Maybe he liked you and wanted to give it another chance. Maybe that girl was a rebound. But do you really want to drag all this up again?<br>  <br>  Try to move on sweetheart, by the sounds of it it'd be for the best.
vk5R3sCzaa	Aww, hun I feel for you!  I would suggest sending her a message and just say hi and introduce yourself.  Since she is new, ask her if she wants to ever do something, you could show her around.  If that doesn't work out, think about joining a sport/club/activity.  You'll be surprised how many friend you will make.  Good luck!|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	just be like hey give her your email and phone number and stuff so you can call her and y'all can ike start making plans like going to the movies or to a theatre park together OR she could just come to your house!I guess that's how I made friends.Hope everything works out!|`|afYSjcp0aa	slowly start to talk to her   about anything  music celebs.weather     then maybe u can ask her to hang out sometime  but u might want to try and make other  friends so u dont look desperate|`|eR8JygaDaa	Well what I would do is message/comment her or IM her (if you have one) and be like "hey this is (insert name here) i was just wondering how you liike the school" or stuff like that and if she wrote about herself on her profile check that out and see what you have in common and talk to her about it. like the type of music she likes and her favorite tv shows and all that stuff. then after you two start too talk you be able to tell if you would actually like her as a friend and hopefully if you both like each other then youll become closer(:|`|2keIEMFUaa	Ask her if she would like to hang out at lunch, ask her what school did she come from and what it was like.  Ask her if she left any of her BBF's behind and if she has a boyfriend and what was his name and what was it like?  Where does she live invite her over to your house and hang out or do something.  Tell her you know how it feels to lose your BBF (Best Best Friend) share with her what you and your old friend use to do together.  Good luck to you and just be your sweet self.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Has she seen a doctor?  Dizziness is usually highly treatable.  If it's being caused by ear infection, antibiotics should do the trick.  If it's from Meniere's disease, meclizine can do the trick.  If there is some other cause, it could be serious and needs to be treated.    As someone suffering from Meniere's, I can tell you that dizziness sucks!  It's wonderful that you want to do something for you mom.  The only suggestion I could give you are books on tape or music.  For me, if I'm having an attack, I don't really want to do anything but lay still.  Music might be okay, but any visual stimulus makes me want to vomit!|`|JQrGknfMaa	Its nice that you are trying to help your mom.

Music is also really good to help heal you when you are sick- makes you feel good too- have cd's of her fav musik to her to listen to. And just txt her every now again during breaks at school - to check up- and say hi- make sure she's alright- she won't feel as lonely either. Even arrange for some family or friends to visit her during the day for a chat etc- hope she gets better soon
4ZGriYvGaa	she might be upset about something else. just give her some space and let her talk when shes ready

V9xSXPa3aa	In this modern world, there are no such things as age. Hehehe. For me you aren't old yet. yOu still have much time to enjoy your life and choose what you want for your future. If you felt that you are old then I can't change your mind.

You need to shop around until you find someone you can afford who you are comfortable with. The ladies on the local boards at <a href="http://talk.theknot.com" rel="nofollow">http://talk.theknot.com</a> are helpful.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	honestly, in this case, i would take it to a professional.  if you are not quite sure what could be done to make it look best, then there is absolutly nothing wrong with asking for a bit of help from a pro.  <br>  <br>  my sister in law wore a dress that had been worn by her grandmother, mother, and aunt before she got it.  a professional seamstress helped her turn it into her dream dress, and you could still see the older style but it was done in such a way that ANY modern bride would have been proud to wear it.<br>  <br>   a good seamstress can help answer any questions youve got.|`|8ygky5g4aa	You need to take your dress to a seamstress that specializes in restoring and altering vintage dresses.  Search online for vintage seamstresses in your area, or contact local vintage or wedding stores.<br>  <br>  I wore my grandmothers dress and had it altered.  The seamstress I found was extremely talented and could even take a dress a part and re work it into a whole new style if you wanted.  So yes it's totally possible you just need to find the right seamstress.  Don't trust any old seamstress or wedding alteration shop!!<br>  <br>  As far as the cost, depending on what exactly is needed it will probably cost from a few hundred to several hundred, but it will save you money in the long run because you will definitely spend more on a new dress.  Also you do not want to take any chanced in ruining your family heirloom.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|blxlNHeCaa	definitely take it to a professional. You run the risk of ruining the dress completely if you do it yourself and you aren't skilled at doing wedding dress alterations.|`|9nnmoktEaa	I totally agree. Take it to someone who works specifically with vintage gowns. That can be tricky since the fabric may be delicate and difficult or impossible to duplicate.
4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	No way to tell unless you tell your partner.  The hymen is often broken by other means.|`|qScVhUUsaa	It is a common problem. How good are you with needle and thread? <br>  Your Mother might be able to get closer to the item to be refashioned. Use surgical sutures which will eventually dissolve and appear to be the action of your new husband's attentions.|`|ee4c731e172709155a7a44c4d836eaa4aa	He won't know if you're good at faking it. However, it's a pretty dishonest thing to do if it's important to him for religious or cultural reasons.  Couldn't you tell him the truth?|`|8vfCRg7Caa	what religion are you, and why does it matter you arent a virgin before marriage. Did you cheat on him? You should never lie to your husband about your virginity. i could see some other things he may need to know but saying you are a virgin and that you are not is easy to figure out on wedding night. id say tell him after the wedding night. Im laid back though. if its part of your religion as you parents what to do. They probably will give you the best advice. And maybe they might talk to him indirectly.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	A broken hymen doesn't necessarily mean someone's not a virgin. They could've broken it as a child, doing...you know, stuff.<br>  <br>  But anyway, if he really loves you, he shouldn't care that much that you're not a virgin. I mean, how could he control who you had sex with before you met him?!|`|UxlL89rHaa	Some guys can spot a virgin by the way she handles her self in bed. My advice would be to be honest. Because if he ever finds out after marriage your life is over.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	I hope you did not tell him otherwise<br>  you already had sex you are not a virgin|`|ltlTkDjKaa	He won't be able to tell if you're a virgin or not. The hymen can be broken even by a tampon or some other nonsexual activity. The vagina tightens on its own too, after not having had sex even for a few days, you have nothing to worry about. The vagina even goes back to its regular size after giving birth in only one week :)<br>  <br>  But the bigger problem is if you should be hiding that from your soon-to-be husband. I realize you may be religious or have a cultural need to be a virgin, but he loves you not because you're a virgin - he loves you for you. <br>  <br>  Tell him - if you're not ready to tell him, maybe you're not ready for marriage anyway.|`|uAZlvHgiaa	The only way your partner will know that you are not a virgin is if he has been with a lot of women. If he has been with a lot of women then why do you care if he thinks your a virgin.I really don't know why you want him to think you are a virgin. You do realize that you are marrying someone based on a lie.Don't you want someone you are marrying to know who you really are. After all I think it is pretty good that you have only had sex with one person (if its true) & masturbated sometimes.It doesn't sound like you have dated the guy you are marrying for very long. I was really wild young. I do not lie about who I am & about my past. I wouldn't want someone with me based on a lie.I have had 2 that I really cared about. One for 12 years & one for 24 years (they overlapped), they both know the truth. Neither one of them were virgins so why should they expect me to be.|`|cce9d5d3e1f6a8bafb5bad987d7a425baa	dont tell him that you cheated.<br>  and if he sees that your hole is bigger just say you couldnt wait till you were married<br>  sooo you got really horny and masturbated aloooooot<br>  <br>  it might sound stupid but alottt better than..<br>  <br>  "i had sex with another guy"|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	why did you tell us you were fingering? that has nothing to do with your parts getting bigger. that's down right nasty!are you happy to tell the whole world?squeeze as if your holding in your pee for 10sec, then let go. repeat.you sound naive and horny|`|I5SypMlsaa	just act as if it hurts the first time you do it togetehr, you can actually get a surgery that will stich it back up again|`|YhZM84P1aa	um you can say that you broke it when you were little but activities like biking or sometimes stretching. But you sound messed up and that guy your marrying should be with someone else.|`|gp0UKiTjaa	Hi, I would recommend to tell him the truth before someelse tell him. I am sure he will understand that he really loves you. There is no point in starting a new relationship if it has to broke down later on.|`|GiaVm26baa	Okay, I am guessing this has alot to do with your culture and the fact your culture/religion believes you should be a virgin before getting married. Please, do not feel bad about having sex, it is a natural thing as a human being, do not let anyone tell you different. This was your own personal choice, it is no one's business but your own.  Yes, your vagina may have stretched a bit, but there is no way your husband to be will know this unless you tell him. There is no way to make your vagina smaller, but he is not going to notice anyways, he is probably just going to be happy he is having sex with his new wife. Realistically you should be able to talk to your partner about sex, but if its going to be such a big deal with the new husband, i say don't say anything, do not feel bad for having sex before, do not feel shameful or guilty, and move forward. :)|`|UKqDzATkaa	Oh god!! why did you lose your virginity with a guy whom you didn't want to marry or before marriage. Ok, any way it is happened. It is better you tell him that you did masturbation by whatever mean, but that should be reasonable for him to believe. Breaking of hymen is different as other people have answered. It will make your hole bigger. Just it will break one thin skin which was covered inside vagina. Happy married life...Don't worry more dear friend...just dream about your future marriage..|`|82PkTDwwaa	Tell your future husband the truth, I'm sure you would want the same courtesy.

Your brain is not fully developed to make a rational self deciding decision like that. That is why you are considered an adult at 18. You have a lot of growing and maturing to do. Sex should not be a topic you are discussing with a "boyfriend". Your mother is right and you just have to accept what she decides is best for you, That will earn her trust back in you. If you are too embarrassed for your mother to see what you are texting to this guy then you shouldn't be texting it.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Dang....<br>  <br>  I cannot say I would be thrilled that my 13 Year old Daughter was texting sexual things to any Guy....<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  Sheesh, I kind of feel bad for you as well... to the point I am certain you're mortified your Mom saw those messages and are feeling pretty embarrassed... <br>  <br>  I do have to say that while I can understand your Moms fears (She doesn't want you being sexually active) that she probably should approach this from a different perspective in telling you that she loves you so much, and she wants you know that while she doesn't agree with these types of messages (or certainly you entertaining the idea of having sex) that she is there for you if you want to talk or have any questions....<br>  <br>  My feeling is by taking your phone, refusing to have any discussions about what has happenend and thinking she will be able to keep an eye on you or hold your hand all of the time that it will prevent you from engaging in sexual activity... that she is doing you and herself an injustice....<br>  <br>  Although awkward for you hon, I would really suggest you ask your Mom to sit down with you and tell her how embarrassed you feel about the inappropriate messages, assure her that you're not having sex (jeez I hope your not!) and let her know it will not happen again.... <br>  <br>  I'm thinking hopefully with an open discussion and a sincere apology and honesty... your Mom will see that you are approaching an age that you are not such a little girl anymore, and leave the door always open for you so that you don't fear ever telling her something important out of fear or embarrassment....<br>  <br>  Hang in there.

GKWwmnT3aa	Hey man, just tell your girl how you feel. You should be as honest as you can. You are already 2 months in. I definitely think you should tell her how you feel. If she hurts you, you should let her know. Males are not born hardened and emotionally cold like some people seem to expect. Just be yourself, but be considerate. Love makes you do stupid things. At least you are doing it for love. There is no other thing worth doing stupid things for than love. Be smart, receptive, and caring. Girls, especially now a days, don't want to feel like their man is treating them like their incapable of thinking. Make sure you give her enough room to think and in the normal ways do her own thing. When she needs your help or sweetness it should be obvious or she'll probably just ask.<br>  <br>  I have no clue what you 2 are like, but you might also try seeing if you can get her to be sweet and clingy toward you. Sometimes a girl gets bored when she thinks you are easy. At your age things are fast and sometimes wacky. Try being more extroverted rather than in your own head about her. Be receptive of what exactly is going on.|`|vqgGKWagaa	it's good that your sensitive, but there is a fine line between sensitivity and obsessiveness. Don't check up on her unecessarily, this can be clingy and it will be more special if you just give her a text at some point to let her know you are thinking of her. You have only been together 2 months so don't be so full on, have fun and don't ruin things, and don't stop being who you are, because it's rare that you will find a teenage guy these days who cares about a girl.|`|oDtuygT6aa	if she ever did break up with you because your too sensitive.<br>  then eff her, youll find someone better who appreciates you.|`|YbI6PKw3aa	You wanna be more of a man. A girl doesn't want a girly type of guy, unless she is gay and in that case she doesn't want a guy at all lol<br>  <br>  Take up some very physical sport and hang out with guy friends as well as your girlfriend. Stop acting like a girl or it will be a mega turn-off for her and you will lose her. Also be more assertive and decisive as to what you do with her on dates and stuff. <br>  <br>  She is probably bored with you bcoz she finds you too predictable and not a challenge any more.|`|WOYeefoPaa	Thats ok, shes just not the clingy type.

My heart goes out to you.  I remember the days when I was just like that myself.  Wondering why I was so sensitive and all the other guys were just jerks.  I still am very sensitive.  There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that. Let me tell you something... BE YOU.  If anything else, just be you and do it with pride.  If she doesn't like the real you then it aint meant to be my friend.  Trust me... when you are older, it will be one of your biggest assets because in time you will grow confident with yourself and the bottom line is most "good" girls want a sensitive guy.  Just as long as you can stand up for yourself, show an edge that is unique to you, don't take any crap, brush off judgement from others especially girls, and show that you are confident.  Being confident will take a little more effort on your part at this time of your life.  You can show it by not being "paranoid" about your sensitivity but being in control and accepting of who you are.  Especially being sensitive.. cuz at some point that girl will get tired of getting hurt by "bad boyz" and eventually if she's smart want a caring sensitive guy.  Don't trip so much about being sensitive.  Just show that you are who you are with a smile and you'll be okay.|`|b6aace0d0ae37de2263d58c90db44b2aaa	thats adorable.|`|JWNzoksmaa	Being 15 you're not going to understand this...but you will when you get older.  So you're just gonna have to trust what i say here...even though it sounds messed up (b/c it is) you're just gonna have trust someone whose been around for 15 years longer than you have...it'll make sense as you get older and experience more relationships.<br>  <br>  Some girls like to be treated like *hit.  Seriously.  The worst you treat them the nicer and more compliant they are to you.  It has to stem from their home life basically.  If they were raised with their father being a really A-hole to their mother...they view this as love.  Now it sounds like you come from a pretty functional family...where you dad treats your mother with respect and love....or it could be the opposite in your family also.  Maybe your mom treats you dad badly and your dad seems to respond well to this treatment and maybe he just can't do enough for you mom no matter how badly she treats him.<br>  <br>  Basically, you should try to find a girlfriend that will appreciate your adoration for her.  Or you could just start treating her like a piece of poo and see how well that works.  When you start acting like you don't care the more she'll want to try to make you care by treating you like a prince.  See right now, she knows she has you wrapped around her little pinky finger...she knows no matter how poorly she treats you...you'll always be there like a waiting puppy dog.  Maybe you should stop caring so much.  Seriously, no one likes a lap dog.  It makes you not respect your partner.  <br>  <br>  I understand you love your girlfriend and you just wanna get all mushy and puppy dog eyes with her...but for whatever reason she's not that sort of chick. It can betcha it stems from her home life....OOORR..and this may hurt a bit...but she's just not that into you...at least not as much as you're into her.  You're the "right-now" boyfriend until something better comes along.  Whatever you do, do not beat yourself up over this.  It's not your problem it's hers  You seem like a really sweet guy...and she doesn't seem like she deserves you.  So maybe you should find someone who will appreicate your sweetness.|`|VxVgkilLaa	sign up for a sport and toughen up.<br>  lol! just kidding, and be who you be.|`|O2hZicPXaa	Well don't check up on her to much wait until she comes to you|`|MfG75qy1aa	nah dude you're not. listen if you honestly care for her and her happiness and that annoys her, then she's not so amazing. <br>  if you care about her don't you think she has to care about you too? <br>  i know this hurts but talk to her about it if she gets pissed or annoyed then you'll know she doesn't care. sorry dude it's time to say goodbye then. <br>  you seem like a good guy [haha no im not gay] you can do better. <br>  <br>  INSTINCT :]|`|ltHslyCeaa	You sound extremely like Edward from the "twilight" books minus the whole vampire thing|`|XbFEFJsgaa	lol chics dont want dudes that act like they cant get anyone else. be nice and have fun man, and i know ur only 15 but get some while u can, and stop whinning or ur gonna end up alone!|`|lzZjSNgkaa	This is a very good question, and brings back a bunch of memories for me, even though I'm a long way from 15 years old!  Some girls seem to confuse sensitivity with weakness in a man.  Unfortunately, a lot of women, 'specially younger ones, like more of the "bad boy" image, and nice guys like us finish last!  Now, like it or not, emotional pain does equal growth, and if you lose her it won't be the end of the world, but I know it'll sure feel like it.  Please don't let anyone put you into a box or a mold of their choice,and try to change you... one day I'm sure you'll find that your sensitivity is more of a blessing than the curse it seems now.  Good luck to you, learn from your emotions, and try to use them in a positive way if you can... I remember being 15 years old and it really does hurt a lot of the time.  P.S. It really does get better!|`|A5nZFjEoaa	Well i was going out with a guy for like 2 weeks and i broke up with him because he was too clingy!

Just be careful.|`|w23GY6ZOaa	I have never had a girlfriend, but one of my best friends is a girl and I have come to understand that girls hate it when guys become too clingy.  They feel as if they aren't being trusted, which is properly what your girlfriend is thinking.  She also properly wants her own space.<br>  <br>  You sound like a really sweet boyfriend and she properly does still like you, but you being around her 24/7 has made her take you for granted.<br>  <br>  Take a step or so back (not too far) and you'll find your relationship should be back on track.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work and she still hurts you, maybe she isn't the girl for you.

Being clingy and constantly needing her to reaffirm how she feels to you is your hang up.  If she's not happy, she'll let you know.  Just be yourself and stop second guessing yourself.  Also, you may want to start looking for a girl who appreciates you for who you are.  She thinks you are too clingy and too sweet?

AA11765749	What you're going through it totally normal. Especially if your grandpa and you were really close. My grandma passed away last year, from cancer (and it was kind of sudden. One day she went into a coma, and two days later she died.) One thing that might help is sitting down to a dinner, or lunch (doesn't matter), as long as the whole family is together, and eating your grandpa's favorite foods, and talking about fun memories of or with him. You should probably hold off on that, however, until you're a little more composed about all of this. Listening to sad music really helps too. For me, the song that helped  A LOT was Josh Groban's " Remember me". Since you're Christian, you belive in heaven, right? It might be the last time you saw your grandpa in this planet, but when you die, you'll see each other in heaven. And the stuff about him missing out, he isn't. He's probably watching over you and your family, so he'll be there for everything you do. Your grandma probably changed because this is really hard for her too. There's this thing called the Stages of Grief. It's actually kind of helpful, knowing what's going on and stuff. If you want you can google it. OK. Last thing. The thing where you're angry with the person, you have EVERY right to be angry. You're only human after all. He took something important away from you because he was careless and stupid. What I'm saying is... don't hate the guy, but give yourself a little time. Maybe someday, in a couple of years, you'll find that you ARE able to forgive him. It's all about time. Time IS the best healer of all, after all.|`|66jX06Onaa	I'm sorry for your loss. I was close to my grandpa too, and really missed him when he died.  Things to try to help you through this tough time:  Start a journal. Write down all the fun memories you have of spending time with your grandpa. Write them down now, so you will be able to remember them for many years to come. They may make you cry when you write them, but it's a wonderful way to get out the pain and joy together. Try to think of something to write every day for a month. You can also write about the pain and anger you feel too. Get it all down on paper.  Then, put the journal away. Wait a couple of weeks and then read through what you wrote. Pick out a couple of fun memories and share them with your grandma. Tell her how much you loved your grandpa and share the memories. She may cry, but she'll also love knowing how much you love and miss him too and may share some fun memories with you that she has too.   It'll take time, but these things will help you get through the pain and still embrace the great memories of your very special grandpa.
WDs4fRoxaa	Counseling, structure, and programs.    You may be able to get some type of counseling  through the county.    They have programs to help parents.    Structure meaning detailed schedule, consistent  discipline (not hitting, but not letting up on rules),  and constant praise.    Programs meaning anger management, karate,  sports, etc...    If they have to get up at a certain time, leave at a certain time,  be involved in all of the above at a certain time...and do it all under the supervision of an adult...they will start to change.    Best wishes|`|umzzx0Noaa	Well i think that the only way you are going to make this work is to recognize that your two beautiful sons want to have a relationship with their bio-mother- they have a need to know her and connect with her. They need to know who they are- where they come from. I suggest that you involve bio-mum in your family- and welcome her with open arms- to bbq's, dinners, atleast weekly. Make it scheduled Bio-mummy time. Make friendz with her- forgetting all prejudice or animosity and forgiving all wrongdoings. I think that it is important for you to remain the parent and to take control- and to realise that you won't be losing anything - you will be making your children happier- and more adjusted adults. They will see that you are strong and that you have their best interests at heart. Maybe you could even get them a mobile to talk to her on- or let them phone her as frequently as they would like to. You need to re-assure them that you love them and talk to them- be positive and happily say- ' so you want to see more of bio-mummy?.... and have the talk- and talk to the bio-mum and tell her that you're happy to have her involved in her bio-sons lives- and explain that you are naturally protective of them - as they are your baby's and you dont want them hurt- im sure she will understand and things will be alot smoother for you
2CnhBR86aa	ignore him|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	do as I say and not as I do and everything will be just dandy
g0xqgidLaa	If you really want to make her last birthday special you can do something that is very affordable.. Have family members donate videos, pictures, and other memrobilia and make a slide show of her life to show at her birthday party. Make sure everyone in your family is there. As a gift you can make a scrapbook of some of the other pictures, videos, and other memrobila that wasent in the slideshow. I did this for my mothers last bithday and she loved it so much and she talked about it until thte day she died.|`|wntdMR8caa	Yes, just make sure everyone is there with her. Also take her to a simple place to eat. like maybe a place where she used to eat when she was young. like for my grandma i know sometimes ill make a point to take her to go get some coney island hotdogs and it brightens her up especially with her alshiemers. take her for a ride if you live in a country type place. like a beach drive, or like a forest drive. really anything. just make sure to do calm things.. and make sure to do her whole birthday thing before you do this way she is not to tuckered to do the whole cake and candle thing with the excitement of the company.|`|my3KKl4Baa	just get her some shampoo or body wash things like that|`|bM71Fp1raa	Take her someplace that is filled with natural beauty.

Find family that she hasn't seen in a while and have a surprise birthday party for her.  After all, it is family that is more important.|`|3yB5TfL7aa	just spend the day with her, have a nice cake done and flowers, have a morning tea or lunch gathering.|`|HWmRvunvaa	get the family together for a night of photo taking, lots of hugs, and kiss's. every one take turns telling her why they love her so much... put it on video.|`|JQrGknfMaa	Have a nice dinner and make sure to make sure she is surrounded by the ones who are closest to her.  I think she would appreciate being around her love ones.  The person who made the coffin comment is an ***.|`|56MmKc5caa	I think that spending time with her family is enough. Just get everyone together and throw a surprise party for her don't give her a heart attack yelling surprise though. Maybe go out to a nice restaurant if that is possible i'm sure she'd enjoy a great meal with the exception of what her diet is not sure is it regular ? Is she diabetic? Puree foods? find these things out first. Not sure with the wheelchair situation can she walk at all? Does she need a van to go places?

I hope she enjoys her party.|`|pjgQAXM7aa	I'm really sorry about your mother, I really hope that she isn't going through pain right now. The best thing that I can think of is just have a major and humongous party, or just close relatives and friends with her for her birthday party, right at home(which I'm sure she would prefer). Do you have a photobook of you or other siblings when you were a little baby? I think she would be delighted to see that.
rh12tX8Naa	Tell them that you will try your best to bring the D up. Tell them how bad you want to go snowboarding and ask them if there is anything you can do to change their mind. Good Luck!

I would be so disgusted, and I would also be worried for your brother's girlfriend!     I wouldn't let him come to the wedding, or even give me away if he was doing this.

RED FLAG!|`|gqmtPx8gaa	He may not be cheating but he's definately hiding something from you. Their friendship may be a bit more than "friends"...     Tell him to be honest with you. If he cheated on you and admits it then you can forgive and work on the relationship. It's the lieing that hurts the most.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Well  myself included, no one on Yahoo Answers will be capable of answering this, however, they say if you are feeling like he is cheating and ya just have this intuition that it is happening, then chances are it is, so instead of listening to others who will make many suggestions and ideas, trust your gut.|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	He's cheating|`|VfuCXCRAaa	well what were the messages that you did see?    Not sure if hes cheating, My best friend is a guy but i have met his girlfriend many times.  But he is definetly hiding something!|`|T9hKxmGPaa	Red Flag.  If this was an innocent friendship, he would have no need to delete logs and hide messages. Sounds like something is going on. I would look more into the situation. You are not overreacting. Your gut is telling you that something within this situation is not right, and you are likely correct. It may or may not be to the extent of cheating, but something is going on that he does not want you to know about it.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	get rid of him, before you have to put up with a lot more crab that he brings.|`|mE48VMXiaa	He may not be physically cheating, but he's deleting texts because there is something more than a "friendly" relationship... Maybe they're just flirty texts, but if that's the case, it's emotional cheating, which can be just as hurtful or worse than physical cheating because he's exploring his other options.  If he truly values your relationship, he would have introduced you to her to avoid any suspicions in the first place...Commited men don't have female friends they don't introduce to their partner.... there's a reason you haven't met her.  He may be avoiding the awkwardness of being in the same room with the two of you together or fearful that you'll catch any weird tension between them.     If he's turning his phone off, leaving it behind, or putting it on silent when you're together, they're talking or texting pretty frequently.  If you are looking through his texts, also check the most recent list; even if he's deleting the content, you'll know its still going on if her number is one of the most recent.|`|K7fVSLSKaa	There is a sure fire way to find out if he's cheating on you in 5 minutes or less.

CNSGz12zaa	Move on, don't waste your tears....you will find another.|`|83r5cMh4aa	i feel you have the answer... you already know he is not going to "step on his best friends turf" this is something you need to deal with unfortunatly or break up with your boyfriend because your heart is not completely there and then you loss a great love and a good friend. I feel you know the right thing to do you just need someone to talk to that is not so close to you... anyways good luck...|`|kvcIdORcaa	let your bf go... you don't love him and you're only thinking about the friend. don't you feel guilty?|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Wow what a trauma ?   Take it easy and see things straight for good for you in future without too emotionly enggaged. Good. Luck.|`|AA12272885	I think you are in love with an idea.  We often think what we can't have is the one thing that would make us happy, and we ignore the happiness already at our feet.  It is human nature I guess, but all it does as you can see is make you miserable.  If this guy really wanted to be with you, he would never have used excuses- he would have just done it.  So you are right you will never be with him, especially now  that you are with his friend.  So try to be honest and compassionate.  If you can't love your bf and constantly think of someone else, leave him.  I bet if you do, then you will look back and regret what you did.|`|N2xzSXosaa	Aw,  I know this situation has to suck, but honestly... I have 2 really good options for you, but be for-warned, they are both VERY risky:    A.) Break up with your boyfriend. It's not fair to be with him knowing that you don't feel like you love him. You can be happy with someone but not be in love with them and it sucks when things happen that way, but that's why you should recognize the difference because sooner or later things will take a bad turn. Especially if you knew all along that you were in love with someone else and didn't do anything about it.    B.) Stay with your boyfriend. Sure, you fell in love with his bestfriend first. But it seems almost like his bestfriend is hinting that he's better as a memory than as your man. [Yes, I know those are song lyrics by they fit perfectly.] He seems to have a lot of respect for his bestfriend which is highly repremendable and obviously means your boyfriend is a great guy who deserves a great girl. And, I don't personally know you... but I think you are a great girl. So maybe if you realize that you have someone in your life right now how really cares about you and wants to be with you... you'll grow to love him more and more and you'll see that you were brought together with your boyfriend and not his bestfriend for a reason.    However, that is risky, because you could end up hurting him if you don't develop feelings... but I think it's worth a shot. You all seem like really great people.    Follow your heart hun.  Best wishes!|`|WNB4Vojsaa	2 long. summarize in 3 sentences or less.|`|S7Y8L5lMaa	join the club...    i cant tell you how he feels about you from a lil paragraph.    i would tell him how you feel its better than crying over no knowing.    its worth a shot.    good luck|`|7e8NN8saaa	Just because you are in love doesn't mean you have to do anything about it. It is really easy to fall in love - but not so easy to work it out.    You want to spend as little time thinking about this guy as possible. Make yourself so busy you don't have time to think. It will pass.|`|nOVyrsl4aa	I think you should count your blessings with your boyfriend, you said yourself that you are happy with him and he treats you well. What does this other guy that he doesn't?....that's worth you risking a good partner|`|1R5zuWdDaa	well I think if you love him so much. to go for him. because you dont wanna live a sad miserable life.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	first of all you have a b/f that you said is wonderful why would you want to jeopardize that. As for as your b/f/f  he already told you how he felt when he said that even if he was interested that he wouldn't cross his friend turf or territory you should respect him and yourself if you think that you are in "love" with him then break off the relationship with your b/f it is not fair to him to be in a one-sided relationship even if you get together with his friend good can't possible come out of it there will always be issues of trust lurking around.|`|BO4ND6x5aa	im a be blunt with u..... if u thinking of the other guy u don't truly love your bf.. so your going to have a big question to answer in your part...  will you stay with your bf... who u say u "love n care for him"   or  will you break up with him and go for his best friend...  atleast your bf bestfriend knows his place and isent trying to get between u n your bf so the choice is your to pick who u want...    good luck n hope everything goes the best it can|`|kUxJJzzmaa	Ive been in this situation befor and it aint pritty,     The best edvice i can give to you is observe more on your bf friend, see if he actually cares, test him in a way, the party example you said up there was a perfect example. but make shure. And if you really like him, tell your boyfriend that you dont feel much about him and move on to other. That is if you like him more then your bf. The other thing is it seems , sorry to say this but your using your bf to get the attention of the other.     But since you love him. its best to break it off now and go to the other befor your current relationship stays together to long    So in my opinion go to the one you love for how he acts, and now how he looks. about all i can give you|`|nS5bZhwnaa	then find someone else|`|rzHRFEvjaa	go with wat ur heart tells u|`|1W82FNH6aa	The friend probably feels attracted to you as you do to him so a bit of flirting may be happening but that's about all, what else can he do, he probably assumes you 2 are both happy and would not do anything to hurt his mate.    It is possible to feel attracted to more than one person at a time and you probably do love your bf but wouldn't it be fair for all if you concentrated on the guy your with now and if you feel you really love him then you have to do your best to avoid thinking, flirting or anything else with the friend.    If not then break it with bf first before you start anything elsedon'tnt forget that if you do end up with the friend, there friendship will probably end, he may not want danythingng for that reason or may not even want to be with you except for the occasional flirt and ull be left with neither.  Its a difficult one!!

You can (if you're desperate) convince your friends to help you. Gang up on him with makeup or something to that effect.  3) Any older than that... I can't help you.

JCK4sKfPaa	I think you were right. But guys rarely apologize, so if I were you I would apologize to him, and then he might apologize back. But unless you are really sure you like him don't do anything. If he is what makes you happy, then go . . . try to work things out.    Hope I Helped! ;-)|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	you wanted his attention right then and there and didn't get it just let it go then call him back and talk to him like nothing even happen.  he didn't mean to forget about you it's just that he wanted to get that taken care of right then and there first that that he was able to have nothing else to stand in his way of talking to you.  kind of a save the best for last kind of thing|`|u3xzrJszaa	......whoa! Lotta info. Confusing. Uhm... well..... just, does his memory falter alot. Cause if it does no biggie.|`|MTiOchh9aa	Until you get a ring on your finger you are still in the game.  I am a guy married 3 years now so this is honest.  If he has already quit chasing you, you better quit.  Like I shouldn't have told my wife.... "it is always the man's fault"...  It was a mistake to say it on my part, but it is true.  If you are not  1 priority then you have to get him back on the hook or cut the line.|`|51hThZ17aa	Sorry, but it seems trivial, and I'm sure it will blow over. I can understand that you're feeling ignored, but that was probably not his intention. Men are often insensitive and don't understand why us women sometimes make such a big fuss about something that seems trivial to them.     Therefore they are puzzled by our "hurt" behaviour and wonder what in the world got into us. He probably blames it on PMS... :)    Be the bigger person here and forgive him for not understanding how his action made you feel ignored. Explain it gently, so that the next time it may happen, he will understand better if you get upset.     Btw, I think it's adorable that he likes to spend time with his dad.|`|AA12044809	i think there is too much drama in your relationship.    you want to talk and he don't want to listen.  think about it.|`|441GSyaMaa	so his dads truck broke down and he went to help him? you then tried to contact him later to carry on a conversation then had this arguement because he didn't call you back (because he's helping his dad) ?    I'd say you were in the wrong then, sorry....    if i'm reading wrong then let me know :-P|`|1s6mQJqOaa	I am sorry but I agree with your boyfriend I don't think he was perposlly trying to hurt your feelings! I hope you make up!|`|oPrMQkJQaa	i think you went a litte to far cause sometimes people need their space maybe he just wanted to eat with his dad and have a conversation instead of talking to you while u yellled at him so yeah
owRAguaNaa	Get your fiance to beat the hell out of him. I'll be damned if i let some loser harass me and my girl. But seriously confront him or call the police. That guys starting to get a little crazy. This could lead to something tragic. Fix it before it's to late.
Ih4T0QpOaa	wow! long story! LOL   First thing that came to my mind is to get a restraining order.  You have all the reasons to believe that your and your fiance's life are in danger and this can be proven by his past mental health records.    Second, perhaps this is a bit drastic, but you might want to consider finding another place of residence.  Change phone numbers and only give them to people you trust.  People who understand what you're going through with this person.    I worry for your safety and your fiance's.  I think you should also discuss this with the police - perhaps getting a restraining order will start the ball rolling and you'll get more support from the police officers, etc.    Lastly, this is the time that you and your fiance should have the strongest relationship!  This is a stressful time for both of you and you two should realize that together you're stronger to face and solve this challenges you're going through.  You didn't say if you told your fiance about the bedroom incident when you were drunk, if you haven't told him yet - you should tell him now and get it all out.  You don't want this x-friend to use that against you.  If he does and catches your fiance in bad mood, your fiance might turn against you - I honestly don't think he will, but better safe than sorry.  You have to be 100% open with your fiance.  And assure him that you love him and whatever it is you're facing now, you two can take care of it - as long as you're together.    wow - that's a long answer for a long question! :)  LOL ---- good night!|`|AA12107138	Restraining order, why would you wanna put up with all that ****?|`|xLYxfVrZaa	file a restraing order! FAST|`|1qPH52x6aa	yes ben in your shoes you'll never be able to prove it till u actually see or have a neighbor tell u they seen someone which i would ask if they ever seen anyone around day or nite . you see it makes no diffrence if he got a girlfriend or not hes sounds mentally off and id be very carful i had a male cousin one time poped into our small town and since he grew up here the police brought him to where me and one of my brothers and our kids lived togather and we let him stay and while my brother was at work he started telling me hes raped girls and kept following me around the house scared me to deathk so i called  my mom who raised him and told her about the stuff he was saying and doing and she said go buy him a bus ticket and make sure he gets on it so when my brother got home i said dont get out of the car take him to the bus and stay there till he gets on lol that was over 10 yrs ago so  i hope this ends for u cause we dont know where he is but nones safe as long as hes free to roam so good luck take care of u|`|c5UAa65qaa	File a police report on the vandalism and phone calls, mention your suspicions to them, and look into whether you'd need any additional proof to obtain a restraining order.  It doesn't really sound like conclusive evidence, so I'd focus on trying to address the problems first and deal with him only if you have to.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	You need to involve the law into this because now not only is he being a moron, he is unsafe for you and your fiancee. And it can actually get violent. (hopefully not) He is mentally unstable.  You need to file a police report and get a restraining order. Anything that belongs to him, return it. And just forget about him. I think only a shameless man would keep coming back after being kicked out of someone's house. (especially a friend).    PLEASE do yourself a favor hand it over to the police. That way if he does anything stupid...they will deal with it.|`|5k7BexD3aa	You need to file police reports on every incident.  He sounds like he needs serious help.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	That's freaky, and I'm sorry you had to go through it.  I'd say for now, keep your eyes open for anything strange going on.  Make sure you keep your doors and windows locked.      Basically you can't prove it was him, but be extra cautious and report anything strange to the police (including what's happened so far, and let them know you suspect who it was but have no proof, they may be able to look at his call records and link him to it).
6U9b2t4raa	Why stop at slapping him?   Why not a good kick in the nuts?  The freaking guy and his little hot chocolate with mini marshmallow crap...what a load of BS.    umm...

Flirting makes us all feel a little more secure with ourselves. Of course it's really classless to flirt in front of your partner.

You both need to practice a tiny bit more subtlety though!|`|LDv4dqLraa	JC ? You meaan THE JC ? The one in the bible ?

He wouldn't have married you if he thought you would be that way.    70% of marriages are initied by women.  Men make more effort,  more sacrifices, and take more responsibility when it comes to marriage.... even when it fails.... men are REQUIRED TO be more responsible than you.    Show some respect to the man you WANTED To marry you.  He didn't marry you so you could play with other men and think its CUTE.    He bought you a diamond ring worth two months of after-tax savings that took him a year to save.... and gave you wedding HE didn't ncesssarily want.    What did YOU do for HIM?????    Stop being a harlot.  Your husband earned it more than you did.|`|AA11683646	Must we be there constantly to keep thoughts of the neighbors   from entering the picture?  After all, I had to go out, plowed the drive , made dinner built the fire BEFORE I left.    I'd hate to think it was for someones benefit who did not reside here.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	I think you should pray for forgiveness to the The Almighty Flying Spaghetti Monster.  He will grant you absolution as soon as you have eaten a whole bowl of his "flesh" in the holy tradition of sucking each strand so that the whiplash is sufficiently forceful to splatter his bolognaise "blood" all over your face.  The final act of contrition will be to offer your "blood" spattered face to your husband for him to lick you clean  This act of consummation will fill him with the FSM's Saucy Spirit which will force him to speak in "tongues" the language of love and perform the sacred ritual of Pasta Clitoris.  After his tongue performance you should offer yourself to him for honest contraception-free coupling during which you should pray loudly to the God of Lasagne Orgasma as he proceeds to inflict upon you at least 100 Pasta Uteri.    You will know if this act as submission has been successful in saving your marriage if you begin to vomit regularly some 6 weeks later. This is the first sign.  If you are also without menstrual affliction and feel the need to eat that most heinous of food, vegetarian carbonara, you may wish to seek absolute confirmation from the elders on Yahoo Answers who in response to your question "Am I pregnant?" will shower you with the benefit of their wisdom in the time-honoured tradition of lecturing you about being a sl ut.  Ramen.|`|7foornMVaa	LOL desperate house wives......the drama continues..............|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	What?  You made it sound as if you wanted another guy (JC), he made it sound as if he wanted another woman (your friend).    So far it sounds even to me.  Slapping him would be hypocritical.    Edit: true, but why does assuming nobody will ever find out make it okay?  You're saying it would have been fine for your husband to say what he did if your friend hadn't actually been there to hear it?  And obviously your comment wasn't particularly private because it did get back to them after all.  Look, I grant you, what he did was brazen and pretty damn disrespectful, okay?  I'm just saying, this one time, I don't think you're in a position to criticize.  You know how hell hath no fury etc?  Sometimes it works for guys too.  I think this was just a childish reaction on his part.|`|rPywKtJRaa	hmmmm this is very interesting.  He might like it if you slap him.    ~brb  God Mags I just feel the love in this room.

Since I have my own I suppose I am happy, did you see Mag's ring (she has a ring and a snuggie!)
869bb7a223baecd52d10fd82a9beab0caa	I'd say it is an emotionally abusive relationship. It doesn't sound like he is a good boyfriend. He should be making you feel good about yourself. I would end that relationship, I know that might not be an option for you but I'm just saying what I would do. Well. Good Luck! =]|`|kvcIdORcaa	he is probably stressed. i doubt he means it when he flips out like that. he might regret it right after and is sorry. i wouldn't be surprised if it's a habit of his or something dealing with things that way.|`|Cqd1fkC0aa	He sounds like a jerk. Maybe he's hitting it on the side, if you get my drift.      Sorry. :(|`|Z4B93N31aa	He always tells me stuff like, "You're so annoying! You're just like MY  mom! but other than that thats too far   my boyfriend has gone further but i have said stuff too.  but  we are trying to change!    aww talk to hi or get someone  better or you can cut his penis off!|`|hUsW2Iymaa	girl, YES, if youre not in love which Im sure you couldnt be after all that....RUN.    Hes changed b/c the honeymoon portion of the relationship ended and youre seeing who he really is. He isnt going to change. If you dont like him for who he is then leave.|`|G4KKm0IOaa	yes.break up with him.He's emotionally abusing you and if you stay it'll only get worse|`|hEcKmleVaa	Yes, this is emotionally abusive behavior.  You called him on it and he blows up.  He promises to change:  How will that happen?  What will he do to change?  Will he go to anger management or counseling?  My guess would be no.  He is disrespecting your feelings, making fun of your appearance, calling you names, and criticizing you daily.  Is that really a boyfriend?  He sounds like someone to be avoided.  You say you are much younger.  I think he is behaving like an abusive parent!  Ask yourself some hard questions before you let this guy totally ruin your self-esteem.  You are too good for him!|`|jvvDbAl5aa	uh i really dont care|`|ZH1IE8kLaa	yes. get out of that relationship. he is not worth it. you can find someone better who will apperciate who you are and not try to change you. never change yourself for a guy.. you'll always lose yourself in the process and it's even harder to find who you are after it's over. leave him. he's not worth your heartache.|`|7UKJY0v0aa	o im sry sweetie, but i think it is an emotionally abusive relationship:( but you soo young, so its good that you found out, and you can move on and find someone who treats you like you should be treated. I seriously think you should think about leaving him and finding someone who is right for you.      xoxo~|`|vNzc4RnAaa	yeah, thats terrible. hes being such a dick over nothing. you might want to reconsider who your with if they treat you like that    sorry =[|`|mHt73Uvhaa	Yes. Most people think emotional abuse always has to be using obscene language and vehement insults, but emotional abuse can also be talking about you, always making you feel incompetent and making you believe that it's your fault that they're mad ("if you didn't do this I wouldn't always have to yell at you"), and breaking promises. It won't get better, you need to get out of that relationship now.|`|tYhkdr63aa	you're probably scared of him by now and that fright will make it even harder to break up...so maybe you could talk to your mom and get her on your side, or a friend or sibling, that could talk since into you, and that could back you up in person when you need to get your things.    He might just be bad socially.  if you're not too afraid, talk to him about it.  he'll probably just be offended and yell at you though.      the only answer is, stop taking his ****.  if he says "GIMME BJ" then say, no.  when he asks why say you feel like he was too mean to you today.  he'll probably badger you or beg you.    if you love him try to make it work, but dont ever feel emotionally abused.  bend him until it breaks.  then breaking up will be easy, and for the better.|`|mMmdJKvRaa	um tell him to F Off and get away from him. that is sooo not healthy and obviously it doesnt make you feel good. run away from that mess. not to mention he probably has an extremly low self esteem if he has to make himself feel better by talking to you like that. seriously leave before he starts doing worse things to you|`|X4bE3Havaa	Ok heres the thing. there is no reason that he should be talking to you like that. im sure you are beautiful so dont let him get to you. You should not be giving him bj or anything because he is noce to you after he should be nice to you all the time. your his girlfriend and should be treated well. my suggestion is to leave him and try and find someone better, which dosnt sound like it will be hard. and yes he is being emotionaly abusive|`|AEgkcLEjaa	he  called u icky|`|8MiSxYyeaa	I think it's time to cut your losses and go a different route... If he can't treat you right then you should find someone who will.  No one should be treated like that.
OWbLJOotaa	I think so. Why do you want to pretend to be married if you are not? Are you trying to avoid getting hit on? Because that would work.    But if you want to make a commitment to a partner without a legal marriage taking place, why not have a civil ceremony?|`|ECe1rgsdaa	No, it may be annoying though if you are trying to date and people think you are already married!|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I have to wonder why a person would do this.      A wedding ring is a symbol.  Why someone would display a symbol that doesn't symbolize anything seems rather pointless to me.  Why bother?|`|JjTinVMSaa	no but people will thing your married     why are you wearing one did you get married before but doesn't want to let go|`|ZbCLP2Kxaa	Why would you do this? What is the significance?|`|mF3PsJUVaa	the rings are a sign of ommintment, you dont need a piece of paper to tell you that, so go ahead and wear the rings and call eachother husband/wife if thats how you feel.
MVxFOI5naa	Don't ever marry a guy like your Dad-they aren't all like that you know.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	if thats not the kind of marriage you want to be in, find an easy going guy to be with.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Not all marriages are like that. Your mom puts up with it. You need to be an independent woman and act like one after your marriage also.|`|gfHutvEFaa	cuz u believe your husband will do the exact thing to you that your dad did to your mom. when you think you've found the one, talk to him, get to know him, observe how he is with others. Trust your gut. Counseling wouldn't hurt either.    Good luck.|`|U88H6YlEaa	If you think you'll regret it, then don't do it.   Not all marriages are like your parents however. Marriage is an equal partnership where each person encourages and supports the growth of their partner. It can be very beautiful.|`|QkYRnTPIaa	Your dad was a poor role model for you.  Little girls look up to their fathers and often marry men that have similar traits, personalities and characteristics.  Your sense of foreboding is correct.  You don't want to marry a man that will treat you like your dad treats your mom.  If you recognize this you will seek out a husband that will respect you and treat you equally.|`|XmudUg2aaa	You just answered your own question.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	What's the rush ? Chill on it until you are sure you've got a goodun|`|6aVtiTKiaa	I think there are good guys out there that will treat you well.  They're hard to find though.     As far as the situation with your Mom and Dad ... you just don't allow yourself to be put into that type of situation.  As long as you always have your own car, your own money, a guy can't order you around.  You just do what you want anyway.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Normal under your circumstances,  but  that does not mean that all parents have the same type of relationship. You don't have to regret as you will be careful about the partner you will choose.|`|F1TFSVRBaa	I think the experience that you have had to date with marriage is not positive.  This can cause you to think if I do it and get treated like my mother, I will regret it.  Whilst no marriage is perfect all the time, you will need to be the ultimate judge of character if you are ever to take that path.  Marriage can be great, if the person you enter into marriage with is just as great as you.  Then again, you could chose never to marry and be happy with your situation whether you live with someone or alone.    Also, your mother has allowed your father to dictate what she can and cant do.  If there is one thing you can take from that, it is the personal power you have to hold your independence.|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	because your dad's a douche bag- find his complete opposite and you'll be much happier than your mom could ever dream of being.|`|mV8FoLQoaa	You think you will regret marriage based on your parents marriage? Just because there are faults in their relationship  doesn't mean it will happen to you. It takes 2 to make a marriage work, love and respect has to be part of that. Your father doesn't respect your mother, your mother doesn't respect herself enough to let your dad treat her that way. If you find that special person who you want to spend the rest of your life with, then make it work for you.
flxHpF52aa	Don't worry you will find someone it is better to find a nice a wait longer than finding a jerk and crying afterwards about it.|`|AABCy5mQaa	My suggestion to you is to go with something different. I, too, used to only go out with  "specific" types of guys. The ones I were attracted to. But I always got the same result. Then I met someone who was totally different, and I fell in love. Go outside the box for good men.

Good luck.|`|Ub1IOPsraa	That's an interesting question.  We must be careful for what we pray for.  The Good Book conveys to us to pray often with all our hearts to Him and He will hear you.

If it did I would have a wife and have won the lottery a few times.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	while i agree with the first answerer, i do have to say that i prayed for a good one, and im pretty sure i got one!     try expanding your horizons to look for me, or thinking outside the box. when you're 28 you should be focused on the prospect of a lifelong partner, confidant and lover, not having the hottest guy in the world.     try societies and clubs that would naturally attract- if not older men- than mature men. Clubs like political organizations, religious groups and book clubs. These are all places that lend themselves to easy conversation (you can talk about shared beliefs or guest speakers) and are low key, no pressure.     good luck, chicky! :)|`|encb0jc2aa	FIRST drop the plan to be married in two years, you'll end up with some asshole who beats you....

Just because YOU want to be married by 30 (sorry sweety that's LAME) doesn't mean a guy will want to oblige.    To say "WHERE IS HE?? I WANNE BE MARRIED BEFORE I'M 30" about a man you've never even met - is really kind of tragic.  That's why a man like me would never even want to MEET you.     Let alone marry you.    Men like me are not interested in being the man "YOU always wanted"  We are interested in being the man WE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE.    And if some spectacular girl wants to come along and enjoy the ride - GREAT.

All good things in life take time.|`|AA10250709	Stop trying so hard and lose the time limits.  Love happens when you least expect it.  Focus on yourself. The right guy will find you in the right time...promise.

deAyKj2Uaa	my fiance does something similar. he doesnt text it to me since we sleep in the same bed, lol, but every night we have a 'goodnight' routine.  i think it is very sweet.  im sure she appreciates it and makes her feel special.  if she hasnt said anything, dont worry about it.  routine things like that makes women feel secure in a relationship, like they have something solid.  most girls want that, so if youve already got it, more power to ya!|`|cGpC8547aa	No, that is very sweet. You need to show the romantic part of you sometimes when its the right moment. You will know when the moment is going to happen. :)|`|Tf19RETiaa	noo i think it would be really sweet = )|`|7yrdcqY1aa	its very sweet but if it happened every night i would begin t think it is just a habit. it would mean more if you did it every once n a while i would appreciate it more :) but you sound very sweet and respectful :)|`|vCTMZKrgaa	I think it's sweet that you do that for your girl. Some girls are different so we can't tell you. But try skipping a night and see if she says anything.|`|AA11814087	It wouldn't annoy me. I think that is very thoughtful and kind of you to do that. I hope she appreciates you. :-)|`|h9VfwcK7aa	noo  it'ss not  it'ss totaallyy sweeet (:  i wishh mii boyfriendd doess thaat to mee ):  buhh, everyy girll is different  shee mitee thinkk it'ss annoyin' whilee otherr girlss mitee findd it sweet n' romaanticc kindaa
IXskJPlVaa	Forget about him and move on. He doesn't seem to be the right man for you. Relationships are mutual - this seems too one-sided. If you like him - continue to be friends, nothing more. Even his self esteem and trust level is Low - what else is positive about him? Gradually move away. Best of luck.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Dump him. He's not working at this relationship at all, just ignore him and go out with other people.|`|3652865bf75234629480db3292c40bc6aa	I have to ask why you would have a boy friend who treats you that way? Think it over. Drop him and hang out with other friends that treat you better.|`|KwNpyp3saa	You should just end it. A relationship is give and take. He should've made an effort to be with you. The fact that he didn't do this and gets upset with you because you didn't respond to his texts right away tells me he is controlling and he just wants to keep you under his thumb. Available only when he wants it.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	have you talk to him about coming to you sometimes?try talking to him about it. if those are the only reason try and make it work that's not enough reason to end a relationship|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	End it girl!  He's too insecure for you.  And if he can't do something as simple as come and see you, he's not good enough.|`|1r05fktRaa	i drive 2 and 1/2 hr to see my g/f before we ware dating from  ct to ms|`|vSJIorF7aa	Thats not a good excuse. We are here to answer marriage questions, not dating. Go to the dating section.|`|MVxFOI5naa	Please end it with this loser. Tell him you met someone who is willing to go the distance!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	He sounds like hard work, what are you actually enjoying in this relationship ?|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	End it, and heck if I were you, I'd just ignore him in every way because it just sounds like he's guilt tripping you to stay with him|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You are in this relationship alone. He is a needy control freak and has no consideration for you. I'm betting he is a mama's boy.  You need to make him come to you or just leave you alone... text him that and see if he calls you!    Either way, I think you should find more mature people to hang out with. This one is loser-ville!|`|Ub1IOPsraa	Kick his loser butt to the curb.  Then go to the Singles and Dating arena to find a new beau.|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	Find someone else. He is selfish and clearly isn't that into you. A man who loves you doesn't allow you to risk getting into serious trouble. A relationship is give and take. With him it's all take. Tell him that you need more than he has been giving you and you deserve better and it's over. Then say goodbye and mean it!|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You don't really have to do either. The next time he asks you to do something, ask him what time he'll pick you up? And, if he won't, tell him  "maybe next time then." If you do all the work, he will let you do all the work!|`|Y08YLysXaa	Sounds like a waste of time. My man flew 10,000 miles to be with me (and he is not perfect believe me) and yours can't even drive half an hour?! And he was okay with you risking being pulled over without a licence? It doesn't sound like you have much of a relationship.    Also the person below me said you're a booty call... they're probably right!!!|`|D4oVe5guaa	You are a booty-call delivery. If you don't like that designation, end it.|`|wk1RDK3raa	Girl, you know you need to end this- he is not on your level. He seems like a bum... Actions speak louder than words/text's..|`|AA10250709	Put simply, Stop giving in.  If he doesn't want to drive to see you then don't see him.  He'll get the point.  If he doesn't budge then I think you have to face that you just aren't a priority to him and walk away.|`|T9hKxmGPaa	End it and move on.  Simple as that.    There is no such thing as a one person relationship.  Before my boyfriend became my fiance, him and I both drove an hour and 30 minutes to see each other and spend time with one another. If he cannot even manage to get up off of his *** to drive to come see you, then he is not worth your time and emotions. Besides, you do not mention him having a job. That makes him look even worse. So we know that his busy job schedule is not preventing him from coming to see you. He sounds like a bum, especially if all he does is smoke and sleep..    Find someone who is willing to to be with you and want to be an active part of a relationship. You deserve better. He sounds like a complete and utter loser.|`|7e8NN8saaa	How bad does he want it? If you don't go to him - will he come to you?     Why are you doing this again?     A guy who doesn't work it and isn't trying - doesn't deserve it.
zGwJF5Ncaa	Girl you are not ugly or fat come on and i think your pretty and so do many people out there think ur beautyfull okai and ur not fat who said u were fat huh soo i can beat dem up lol look ur not fat and  u even have a botty girl wich alot of people love  now a days some even wish dey had nice blue eyes.. i liked da makeup looks like ur a uniquie person u like showing different side of urself i love da pink.. keep ur head up high and know dat ur are beautyfull soo now go look at urself and accept urself and sayy in da mirror i am beautifull..=]|`|mzkfSwLwaa	People online always talk smack ignore them your cute.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	different colour eye make up, and maybe a few highlights and you'd be drop dead gorgeous. you're not fat or ugly. ignore them, they're probably only lil kids anyway, no man worthwhile would say anything like that.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	you arent fat. or ugly. but that horrible eye makeup GOTTA go. and you would look 5x better if you got your eyebrows waxed.|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	you are NOT fat ugly disgusting or any of those things the guys are idiots as guys often tend to be forget them and love urself the way u were made girl...im pretty sure u'll be a queen in many many many real guys eyes.|`|cR3M6tepaa	OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Ur hot u shuldnt listen to them ur realy attractive.most girls wuld kill to look like u|`|HsCHz0kyaa	Trust me, I'm 100% sure they were just being jerks.  Your not fat, your just a little overweight, but not close to fat, trust me.  Your good size and look good too x]].  Dont let other people mess with you.|`|ymnlQsNIaa	You have a gorgeous face. There is no doubt about that. On top of that, I don't think you're fat at all.   They were just trying to mess with your head, honey, don't listen to them. There will always be people that are trying to bring you down. Don't let them get to you. You know you're pretty.    I want to f*cking yell at those *****|`|BvgMVNk5aa	I think that you are gorgeous, dont let some guys on a website who are probably fat slobs sitting on there couch eating twinkies ruin your self esteem.|`|4m9Hewq1aa	That's awful that someone would say that, and I am very sorry. You are beautiful, you have very pretty facial features and bone structure. Also, don't say that you know you're fat because you aren't, at all...Please, don't be so critical of yourself. I think it's a shame that there are immature people out there set on hurting others to make themselves feel better, but don't let them get to you. Keep your high self esteem, you are a beautiful person who I'm sure has a beautiful personality. Best of luck! -Alice|`|1ZgV0AbGaa	ignore them...there's nothing wrong with you, in fact I wish I had eyes the colour of yours ...guys usually tease girls when they fancy them...or they're probably jus being jerks as usual...one more thing, ppl usually insult others when they have low self-esteem themselves its makes them feel good about themselves in some weird and twisted way...forget them!!!|`|njbmOlJSaa	well you are a beautiful girl to me, but i can't really tell how your body looks from a side view..but it's looks like you are perfectly normal. Yo will be fine..i get talked about to, and i'm a beautiful person myself..people always talk about people whether they are perfect or ot..it just gives them something to do...so don't worry about it.;)|`|AA10858784	You're fine. They're just retards who are trying to pull your leg. Just play it cool.   They don't even have the right to call themselves guys after doing what they did. It may seem funny and all (to them), but no self-respecting guy says such stuff to a lady. So don't worry about it, you'll meet respectful guys sooner or later :)|`|5UjkkQgDaa	DONT CALL YOURSELF FAT!!!! haha im pretty close to your body type and im not fat :)  haha so no calling yourself fat... cause then your calling me that :D    and you are very pretty! those guys are ***** they can suck it :)|`|2vazHHXeaa	Odds are they just said that for attention.  When somebody insults someone else and uses a broad insult or a large number of insults, it's the same as "hey I want to make you feel bad".  Those four words are the first things that popped into their heads.    Oh, and they're wrong by the way.|`|SqGO6Qyeaa	stupid boys    be confident in yourself, i think you look fine, but you shouldn't care what i have to say about your body, or what anybody else says. you know you're normal sized, and have a very nice face shape.|`|0ClA7HlEaa	Your not fat or ugly. those guys are just being immature.   ignore them, they have no life. your makeup is a no-no...dont worry, you look fine ok :)|`|95c2929336859361a8f5aac01e713a06aa	Self-esteem cannot be taken. If it is suggested away, it never existed. If you can learn to judge yourself accurately and not be unhappy with yourself in any way, then you will have self esteem. There aren't really levels of confidence. People with 'moderate self esteem' are moderately successful liars.|`|zLsA6IAPaa	ok listen to me. there are ppl in the world who take joy at crushing other ppl because thats the only way they feel good about themselves. they're probably jealous that your so confident with your image that they had to break you. thats not fair. and its pure cowadly, dont let it get to you. i promise you are not fat and you are not ugly, i promiseeeeeeeeee. self esteem if a very fragile part of someone that shouldnt be messed with, and those who do are just dickheads. think of those guys as no one because you are a better person than them by far, dont even think of them as ppl if u dont know them because its not like they are gonna see you again. dont change who are because someone criticises you. thats their own problem and if they dont like you then they can shove it up their **** and be gone with it i say :D!!         YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIRL!|`|lpOKbiYSaa	you are not fat at all! :)  i think your really pretty.  screw those stupidd boyss.|`|79eBn6V8aa	You're silly...you're not fat or ugly|`|OAjj2NMuaa	they were probably jerks i know a lot of those how do they know they dont know who u are|`|c4BPvxz9aa	u r not ugly or fat or gross at all u have beautiful eyes and a nice butt :) keep ur head up high those guys have probably nevr even gotten a girl . some things that can help u feel better about ur self is a hair cut and some new clothes dont listen to them.|`|pTDwgXodaa	i like ur makeup:)    they are probably gay anyway:) gay guys are usually really hard on body image........    the picture of your body looks like your pooping though. Thats the only thing that not really attractive of the pictures lol    otherwise i think its great :D|`|zclADBmiaa	Proceed to An Hero. Do not pass go, do not collect $200|`|363YPQ62aa	Don't worry about them you look great|`|cDxPPOPmaa	The thing is, once guys find a target, they stick with it for a while. You're a real pretty girl, so why let them bother you?    Your eyes are super gorgeous!|`|Lii6IXEkaa	wtf!! i hate girls that think that they're fat when they're not.|`|M92bLBRjaa	Based on the photos given.    I would say that you are not fat. You look lovely yet, around your eyes are very red.    So, go wash your eyes and bathe in the knowledge that they were twits.|`|ofMV2sS5aa	Dude, you are not fat. Nor ugly. These guys are probably just obese pedophiles looking for someone to manipulate. Besides if you want to see fat: http://z.hubpages.com/u/45495_f520.jpg look at that.   Get your self esteem back up!   ~K8|`|wFgS5nlraa	ok, 1 its wrong to call any girl fat butt, self esteem, has to do with your SELF, dont worry about what they say, thay are just hatin cuase they are jealous. dont let any one call you fat because only you are aloud to judge yourself. and if some ons is trying to **** with you, just simply ask what they want from you and if they say "nothing" then tell them to **** off!|`|NOYOgHIEaa	they're just being freaks!!! dont worry ur not fat :)|`|98v2W0gGaa	you're not ugly just wipe off the makeup and take a flattering picture of yourself  you're not fat but if you really feel that way, go exercise|`|IzP50gNIaa	you are not as ugly as they are stupid in fact you are Beautiful from head to toe but they  are still stupid and you can't fix stupid right?|`|pCaXS80Iaa	Man, i'd tap that ***!|`|sqaRnidQaa	lmao why do you let other people drag you down.do you realy hate yourself so much that you need someone else to tell u wether your beutiful or not.stop seeking other peoples aproval. look at yourself.dont think about the stars on tv. look at YOURSELF.do you think your ugly?do you think your fat? you are what you belive you are but if you so despretley need somone elses aproval to live,    id say your ok. the pink eye stuff really steals away your natural beauty though.ur belly looks average. if i was you i woudnt diet just excersise. alittle|`|AA11595860	Dont ever let anybody rain on your parade baby.   Allowing anyone to make you feel insecure just lets them win.     Get rid of pests like this and surround yourself with people who make  you feel good. Anyone who says bad things about people are insecure themselves. Don't let anyone bully you. Your beautiful, tell them to take a hike.|`|rzHRFEvjaa	no, altho u do look really sad :'(    Ur not fat at all and u r pretty    also u have REALLY pretty eyes!!!|`|z0OEmIyBaa	You were @ $% the first time I saw your pics.  You're still  $%^ ugly the second time.  Jesus tap dancing Christ please an hero now! You are So god damn fat, how about you skip a few  $%^ing meals and chill out on all the God Damned jelly donuts, Miss Piggy.    tl;dr:  You're fat I'm bored, have a nice day.|`|4Gxurdtzaa	People who attack viciously like that tend to be really ugly themselves, whether its outside or inside.  You should always know your worth...no one is a perfect ten all the time but that is not a welcome mat for ugly comments from anyone...so, let it go and reframe your thinking.    Try to let it roll off your back...sit down and list what you like about yourself, compliments family and loved ones always throw your way...take the focus off this negativity.    Its amazing how easy it is to ruin beautiful things with ugly words and behavior...this person is not worth another second of thought.|`|VKlIjfIXaa	You don't have self esteem, what you have is a large ego. The difference is self-esteem is based on a understanding and love for yourself. An ego is a superficial mask that is built on fear of rejection and is easily shaken. You need to work on your confidence.    Even if you were fat you should still have self esteem|`|CpYpTWqGaa	Oooh, thick :p. Gay guys say stupid things like that...|`|szRtzdIGaa	IN the facial portrait, you seem to be sad.  In the body picture, I see a nice female shape.     Don't let what other people say to you make you think less of yourself.  Let alone what someone says about you.      You are not fat.  You are not ugly.    Stay away from people that do stuff like you say they did.  They only do it to see if they can hurt you.  In doing so they someway enhance their pitiful obscure existance.    YOU GO GIRL !!!|`|ubj2hZWZaa	Those guys were trying to get into your head.    But on the serious tip I do not see a fat girl in any of those pictures.  I see a sweet, cuddly, warm, and friendly woman.|`|a3ed5d45bcfeadcd80b73e66de664f71aa	You are not fat or ugly.  But you should change up the way you do your makeup :)|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	You have got to be kidding me!  You let three guys say stupid stuff like that to you?  LOOK AT YOU!  You are NOT fat!!  You are NOT Ugly!!    Leave those boys behind!  Instead why not concentrate on your education, getting into a great college, finding a enjoyable career, and in becoming a self-confident, independent, productive, and intelligent young woman?  That's how you will shine in life, hon.  Trust me on that.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Your not fat or ugly! You just don't have good eye makeup! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|Xpj8Mn2laa	Your not fat or ugly! Those people are just being nasty. Don't let them know it bothers you - if anything laugh at them for being so pathetic.     Maybe loose the eye make up though!|`|CYKAGJMyaa	basically they were just being @$$holes. I would disagree completely|`|fSQfmCUbaa	shut up|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	WTF? Your not fat. If anything your thick, and thats a great thing. Get back on that white horse, and forget people who say mean things, because they cant find anything better to do.|`|qcB23QvZaa	you look really naturally pretty, which is good. If you had a high self esteem, it means you diidn't see yourself as this horrible ugly nasty person, so you shouldn't let them get to you..    Tip: get rid of that makeup. Did you photoshop that on? anyway it's realllly distracting      and no i don't think your fat at all|`|9eMYzY0Paa	Don't worry about them, they will NEVER amount to anything.
DbQKHNYsaa	Well sounds like she is doing you more harm then good! I would cut her out of your life! You don't need a friend like that! Trust me! Ive been through the same thing. It's a difficult decision, but you want friends that you can trust, and this girl doesn't sound like a good friend!  Hoped this helped!|`|4JGTC2MHaa	A person can only take so much advice, no matter how good it is. She needs to make some mistakes and learn some lessons herself. She might not need you now, so the question will be are you willing to help her if she comes running back to you?   Maybe if you cut her out for now, things will be better for both of you. Just be ready if she comes running back; it's likely to happen with people like that.|`|K4DBU7cuaa	well i am only 12 k. But i will try. Your friend is probably caught up in the boyfriend that she does not know what is going on. But probably in a few he will dump her. I hope that does not happen to your friend.  But she will ask you for advise. So i saw stick around for a while see what goes on. Keep in min that i am only 12 years old so...
1V3mDqeuaa	Well if you know it's her then call her is the best advice. This is of course going to sound korny but if you like her age doesn't matter soon she should be 18 any who right? So go for her just make sure you do NOT have sex with her or you can get sued! And try to get out of the disorder try going to the gym and work off your anger/depression anything and i am sure you will feel a lot better! Keep a smile on but only because you are happy. A guy with confidence is hott! Really take this advice because you can ask any girl a guy with confidence is great but dont be over confident. And when you talk to her ask her how she is and try to have a heart to heart conversation with her. When i guy does that to me i start liking them immediately because it makes it seem you like her. Treat her right tho!|`|FyI9qlxBaa	call her and leave her a message. tell her that you have forgotten the past and want to look only at the future. if she avoids you, dont take it offensively. it may not be for the reason that you think. and dont avoid her. she may realize that she still loves you. dont let her mood swings affect you. lets not forget that you "broke her heart" first. and she is always going to be cautious around you. she was only defending herself when she told you not to speak to her again.  good luck,  sydney|`|dWwIEqEwaa	you shouldn't have reacted the way you did when you went to college. But I agree with you she is too young for you and I think you did the right thing not going out with her. Talk to her about how you feel and apoligize for breaking her heart. and DONT ignore her. thats not a good thing to do .|`|3QNPMVd5aa	wow it sounds like you are in love with ehr. and this sounds like a creepy relationship! you should just forget about her, she is in like 8th grade dude, get over her. !
h9lPQCOVaa	You might try and contact The Locater. I think he has his on T.V. show about people who are adopted or people who gave up their babies and he tracks them down. I seen it a few times and he really is a miracle worker by the looks of it.|`|9a29ff9d83b4bd07e03cf4ccfb727231aa	y dont u ask the people who took u in to give u the information on ur mom if they have it or the place where they got u and u should be able to find out....just go to the place and tell them u were adopted by a family there and u want to find out info about ur real parents. they should be able to give it to u..  good luck =]
FdfE8iMEaa	Do you mean sex with somebody other than your spouse or had sex with somebody you weren't married to?    I have never been married and I have had sex.  I honestly wouldn't marry a man I had never had sex with.  If he isn't any good then you are stuck with him!!  lol.  I would not, EVER, cheat on my spouse.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	yes and regret it every day of my life. it was the beginning of the end.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Nope.|`|KwkEvmpPaa	no sorry im faithful|`|AA11467629	Never! A vow before god and man isn't something to mess with.|`|Umsj08pnaa	Do you mean premarital sex or cheating on your spouse?    For premarital sex, no but I will. I don't support marriage at all so I may never get married. If I do, oh well.    For cheating on a spouse, obviously no since I've never been married.
4jx4wAhgaa	I think you should first of all tell your friend that knowing a guy for three weeks is not love! And like she's 13?? Anyway, if you want to deal with this matter, I guess you should tell your friend that if she wanna hang out with you, try not to talk about the issue between her and her guy, because that will only disgust you more.   OR  you can break up your friendship! Because sometimes even by looking at her, you can recall what she say and stuff. But the decision is yours! See which one you are comfortable with! =D|`|puUStDPpaa	its her's to deal with  it has nothing to do with you  if shes happy about it and thinks she is ready let her be.   really.|`|bxfInqBPaa	Well, pretty much you'll try and talk her out of it, she won't listen and might get mad at you.    Later on, she'll figure out she got used, and will cry and cry. Then you can eat a tub of ice cream together or something.|`|C3tVKFWuaa	WOW. I am 13, and i am not Dumb enough to loose my Virginity to a 16 year old who jsut wants to get into my pants. Just tell her how you feel, and tell her the truth. he doesn not love her,. He just wants her body, and he took her Virginty, all he can take from her now is her Pride. Hurry before it's too late.......|`|CIKr28xoaa	ekk!!! just imagining me losing my virginty creeps me...  well you can control time and she already lost it..  so you just have to get use to it...  and btw she hasn't changed or anything she just lost it.|`|ugqaDJSRaa	I can understand how you feel.  All you need to do is drill in her head how important it is to use protection. don't tell her parents because then she will hate you and never tell you anything again.    be there for her, because when the break up she will reagret it. people make stupid choices soemtimes. I know it makes u sick cause my bff did the same thing but they coem around in the end!|`|739d0573262dcbbe7e80cf6b3b90ad03aa	slap the heifer upside the head and tell her to stop being such a stoopid|`|RjF7TmvTaa	tell her to use protection or tell her parents nothing else you can do sorry|`|BifE4q7Baa	Is there a good school counselor you can talk to?  If your friend is having sex, someone needs to talk to her about safe sex and pregnancy asap|`|Ml3W4zagaa	its a personal choice. i understand your concern for your friend, its a natural caring instinct. tell her to be sure to use protection, thats honestly the most important thing. in the end, its her's to deal with.
EroXBvDNaa	if you change lawyers they will have to file with the court letting them know you changed, does not take long.   If you are not happy with your lawyer get one you are happy with  at that price he shouldn't be making errors
vHwYENVjaa	There really aren't any true cons.    The pros are:    1. you actually get to learn what the person is like on a day-to day, hour to hour basis, instead of just on their good days.    2. you find out if you can actually LIVE with them.    3. You learn how they deal with things financially, emotionally, in a crisis, how clean they really are, and so on.        The only con is.... You might find out you really don't like each other at all.|`|8MiSxYyeaa	The pros and cons are hand and hand in this matter.  You get to get a preview of what married life will be like before you actually take the plunge.  The best way to know someone is to live with them.  Remember the things that get on your nerves will only get worse once you get married.  The pro is that you get to find out if this is really the person for you or if she is bat sh*t crazy. and the cons to this are also that you get to find out what it is like to be married to this person and if they are indeed for you or bat sh*t crazy lol... best of luck|`|eMkTZlnRaa	You know that saying "why buy the milk when you can have the cow." That is what living together before you get married is like. For a guy it's a big time pro, because like the last guy mentioned, you get to live with her and get to know what she's really like, you get to decide if you want to spend the rest of your life with her, or if she is really crazy. The girl get's the con end of it, because she is taking a chance that you will never want to marry her, because you're already living together, so what more do you want????? Speaking as an expert in this field, I have lived with my boyfriend for the last 4 years, and we are no closer to getting married than we are to having children. For me, it is a pro, but most women don't think like me, and I'm pretty sure your gf is not going to want to stay living for four years, with out a ring on that finger. Hope this helped.|`|732f023485f98c8f1c786d529f3970e9aa	well i think too many ppl try and do the whole 'trial' marriage thing by living together, and after a couple years realize they can live together and then get married and then get divorced after a few years, people get married now when they get too comfortable in relationship, nothing really that new when u get married esp when u've already cohabited together and spent a few years together already. by the time couple gets married the 'sparks' die out and people wonder why marriage don't last long.  people want/expect things to be perfect in a marriage and if things get tough they walk out easily and don't want to put much effort in nowadays,   i don't see many pros about living together to be honest maybe i'm the more traditional type|`|EsnFmcMFaa	there are no pros
f4wDSdyPaa	well if she was a true BFF then she would sit down and listen to what you have to say. even if you did no wrong she should have picked you over her boyfriend because boys will come and go but friends will always be there. then again she probably dont know what to think because this could be here first time in this position so you would expect her to jump to conclusions if she really like this boy. when the boy is gone she will realize what she did and will hopefully apologize and next time she will learn from her mistake and never put a boy before yalls friendship so just give her some time to come to her senses      hope i help|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think she has to grow up..and trust her bf if he hasnt given her  a reason to doubt him..  as far as your fighting over something that hasnt happened its senseless.. good luck|`|C3tVKFWuaa	Just ingore her, and tell her taht you guys need a break , and then talk to her after maybe lets say a week. Try to talk things thorugh and see where it leads. Maybe ignore her back.
QpDvSo9vaa	In my experience, I think that guys are just as scared to admit to a crush as girls are. I have heard a lot of my friends say they like it when the girl makes the first move. Let him know you like him. Or at least give him hints(most guys are clueless).|`|AA11599430	just ask him
jQkRf7SLaa	i think if it is ment to be it will happen but u cant wait for it to happen, u got to do something. i can tell she loves u. go down there and tell her how u feel. dont stop trying. move down there with her. if she says no then when you r both 32 and neither of u are married then remind her of that promise. trust me and go for her right now.|`|tQnE8PPTaa	Honestly, You need to get over her. I don't think she's conferable dating you right now. Give her sometime and maybe she'll come back to you. The whole "If I'm not married by 32 then I'll marry you." is stupid. She's pretty much planning for something that might not even happen. I think she just broke you heart :\     If you reaaaallllly want to get back with her, I think it'd be really sweet if you went to her house and sang this to her...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNyhN0KAR...
rJMZdp04aa	Sucks to be Him then.    I love me a Screamer.    Means as Men , We're doing Our Jobs.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	If you live in an apartment or have kids I'd sympathize with him.    If you're alone, if you're literally screaming, or just have some kind of incredibly super whiny and nasally voice, it would still probably turn me off. ... not to the point that I'd stop, though.    Compromise?  Try screaming into a pillow, his chest, his hand, or a ball gag if you like kink.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	WTF???  Most men would see that as a verbal acknowledgement of their prowess. Your husband is a freak.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	put duct tape over your mouth|`|encb0jc2aa	he is a dumb-***, ask him if its ok if you do it with someone who can handle a good woman|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Maybe you have a really unsexy orgasmic voice that turns him off.Idk what man wouldn't want to have sex over a bit of loud moaning unless you are really screaming bloody murder.I know a girl who thought screaming was sexy and every man she was with said how unsexy it was because it seemed forced.Apparently it was really annoying.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	liar|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I think most guys love screamers. Unless he's scared people might hear it.|`|iwpwC93maa	He may be concerned about people hearing, which can in turn affect his enjoyment of the occasion right? Maybe it's just not his preference, is he around noizy people all day at work?    Look at the bright side, at least you can have orgasms during sex, apparently many women don't. Try not making any noise, that will probably make your orgams more intense   :)|`|EzZk2pyNaa	I would think he would be happy.|`|YmLcF2rSaa	Ask him why it is that you cant be who you are? I read a loy of answers and the survey said...AHEEESSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH...|`|rLP9wjPtaa	I like it loud!|`|yM7YPmzSaa	You too are no longer having loud sex anymore?

I just wish my husband was considerate enough to take the time to give me an orgasm.    Try biting a pillow or something.|`|7e8NN8saaa	tell him he must be doing something right.     Don't apologize for being who you are. If he doesn't want to have sex with you - what are the odds this marriage will last?|`|DlBeFoKcaa	can I hook up with you???

It's natural to scream, don't hold back.|`|kTLIj0rmaa	Its not wrong its just his preference. Sounds like you are not very compatible in the bedroom. I hope you can work this out, hes a fool|`|Ub1IOPsraa	Keep screaming, baby!  I would rather know you're alive under me rather than be the mummy and be afraid to let your emotions fly!  My wife isn't a screamer.  However, I know I'm not there alone, either!|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Well if it's a turn off for him. I don't know if it's wrong or right to have a turn-off. I hated it when my ex was licking my toes... Nothing harmful, but I just hated it.|`|0PHRkiomaa	That's weird. If I don't scream my man is upset!|`|RQrFOF14aa	He is an idiot. I love it.|`|onbwN4csaa	I love to hear may wife's  pleasure.|`|NT08sMBpaa	Yes it is wrong. Very wrong.

I wouldn't mind if you shattered the windows and it would be great to try.|`|PdmSmTYdaa	The question is are you screaming in tune?|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Dang! He's actually doing his job right and he's got a problem with your way of praising him. I had to cut mine back because of my kids and it really hard.|`|Fj5Odsj4aa	OMG i dont understand that at all. my boyfriend lovvves that i scream. it turns him on even more....    but try to make it more of a moan/screamish than just as scream. maybe hes freaked out by the way you scream cause he might think hes hurting you|`|F1TFSVRBaa	I dont know what his prob is considering he helped to get you off...?!  He should be grateful, would he rather a silent orgasm where he has no indication that you have enjoyed yourself thoroughly...??|`|Osfneozgaa	Gag ... kinky... ;)|`|GPHkzRn4aa	you full of ****
bO2rzfISaa	I wouldn't normally care at all, but one guy violated me who CONSTANTLY insulted everyone. I emailed him that it was on and I violated him out of a few accounts (because he continued to insult). I did call him pathetic. I might be myself, not sure. : )|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Usually, I am mad. I have probably stated an opinion, and how is THAT a violation, especially if they WANT opinions?    Frickin' teenies...|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Annoyed.  I received one once and appealed it, asking what term I violated.  They wrote back "You violated the terms of service" blah blah blah.  So I wrote back asking to state exactly which term of service I violated.  I never heard back.  That p****d me right off.    LOL @ rmf!!  I love our Aussie sayings!|`|EFlX4GYOaa	WHen it is from a report from teh yahoo community, ANGRY    When it is from the yahoo admin..proud|`|3iNobwVraa	Amused.|`|MVxFOI5naa	I really don't care but sometimes wonder why people do that unless it was something really offensive|`|Ub1IOPsraa	I think of it as Monopoly.  You play your cards right, you get ahead.  You don't follow the rules, and you get penalized.  That's the life of it.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I don't care.|`|0PHRkiomaa	Just shocked..... especially when it's for saying "Crikey". I guess they don't get aussie slang.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Some i have re-read like 8 times and still cant figure it out. Others I just are amused that people can be so prudish or upset when u respond with the truth about their sitaution or how they are acting. Why do they bother putting stuff on here if they dont want all possible answers. I especially hate being violated when i respond to a racial/sexist/homophobic rant by some nutter! Go figure - now i just ignore them!    I'm with rmf on the aussie slang stuff. Ive been violated for the same type of stuff. Maybe us aussies are a little less precious!|`|sLLgERQWaa	Don't care....no big whoop as my kids say.|`|onbwN4csaa	I think that they have gumbee  On the violation button.    Half of what they  call a violation.  Is in no way offensive  to others. I don't know why. Except this one maybe.    This message may get the button.  Let's just see.|`|dFMSACxhaa	Violation of what?|`|ZtfN4J6taa	I really don't care. My last one was because I answered asking the person why the question was in marriage and divorce. Clearly the question had nothing to do with this category. I feel like I'm in China when one of my questions/responses  get censored.|`|Y08YLysXaa	Extremely sad, then angry, then tired and apathetic. You're talking about violation in marriage right? lol... or are you taking about this site?|`|kTLIj0rmaa	I tell it like it is and if I get a violation notice well its because they couldnt take a little constructive critism and have low self esteem|`|1qPH52x6aa	sorry need more info on what type a violation if asexual or abused sad and angry with help peaceful within so hope this helps some|`|p6QizgmRaa	Couldn't care less.

Cdkd4oQ7aa	Tell her it's inappropriate behavior, she needs to see a doctor. Everyone has to see a gynecologist when they start having sex, and that includes her even though she's only 13. Therefore, tell her, she has to talk to her parents. Then you should tell yours. You might not want to, especially because you might think you're going to get in trouble, or she's going to get in trouble, or hate you forever, or whatever. But that is seriously bad behavior, and better safe than sorry. It's better for her to be mad at you now and thanking you later for saving her from something horrible happening.|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	scare them tell them about STD 's of pregnancy|`|CIKr28xoaa	once shes started.. nothing really can stop it...    if it really gets out of hand.. tell an adult|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Tell her that she should be ashamed of herself.|`|e81B9pDKaa	Wow that's young talk to her and tell her it's dangerous.

Ub1IOPsraa	If you drive, don't drink: if you drink, don't drive!|`|MVxFOI5naa	If you are both alcoholics neither of you should be drinking ever-but drinking and driving is VERY bad. almost lost a child to a drunk driver (he was the passenger and drunk also)fractured his skull and had to wear a helmet for a year until his brain stopped swelling.  Please don't ever drink and drive|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	You are not wrong to be angry.    But at the same time, I can say I worked for a couple of bosses who were not happy unless they could get all their employees into a drinking contest.  When I started work there - I didn't drink (had seen too many things when I was a kid and my parents ran a bar).  When I left there - I could out drink any of them.  Not a good claim but true.    One reason I left was to get to someplace sober.    At your age, drinking is a (?) common occurrence.    When I got married, I also got 2 teenagers.  No matter what I said about drinking & driving, they still did it.  And continued to do it until they finally matured.  At what age?  But now 38 and 40, neither one will drink and drive.  But they were lucky to not hurt anyone when they were younger.    If you approached the boss and said your husband has a drinking problem, that would hurt your husband at work.    And - from my experiences with my bosses when I refused to join the drinking parties - promotions were withheld from me.    So, by process of elimination that either leaves finding another job (would your husband leave, can he find another job?) or you going with him to these parties and you being the designated driver.  A trick I used to pull when we went to bars, is I would get the waitress to bring me a ice tea instead of bourbon & coke and not tell the  others.  In return, she would get an extra tip from me.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Usually people who drink too much and drive put their hands up and say nothing will happen to them and they feel perfectly fine being behind the wheel. All is fine until one day one mistake and it could be disastrous. DUIs are a problem and in my state they are slowly trying to make it more difficult in just getting off with a fine. Prison time is working its way down to third offense. So you are wiser for being angry and more responsible knowing the consequences and having that tragedy in you life to remind you so painfully. I give the credit to where its due and it's clearly not him for his dangerous behavior and so serious of a risk to take in this busy world......|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	All drunk driving accidents are from people who think they are okay to drive. He's just showing all the signs!|`|Y08YLysXaa	Yes, I'd go off!     That's such an important commitment to eachother, and he's basically crapping on it by drinking and driving. We all have slip ups but he really needs to rectify this with you.|`|NctuEmFKaa	No, it's stupid to drink and drive!  No ifs, ands, or buts about it. He should have enough respect for you to realize you would not be kosher with it anyways.|`|AA12104815	love of your life?  Shouldn't your present hubby have that title?  Anyway.. yea he could of killed someone !!|`|AA12255146	Of course you are not wrong to be livid! I would be too! What he did is break the law, and next time, it won't be YOU scolding him, it will be a cop with an attitude, then a judge, and a BIG FAT FINE.     I went to AA when I was younger,and both my hubby and I are recovering alcoholics. He completely quit 7 years ago. me on the other hand, relapse on occasion, but I make a serious effort to quit. I do not drink and drive. we have a 0 tolerance here, on drinking, so, I just don't risk it. If you cannot reason with him, get a family friend who can. good luck!|`|1qPH52x6aa	u know it  was wrong u have should be mad but now what ya gonna do to get your point and tolerate this  since u both as u say young and got a problem with alcohl sounds like to me if you want to stay married instead of u agreeing to drink get into a program aa and agree not to at all good luck|`|AA11814087	Yes, of course you have the right and a reason to be upset. I know you are mad, but alcohol is a problem for him, and he was in a situation that he let get out of control. Try to be understanding and talk to him about it. I'm sure he feels bad. Good luck.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Both of you need to go to AA meetings and learn from that from others who are in the same boat. Of course he thought he was fine, drunks have no common sense or sense of reality they are in denial.|`|7foornMVaa	No, you are not wrong to be angry.  Show him some pictures of an aftermath of  drunk driving accidents.  Bet he wont look, they never do.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Very Wrong|`|HunSyQaSaa	No way are you wrong. Have you  or he been to AA?Does he have a sponsor ? Stick to your guns.I'm  sure he knows the consequences of D&D.Good luck.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	it is never a clear cut "right" or "wrong" when you are talking about how you feel. its just a matter of whether the other person thinks the same way.     even buzzed driving is drunk driving. that tiny bit of compromised hand eye coordination could be the difference between life and death. and you never know what sort of situations are going to occur on the way home (will the lights all be red? will there be a detour?, etc) so its never safe to take that risk.     i would sit down my husband and explain that, maybe look up some facts, i dont really know. but i would def let him know that im not okay with it and that i wouldnt ever want it to happen again. its a selfish thing to do..|`|faT4MyVkaa	He sounds like the typical kid that doesn't think that bad things can happen to him. I don't know what to say. Kids are kids until life spanks them.|`|gfHutvEFaa	he was very wrong. if you and he are alcoholic's  you can't drink, period.|`|vSJIorF7aa	You are not wrong to be angry, but you both really should seek counseling. Alcoholism is an addiction and one that usually comes back. He obviously is still having problems with it, if he is drinking and driving. Maybe you both should abstain from alcohol completely. As in, no more drinks at all. Attend AA meetings for support or surround yourself with positive parties without alcohol. You both need to work on this now before it becomes a bigger problem than it already is and begins to cause marital problems.   best of luck|`|U88H6YlEaa	Livid is a realistic response to drink driving.   Yes, you are very young to be married and not old enough to know that all that soul mate stuff is rubbish!  If alcohol causes drama, stay away from it.  If you make an agreement with your spouse, honor it!|`|XmudUg2aaa	You are not wrong to be upset. He needs a reality check and a wake up call. It's attitudes like that that get innocent people killed by drunk drivers....who almost always manage to survive.    It will be hard and pointless to talk to him while he is still under the influence.     I would gather some information ....perhaps a good video where the family survivors and the drunk drivers talk about their own experiences, and watch it with him.
2bc2032db82e5489fa9c176d5b1930b7aa	you have your reasons just to be sure to get the rite one start to talk to both of them and see there personalitys not just there looks one might not be what u expected them to be|`|XzkvqTyxaa	why do i care anyway this is not my problem just kidding all you have to do is ignore the fact that you like them it might help not that i would know.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well it is different with every guy it may be looks and it may be the heart that they have that attracts them. you never know your emotions and feelings are complicated. but all you know is that you like them it doesn't mean that just because they had sex or maybe had sex you can't be friends with them. you know friends do lie and rumors do spread around about people. so don't always believe what you hear around the school.|`|AA11519473	sex, bro, sex.|`|AEgkcLEjaa	because your aroused by them being un-virgins|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	BRO!!

tmfhieP7aa	does he know you have a boyfriend. Maybe you should tell him that first and maybe he should meet the guy. then spend time with your boyfriend at your house when your dad is home so that he can see that he is a great guy and can trust him with you. and then you ask if you can go on a date. you might be able to get away with it sooner, but i dont like to push things. the more details you give like what movie (if you see a movie), what restaurant, what time, what time you will be home; then the more he will trust you. i lied a lot to my parents and i got in so much trouble when they found out i wasnt spending a night at my "freinds house". i got grounded for 2 weeks, couldnt go out for halloween and couldnt go on vacation with my boyfriend and his family.     do what you want|`|ghItgMZxaa	well for the first thing don't lie.  respect for others is a very good thing.  and as for your dad not wanting you to go out alone...  well your his little girl and he just wants you to be safe!!!!|`|24b0qkPbaa	i done that so many times and it took me forever before i got caught. and i really wasn't in that much trouble. just do whatever feels right.    your a kid, kids mess up. every parent knows that|`|Uz3f1fO5aa	well of course you should lie haha  your dad is only trying to look out for you, but parents can be so oblivious to situations.|`|uKYPmVG0aa	ok..if u like him enough to lie to ur parents then do it. but if u don't think he's worth it then don't. i say go for it do it once and see what feels right.

I'd continue to go on as I had before and let him deal with his own insecurities.|`|3iNobwVraa	I'd say, "of course you don't" *rolls eyes*  Then I'd probably do it, if I wanted to, anyway.

Males don't reach full emotional, hormonal, and physical maturity until that age.  And yes, your tally whacker can still get longer, but only if you are sleeping a minimum of 9 hours a night.    If you are under 24, than you are also dealing with females who have not yet reached full maturity, so you opinion is affected by both your lack of maturity, and theirs.    If you're a teenager, than there may be some concern as 20% of sexual active girls between the age of 12 and 19 are trying to get pregnant.

I'd love to do with you.|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	All Asian guys or any guy of any race will not be the same. Your saying that like it is some stereotype, which I find pathetic. I am sure there are some Asian guys who like "rough" and some who like it "gentle" all people are different, just because someone is of certain race dosen't mean they ALL like this or that!!!|`|xtcSsPPwaa	mine is like samarui sword|`|nLScNIekaa	no asians have the smallest peckers out or everyone|`|zB5EftV8aa	I have pictures, email me if you are curious cantseemekidd@gmail.com =)|`|MzzEQd1Faa	NOPE, us asian guys only like women who look like girls so we can tickle them|`|Wo6K4vPraa	Babe let me say i got the asian persuasion i can give you more than you want email me   =p|`|3ae17f1385adb17520ba8656392cdad8aa	brucelee and buddha both r from asia|`|cR3M6tepaa	im a 8inch asian guy|`|ROeq8hkWaa	I'm a half Asian, and I say yes.  We last longer than caucasians|`|5GszWfAoaa	well, it depends on the guy, people to people vary offcorse. but its always best to discuss your needs with him. it doesnt have to be awkward or any thing. more than half the times, a guy is worried about his performance, and that can improve and change a lot on how you react, how u approach him. if you act soft with him, u cant expect him to treat you much diffrently. and as far as asians are concerned, lol, they have countries with the biggest population dont they :-P|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	That's stereotyping - pretty sad...|`|3ztjaDBaaa	We know kung fu, what do you think?|`|E6In8bW1aa	I am Asian. I am not pretty. I am not delicate. My penis is big. I can do "rough".|`|eefc786d1aa3ac2e3759499bdd83cf9baa	We can do 'rough'/|`|COmp4sIuaa	LMFAO x 100000000000000000000    I'm sorry, I found this to be hilarious    Thank god I'm Irish, hahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahaha|`|VjmTK6uZaa	I'm asian and I satisfy my girlfriend to the fullest extent.  People say that were small down their, and for some of us its true.  But in every race their are some people that aren't privileged.  Honestly I'm not, but im not tiny.  To you'r question, I'm sure that a asian guy can do this.  Any guy really can if they want to.  You just gotta tell them thats how you like it.|`|tCoSuDYdaa	Of course they can, but there a little small down there if you know what I mean.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Yes.    Trust me.    They can.    I'm Chinese.    How the hell do you think there a billion of us?    Look at it that way.    Just my 2 cents.|`|IJgif2Czaa	well, if you're white you probably have a black hole cooch.  and if you're black it's probably a bigger black hole.|`|1842c18e2b8f922c49d387bfc336ea46aa	yes.

Everyone is an individual. A person's ethnicity has nothing to do with his or her sexual prowess.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	what kind of Asian you mean? There are at least 3 or 4 different types of Asians....chinese looking, arab looking, Indian looking and Malay/Polynesian looking.|`|1RQOisKkaa	The only thing i know about Asian guys is dat they don't got facial hair. they look young. ok not just asains but they known for it|`|CAOisulkaa	grain of rice between my legs can do many great things to u american woman.
AA11967247	maybe in the computer or recipe category, but not on the matter of relationships. besides, most of these people range from 12 yrs to 20, their experiences just arent pertinent to my life.|`|encb0jc2aa	i never asked a question in this section to my recollection's|`|lq8YBCwzaa	It depends on how serious my question is, once I asked a question about my guacamole that I was eating, and I took the advice, but if it has to do with my relationship, probably not. But I love to hear all of the different answers.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Yes and yes.|`|AA10408380	I learned a lot from here. Yeah, I've taken some advice from here and it did help me. Sometimes I just wish I found it sooner.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	I don't ask many questions .    I'm a know it all !|`|bYoKSMNKaa	NEver asked in M&D but have asked in parenting and used suggestions and it worked.|`|R15lnDZaaa	No way lol|`|1qPH52x6aa	yes it was in pets and it helped a bunch and mug u cracked me up u r so right have good nite
at1Vev9Gaa	My fiance and I used to do the same thing but we are both trying to change as well. We fight and yell then kiss and make up. If you want to stay together just keep an open communication line and stay truthful with everything. If you say that the both of you are going to change then do it! I am sure you will see good results =)|`|NOYOgHIEaa	idk... id just try to talk it out. Tell him how u feel and how ridiculous and stupid it is that u have to go through that every day|`|a3gFZur0aa	lol. i am the exact same way with my girlfriend but the way i look at is that is because wat we have is real we are 2 real different (even thoe we have alot in common) people. we have our own opinions on all types of stuff and we both dont like to back down. but all that fighting is a sign what you guys hav is real not a fairytale relationship (those dont exist and if u find one it sure as hell dont last trust me). if u can fight then laff bout it and kiss and make up and fight again and still not break up then you guys are very good 2gethor mayb even in love|`|Dao59jyDaa	sex does not create relationships. if u have nothing in common then u are not meant for each other. u can see him less often and that will change your mood, u will miss him more and so will he!!!|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	try to get sober then you'll be more stable|`|slHUNl58aa	try to stop saying wtf before you start a sentence. try not calling names at all. That is the first place to start.. your mouth, you can't control his but you can control your own, hopefully he will notice and try to stop talking like that too you as well.|`|fSQfmCUbaa	spend less time together no need to break up and if you feel an argumetn about to break out be the bigger person and just change the subject|`|92yiQo7uaa	oh, the drama queen wants to be the center of attention. Ignore her everybody.|`|CvwcRoYRaa	Andrea, i think both of u must have a will to change. If not your relation will not working at all. So try to ask professional advise or read a book how to making up your relation. You will learn a lot and knew which act should be taken.|`|uRHVCvNPaa	Did you ever think that maybe its not meant to be? Sometimes you just need to take a step back and look inside. If its worth it you both need to work at it, if its not make a break and time will tell you if you should stay apart or try again.|`|ac0rRBHCaa	chill out|`|lcc7SZAdaa	you should probably let him know that if   he really loved you he wouldn't be fighting with you.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well my boyfriend and I went through a rough time like that just let it pass it will. you two will get over it and through it if it was meant to be it's just a phase that couples go through.|`|Rc5wpzSiaa	i beeen with my bf for 3 1/2 yrs n i know what your talking about. go out on a date like jsut u n him make things better.|`|ifVqaPsxaa	just try calmly talking to him and tell him whats wrong. if he reacts by arguing then hes not the right guy for you but he shouldnt react if hes cool with everything|`|KfafY2YQaa	what you need to do is to take a 30day challenge where you don't say anything negative to each other. just for 30 days. it will get very hard, but if your relationship is going bad and you don't wanna end it, you have to do it. after the 30 days, i almost guarantee that your relationship with each other will be much stronger. give it a try. good luck|`|BeXHzsSwaa	wow my story is so similar if not exactly the same as yours. all im going to say is sit down with him and tell him what bugs you about him. then tell him to tell you what bugs him about you. this conversation should last at least 45min to a good hour. if not then the conversation was no good bcuz both of you or one of you did not take it seriously enough. i personally havnt done this with my bf yet... but im going to tmw!!! good communication is key to a healthy relationship!!|`|UThG15FLaa	Considering the fact you both need to change, you both need to sit down and have a talk. A face to face conversation with eachother, basically explaining your feelings to one another will do wonders for you ;]     My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and a bit now, we fight. We use to fight almost constantly, but we both knew it needed to change. We both chose the advice i just explained to you.    BUT! we still fight, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship, fighting while being in a relationship is healthy believe it or not.    So try my advice, it worked for me hun.  ? DEEEE|`|xtcSsPPwaa	i have no advice. u will get used to this anyways.. or you could BREAK UP!!|`|u3xzrJszaa	speak to a.. idk how to put it... person, a specific job I know there is, that you can talk to. A phyciatrist maybe.|`|en9uWbO6aa	ITS NOT WORKING.. LEAVE HIM YOUR ONLY WITH HIM FOR HIS DONG ANYWAY.. GO FIND ANOTHER GUY
fv0U7ft1aa	definitely you just have to be honest. It's hard to get over feelings for someone if you love them, but you shouldn't be put in the position of getting back together with him if you don't feel the same way. Have a honest talk with him and see how it goes from there.|`|wFWytGlxaa	You get him to stop by cutting off all communication.    Life can be tough, and sure it may be a "cold" move -- but hey, it happens to the best of us?    Do it.    Your life will be much better in the long run.    Good Luck
cDpu1Dxyaa	sometimes when girls act like that, it's just their personality. They may be naturally flirty people, not especilly intending to send signals to you.  If she's going out with somebody else, then it's pretty clear she's not interested in you in that way, or at least not yet (especially since you've only hung out with her for three days). Be friends with her.|`|TRPqdDTLaa	It seems like she likes you and goes out with someone else to make you jelous|`|LVcgfszBaa	Its best to let her be if she is talking to someone else. you wouldn't like for some guy to be crushing on your gf..would you?|`|71LeWL4waa	tell me more about the note and when she sat on you lap thats called lap dance she like you ....|`|g59U5kwUaa	no offense but if you just started dating a gurl and then liking another one then you cant like the gurl your currently dating very much ;-d|`|8Rpz9PEUaa	She's probably a tease who's trying to lead you on... :\  I'd stay away from her if I were you.|`|IRRO0vOnaa	it could be she is just trying to make u jealous or she just want to be friends just ask her|`|Bh82isDSaa	Give it a little more time. It appears you have only been involved for a few days so continue with your fun. Eventually you will find out how her other attraction is working out.  Keep being a friend and she'll find out if you are more fun than the other person. You may have a sense of humor and he is dull and boring. If she is not a big flirt, then you may have yourself a partner you could really get used to since you both have fun personalities.  Good luck.
nETF5rmJaa	i am 14 almost 15 in a great relationship and I completely agree with you. I dont understand how us girls and especially guys can take such a serious topic as sex and pregnancy so lightly. No one understands how much of a life changing thing getting pregnant would be. No im not saying im waiting till marriage, but defintely am waiting until i am completely ready for the emotional and physical toll. And of course a guy who respects me and loves me for me. Anyways, i have to thank my mom for being so open and comfortable with me about sex. parents truly are the anti-drug haha and thank you for posting your thoughts on such a serious issue in our society.    Audrey|`|49We7buoaa	I'm with you on this, I don't know why these young people not just girls, men too...don't use condoms or birth control I was always soooo scared to have unprotected sex and most men did not object to wearing a condom, I was with my X boyfriend for almost a year we never not even 1 time had sex with no condom!!! I was scared about contracting AIDS, or getting pregnant.... I made every man I slept with wear condom even if I was on birth control!!!! I'm now married and so glad I lived my life the way I did, I now want to teach my son's the importance of safe sex|`|0dd0cKUGaa	I wondered this myself back in high school and even more now in college. My opinion is that at that age, the concept of real consequences hasn't been learned. Sure they know "if I get caught I might get grounded," but I don't think many can see past one week of no car/tv whatever punishment the guardians see fit. They don't understand that at age 25 in all likelihood they will look back and be ashamed of how immature they really were. If they only have to look back and be ashamed then honestly that would be a win. But more and more people are looking back and realizing that a kid at 14 or that std you got could have been prevented with little effort.|`|258mrT2Paa	hi Tray Jay  looking at some of the questions on here from "young girls" im shocked at what they say and ask.i try to give advice but as with most teenagers do they listen ?  you have the correct attitude with your children, be open, be there, you have a few years yet ( thank god ) before you have to worry,   heres my advice for what it is worth:   do not wrap them up in cotton wool, it makes them more insecure to actually talk to you as they get older, its never easy been a parent but did you learn from yours ? eventually, not meaning to be pedantic, but it took me a while, my "kids" are grown now parents even, but thanked me for there "freedom" while growing.  regards|`|Y7RVUZ9Yaa	i think girls take part in unprotected sex because they either aren't aware of the consequence's or they think that all the stuff they hear about will never happen to them.  If you build a nice strong relationship with your daughters, I believe they will be able to come to you about anything, they might feel a bit shy or embarrassed but they'll still be able to understand that your on their side, and they can talk to you about anything.  :]|`|rSQjhXbUaa	Well I'm waiting until I'm married to have sex so I'm not under that category. But I have a friend that is..    She did it her first time because the guy pressured her and she really liked him. After that, she always has sex with her boyfriends and sometimes not her boyfriends.. Her mom and dad are split up and both are really rich. They give her what she wants but I wouldn't consider her spoiled. She lives with her mom who is really uptight. My friend would NEVER tell her mom the stuff she does with guys. She'd be pissed. But I think they don't talk about that stuff because her mom is so uptight and never has good conversations with her daughter.  So many people get advice from this website because we don't all have someone to talk to. I'm sure many of us would trade this in for a caring heart any day if that were possible.  So its a good thing your kids are still young and you can yalk to them about everything now and it won't be wierd later..   My other friend and her mom are like best friends and she tells her everything.. I think that'd be really nice to have..|`|2H3XU94Caa	14 to 21, hot damn, that includes me!    I will practice safe sex, only because my friend got herpes on her first time, and that scared the sheet out of me.|`|AA11263103	because they:  1) are slutts  2) they want to do it like everyone else because its cool.  3) they want a baby  4) they say "they are madly in love with blah blah blah and trust them blah blah"|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	i always do!! no babies til 28 at the least! !!   and besides, aids, herpes and other stds are not cuteeeee|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Dont you know?  Teenagers already know everything!  they are omniscient and bulletproof, nothing can happen to them.|`|TRrTunqvaa	well im sure you know.. its more convenient. im 17, and although ive only had sex with 1 person, i do stupid things. i used to use condoms, but since they broke a lot, and i was taking the morning after pill a lot, i decided to just go on birth control. as soon as that started, i felt like condoms were useless anyway, because if there was anything to catch i would have caught it already. then when i was off the pill, i started using condoms again, but then one slipped off, so it was plan B again. now that that never worked, im interchangeable using condoms "towards his finish line", and just him pulling out all because of convenience.|`|Cqd1fkC0aa	I use condoms and birth control everytime, and I am 17 years old.  Don't generalize.  Not all teenagers think they're superman and that nothing will happen to them.|`|D018CPTUaa	Goodkat-  this is not true.  stop being so old-fashioned and jumping to conclusions.      it all depends on the person's environment and peers.    not everyone is like this, probably not even the majority of teenagers are like this.  it just gets so much publicity because it is a big deal not to perform safe sex.. so everyone's trying to push the idea of safe sex.|`|LDKukrPVaa	i like sex.   protected sex.  cause i dont like babies.|`|umoq8bjIaa	We think condoms take too much time, most of us rush into it thinking that it'll make us look cool with our friends, but when we end up pregnant or with an STD we ask ourselves... WHAT WAS I THINKING? And we regret it because of all the gossip. We're just dumb.|`|M3CVx4N7aa	Untrue! I don't have sex at ALL!|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Embarrassment is exactly what it comes down to. Not everyone has secure, open relationships with their parents. There are many girls who feel they can't ask for birth control, and I know of others who would rather risk a pregnancy than walk up to a cashier with a box of condoms. They risk being seen by people they know and being labeled a slut. Reputation is everything to some high schoolers. It's sad, really.
5DJzp6bMaa	Found a FWB|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Be adventurous. I'm not afraid to try new things and I will read up on positions and such and then try it out with hubby.

They suggested each person write down the top 5 things they liked.  And then give it to your mate.    Had a married couple who said..hmmm didn't realized that my mate wanted something different.  Tried it and it worked..GREAT!    Back in 85 I married someone who had been married for 8 years (had 2 kids) and then was divorced 8 years.  A little older than me and more experienced.  But one thing I did know - every person's has different interests - or "hot spots".  Being the curious type, during one session I just explored every place on her body that I could find.  Found several which she said no one else had ever taken the time / trouble to touch or rub.  I did.  :=)    Busy about 3 times per week.  And touching some of those spots still work - like turning a switch on.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Being completely open with one another....anythings possible once you get that comfort!|`|vSJIorF7aa	Dressed up.|`|MVxFOI5naa	Got a cool young looking makeover|`|hWuS3AlLaa	Jalapeno pepper juice on your hands will work every time.

I really fought it for a long time because i had always been a bit submissive. One night I finally got into it. It was slow to start with but then after 2 or 3 sessions I got it. He loves it, I get all the attention on my pleasure for as long as I like and then he gets what he wants. Its win-win. We dont do it all the time but it really has made a difference because i became open to his fantasy and fetish and in return I am his goddess!

1pXMTOkaaa	Walk around the neighborhood and yell out fun things into the air.    A lot of the time, you don't need something to do, you just need somewhere to do it.

DcVoq5Tuaa	apparently they are. If you didn't hear the sound, how can you tell them what that sound was? It looks like they want a detailed answer about what you did come down the hallway and stairs. Next time they ask, tell them, I got up off my bed, dropped my phone, picked it up and opened the door, I walked out of my room and down the hall, I came down the stairs and now here I am, what you heard were my footsteps" and ask them, any other questions? and walk away.
sdcx2clBaa	Well, she's not your friend if shes doing that. Don't talk to her anymore.|`|5sYfBSgJaa	So... your "best friend" is being messy? Well to start, she isn't much of a friend if she is doing that!    In my experience with friends like that, they are jealous of you. So dont let it bother you! You dont need her! She wants to lie then tell everyone how pathetic she is about lying and then start a rumor that she has head lice. After you do that then if she is your "best friend" Im pretty sure you know who she likes or who she is going out with. Tell either the guy she likes she has a scrap book of him and make her seem crazy or tell her boyfriend that she is texting some guy that he doesnt like. And that she has been "talking" to him for almost as long as they've been going out. Believe it or not it is fun to play fire with fire.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	I guess you have learned a valuable lesson about that friend.|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	do da same and when she confronts ur puch her in the F-ing face

Afterall, it's been a while. Just make the first move and contact him..get closer again and then see what happens.|`|OuYPy2Ihaa	Likely in a good relationship he does not want to screw up.|`|AA10953999	I am a little unclear on what happened. You say, you started a good conversation and then he stopped talking or he failed to keep in contact with you after your nice time together?    If he stopped talking mid-way then maybe he ran out of things to say or he had flashbacks of how you two were.     If he said he would keep in touch and didnt then maybe he has a girlfriend and thought continuing contact with you would jeopardize his relationship with her.|`|CZTT7FzUaa	He's a man! that makes him just fake anyways...

Her husband cheated, and I can't bring myself to tell her about it. I don't think it's my business, but it kills me all the same...|`|5LT6LRUZaa	well there is always the planning of an outdoor wedding when you have no back up of an indoor structure in case of rain!    yes RENT  tent to not attempt to build your own...sadly that is not the first story I've heard of regarding a homemade tent that went horribly wrong!    no one objected at my last wedding..though looking back I wish they had!  but I was at a wedding where a woman objected and as it turned out he had a secret family with her...she was in the back of the room with a big hat on and when the priest said "speak now" she stood up and marched up the aisle and went off!  dropping the F bomb inside the cathedral...someone tried to stop her and she kneed the guy...apparently the groom had been with this woman and still was for over 10 years and he had 4 kids with her....his finance' thought he was on business on the weekends for 4 years!  in fact he was living with his other family...wow the drama...needless to say that wedding did not take place that day or any other!  it was like a scene out of a movie that's for sure!     I had to have a sheet cake as my wedding cake before 30 minutes before we were due to pick up the small 3 stacked layer cake they dropped it!!!  so I had them add wedding doodads to a birthday cake!    the guy that gave me away was thicker and he wore Hammer Pants to my wedding!!! it was 1991..but still...OMG!!!! lol    the man who married us was a justice of the peace and also a wiccan high priest, I was unaware of that little fact until he showed up wearing short sleeves and I saw all of his pentagrams and dragons tattooed on him and wondered if the marriage would be legal...sadly it was.    I went to a wedding once who's bride and groom were advid dog lovers and they had their dogs dressed as a bride and groom walk with them down the aisle...btw this is SO STUPID...anyway the dogs were in the mood for love if you catch my meaning and gave everyone a show...they had to dump water on them to get them apart!  so not something anyone wants to see!   Leave your pets at home people!    when I was a teen a family friend got married and the kitchen caught on fire!!! the entire house they rented had to be evacuated and the fire department came and wouldn't let us go back in even though the fire was contained to the kitchen..we had to pack up everything that was salvageable and go to their tiny little house to finish the reception...niiiiiice!      I think that's all I have for now...other than the parents of the bride who had divorced years earlier getting into an argument and the new wife of the father slapped the mother...her new husband and the father started fighting..while the mother and step mother were fighting...that was very ugly!  The bride took off in tears and never did come back to her reception...the groom of course went after her and didn't come back either and that same wedding a crasher walked off with a keg!  lol|`|EetB3Jpyaa	We splurged on honeymoon because we really wanted to go to Fiji. A week before our wedding, the travel agent told us that the vacation company they booked the trip through stopped all communication and didn't book anything. We had to pay 10 grand again to book it through another company, but got all our money back from the credit card company. So my suggestion is...get a travel insurance. We weren't sure if we should spend all that money, but the travel agent told us that if we don't get our money back from that credit card then we can file the claim through the travel insurance we had. We also convinced her to write and sign a letter stating that if we don't get our money back from the credit card or the insurance, then she will pay us the money back. So we were pretty sure that we were going to get our money back. But for a little, we thought we were out 10 grand and not be able to go on our honeymoon.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	well my sister had ordered her cake a few months in advance and the bakery lost her order, my sister was stupid in paying them when she made the order too cause when they went to get it they had to get a replacement cake and pay just as much for it and the bakery didnt care one bit that they had basically stolen her money,lost her order and still made more money off of her.she got lucky though cause everyone found out and made a donation to pay for it.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	one of my bridesmaids ordered the wrong dress cause she lived out of state. i had to change them all because of it.
dUqgiKBPaa	well my future family ;) is really big into snowmobiling and stuff! for christmas they got me really nice snow stuff, my fiance got me a coat and gloves (a ring of course) his parents got me the snow pants.  they made me try the coat and pants to make sure it fits and all that.. when i got to the gloves on they said these fit really funny so you will have to put them on (who tries gloves on)!! they had taped the ring inside the glove in the ring finger so when i put the glove on it slipped right onto my finger. at first i put the right glove on and they said put the other one on too. i did and i could feel something in it so i said this one does fit funny and i pulled my hand out and the ring was on my finger already!!!!!  AHH i had NO NO NO idea that i was getting a proposal for christmas or anytime soon so it came as a total shock!    what was yours like|`|KglW7g96aa	i live at the beach, and it's my favorite place in the world.     my fiance and i once went into a museum along the boardwalk, and it was a wildfowl museum, so ridiculous that it became a joke to us.   the night he proposed to me, he took me to the restaurant where we had our first date, and then to walk along the boardwalk. he proposed to me in front of the atlantic wildfowl museum, on the beach at sunset.   so perfect, and i had absolutely no idea!|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	Well I wasn't supposed to get the ring until Christmas Day. I ended up getting it as a surprise a whole month early second week of November. We had gotten into an argument the day before. He told me he was just coming over to say sorry and give me a hug and kiss. So we were talking things out in his car in front of my house and he was spilling his guts to me saying how sorry he was and how deeply he felt for me and loved me and cared for me. And then said he was even more sorry b/c he couldn't wait he just had to do it he just had to, and he pulled out my ring and asked "Bunny will you be my wifey?" (Bunny is my nickname). Then after I said yes he showed me my wedding band too. Nothing fairy-tale-esque but just my story : )|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I had to be proposed to over the phone.  My boyfriend was in boot camp for the army.  He said he couldn't wait any longer and I wouldn't have been able to see him for another 5 months so he asked me if I would marry him over the phone. We had been dating almost 5 years.
tYhkdr63aa	if she was looking away she was probably thinking about you and embarssed about looking dumb if she blushed or something.  Girls dont look away randomly.  there's always a reason for everything they're doing.    when she smiled was it like a walmart greeter smile?  or was it like a sudden, holy **** "Hes" looking at me.  unfortunately some people smile at others just as a social grace.  was it a real smile or faked?  where her eyes sort of squinty?  if so it was real.  if not she was just being nice.    maybe between looking away and smiling she asked her friends what to do, because she felt, like, so embarassed!! and they probably told her to just smile at you.      for the future try and see if her reactions are gauged towards you or if they're enviromental.  Girls dont think about guys they dont have crushes on.|`|50fc8503a82ad4a3d7a2568f22b34236aa	Well if she smiled at you she'd also probably talk to you. Anytime someone really makes eye contact with me I typically smile at them, but I know when I do that, that it might lead to a conversation or something...So I would just introduce myself the next time I saw her...that's really the only way to know for sure if she is into you.     But remember you don't have to be creepy about it...ha ha just keep it casual until you know if she is interested =)      Good Luck!|`|LDKukrPVaa	she freakin' smiled!    dude.  i smile at people i dont know on the street, it doesnt mean i want in their pants!    calm it down.    talk to her maybe?|`|GlP7KECoaa	i generally smile at people who make eye contact with me but who knows. thats just me :)|`|RBGc1Hytaa	It means two things- she is either just a friendly person, or she is interested in you. You won't really know until you start talking to her...Next time say hey or if you stop at her locker or something start up a conversation. She's most likely interested in you though!|`|1RQOisKkaa	girls smile at me 2 many times. is hard to tell if shes happy or she likes u.. try talking to her?|`|umoq8bjIaa	A smile can tell a lot about a girl. Depending on what kind of smile it was, if she was biting her bottom lip, she was flirting, if it was just a quick smile, she was just being friendly, if her eyes lingered on yours then she could possibly be interested. Just start talking to her, and get to know her a little.   Be yourself, and be confident.   Good Luck|`|cR3M6tepaa	no it means that u look like a clown J/k culd be possible though|`|60UGQvMSaa	Hate to break your heart, but smiling is usually a general courtesy. Talk to her the next time you see her, get to know her, tell her your name. Spend about 30 seconds talking, then tell her you have to leave. The next time you see her, catch up with her, spend about a minute talking to her, but make it seem like you have more important things to worry about than her, if she catches on that you like her before you ask, she will most likely, stop talking to you. Do this everytime you see her, spend a little more time with her. Eventually, if you get a good conversation going, tell her you have to go, but you would like to continue the conversation later. Ask for her number, that should do the trick.     If you see her within 3 days, ask if she wants to do something, if not, call her after 3 days of having her number.|`|Lii6IXEkaa	a smile doesn't mean anything|`|KFWVWwb3aa	ummm maybe she is being friendly or maybe she is interested sometime when i like a guy i usually smile i cant help it but if i don't i just walk by and don't even smile that's me!|`|KGZlxhAVaa	Yes she could be interested or she could have been just being polite either way if you like her( butterflies) make a move. start to get to know her|`|869bb7a223baecd52d10fd82a9beab0caa	I think she likes you because she smiled at you, but don't be too sure, she could just be trying to be nice. Just wait a little longer and make eye contact with her and see what she does. You could also try talking to her.|`|V53qel9Xaa	She could have been just cordial and you were attracted to her.  Could've been a spark. Just smile when you see her.
9WrqJ6Ueaa	Just try to talk to her more, and just get closer with her, then ask her to 'hang out' not to 'go out' and then you can kick it up from there.|`|laFb9Mk1aa	dude tell her streight up  i dont want this to be awkword i would rather have u as a friend than not have u in my life at all...(even if not say that she will fall head over heals...)
RjF7TmvTaa	because she didnt put in effort i can see where you were coming from|`|CIKr28xoaa	its just cake.... its not like a photo of you|`|5sYfBSgJaa	you know i stopped being friends with a girl because she did my hair ugly and she did a couple of her other friends hair really nice. so either do something back 1/2 a$$ed or just stop being friends with them. friends come and go and if they would have put more effort then maybe you wouldnt be so upset about the sucky cake!|`|tMslz416aa	Go to him/her and try to explain that you are sorry and you were just being ignorant, if your friend will listen. But, if he/she is really your friend, then he/she will forgive you and get over it.|`|cKeghBi7aa	uhhhh....|`|bxfInqBPaa	Screw that, you deserve a GREAT cake!|`|C3tVKFWuaa	wow that is really HEARTLESS! you are disturbed.
s9Pb6MnYaa	you don't have to hate each other for what you guys are. If you're not similar in opinions and tastes, you can't try and change the other person, because that's just what they are. accept him for who he is, and accomodate it. It's the same for me and my brother...we were REALLY close when we were young...i'd talk to him all night and day about stuff, and then we grew up and developed COMPLETELY different attitudes and personalities...he loves rap, the social life, parties, and is pretty much a jock too. he kids around ALOt, to the point of annoyance. I'm quite the opposite. i prefer rock and oldies stuff. i'm friendly to people, but i prefer to be alone, do art and music, think, read, and stuff like that. basically the classic extrovert vs. introvert. i HATED it at first...like i'd always get into fights with him and try and make him change, to be more like me and be more sensitive to my feelings. but then i realized, he's just a playful guy. he likes to have some fun, takes things lightly. he just DOESN'T sense feelings...he's not a mean guy, but definitely NOT sensitive. that's just his basic nature and what makes him happy. He's equally valid to be who he is, just like me (and you). And now I'm alot more patient with him because i know he can't help it. i just accept it. i try to laugh along with the joke, which helps me too because then i take things less seriously and learn to laugh more, be happier. but if it's at the point where it's pissing me off, i'll tell him point blankedly, give him a reason he can understand. basically, the point is you don't have to be divided and hate each other...just have mutual respect and accept each other's differences. meanwhile try to live and not kill each other :)  p.s. he's still the same guy you knew when you were kids.|`|inIjc9Eiaa	I think this is just a phase. You are both young and are still in school. You mentioned different cliques. That is exactly what it is. He probably tries to show off infront of his friends. Jocks tend to pick on different types of people that arn't like them. Both of you are probably going to go to college and then get a job and life goes on. This won't make a difference to you two then. You will probably laugh about it. Brothers are for life but believe me friends usually arn't. Unless your brother turns out to be a real jerk then this should just be a bump in the road of life for you guys.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	He thinks like a jock, so he thinks you think likewise.   Accept him for what he is and move on to be who you are.  You don't have to play his games. You only get into conflict if you allow him to bug you.
AA11553245	The blitz is big but has a keyboard    the smallest qwerty keyboard phone would be the lg env2 they are pretty nice little phones  also look at the palm centro by far palms are one of the best phones on the market and they come in pretty colors|`|844DGAMmaa	Wrong section.|`|5pcCyum9aa	choose the phone i have it so great-I have alltel but verizon the SAME EXACT THING that's called something different. In alltel its called the scoop, at verizon its called the rumor. Its a really reliable phone and you can text like wind! It comes in like 10 colors and is small, that is a great phone    i don't know about verizon but at alltel it was only 50 bucks with a 10 dollar instant rebate and a 20 dollar mail in rebate, so its basically 20 bucks!!!!
AA10953999	I know a guy like that, everyone tries to avoid all contact with him because once he starts talking, he never stops. I suggest you make yourself look as busy as possible, maybe even say you are sick with strep throat or something catchy so he wont want to turn to you lol  Oh and leave an anonymous note at his seat that he needs to wash once in a while.
ZTHP6Ybvaa	Sounds like he might be thinking something similar to you as well. If he's become distant there is probably a reason. You just have to ask yourself if you are willing to settle for what you have? If so, good luck, but if you honestly think you deserve better then you should move on and hold out for everything.  Not everyone meets their soul mate...but wouldn't you like to be open to that chance?   To me, it sounds like you already have your answer, you just need someone to tell you it is ok.....?  Good luck with whatever you decide!|`|5k7BexD3aa	Honestly, I couldn't even read your post for the misspelled words and grammar and such.  Sad thing is you are in GRAD school?  Focus TONS more on your education instead of a loser.|`|AA10065812	*** Why don't women recognize that men are being affected at a much great degree by what's happening in the economy.

Get him into depression screening before he spirals out of control.|`|91sBjTtAaa	it will only get worse iv been there
p9DW7iRfaa	Odds are it is kind of innocent, if it is her best friend and they're both of the same gender. However, I would suggest that you talk about it frankly with her. Communication is key. She won't get angry at you just for asking.
umoq8bjIaa	Women are twisted, i know this because i am one, we think it's a way to flirt, but what we don't realize is that the guy we're playing mind games with is actually getting really pissed off and slightly annoyed.   Just talk to her about it and tell her how you feel.
kYDYuZ40aa	i know u care for him ..... but dnt get involved.... this is the way he is going to have to learn... he didnt listen the 1st time so hes going to have to learn sum way.... just let it happen and just be there for him when it does... he'll need u... thats all u should do....|`|TRrTunqvaa	well you gotta keep telling him.. be like "im just lookin out for you"|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	sometimes friends just won't listen and have to learn for themselfs. i had the same problem one time with a girl that worked for me. she was pretty and so on and on but a whore also. my friend went out with her until i gave him her backround, then he dumped her and turned her on to his friend and he got serious and i told my friend to tell his friend the same thing but he would not listen and married her anyways which lasted about 3 years. do not get bent out of shape about it, get word to him and let it go. some guys like women are so insecure regardless of what you say they will do there own thing and learn the hard way but at least you tried.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Dude, he can take care of himself. And if he can't, he'd better learn if he's going to survive in this world. Don't go sticking your nose where it doesn't belong unless you want to lose a friend.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	if this is true, gross.     but if you tell your friend he may not believe you and may side with her (people do crazyyy things when they are in like)   just, i;d let him know i was there for him and what not, and tell him to maybe not get too attached

uCr1uiIuaa	This tradition replaced the dowry, a costly prize (often land, property, money, or chattel) that accompanied the bride.  When a man accepted a woman for his wife, he expected something in return, hence the dowry.  As this feel from fashion, the bride's father became more responsible for the cost of arranging the ceremony.|`|cWP73qEsaa	It all started many many years ago when a man was going to marry a woman his family and him would first see what the woman and her family had to offer example; farms, livestock after that it was more of riches and money which they called the woman's dowry. so that's why they still think the woman's family has to pay for the wedding|`|O2xwMwHYaa	its becoming less traditional now-a-days but originally it was a dowery. as a thank you for marrying my daughter, let me impress you and send her off right. i dont think its thought of in that way, for americans at least, anymore though.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	Its part of the dowery. A woman savings things like china and heirlooms for her future settled live called a hope chest (now a wedding shower) while the parents save up money for the wedding and her future.    A young man would offer the girls father barn animals, to show that he has a way to provide for his daughter. (now its a ring)    I think thats how the tradition started.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Because it was usually the dad giving away his daughter and it's like "here, this is what I've saved for you" and now, in your honor, I am giving you to this man who will take care of you.    Unfortunately, it doesn't always work out that way as dad pass away and/or money is non-existent, but oddly enough, as luck would have it, we are still supposed to foot the bill.  Ah, c'est la vie.|`|flxHpF52aa	It is kind of a tradition now. Mostly the girls family pays the most. But if you are a nice guy i think the guy should also help out the girls family.
Ikd9cppcaa	I think your Dad has made his choice and that is his wife. It doesn't matter what you think of her or what I think. What you need to do is just go visit once a month. What you are going to find is that you need to stay loyal to your Mom. Forget what your Dad is doing. You know he is selfish. After all, he cheated with her when he was still married to your Mom. He has fault, too. Don't say anything bad about him or his wife to anyone. As you grow older, it won't matter that you don't go to visit. In fact, you will be much happier spending weekends living with your Mom and spending time with your friends. Just smile and enjoy. After all....it could be worse....your Dad could have full custody and then you would need to deal with the stepmother everyday.|`|R0o5rvpGaa	this is what i think of her...                Total Biatch... i feel sorry for you
KifasiMraa	Unfortunately, you can't make anyone like you.  All you can do is be your awesome self and see if he recognizes and appreciates that.  If he doesn't, let it go.  Don't worry, even if he never sees the light, you'll find someone who will :-)|`|Ohlnx99Caa	I'd have to agree with Lorien. I don't think you should play with the "hard to get" game or try to change yourself in anyway because if you do and you get into a serious relationship with this guy you will have to keep this veil up to keep him interested. If he likes you, he likes you, but if not, you can't force him to. If you like a guy, why not asking him out?|`|7U3RQBLtaa	Honestly, play hot and cold with him.|`|dWwIEqEwaa	you cant make a guy like you.

You have to be pretty. Looks is what attracts a guy to you first, personality comes next  2. Personatliy. Be funny, outgoing, and nice. Don't be mean to him or play hard to get, just be friendly and show him that you like him byt trying to touch him and laugh a lot when he talks to you  3. Don't try to make him jealous. It's mean.   4. Say hi to him in the hallways. In fact, say hi to him whenever you can. It will show him that you are interested.  5. Sit/stand/ be around him as much as possible  6. Be VERY nice. Do REALLY nice things, like loaning him hw.    Follow these steps and he will fall in love with you in a matter of days|`|kBmL1m3Eaa	challenge him, don't pretend to like something just cuz he likes it. if you disagree on something tell him, but don't get into in argument. show that you are interested in him but don't act like he is your number 1 priority. in other words, make him chase you and not the other way around.

The insecurity can be the result of prior infidelity or a lack of trust.What I will suggest is to build up the trust between you two, talk and text each other when you are apart from each other,deal with and resolve the issues that create trust issues between you and so on.Spend more time with each other, and do fun things when you are together, affirm your love for each other constantly, and say sweet nothings to each other.Discuss the feelings you have for each other, strengthen them, and build on them.

StztwNonaa	guys are easy to approach....even us sexy ones, nothing is hotter than an attractive girl showing great confidence by approaching me.  any woman who comes to me first is starting ahead.  now you women, though, some of you can be pretty harsh when someone says hey.   so with that said, i suggest that if you see someone you are interested in then try to notice something about them(clothing, shoes, hair, smile, piercing, something) then walk on up there and say something about that noticable feature.  And seriously, this is important, just be yourself.  whether you are super intelligent or really bubbly or straight up goofy.  dont be fake.  if they dont like the kind of person that you are then they are not for you.  Good luck and i hope that helps.|`|wAXtxBe7aa	go up to them and be like..  im so and so..   wana hang out?  they will understand.|`|lz6vAjSEaa	ask if they go to ur school|`|TyQVTvw1aa	In the mall ask him if he knows where a certain store is......Wherever ask him if he is so and so's friend because he looks familiar.
3y0w1qIBaa	If you get back together with him, be aware that he can break your heart again.
onbwN4csaa	That's what happens when your marry young.  The years that he feels he missed.  He can't go back.  There gone.  The sooner he realizes that the better. He's age, maturity and responsibility. has moved him past that.  He's chasing a what could have been...   He's going through you mite call a youth life crises.  Let him know that what you have together now is far better than  those past years.  Work together. Talk both of you through it.    In most relationships there is a rough patch at about 8 to 10 years in.  When you get through it. It becomes easier. A better  understanding of each other and you life together.    Your just hitting one of those.FOR better or worse times.  You know.. the ones in your wedding vows.  Good luck.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Take a weekend and get away or plan a week long get away where no one knows you, tell no one turn off the phones when you get there, Just spend time with each other re-expoloring each other and finding that special something that brought you together in the first place. Since Valentines Day is coming up  start with a weekend and as it gets a bit nicer say Spring plan something more elaborate  say like a 4 day weekend trip out of state or to a B and B.     But to start all this you both need to agree that those houseguests of yours need to go ASAP!!! no ifs ands or buts get them out and then you can start to reconnect slowly. Star with a shared late romantic dinner, watching a movie together, offer to give him a massage that leads to the naughty side of things then rock his world and remind him how much you love him.|`|15c65c9e8add677224c2ca33da13498aaa	First off get the squatters out. Second make sometime just the two of you even if it is an hour a day watch a show cuddle on the couch to be close. Remind him of why he said I DO!!|`|dGBbFwFWaa	sometimes being alone together instead of people around is best.. try to communicate with him and understand him.. but also make sure you let him know how u feel about him...good luck|`|roGfyzcHaa	My wife and I married right out of school. We were 18 and 19 at the time. now she is 26 and I'm 27. Everything I wanted to do she did with me. Everything she wanted to do I did with her. We helped each other grow up.Do what you can to help him with what he thinks he has missed. We just got a place of our own a year ago. Hang in there you can work it out marriages aren't easy. Why do you think so many fail? It's because one or both give up.|`|geJM58L2aa	Young marriages are hard and a lot of the couples do feel like they missed out on a lot of their lives because they got married and took on a lot of responsibilities early in their lives. I'm 19 and got married almost 4 months ago and since then I've stopped seeing my friends, I feel like all I do is work and clean, and I'm tired from working so hard so my sex life is pretty much null.      Why do your have people living with you?  The first step to getting your relationship back to how it was would be to get your own place so that you can have your time together in the privacy of your home.  If that's not possible right now, you need to at least take a romantic getaway as often as possible until being on your own is possible.  That way you can have some privacy, not worry about who's around, and spend the weekend doing things young married couples should be doing ;)|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Does he have friends? Does he hang out with his friends?   Get him to go out with the guys. Tell him you understand and that you do not want to take the risk of loosing him. Why are people living with you anyway?   Because of people and the whole situation, you two have been growing apart and are loosing the connection you once had.   I think you need to (SOMEHOW) get rid of these people and prioritize what he wants. You both got married when you were 23, which is not TOO bad. If he says he missed out on things, then you have too.   Talk about what he wants to do...what are the things he really want. Share. Talk.   Make romantic dinner and spend the night talking about good ol' memories and connect.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Romantic get away for the weekend!|`|pOwOYqhEaa	you and your husband need your own place so move out or kick those other people out of your house, so you can reconnect with each other.  Take a vacation 9 years is a long time when you are young.|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	First kick out the people who live with you. Next you want to spice up your sex life with him.  Go out on dates again with him.  This should help revive your relationship.  Maybe he is just getting that itch that I think alot of people get when they are with someone for so long. Hope this helps.|`|AA10065812	He has missed out, and still is.    You reached full maturity a year ago, but he doesn't reach it for five more years.  Christ wasn't mature enough to leave home until he was 30, and he was a perfect human being.    He is still feeling the desires and urges of his youth.  You are no longer feeling them.. Your whole view of the world changed a year ago, and along with, how you relate to the world around you and those in your world.    I can't give you any advice here.  This is why couple should not live together or get married prior to age 24.  It's when you reach full maturity, and as the anchor of a good relationship, you are the glue that holds things together.  Over 85% of breakups and divorces involve people who got married or began living with a partner, prior tp that age.  It affects all your relationships from here on out.    Unfortunately, as our economy collapses, and we are heading into a another economic depression, he may also be experiencing some problems with depression.    Here's some books I hope will help.

71VRvldJaa	Anything that happened before this guy became your boyfriend is none of his business.  I think you don't owe him any explanation at all.  It's in your past, leave it there!  It doesn't concern him, it has nothing to do with him and it has nothing to do with you two as a couple.  Tell him to drop it and get over it and that you refuse to discuss it with him any further!|`|uRHVCvNPaa	Thats s^c&s, but your past is your past and he is only privvy to your past if you choose you tell him. What happened between you and another guy is none of his business and he shouldn't be concerned about it. He should try to work on his relationship with you or he will be part of your past too.|`|uKkCXbFzaa	That's so dumb that he's mad at you. It has nothing to do with him, and it's completely understandable if you don't want to bring it up. It sounds like he's being overly controlling and you need to talk to him about it.|`|1pXMTOkaaa	call him. personally, i think he overreacted. just try to talk to him (force him, if you have to), and explain that you didn't think that it mattered. (again, personally, i don't see why it matters...)|`|advg14adaa	he is being an assholeit's your business not his!!!!|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I believe its more to the story but he will get over it|`|N0nYIeNvaa	your boyfriend is overreacting to something that has nothing to do with him.  whatever happened in the past has absolutely nothing to do with him  would you get mad at him if his ex girlfriend cheated on him? no.    but you never know, maybe he thinks YOU cheated on your ex, not the other way round.    give him a call, talk things over, and tell him there is nothing to be upset about.
rx20pKgOaa	file for divorce. Why are you willing to let her make all the decisions?  You can't work on the relationship if she won't communicate, so make the decision to move on with your life.     Good luck|`|VXcp8hvHaa	Welcome to the wild world of "my wife has a boyfriend and it ain't me". Sorry dude she's moved on, sorry.|`|Y08YLysXaa	You sound exactly like my fiance, in fact I could almost believe you're the same person by this post! When a man treats a woman badly, is an alcoholic, no job etc... it all piles up. She's feeling neglected, hopeless, tired. She may be waiting for you to do or say something that communicates a change... she needs to know she can benefit from the relationship. If all she gets is fighting and etc, she won't want to be in the relationship. She doesn't want to hear "you're not perfect" or "what about the time you..." or "I know we're BOTH bad to eachother"... she wants to hear "I'm so sorry, I really need to be with you... you mean everything to me and you don't deserve the way I treated you. I want us to work on this together because when I married you, my vows were forever". You seem to be feeling this way going by what you've said, but I doubt you've really communicated that to her in an open compassionate selfless way. Men like to try and sort things out by comparing, analysing, making sense of. Women just want you to be sorry, acknowledge what you did, feel valued and needed, feel like you are willing to do what it takes to have her. The last thing she needs is for you to act the same way you always did, even when you're separated. That'll make her feel that your ego and pride are 100% more important than being with her, and that you'll protect those to the grave rather than have a life with her    !!|`|ZtfN4J6taa	You must realize it's over. She has someone else, best thing you can do is file for divorce, move on, and good luck !

rWApTbBOaa	honesty is the best policy, just say i don't like you i like the other guy, that way you are not leading anyone on, hope this helps
9ykAQxJxaa	Listen, they are paying for what they believe are fundamental needs...meaning things that you cannot live without.  Clothes, food, shelter, and school supplies.  You're lucky enough that they are willing to buy you designer clothes...most parents won't pay the money for something like Abercrombie & Fitch when you can get something much cheaper at a department store on clearance.  Music and tutor lessons will enhance your education and life overall one day.  You may not see it now...most kids don't....I didn't see it either, but believe me, you'll be thankful when it comes time for college...trust me!!    Try saving some of your own money that you might receive as b-day gifts or what not to put towards the PS3 that you want...maybe your parents will buy it for you on a special occasion.|`|BwNoWmQ0aa	Because it's their money and they are in-titled to spend it as they see fit. You shouldn't be so unappreciative. If you keep on, they may start shopping at wal-mart for your clothes little missy.
wFWytGlxaa	I Taste Just Like Candy, Kelis.    Always cheers me up for some reason.    Listen to it.    xoxo
wf3S2avqaa	It's not be jealously. I've gone through sometimes similar before. Tell both of them off and then kick them to the curb. The way this world is today nobody needs drama in there lifes. Let her be a slut with her other ho-ish friend. Go on with your life.     Stop the life you save may be your own.|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	i have gone through a VERY much similar situation.  while girls grow up, they want to get more "hotter" because on what they see in magazines, lol im the SAME way but my adittude doesnt change like these girls have.  n e ways, once they see a girl that is more prettier than them they AUTOMATICALLY take control by be-friending her and acting like her to make themselves feel more important.  by bullying u, and yes hun they ARE bullying u, they feel a sense of pride/are liking every minute of it.  what u need to do is just STOP trying to be friends with them.  one day they will learn what they lost and come crawling back, i GUARENTEE that will happen but DONT let them get what they want.  stand ur ground, get new friends, and start living your life by what YOU do not what THEY do.  next time they do something like that again, ask yourself these questions:  1. is it worth it?  2. do i WANT to start acting like that?  3. do i want to be KNOWN as the school sl ut?  and 4: why do i CARE?  ask yourself that and then you'll realize that there is NO need to care about them.   good luck.|`|8nexYdUjaa	Who knows what it is. it's something that everyone goes through at some point in their life, and i'm so sorry that you're going through it now =( I went through a friendship problem too. I was great friends with these two girls, we were like family. and then they started leaving me out and treating me like I was worth nothing, and I took it because i didn't want to lose them. but you know what ? "friends" that would hurt you like that, are not meant to be your friends forever, and you are meant to meet much better people & move on to bigger and better things =) let her go. it may take time, i know it took a long time for me too, But sometimes you have to know when you've gone through enough, and when it's time to take care of yourself ! Take care, i hope i helped =)|`|tMslz416aa	I have not have this happen to me personally, but one of my best friends has. Her and another girl were friends with this one girl, until she just started hanging out with other people because she "thought" that the other girl hated her. So she started getting meaner and meaner over time and actually started changing into the people she was hanging out with. My friend pretty much told me that she just had to give up on her, she tried everything to be friends with her but the girl thought my friend was hanging out with the other girl to much and ignoring her. So eventually they just stopped talking, completely. The girl went with her friends and my friend went with her friends. It's her choice, and if you can't convince her to somehow stop hanging out with the sluts, then you will just have to let her go.|`|00d78fc4efb7cb89b0aeaab9da6bf0f7aa	Um.. it's kinda Jealousy. I think it's just you knowing you lost a friend and that you feel bad about it, and honestly you need to tell her, if she is worth it now, that she is being Dumb, and hopefully she'll understand.
BC9nPXG7aa	OMG!! guess what! i have a B.F in the philippines too.this time you should get to know him more so that you guys will have a good connection with each other!|`|2xhISlUEaa	well for one. The reason he was flirting with other two girls to is because in there culture they have more than one wife and there is nothing wrong with that. its just part of there culture.  And two. I think you need to get over him and start looking for someone else because Long distance relationships nevre work :| sorry to say but they dont. :(|`|3secB3Smaa	You cannot have a relationship with a fantasy.
1nk8WPrtaa	They never leave their wives. Ever|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	You're not a bad person.  You got swindled.  But you are making a mistake.  The major problem here is that he wasn't upfront with you about the fact he was married.  I don't see how that lack of honesty and openness is going to translate into a decent relationship for you, even if he does leave his wife.|`|1YDpRGocaa	"if he does it with you he will do it to you!"  it sucks that you didn't no and im sorry you are in this situation and even if you do love him is it worth it to be with a cheater? it may sound romantic that he says hes willing to leave his wife for you but put yourself in her shoes and think how would you feel if he left you for her? im sorry i don't know your situation or any of the people involved and this probably isn't what you want to hear but i don't think your a bad person if you didn't know in the beginning that's sooo not your fault! But think about it is a guy really worth it if you only mean enough to him to cheat on with? I don't know that much about love but i do no the effects of cheating has on people i watched my parents get divorced over it and 4 years later i still cry myself to sleep and i can never look at my parent that cheated the same (i actually broke the guys toe) and after my ma married him they got divorced too. if a relationship isn't built on trust there is very little chance of it working out!     im so sorry but do you really want to be in a relationship with a guy that put you in this situation? the fact that you asked alone shows that your hesitant about the whole thing and my plain out advice is he isn't worth it and you deserve someone who values you as more then a mistress! im not trying to yell at you i really hope this helps and things work out for you!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If you don't know then you are not. When you find out and you still see him you are. He might choose you? Do you really want a man that is a cheat and a liar? He is cheating and lying to you too you know. If he was really going to choose you instead of her he would have done it by now.|`|G50ucmllaa	Hahaha!  He's just saying that sweetheart.  I know you love him, but he has no respect for you or his wife.  Why would you want to be with someone like that?  Move on and find someone who will actually put your first and not sneak around on his wife.|`|dFlc9DVsaa	You surely know the answer.  Continuing with the relationship is justifying your desires.  Do you really think this guy will remain faithful to you if ever he choose you?  If he has done it to his wife whom he has a committment...that means he can do the same with you moreso that you're not legally attached to him.    Don't waste your time with him, find your own man who's single, unattached, responsible and loving.    I know you're already feeling guilty about this...would you like to be in the same shoe of his wife?|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	He "might" choose you? LOL...  If you know now he's married, you know YOU are doing something wrong by being with him.  Does he have children? You like the fact that he might abandon his kids? wow, what a catch.    If you ever marry him, you'll be the one who's being cheated on and you'll be the one he doesn't love anymore over another person. I hope you enjoy that.|`|frpCK0utaa	Well, if you didnt know at the beginning he was not single, thats understandable. But as soon as you found out, he should have been cut off. Guys use that "i'll leave her" line all the time, and women are foolish enough to fall for it. Yes, you love him, but chances are, you dont mean that much to him. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you!     Move on hun, or at the very least tell him to call you when the papers are filed.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	How can you not know? Does it not make sense that you don't get to visit his home, have a home phone number, call or see each other at odd hours? What about his car, there have got to be signs that he's married. At least there are in our vehicles. Is there never even something like a bill in there with both names on it? And, if nothing else, have you never ran into him in public anywhere with his wife, kids, or maybe even an in law? I just cannot see how someone could not know that someone that they are dating is married.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	I don't think it makes you a bad person. You just need to realize that the relationship isn't going to go anywhere and you are  2 on his list. he won't leave his wife for you!! Don't let to much time go by waiting for that to happen.|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	You are if you stay with him knowing that he is married. He lied to you. Is this the person you want a life with? You aren't special if he cheated on her I'm sure he'll cheat on you too. That's if he even leaves his wife which he won't. End it with him. Tell him you can see him again once he's legally separated but trust me he is taking advantage of you and your trust. He has no intention of leaving his wife for you. Consider yourself the flavor of the month.|`|bnFcjEptaa	He said that he "might" choose you! Do you want to be with a man who is a liar?  Not revealing that he was married is a deception.    I am sorry to have to tell you, but statistics show that only 3-5 percent of married men leave their wives for the mistress.    Sweetie, the probability that he will leave her for you is very remote.  You are not a bad person, you are conflicted.      You may benefit from counseling so you can become brave enough to let him go.    Best Wishes|`|XmudUg2aaa	He might choose you?    Do you value yourself so little that you are willing to wait for a married man who is cheating on the woman he took sacred vows....to choose you?    Is he the only penis in town? No.    Is he the only man in this vast world that you could love? No.    Are you worthy of only having someone elses sloppy seconds? No.    He is lying to his wife...he lied (misled) you....I'm sure this guy is a keeper .....as in keep away.    Please move on and find  someone who is better.    I'm sure he doesn't LOVE any of you. What kind of twisted 'love' are people accepting now a days?|`|WItKOQh7aa	I do not know how old you are, and although your spelling is atrocious, I'm going to take you seriously anyway.    Being a mistress does not make you a bad person.  Every single situation is different, and you cannot choose who you love.    Do NOT seek approval from others with regard to your relationship!  You are going to get a lot of angry responses telling you to find your own man, calling you all sorts of names, telling you he's never going to leave his wife for you..... all from bitter women who've been cheated on, or live in fear of the day they find out their husband has been enjoying himself (for a change) with another woman.    Being in love with someone who has signed a legal contract with another person does not make you a bad person. (Everyone who says that you're a home wrecker is full of ****, and LOVE has nothing to do with it, because if he really loved his wife, you wouldn't stand a chance in the first place). Do not let others judge you because of who you love, IT'S REALLY NO ONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.     OH, and I almost forgot, they'll throw in the bit about the "kids".  They always do.  Plenty of women use "the children" as an excuse for why a man should stay in an un happy marriage.    Get over the guilt and enjoy your life.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	men hardly ever leave their wife for a mistress.  No matter what they say.  Plus, even if he did leave her for you, what is going to stop him from getting another mistress when he gets tired of you?|`|6aVtiTKiaa	There are very few things in life that make you a bad person.  Good people do bad things sometimes.  You're not at fault for the time you didn't know ... but you need to think hard about what you're going to do from here on out.|`|W7DhZSy3aa	Don't do it girl, you can find better, if he is willing to do this to his wife, he will do it to you too eventually. It is a good thing that you recognize the commandment because it is there to guide you in living a fruitful life, God knows what will happen if you choose to go on like this with a married man, not too many good things can come from this .... think about how you would feel if you were the wife. and think about if they have kids, how would this effect them and you being apart of the pain their family and kids will go through? its not worth it. there are plenty of men out there that are not married....dont do it, just dont talk to him anymore... good luck|`|560748dc95678942bf1e01b427bfb8beaa	If he cheated with you he will cheat on you.
DcVoq5Tuaa	well I don't think you will get one from your parent's now since your older than your sister, I am assuming your the first born. Maybe a friend will loan you her brother for a while, I am sure they would love to get rid of their brothers from time to time.|`|HyulW3aiaa	That's natural. I have 2 older brothers but they don't count for much these days. My wife has an elder brother who never ever contacts her.Some families get it right,some don't.Just accept your position and remember to set a good example for your sister to follow.|`|tYhkdr63aa	Any guys you contact will want more than being just friends.   Find a guy out of your league and establish similarities.  A guy that's way hotter than you will have fun with you and will never consider you as a potential lover!  but they have to be wayy hotter, not just a little hotter.     OR get friends with a gay guy.  they are really good companions for girls.  besides any gay guys in high school are so ostracized by their peers, that they will be 100x closer friends than anyone else.|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	Im like u.  I wish i had a brother.  Im the only boy and 3 girls (older) I was tortured and dressed up like a girl and forced to do cheerleadin :( I used to think babies came from eatin alot (dad told me) So i would tell him to buy my mom 50 big macs so that i could have a brother, but she declined.  I had to b the baby of the family.  4 their weddin i was so spoiled i got to pick the cake.  Ofcouse no one told me it was a weddin so i picked a dinosaur cake lol.  Atleast u have someone younger to boss and more importantly b a role model 2 so b grateful for what u have and b sure to take the right path.  Well enjoy ur rest of ur nite:)
cPgOxcS7aa	Having your heartbroken is a really awful thing but everyone goes through it.  I have been off and on with my friend for almost 7 years and right now I am very hurt and cant figure out what to do.  We never dated just close friends.  I stay away from him right now but I have been thinking to much about him and crying alot.  It depends and everyone is different.  Hopefully it doesnt take you to long and maybe go and try to find someone else.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	They say it takes twice the amount of time you two were together|`|t2R3mEMoaa	It takes time to mend the broken heart, but mend it will.

Trust me.|`|lIfeAsb3aa	Well for me and from my past experiences it depends how long/strong the relationship was, and there person handeling the break up.    I liked this guy but we were only friends, I never really acted on it, but he knew I liked him. One day he hooked up with my friend, that did hurt, but only only for a couple weeks. There was this other guy I liked and had somewhat a relationship with for about 4 months, when he got a girlfrind that hurt for a couple months.        I hope you feel better. |`|d0f8fa109b7a7196f354bef38eee38d5aa	you just need some time honey.go out there and do some men.you might find someone who does you better and suprisingly might even provide better company|`|vjxroyxjaa	That's a tough one. There r just so many possiblilities. How was the breakup, how much did u like this guy, how long had u been goin out, watz lif lik other than the breakup. C wat i mean. It also depends on u. Its hard to but r u ever gonna fully let go and move on? It's horrible that us guys can hurt u guys' so much but luv sux sometimes. I bet ur a strong girl and that of course ur gonna cry now and then but it sounds lik ur movn on well. If u keep goin it should pass and if ur confident and b urself, theres gonna b a couple guys waitn for u. It will pass as fast as u let it. I hope this helped,  Best of Luck!

I had my heart broken even before you, sometime around october, and yes it still hurts bad. It might be because it was my first heartbreak but either way it will always be a soft spot in your heart and will only go away once you let it. Do yourself a favor and delete his number out of your phone, and do the things you love to do when you are single. Have a girls night out party and just have fun being single. Just don't get with another guy just to forget all about what's his face.  Hope everything gets better, good luck!|`|UThG15FLaa	Well  There is no magic medicine, that makes heartbreak go away.  All that you can do, is try to forget. It takes time to get over a heartbreak. There isn't much anyone can do to help.    You have to help yourself,   -maybe go out with some friends? try not to think about it.    Just think too, Maybe he feels the same way?  Have you tried talking to him? Talk to him, maybe see how hes feeling.    Gd luck ?  DEEE|`|peUNFJH7aa	When you decide you are better than that. I had a hard time getting over a relationship (I even knew it wasn't going anywhere) when I was cheated on. I cried at night sometimes a month later. Eventually you just learn that they're just not worth it. There's better people out there.|`|eSV03XrZaa	Its ok but dont cry to much. When you break up with someone it just shows that that person isnt " the one". When the time is right youll find someone that you will LOVE and he will LOVE you back TRUST ME!!!|`|AA11595860	Omg that depends... if you went out for awhile, I'd say at least six months. maybe more.     Go out with your friends, work out, and stay busy!   Throw out all the pics, and anything that reminds you of him!     Oh and dont stay in contact, that only hurts more...

You will decide how long to cry and when to stop.|`|PEYYcGpuaa	well... I don't know how long it would take to get over someone, BUT what always works for my bestfrend is...  ice-cream  porn  going clubbing  and getting a very sexy haircut... yup yup       p.s hope you feel better.|`|kBmL1m3Eaa	i know it's cliche, but there are a lot of other guys out there, and some maybe even better then the last you just had. always remember, when one door in life closes there's another one that opens up.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	everyone is different when it comes to being heartbroken. things can take a long time and some may be short. if it is someone that you truly care about a lot then it will be VERY hard and you never know just keep on crying it is a way of heeling your pain. it's good to cry about things that way you don't keep it inside. that's never good. talk to some of your friends to go have a girls day..maybe scope some guys out at a mall or something. just hang out with friends and they will be there for you as things move on and get better. they always do, don't try and dwell on the past think about your future and you will do fine.|`|mMmdJKvRaa	honestly if it was a first love you will always feel something for them but it will eventually get less painful however if it wasnt you will eventually begin to feel better and stop crying. hang out with friends, go shopping, get a massage in other words do things for yourself and focus on you. usually focusing on something else helps. have fun and maybe you will meet someone else thats even better than the last and will realize you are better off without that other person. there is always a reason for a breakup even if you dont see it now. also getting a pint of ice cream and having it all to yourself helps out too:)
mMmdJKvRaa	well you havent been dating long so you two go out to eat and then if you feel like you should get him something then maybe bake him some vday desserts its inexpensive and delicious or even make him dinner depending on what you think he would like more. ive always thought vday was more of a girls holiday anyways|`|vCTMZKrgaa	stupid single awarness day...|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Don't get him anything for the 2 month anniversary.

If you are trying to be someone else, then she isn't going to like you she is going to like the person that you are trying to be which will cause a ton of problems down the road.  Compliment her when it's needed, not excessively and just put yourself out there for her.  If she doesn't bite (not interested) it sucks, but the beautiful thing about life is that nothing is for certain.  Yeah it sucks if a girl/boy turns you down, there will always be a fear/feeling of rejection but there are plenty of people out in the world to make you happy.  On a happier note, just because a girl says "No" now, doesn't mean that she won't say yes down the road.  (happened in the relationship i'm in now... 3 months later.)  Good luck
OUDXDNBLaa	If you ABSOLUTELY KNOW that he's cheating what are you hanging around for?  Find someone who will love and respect you enough not to cheat on you.  This guy doesn't love you, if he did he wouldn' t do this to you.|`|ry3yUnoaaa	Honey trust your gut instinct, it's always right. That's a gift that God gave us as women. Far too many ignore it and suffer the consequences later. Condoms don't guarantee 100% protection from STDs so be careful. Not putting up with cheating is NOT being brutal. It means having respect for yourself, and loving yourself enough to not allow mistreatment. I hope you don't end up wishing you would have listened to your gut like a lot of women....and then it's too late.|`|fSQfmCUbaa	be brutall.. hes ch eating and is gonna get something then youre gonna end up with diseases from some hoe ur guy was messing with and then hes going to leave you cause he doesnt want a doormat girlfriend thats if he even considers u a gf|`|kiY9kihbaa	It'll eat you up until you know 100% for sure if he's cheating, so get proof.  He'll probably preach his innocence until you show him proof, so don't even bother talking to him about it.  If you accuse him of cheating, that actually inceases the chances that he will cheat cuz he now knows you don't trust him and your relationship will fall apart.  DO NOT talk to him about it unless you are sure or else you face a lose-lose situation.  If you go for proof, atleast you have a 50/50 chance of winning.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Can't leave?  You chained to him?    And what do you mean you need help?

If he gets very defensive then its possible that he is cheating but if not then maybe he is not....but a woman's intuition is very strong...mine has not steered me wrong yet!|`|CmDR4MOeaa	Brutal.. you just described a jerk to me    You ***** slap him and then dump him in front of hundreds of people you know    When you slap that asshole you'll feel so good, you might go clubbing and find someone new|`|UD2X3e3Paa	Listen to that inner voice.  It doesn't always tell us what we want.  That voice has been around since time began....its instinct, trust it.    I am so sorry to hear what's going on.  I've gone through a similar time myself.      Stay calm, be mature and talk to him about it.  Whatever you do, keep your cool.  You'll know soon enough by his reaction.    And, the old saying applies...if you love something, let it go, if it was meant to be, it will come back to you.    You don't deserve to live like this, in this constant fear.  Take care of yourself hun, and remember....while you're spending time on this, who knows....there could be someone else out there waiting to meet you...and start a relationship where you no longer have to fear cheating and worry about horrible things like that.    Good luck!

AA10351134	Most candy is actually shipped two-day air if it's at all perishable, so you will get your candy quickly after ordering it. The beginning of March should give you plenty of time. Don't stress too much about not having the right candy, because candy is very flexible ... even if you're trying to match colors and your dream candy online got backordered, you can find a lot of good substitutions locally. Hit the holidays too if they match your colors, there are great sales after christmas, valentine's day, st. patricks etc.     The main thing like you said is to have enough. Also, be sure you have someone on hand to refill containers as they empty out. Put your extra candy under the table or someplace accessible. Sometimes venues will manage the refills for you, but otherwise you need a reliable helper to oversee it. And finally, have a plan in place so there is some control over when guests hit the candy. You probably don't want your table ransacked and barren before your first dance.|`|dUqgiKBPaa	i just changed my date to may 16, it was the 23 but it turns out it is memorial day weekend that week..sad..anyways i am having a candy buffet and my wedding and i got a list of all my candies and what website i want to get them at, all the vases and organza bags for the candy but i havent ordered the candy yet..most candies will stay good over a period of time and you definatley want it a while in advance just incase you know an i am thinking march would be a good time. that gives you time to decide what goes where and how you want it set up, what kind of bags you want to use for sure, what candy you want in each vase and that!! also it gives you time to add some stuff!!    make sure if you ordered gummies and stuff that goes hard you dont open it too soon!! and hide it :) you dont want your bothers and sister cousins nieces or nephews or heck even your fiance ;) to find it and eat it! anyways good luck congrats
kSlN7MjEaa	You are gay because that is the way you are.  Have you told your parents?  You dont say if you have or not or how old you are.  Look, some parents are very upset but they get over it, some parents will disown you , some parents will try to change you to be heterosexual because they think there is something wrong with you.  If your parents know and have rejected you they may come round in time, some parents never do. You are the same person whether you are gay or straight  its not your fault.  You need to see a (gay) counsellor for some support.  Come back again and give some more information so we can help you more.|`|tYhkdr63aa	is this a joke?  such an undetailed question.  idk why you're gay.  if you are gay then it's because it's natural, or maybe you're just bi.     if you dont want to be bi, then don't get high or drink acohol, it will fuel your bisexual courage.    if you're straight homosex, then that's what you are you gotta live with it.  hide it from your parents if they're really tight assed.  if they're open  then tell them eventually.  \    Go to college, college people are more open minded. get a good job.  higher class places will accept you more openly.|`|BwNoWmQ0aa	I don't know why you are gay. Does anybody every really know. As for you parents they love you, but don't understand you. And if you wonder why you are gay, how can you expect them to understand. I understand some people just have a hard time accepting it, especially men. Good luck and don't be so hard on yourself. You have chosen a  lifestyle that is hard for some people to accept.|`|MxOURY0Gaa	Your gay because you chose to be.  And YES your parents should/will always love you.    idk if you a christain.. but if you are and you don't wanna be gay then just pray to God.
t2R3mEMoaa	No you won't get her fired as she is protected under union laws. However if you want to have a meeting with her, don't have it alone. I would suggest with the principal. Have you talked to your parents about this? You really need to do this first. At the very least you are getting a complex that will affect your life and your studies. This needs to be dealt with as soon as possible.  Remember one thing about all this, it is her issue not yours, even though she is trying to dump it on you! Good luck!|`|AA11263103	just ask her before after school and talk to her.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	talk to the head of the science department about her, (that is if it isn't her). If they don't help, talk to a counslor if they don't help, go to the principal.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	She may be picking on you because you show her some kind of expression or reaction. Your goal is to control what you show on the outside. You need to turn this situation around.  If she pulls you up for some kind of demonstration, clown around some to let her know that you aren't going to get offended.  If you clown enough, she won't want to lose classroom time so won't pick on you. See if you can make the unwanted attention subside.    Next thing would be to type up a very businesslike letter and have your parents sign it... with one copy going to the principal and another to the teacher. In the letter, you simply state that in picking on kids based on size, this unwanted attention is an issue and also making the classroom a negatively charged environment. Since it is chemistry, and not biology or genetics, there is no reason to point at physical differences in her classroom.

You really need to grow up.  I hope your parents all ground your nasty little selves and that you learn a lesson from it.    How would you like it if someone did that to you?  You wouldn't and you'd be bitching and moaning about it.    About time to own up that you're juvenile behaviour just shows how childish you really are.    Disgusting.|`|LYDVekF1aa	you should just be honest and admit what you did. if you lie they will end up finding out in the end anyways. so in my opinion it is just better to be honest, even though it's not probably not gonna be good. say you are sorry for what you did.     hope everything works out!|`|RjF7TmvTaa	good hope you get expelled.   ******
cLkA2nihaa	I made a burn book too once, trust me, there are a lot of people who deserve the insults, but keep it at home, the day when someone saw it who shouldn't have, I brought it home and left it there, the teacher questioned me about it, but none saw what it said, so there was no proof of anything, I just shrugged it off saying me and my friends just wanted to see what people would say, like if they'd think they were in it, well she believed me, and im free.     What I think you should do, well, your parents are usually on your side, and you weren't the only one, they are less harsh to a group, and really, your excuse would be, it was private, i didn't hurt her feelings because she wasn't supposed to see it, if she didn't go looking at your book, she wouldnt have gotten insulted. So yeah. Just excuse as well as you can .Oh yeah, next time, dont write names on it. ;]|`|Nngdk0izaa	That was a mistake; humans aren't made to NOT be in sticky situations. You and your friends shouldn't have brought the burn book or even made it in the first place, so you guys faced the consequences, right? Even if you feel doomed, getting in trouble is to teach you not to do it again. But looking on the positive side, this situation is just adding up to make you reach for the expectations you set for yourself and is preparing you for adulthood. I've been in pretty bad situations and never did it again afterwards. But you'll learn from it.|`|QpDvSo9vaa	It depends on what you said about this girl. If it is just a rude attack on her I would say sorry. But if this girl is a total b!+ch and you have had bad experience with her tell whoever that the talks to much stuff and you needed revenge

N2xzSXosaa	I don't know.  This guys seems pretty sketchy.  I think you should save yourself the pain and just let him go.  Don't worry about what he tries to make you think because you know in your heart that you aren't the one in the wrong.  It seems almost like you're a rebound for him. He keeps coming back to you when he has nobody else, and the criticism is just to keep you around... to make you feel like you need him and he needs you.  This is just my two cents though.    I hope things work out for the best, either way.    Best wishes!|`|tL2U34kraa	i totally agree with physco barbie , don't let him treat you like that, that's crap,he is just using you and tell him how you feel and tell him he has lost your trust and if he is serous about wanting to get back together for you make him work to gain your trust back, if he wont then tell him hit the road!|`|5ed1y0uuaa	He was seeing some other girl, and she dumped him.

Reverse cowboy.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Doggy style or you on top.He could also eat you out b4 sex.That feels really great and he would be able to get you off where the size wouldn't really matter.

It's the only way.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Im gonna answer and hope i dont get violated! I will try to use words found in any medical or biology text.    Try with u on top cos then u can rub your clitoris on his pelvic bone or try with him from behind with u or him rubbing your clitoris. Vibration devices on ur clitoris while he is inside is good. It also depends on whether u are vaginally orgasmic or not. If not then it shouldnt be too hard to find a position that allows for clitoris stimulation. Men dont always get this and may need help or showing. Penis size is irrelevant if they know how to make u orgasm.    It now sounds so clinical and not fun. Just replace medical terms with whatever slang u'd like. Cheers!    Geez people, u make her sound like some cavernous gulf. Some men are just small! You can do all the exercises u want to tighten it up but if its small, its small!!!|`|utBFEjAzaa	What downstairs are you talking about|`|91sBjTtAaa	get an Extension|`|VfuCXCRAaa	Any type of Rear entry position such as doggie style will make the most of what he has....aslo if your on top will shorten your vagina and he will be able to hit your spot easier!

If you want a man or woman to sprung off you this is what you do....

aC9dBaNqaa	I definitely say that he is not over you that is why he told his g/f to wait at the counter and he kept making all types of motions to get you attention and when that didn't work he called you anyway that was very rude how he treated her I can't tell you to give it another try because he do however have another g/f which says that he has moved on|`|Nlo0gQKXaa	i think he walked in the middle of the room that way his girl wudn see him txtn u..and ya that is rude..but i mean obviously it sounds like he hasnt gotten over u..and if u still like theres something there go for it..but if you dont wana go back to that..lik bcuz he treated u wrong or something..then just stay away from him..me and this one guy broke up and he was a complete asshole like he treated me all wrong..but i mean i still liked him..and even after we broke up i still did..and i couldnt stop thinkin about him..he still tried to get me back..but i just stayed away..and eventually i forgot about him and now i dont even remember why i like him soo much..so if you think its not worth it..like he aint gona treat u rite..just stay away..and trust me those weird feelings will go away.|`|71LeWL4waa	he still likes you hes trying to get u jealous =)

lmESBQb7aa	Personally, I would suggest not singing. The reason is that you may cry inbetween, and we all know, it is very hard to sing whilst crying. I would suggest something that takes a little less effort, and can be done while crying (a poem).

There's also a song by the Gaithers, I don't know the name of it, but you might know it...it's about going to sleep & waking in the arms of God.  It's a beautiful song, was sung at my Dad's funeral who was a minister.

JjTinVMSaa	are you getting married were little caylee died omg this is so sad have a great wedding though|`|XpUznHtfaa	yes I know of a great couple, check them out at http://studio28photography.blogspot.com/
jAGwyyuyaa	The best thing to do is stay out of it. Even if she ask you to get involved. She not going to believe you any ways. She is going to have to find out for herself before she will believe anything. And I would have to say, sooner or later she will get to her breaking point. Everyone has one. Then she will have to make the decision that's right for her. But it has to be her finding out and it has to be her making the decision. All you can do is listen and be there for her. But she must love him and keeps hoping he will change or she would not be with him after one time. That's not going to happen, because she has let him get away with it.|`|AA11356977	Stay out of it and focus on what your own husband is doing. Or is it you he is txting????|`|0VBESmFQaa	Depends man,What kind of spell? are you using voodoo or wicca? more details please|`|xLYxfVrZaa	Going through the same thing myself, I actually took her to another town to catch him in the act, and somehow he talked his way out of it.  All of our mutual friends know he does it and I think deep down she does to, but she wont listen to reason, so what do you do?|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	you can't do anything if she refuses to see it.  you already know what the signs are, from experience. she has to wise-up. all you can do is tell her and leave it at that.|`|XmudUg2aaa	I'm assuming you are a guy.....I don't get why people think you are a woman.    Be her friend, but stay out of her relationship from now on.     If she wants to talk to you about  it....that's up to you.    On one end I say don't let her go there because she didn't believe you when you tried to give her a heads up and you were being a good friend.    But on the other end I say be a shoulder to lean on when she finally gets over her denial and starts seeing the truth for what it is.    Either way...good luck and don't meditate on their problems or you will become stressed out.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Sweetie, she's in denial. She doesn't want to believe anything. Even if you spelled it out.., she would still avoid the truth.   I found underwear, a belt, a cell phone... in my Envoy... none of which belonged to me or my X. I told my friends & they said the obvious...   It still took me another year & a half before I had the proof slapped in my face... then he confessed.   In my case, I wanted to believe our vows were sacred & that he would never betray them... she's had how many chances to wake up? Think about it. She doesn't like being the fool, but she isn't willing to change her lifestyle. Money..I know women that have been cheated, lied to, & everything else for YEARS. They won't leave. The money.   Email me....|`|dGBbFwFWaa	there isnt worst blind than the one who doesnt want to see... your friend already knows he is cheating and she will allow it cause she loves him.. she isnt ready to move on with out him.. at this point all u can do is be there for her when she realizes that her husband will never change or have respect for her....sometimes people act when they get tired of being played.. good luck|`|1ff8b378b0e1b6fdc2b8061f2adcd5cbaa	She knows the deal and is making excuses for him  Until the time she herself is tired of the situation you are not going to be able to convince her not to put up with it.    Each time she brings the situation to you;I would have a pat answer;  "I am sure you will do what's best for you", etc, etc...    I also would not involve myself in her marital business any further.    she seems to be the type who ONLY wants to emote but not take action.    If YOU take action or suggest action beyond what she is willing to do, you will continue to be the bad guy.    Think I would say a silent prayer for her and extricate myself from her situation.    Some women LOVE drama and will immerse themselves in it.    She should be trying to get counseling to determine for herself if her marriage can be saved..it is not your call.    Hang out more with those with less drama, YOU cannot save her.(them)|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	There's nothing you can, or should, do.    This is between them. You've already given her the evidence, now it's up to her to take the next step.     All you can do is be there for her if she needs to talk about it.|`|79eBn6V8aa	you need to mind your own business|`|EauDxTOKaa	do oyu know for a fact hes cheating,, can you prove it tpo her.. THEN TELL HER   chances are she wont believe you and then thats her issue to worry about,,,    but if youre her friend,, yuoll tell her    unless hes cheating with YOU|`|15c65c9e8add677224c2ca33da13498aaa	Tell her if she is suspects him cheating he is and then don't walk away RUN. Cause if she will not leave or believe it have done all you can.|`|ztxaXbaKaa	if u already told ur friend and she didn take it well then leave her be    it will solve itself but when it does shes gonna need a friend to talk to    i think from now n u should keep out of it :D|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Sounds like he's trying to cheat but hasn't actually cheated.    It is never a good idea to get involved between married people. It always turns out badly and you will get the blame.    Best to tell her to trust her instincts and that you will be there if she needs you,|`|AueAwhQeaa	Mind your own business maybe.|`|3secB3Smaa	You already did the wrong thing by getting involved in the first place. Stay out of it and away from them.|`|3b0iEteqaa	NOTHING!!-let her find out on her own--and support emotionally whenever she needs you.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	we can always see so much clearer from outside looking in. I know you are trying, but the best thing to do is just be there for your friend. She made her decision to stay and you have to (as a friend) support that (or at least live with it). When and if she decides to go, it has to be her choice and she will be 100% ready to go. It will happen, sooner or later, trust me on this. The more you push, the more interfering you are doing (at least that is how the husband sees it and that makes things worse at home for your friend - it is much easier to cut things off with you and try harder with him). It is psychological (on both husband and wife), he is a controlling bastard and she doesnt know how to live without that right now. Just be there for her, she will thank you later for it.    good luck to all of you
Q5BM2POnaa	I think she needs help.  Maybe not full blown rehab, but at least some counseling from an addiction expert.    Clearly she is able to function, but that doesn't mean she's not an alcoholic.    For your kids sake, you should take action and not just hope it goes away.|`|WtNW8HcPaa	It sounds like your wife may have a problem but she is doing her best to conceal it from you right now. If she really does have a serious problem then it will reveal itself in time - it gets harder to conceal as the addiction gets worse. However, since you have 2 small children at home you can't really run the risk of waiting for the problem to reveal itself; you need to do what you feel is right to protect those children.   In a case like this I would go with your gut instinct. I think you probably know that she does have a problem, but the thought of dealing with the problem might be a little overwhelming - like who will watch the kids while you are at work, where to take your wife to get help, will she go to get help, etc.   The best advice I can give you is, don't ignore the problem. My mother ignored my fathers addictions for years - and after many years it finally took it's toll on both of them and it became one huge, unmanagable mess - but things can go downhill much quicker than you think.   It sounds like you have already tried talking with her - and even if you did try talking with her again it doesn't sound like she is ready to admit she has a problem.   Have you ever thought about having one of those Nanny cameras installed? Maybe you might want to think about getting one so you can keep an eye on what's going on at home. Have a neighbor come over to check on her while you are at work. Talk with the children - ask them if they noticed anything different about your wife's behavior.   Just go with your gut for your children's sake...|`|15c65c9e8add677224c2ca33da13498aaa	This is gonna seem harsh. However for the SAKE OF YOUR KIDS!! Get them move out and tell her you can not continue wondering, worrying, and waiting for the phone call that something has happened. She needs help and needs it now. Cause here is the thing also if you know she has a problem and something happens to the kids while she is under the influence. Both of you can get into trouble!! So just lay it out to her straight as an arrow no BS. Tell her to get some help or else.|`|9KMPOJf3aa	I agree with the first person...she may or may not be a full-blown alcoholic, but she definitely needs help. How long can you go if you're worried about the safety of your children when they're with their MOTHER?!
fY68d3mAaa	call a lawyer and sue him for the money, then get away from him. you dont want to be around someone who strangled one of the other women he was in a relationship with.
NqbBjS0raa	Hey don't put so much thought into it. Let that world come natural and learn on the go. Let your head tilt a bit and let your lips press firm and enjoy the kiss. Let her put her part into it and both of you will enjoy each others taste and the rest is history. Too much mind work is a bad thing and let the emotions charge the experience. So nice and pleasant you will wonder why you don't do this more often.... lol : )|`|cKeghBi7aa	it does come naturally  and you dont need to prove to other people that you dont like him  if you have to do that then you prob do like him a little bit|`|5poK95JFaa	people don't usually plan kisses. it should me spontaneous. no to the last question.|`|tmfhieP7aa	well it will come naturally. the first time you kiss you arent going to be making out (i assume..) so just pucker up and kiss. you dont have to open your mouth or use tongue. it will be natural.    and about the other guy, just don't flirt with him or lead him on in any sort of way.|`|MsSHhX8zaa	You're friend's right...your first kiss just comes naturally. Your hormones and natural instinct take over and you know exactly what to do.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	well everyones different when they kiss so i cant tell you "how you" kiss. but if you act like you like the guy then i would just be carful becase if you really dont u need to stop for the guy u dooo like.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	never talk about him in a sexual way or romantic way or any way|`|uKYPmVG0aa	first kiss with this guy leave tounge for second date have fun with it give him a little nibble on the bottom lip but not too hard. maybe put ur hand on his inner thigh or run ur fingers through his hair but if he has short hair stroke his face slowly.  and just shut out this other guy permenately for like 2 months.|`|JQCqrpqnaa	your first kiss is a moment you will remember for the rest of your life. you want to make sure its not something you'll regret later on or be embarrassed about. make sure you're in your comfort zone and if the time is right, you'll both just know and you'll see it in each others eyes and you'll feel it in your heart. just dont do anything you arent ready for. first kisses can be like the beginning of the rest of your life. what you do then could affect you forever. dont let him pressure you into doing more either. a simple "i like you" kiss is normally what your first kiss is. mine was at our county fair. it was beautiful with all the lights of the ferris wheel and other rides in the backround. that was over 2 years ago and now im 17 and im still with that same guy today. he's wonderful to me and i just knew then that he was going to be.     also, about the other guy. if you are friends with him, you need to set him straight. tell him (discretly) that you are such great friends, JUST friends and dont lead him on by sending him flirty texts or IM's.    good luck with your first kiss! i hope you have a great experience like i did :)
AA11967247	leaving with nothing would seem to appear more as guilt than good will.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	While I commend you for being so sensitive to his feelings, there comes a point where something has to be done. You cannot stay with someone if they or you are not willing to make the marriage work.  Separating/divorcing now would be difficult because of the economy however it can be done with some compromises (i.e temporarily giving up some toys or ammenities that are not necessary right now, downsizing, etc)|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Divorcing without taking anything is actually the nicest thing you can do, even though he is going to be hurt about the divorce. However, don't be shocked if he retaliates and tries to go after you for something.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Seriously,Talk to him because that is the right thing to do|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Well, you have my respect.    NO I am NOT kidding.    This kind of woman is a BLESSING,   and you deserve to know it.    The fact that you care about HIM SO MUCH that you want to not ruin everything for him is highly commendable.    Personally, I don't believe in "soulmates".I believe the best you will find in this world is  " a mate". And that's if you are doing very well. Comedian Chris Rock shares this opinion too.    Chasing "happiness" is the surest way to never find it.    If you are truly CONTENT - happiness will sure follow.    Do what makes you CONTENT.    This does not "SOUND" as good as the "soulmate happy ending"  But anyone can tell you....    "HAPPY ENDINGS ARE JUST STORIES THAT HAVEN'T FINISHED YET." - Angelina Jolie.|`|onbwN4csaa	I assume that when you got married that at that time you thought  that you had found you soul mate. What happen to that. Ask yourself.  How will you know. that the next ( soul mate ) you meet wont be the same thing all over again.    It always LOOKS GREENER on the other side of the fence. Until you get there and realize what you thought was green.  Was really just a small clump of grass.  Rethink it.|`|79eBn6V8aa	How do you even know you have a soulmate.  I'm 38 and I haven't found one yet.  I dont think one exists.  So, not only will you be broke and homeless, you may end up alone as well.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	first you need to realize that divorce hurts all parties involved. if that's what you choose, then he is going to be hurt. that's a reality.    i guess the question is, what is the quality of the marriage? is it so bad that you dont see "working on it" as an option? when you got married, did you think your husband was your soulmate? if you believed that he was your soulmate, then i would see if there is a way you could work on the marriage. if you just married without believing he was "the one", then moving on may be the best option.
RsAhiIuxaa	wow 8 months go by and u want 2 fix it now??  if i were her i would think u used her 2,  i dont know if u can fix it, but u were firnds with her 4 2 years i wouldnt  give up on it yet talk 2 her some more apolagize keep explaing! tell other ppl 2 give her a message shell come around     good luck with everything, but next time dont make the same mistake, ok?!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	your big mistake was ignoring her for those 2 weeks. it made you look like a manipulator. 8 months go by and now you're thinking about how to fix it? i wouldn't want a friend like you. you used her.

OR u can simply ask her if she has a problem with u  i ALWAYS ask my friends that if they give me a reason to.  good luck.
0azvQnhyaa	don't freak out, when girls are really close friends with guys they will tell them their emotional problems so you might think shes flirting with you and she might but she might be subconsciously like without knowing she is, she might think you two are just giggling and joking around as friends and saying she's sick of guys yeah of course shes going to say that after she broke up with a guy.    She will say that to you because your her closest friend, your acting like your just some guy to her. but you have to remember you guys are friends she Will tell you that stuff always. she might always act like this. and I don't think that shes going to tell you who she likes because no girl will ever tell another guys who she likes unless she wants a hookup. so obviously she just wants to keep it to herself and see if he's the right one. if you turn out to be that guy then congrats but if you don't, then don't' be made just remember that when they break up you'll still be there. you'll never be thrown away by her, you'll always have a second chance. THOSE GUYS wont.|`|l344RtC8aa	maybe it's ment to be, she might like you back or you just might getting confused with your own feelings. you might love her but not be in love with her. think about it for a while before doing anything drastic. if you really feel like you like her more than a BEST friend, then why not go for it. if she doesnt feel the same atleast she'll be your best friend. there isnt much to lose just a big gain!  good luck!!!:):):):)|`|4SQx8smEaa	You are just going to have to grow a pair and ask her.|`|Bt3Hvh5Saa	she likes u|`|St0bKidyaa	Okay, girls flirt it's in our nature but it sounds like she MIGHT like you, or she might like someone that isn't at your school, or in your grade. If she has any friends that are girls that she would tell who she liked ask them in a regular conversation don't make it seem like you REALLY want to know your just making conversation. And if they say she does like someone ask if the boy goes to your school if they say yes, then it's most likely you. You could even just tell her you like her and see what she says but then you might not have her as a best friend if she doesn't like you like that.|`|jpycHuPNaa	If she touches or looks at you alot then she might like you. Some times the eyes can tell you alot, just try to notice her body language and if she is paying attention to everything you do. cus if she is then shes definitely aware of you and hopefully does like you.    Best way to know is by telling her and here is how :  I don't think it would ruin the relationship if you were to say "Hey so I've been getting some vibes that you like me... do you?" and if she goes no then just play it off and go " thats cool I just wanted to make sure." it doesn't have to be weird at all.     good luck...I tried my best to help|`|DOZMBzFTaa	WOW! you should just ask her out if you want to...that is a crazy story man...good luck! =0|`|HcjCdLehaa	Wow. I have the same problem right now. There's a guy that I am friends with, he asked me out in the past and I turned him down because I didn't like him, I do now, But I am worried that he's moved on, but if he hasn't he'll still want to go out and I am not ready for that kind of thing...Anyway, sometimes you just have to risk a good friend ship. If you don't try, you'll never know.|`|85nPMEC2aa	i would try and ask one of her friends...  or if you really want to know maybe tell her how you feel like in a compliment  or in something of that nature see how she reaccts if she blushes and seems happy  then i would believe she likes you|`|UTDAZ9sZaa	base everything on the reaction at the dance. Watch how she dances with you- is it close? fast songs?slow songs? is she dancing with other guys?   Does she hang out with you the whole night or does she take off to hang with other ppl.  its normal for her to be chatting with her chicky friends, but if she goes to dance with those " other guys" shes just your friend.  Don't know what kind of dance it is, but dress sharp. If you don't know what to wear ask her to the mall ( even if you do know what to wear).. get her to pick out the shirt ( girls will do this any giving day no matter who the guy- they love to shop) Shell dress you the way she finds you most attractive.   She may be playin' head games, but you have to understand that she may be feeling the water out too.    Have fun at the dance!  hope this helps!|`|JPcFDfMaaa	The person she has a crush on is most likely you. She probably wants you to make the first move to be in a relationship. Good luck!

2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	For all the good reasons, you can remind that person what they had, get some booty without the feeling "shown", its really great.     BUT BE CAREFUL, while all this is great to a certain degree, very bad things can happen, suppose you fall back in love or get the wrong sign, you'll be crushed to pieces, she could get hurt. You'll exit a relationship and leave it messed up beyond repair. Doing all this really isn't for the rookie. Theres a lot of situations, problems, to consider before doing this. I would go back and change what i did, but its too late for me.  But it always ends terribly. They always do. USE YOUR SIXTH SINCE AND BEST JUDGEMENT.|`|SHAXHelXaa	Personally, I love it, and feel it's great (but I use 'em)|`|TSO8rQLnaa	thats really not a good idea. Tell him without the sex  Please answer mine|`|72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	Having sex with my ex.. also my first love after breaking up with him ended up ruining my life.. now im one of those girls that have all kinds of emotional baggage...  i got pregnant.. had a misscarriage.. we tried to work things out but he kept cheating... drama drama.. i could talk about for days... like i said.. now i have bags that im trying to unpack.. i wouldnt do it again..|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	If you get along with the ex and both of you are single, AND both of you understand that it is JUST SEX, than it can be a super awesome thing. I mean, its a person who already knows you sexually, its good sex, you know that they are clean, and it doesn't make your 'number' go up LOL    Then again, that's in a perfect world. This probably only happens successfully, without someone getting feelings for the other, about 1% of the time. But when it happens right, its damn good [and convenient] :)|`|uBJokWtuaa	This varies person to person. I've done this many times and had no problems. But I have a friend who attempted to have no strings relationships with her ex and it really blew up in her face.|`|aNdXegnjaa	Well it made me think that we would get back together..    but then he said we should stop it all because it "wasn't right" but said even though he still wanted to it was best we didnt see each other or talk because it always ends up in sex.    So I dunno. I miss him but he confuses me.|`|AA10986891	My filosofy is don't poo where you eat and if aint broke don't fix it.|`|dn4z7grYaa	go for it! have you never had ex-sex? its the bomb! as long as its mutual and just a one off! happy bonking!|`|TfAxeV3Maa	I've only done it once..that's how my son was conceived..true story|`|fWq45EOGaa	I still would consider that "using". I mean, if you don't want a relationship then why still fool around?  One person is still going to care more than the other and its usually the girl. I think its a bad idea and would not do it. You don't want to be second best!! Hope this helps. Good luck!
FdfE8iMEaa	While getting flowers makes women happy, getting some from an ex who broke up with them is sending mixed signals and would probably have a negative effect on her.|`|euOtDB3Baa	I'm not the mushy, girlie type, but something on v-day would be cool just to know that not only are you still out there but still think about her.  So yeah, what have you got to lose?  And it's not like you're worried about her taking it the wrong way, because you want to get back together, right?  Well, I'd go for it, because if she is with someone else now, then maybe she'll think twice about you and think that the separation was a mistake.  But even if it's not flowers, it can't hurt to send something...anything.  It's a lot more serious than just texting.
5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	You don't need some random women's opinions of you - just be yourself.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	your girlfriend    wait trolls cant date they are always locked home inside|`|K5BLCZPkaa	wow.

Tn52aL3Zaa	put on some high heels darling.  You'll beable to walk like "us" in no time!|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Back straight, Swing your hips a bit when you walk, not too much, just a little|`|CaqxJS0Qaa	I am a woman and I can't even walk that great. Maybe you should try wearing some high heels. That is supossed to help.
fMEypXDYaa	So young and already ready to give up on yourself, why don't you do something about your low self esteem and lose the weight and get a better attitude about yourself? If you don't feel like a hottie, then your not one, if you feel that your a hottie then your one, it is as simple as that sweetie. No body is going to make you change, for that you have to want to change, so start working on it. You'll start feeling better about yourself soon enought, just takes time is all.|`|Y08YLysXaa	lol 10 lbs. I've gained 50 and I'm 21 geez. Maybe you have a body image problem, because 10 lbs is nothing and 18 is practically child whereas 22 is just becoming an adult... old?! Be fit and healthy, apart from that I would advise counselling or something...|`|XmudUg2aaa	Please don't post stuff like this.    YOU are old and bloated at 22?!!!    So I guess after 1 kid and turning 29 this summer....I'm a veritable crone.     You are still a kid....trust me.    Look me up when you are 52 and going through menopause.|`|91sBjTtAaa	it sucks i feel the same my bf tells me i look good and should be happy|`|p6QizgmRaa	We all feel old and bloated at times.

Live life to the fullest.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Too funny...wait until you're my age...I can gain ten pounds just by inhaling!    Stop obsessing over yourself to get attention.
fFBFDIpSaa	I hate it when a guy talks about other girls disrespectfully, saying things like...    "Yeah, I fingered her," or "I'd do anal with her!"    It's just GROSS and IGNORANT and DISGUSTING. I hate that. Plus, I don't want a guy trying to hug me when I don't want it. I hate it when a guy just tries to hug me.     Also, I think the guy should be the one to pay for the meal, unless specifically saying that they'll do dutch before the date starts, so I can get ready.    Of course, I've never actually dated anyone else but my boyfriend, and I have NEVER come across these problems with him, but I I've come across them with other people, and it bugs me!|`|dbaPuwv4aa	Turn offs are definitely greasy hair and  when guys act totally different depending  on where you are and who you are with.  Another bad thing guys do is when they  get really clingy and find a need to text  you all the time and call you way too  much, unless the girl is into that kind of  stuff. It's cute though if you're on a date  with a guy somewhere, and he actually  pays attention to you, and makes eye  contact when you're talking. It's horrible  when a guy is easily distracted when a  girl is talking, personally it makes me  rather mad, haha.    What makes me wanna be with a guy  is when he acts like he likes me, and  holds my hand. But I can also just hang  out with him like best friends and we can  tease each other but know we're both  kidding. It's also cute if you're at the movies  and the girl gets cold, and the boy pulls the  girl closer and puts his jacket over her without  her complaining about being cold. My boyfriend  did that once without even realizing it, it was  adorable. It's also really cute when a guy  kisses me on the forehead or the cheek, and  isn't all up in my girl tryin to make out with me  everywhere we go and doesn't always wanna  get in my pants. It's totally a turn off when guys  are too horny and always wanna get some.    I hope that helped a bit =]|`|Fi5Hh6Eqaa	wanting to see me everyday  asking too many questions  talking too much  not giving me space in general    and the whole lot     i agree with elle|`|ZwDdYnM5aa	I don't like them to gossip about people...not have any table manners...offer to pay the check or at least half of it.    Be A GENTLEMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IUOomveYaa	don't be mean to us, don't tell stupid jokes, don't be try hardy, and  ways that we want to be with you is buy us flowers and chocolates, open the door for us, help us with things, and be nice to us.hope this helped.|`|a6zhcq5Kaa	when your not your self play it cool act like your around your girl all the time don't front because your friends are around|`|94NYYq5Haa	wanting to see me everyday  asking too many questions  talking too much  not giving me space in general|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	When I go on dates with guys. Its when I'm trying to get to know him about his personality or what  his are hobbies and what not. I don't like it when it becomes about past relationships or sex or when it comes quite between the two of us. I like it when a guy keeps on a conversation, keeps me interested. I like a guy that ask questions in getting to know me not my past relationships.   What makes me want to  be with a guy is, Is his personality, where his goals are in life and if he wants to share that with a partner, I like it when a guy carries him self well and shows respect.|`|dalNxu8zaa	he is just plain rude or ignores me when he is with his friends|`|q791er1naa	Cheesy remarks and come ons.  A guy who is self-serving in bed, or has no ambition or career.|`|wAoNbpVlaa	well im not dating anybody but i hate when a guy tells you one thing but does another, like he comes off to you like hes interested in you and says all theses things. Then he turns around and tries to pretend like nothing happened, and the girl if kind just left there confused,used, and disappointed. Its happened to me before and it just really made me mad and little hurt, i think any guy shouldnt tell a girl he likes her if he really doesn't cause its just not fair to that person because they might be looking for more when the other one isn't.|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	I don't like guys who try too hard, like crack stupid jokes every second...I love confident guys, biiig turn on,  but not cocky.  Cocky is a big turn off...I dunno what else, I know there's more.  I like dates that just feel natural, and nothing feels forced or fake.  I love knowing that I feel comfortable and so does my date.....and that's all I could think of..|`|hPBMwEr5aa	I HATE when a guy is silent. why are you on a date if your silent!? It's kind of a guys job to keep a conversation oing atkeats half of the time!    I love when guys tell stories ask questions and are funny!|`|Xe6XVvf5aa	well good thing about my man are he makes me laugh all the time even when is being totally ridiculous....things i hate...well acting like a woman in bed so stupid grow up be a man. yelling over the littlest thing..no taking more time out for the kids.|`|JmFXJ7dUaa	i hate when he told me not to talk or hang with some other guy friends and we were just friends. when he was with his friends he would be so mean... and then he turns around and has mood swings. u ask him what is wrong he flips out. then he is a jerk to u for 2 weeks so u break up with him and then he yells u say i am sorry he wants to get back with u...  well u know the normal....lol|`|MFzG3eRdaa	I don't like it when a guy is always talking about his ex girlfriend or always talking about sex. Me myself haven't had my first kiss, so me and my man sometimes talk about us kissing, but we never have yet. I don't like guys that ignore you or if they are embarrassed with you in public, certain ways. I like guys that tell you they love you when you are having a bad day and that call you when your sick.|`|obeyAb2Paa	When they try to sound smarter than they actually are, esp. when they has no clue on the subject that is being discussed, when they call and talk about nothing....for hours! Please dont waste a girls time. When their laugh is more girly than manly, when they talk in baby talk..I could pretty much go on and on haha
cKeghBi7aa	25-27|`|AA11656721	I Got married at 20 years old.  It was difficult for me the first three years because I thought I was mature enough and ready.  But I still needed to learn so much.  I had to grow up fast for we had a child right away.  So my suggestion is to get married when you are ready emotionally, financially, and past the bloom of youth.  So basically after 25!|`|8N5Fw9TGaa	i would at 24 out of college nd already settling down but onli if shes truely the one nd worth it|`|3603287cb8bb125cf57dbe9352c71868aa	I got married at 20.

RluCMVUSaa	My aunt did... it was too confusing, my cousin and I would ask for permission to do something only to come home and find that we were in big trouble for not telling my "aunt" what we were doing, then we had to explain and depending on who you got at that point it could go well or not so well    But, yes, stranger danger, stranger danger!    I am confused too EOS, I don't know who is who or what is what!  Return the sanity!|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Multiple personalities????...     I'm hoping to find somebody with just one. Though it must be fun to argue with yourself.|`|6U9b2t4raa	yes...I used to date a girl with multiple personalities..one day a nymph, the next day a lesbian, the next a butch ditch digger, etc.     Very, very disturbing and difficult to plan dates.   I would get all excited for a date with the nymph, and the ditch digger would answer the door.  Bummer.|`|LDv4dqLraa	Yes, my uncle. He is a dirty rotten scoundrel. He has made his millions by scamming people out of their fortunes and is a master of disguise which he uses constantly in his cons.

Of course, to all that know him he is a perfectly typical English aristocrat but to his victims he is a completely different person.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	many and no, they usually do not pop in and out|`|7fAHPUkkaa	yes, one day a virgin the next a carpenters dream, flat as a board easy to nail|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	yeah mie lol nah um my cousin has like different names 4 herself when she getz drunk or is mad and stuff like dat itz actually funny !!|`|qdPtCBJeaa	When you dont know who youre talking to?

Hmmm.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	If you asked my husband he would say I am it..so apparently I have met myself. LOL!|`|Stwj8CRmaa	Yes it is confusing and I agree with you a 100% too .
CD5JsjxKaa	are you intending to be mean? if your intentions were such then yes it would be mean, but obviously your hearts in the right place. and i agree with you in that i don't agree with what goes on at bachelorette parties either.     bridal showers are a different matter and i encourage them too! so your head's in the right place!!     of course... it goes both ways so i suppose you're not having a bachelors party either right?|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Don't worry about it. She's going to marry you in the end, so what's there to worry about? You don't want to show her that you're insecure, that's not a good way to begin your lives. Insecurity of one spouse over the other is a major burden; a burden that will tire you. Avoid it at all costs.|`|y21VcTjDaa	You're TELLING her????    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...    Yeah, good luck with that.|`|AA10949869	If you are having a bachelor party she can have a bachelorette party, period. If you don't want her to have a bachelorette party then you can't have a bachelor party either.|`|NQq7xykxaa	You could let her have a party but just be there with some of the other ladys guys so ya'll can keep a eye on things, you wouldn't want her to get to wild right before marriage.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Those are two completely different things, by the way.  The bachelorette party is just a last hoorah!  If you trust your fiance, then you should really have no problem with letting her go out and have some fun. If your opposed to certain aspects, like a stripper, communicate that to her, and I'm sure that she will respect your wishes.  Don't get off to a bad foot with marriage and telling your wife what she can and cannot do...|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Are you planning on having a bachelor party?  If so, then you can't object to hers.|`|wPbXzJhdaa	Oh come on.. let her have one last great time as an unmarried woman with her friends. If she truly loves you she won't do anything that would really upset you.|`|d438f82d0b371074f4c4697b007e1a08aa	dont get married if you're so insecure.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You can't start out a marriage with "I'm telling you what to do" kinds of things. You better tell her your opinion and hope she takes it into consideration.|`|297db89d6d1cac02a4d8ff6ef9c32e64aa	You are so insecure. I feel sorry for your wife. If you're going down this path, you'll end up in divorce. Guaranteed|`|fHJcGAyTaa	You're controlling and insecure, she should get out now.|`|AH9i63ydaa	It's only mean if you're having a bachelor party with all the "kind of stuff that can go on at parties like that."  If she's cool with your terms, then it's ok.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	Why is it when a woman doesn't want her man to have a bachelor party it's ok, but when a man doesn't want the wife to do it there's a problem? It's just as normal for women to mess around at these things as men, so why are men the only insecure and controlling ones? It's not really mean, maybe unfair if you're having a bachelor party. Maybe have an understanding, no strippers or males period. No strippers or women at yours, that's fair.     It's really a matter of personal values. If you just don't like those kind of parties and it has nothing to do with insecurity then it's something you two need to compromise on.|`|6a4027d3805f56239709dd808ba97b3aaa	YES u ARE!!!  he s devoting the rest of his life to YOU!!! what r u afraid of!? just give him that last fun night with his friends!! then he s ALL urs!!
AA11627720	she is telling the truth.. and that truth is that she doesn't want to date you. we are too easy to believe what they say sometimes, on the basis that they are good friends. let me tell you this: telling someone a reason why you broke up with them/rejecting them is always hard. don't worry about winning her over, and worry about moving on. if an opportunity comes later, it will.
ZGvpWQ1Aaa	Cared for me... loved me......... no matter what. ILY mom
75wokcu0aa	It would be really cute to call or send her a letter, saying that she is the only thing you miss about going there for work every day. I know that would make me say yes to a date 
ggTDw6Diaa	I think it's perfectly natural to have a picture of someone in your wallet. As long as you don't get re-attached to the person emotionally, then you're all set.    A picture can serve many purposes. It can make you feel like someone's beside you in a tough situation, and that they're probably thinking about you too. If you feel an empty space inside you when you don't have the picture with you, it means a part of you is still missing this person. Don't let it take the best of you, but just remember the good times and move on (not trying to sound rude or harsh, I'm just speaking from experience :P).    Hope this answered your question. :)|`|wvN4HLhLaa	I dont think its weird....I carry a pic of a man Ive never even seen in person but I love him with all my heart....and Ive never even close to talked to him too|`|fE5bC83Saa	put the picture some where else.and when you feel like looking at him.think of where you put it.but don't go and actually take a look it will go away.  but question :  have you told him you loved him  if you didn't give it a try  good luck
bC5XeVEIaa	Same thing for me, and I'm a 24 year old male. It is considered bad because we are a social species and because we only have two real missions in this life: to survive and to procreate. We cannot complete the second alone. And loneliness can kill.|`|ySvWezDdaa	you're only 19! you have so much time and life ahead of you.  i had an old professor who was well into her 40's and had never been married.  and she was super-religious, so she had never...well...anyway, she's getting married now, in her late 40's!  how amazing is that?  i really think there's someone for everyone but not just ONE person, as in "soulmate" or whatever.  i think there are many people any given person could be perfectly happy to settle down with.  in other words, sometimes it's just about being more open-minded to going out with men you never would have considered initially (mind you, not settling, never settling; that would be unfair to both you and the man you're settling upon).  it also helps to get out there and get to know more people from all walks of life.  i have no doubt if you meet more people, you'll find someone you like who likes you back, someone with whom you're compatible.  good luck! :)|`|hChy7BAPaa	well...the trick is..think positive. did you ever watch the movie "the secret" ? it's about how thoughts become things..the law of attraction. try meditating. it sounds like you have quite a bit of stress or you've been stressed to the point where you are in denial. and the truth is, we are all alone. no ones perception is the same. we can never truley understand any human being on this earth. but we're alone TOGETHER..which makes us one. get out and get some confidence girl!
jD0nfrIBaa	I used to feel the same until I met this really great guy a few years ago.  I think the best part of it is the mere acceptance of someone loving you, despite all your faults (and who isn't family, so they don't HAVE to).  When you meet someone who loves everything about you, it's a really great feeling, espeically when you feel the same way with him.  When someone does little things for you, just to make you smile and be happy, and you know you are so special to them...it's really great.  The cute text messages adn calls throughout the day, just to say I love you and ask how your day has been.  That's why people love love so much.  Once you are in a genuinely good relationship with someone you totally click with....I think it's impossible to not love it!!!    Knowing you are the first thing on someone's mind when they wake up adn the last thing on it when they go to bed is really awesome.|`|OM9n8Lxaaa	I think that you should probably try to grow some kind of heart.  Love is what all of us live for.  It's not like money, or power.  It's integral to what we are.  Yes, there is alot of hurt and trouble.  And you really know nothing at all if you think it's superficial.  Because it's not.  When YOU feel THAT strongly for someone... THEN you can so it's nothing.    Sorry for having a go.  But you really have no idea without experiencing it.  xx|`|jLKcuMNraa	i felt exactly the way you do right now until i found the guy who changed that. i guess its all about the right one comes along. i know thats corny but its true in my case|`|JRn7XUHAaa	If somebody loves you and you don't love them, it's bad. If you love somebody and they don't love you. It's very bad !     So when you find somebody to love, and they love you back; it's a big deal. In the stars,or the one and only, or soul mate. You get the picture lots and lots of hype.    But it's not all bad. Imagine the possibilities. Two people lusting after one another, blind to each others faults, at the same time.This combination usually equals lots and lots of sex. Like I said not all bad.    But it doesn't last forever. So you will have to pick yourself up dust yourself off, and do the whole thing over again and again. And don't worry, your not doing anything wrong. You've got plenty of company. 50% divorce rate. Your right LOVE sucks !|`|4hr9JGAdaa	love is a great feeling, and it makes you happy, thats why so many ppl like it, and when your in love, you feel happy, comfortable, and well, you love it, thats why ppl like love so much. cheesy but true.|`|zwNaZbKlaa	I used to be like you. I was always like why do you people get so obsessed over love and other relationship issues? I thought that I would never succumb to that feeling and that love was for the silly people of the world who were superficial and predictable. But then without knowing I grew to love one of my closest friends. It's weird because I'm gay and he's straight so nothing can happen between us, but I still love him very much. This feeling kind of crept onto me without me realizing it. Now that I look at love, I don't see it as superficial but a complicated emotion that illustrates deep feelings you have for somebody you really care about.     Just wait till the right guy/girl comes along. You'll realize that love is not how you currently perceive it.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Love actually releases a ton of hormones that induce good feelings.|`|17lkwekHaa	Well I am 16 and me and my boyfriend (18) have been in a serious relationship for 2 years now.  and friends for 3.  We love each other a lot and no its actually not superficial or predictable, and yes sometimes its hard, but come on thats with anything.    I mean, I'm not going to waste time and try and explain it to u, u will just have to find out why its so great. We love every moment of it.  So, no one can explain Love 2 u, u just have 2 feel it. Its wonderful trust me.

AA11313824	I'm so sorry. This is obviously a hard time for you. I am afraid that if he's like most guys at 15, he's looking for a good time and not in it for the long haul. May I recommend talking with your parents about what to do and letting him go? He's obviously not ready for this commitment and from his answer, I doubt he has any intention of being a father at all. There are other options. Talk with your family about them. One such option is adoption. For more information about adoption, here is one site.|`|jpMoKkAkaa	well, im gonna go out on a limb here and say he is ignoring u because youre pregnant. just a guess...|`|1vCoaf08aa	He got what he wanted.    Sex.|`|MJGGZYqzaa	hes being a typical boy.|`|Umsj08pnaa	Because you are a stupid, pregnant 15 year old child. What did you think would happen? Did you pay attention at all in Sex Ed.?|`|5jIdcbyYaa	Why are you even worrying about him giving you the cold shoulder? HELLO! you're f'n pregnant of the age of 15! Anyways he can't leave you cus he'll be in deep **** anyways! Fuckin' young kids nowadays! What are you gonna rely on? An apartment for daycare to take of your kids so you can be on welfare!? so sick of young kids these days. Your parents sucked raising you guys!|`|cP9MoCc6aa	sweetie, the reason guys do that stuff - and then lead you to the bed - is to have one thing that is on every guys mind whether they like it or not.     Plus you are 15! You really shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff anyways. Wait until you know for sure he is the guy you will be with forever, and him proving it by MARRYING you.     That's why its better waiting after marraige because this kind of thing happens.    Really, its obvious you gave him what he wanted, and now that he has it, he may move on to another girl.    Sorry being so blunt but sweetie you know all of this is true.    Didn't you have self control or a concious that said this was wrong though? Now you have to care for the baby, the guy always gets away with it because they don't get preg. they just make a girl get preg.    i hope things go well, i hope you are seeing someone who will help you (not necessarily to raise the child for you) but teaches you the way of parenting.|`|qeUoAW6naa	I know how you feel. But just as you're young, the guy is also really young. A 15 year old guy is not very much mature than a kid! How on earth can he carry the responsibilities of fatherhood at such a tender age?? It's natural for him to feel a bit puzzled at your appearance, and also want to run away from such responsibilities, due to his age and lack of mental maturity. I think you should engage an adult (parent, teacher, counsellor, social worker) to counsel both of u regarding parenthood and how to take responsibility and handle the situation. It's unfortunate that the two of you will have to learn about such stuff the hard way, at such a young age. Needless to say, you have taken the wrong path and should have been more responsible. But now it's needless to say all this. Good luck though!|`|jPLiMCPDaa	You're in a tough situation.  You're expecting some who is NOT an adult to take on an adult responsibility.    It's NOT going to be easy, but you did know the risks when you decided to have unprotected sex.    You both need to seek professional counseling in order to make it through this.|`|mQTy3vdqaa	He's running away from the problem and leave you to solve it yourself.....
PD9x9Oioaa	sounds to me that he really likes you but he thinks that u are not interested cause u denied his basically asking you out 3 times or he's scared ur gonna hurt him.
jh9YA4gNaa	SMARTTTT !!!  YOUR MY HERO IF YOU DO THIS !|`|YzS4ZbLHaa	dont....  he would def care, he wud be heartless if he dsnt and im sure he isnt heartless  if u do what u wanna do and wen he finds out u lied hes gnna back away so so much  jus tell him the truth abt how u feel|`|y9mdCYByaa	it's like this...  1. if you tell him you are in the hospital and he believes you and asks how are you or other questions like 'what happened?',etc., meaning he cares, right? and then he will be back in your arms and you'll be happy together.    2. BUT what if he learns that you just lied about being in the hospital, then he'll be upset,if not angry..and with that, the next time you tell him something, he will not believe you anymore (even if you are telling the truth)..and you will eventually lose him forever..    my advice?...you don't have to lie.all you have to do is ask..if he doesn't really wanna come back, then don't insist. NEVER BEG. just let go..it's either he'll find his way back to you or you'll find another guy who is way better than him..    i know it won't be easy..but you'll have to give it a try.^_^
NzEcIEjUaa	I feel the EXACT same way. I feel like my thinking is so mature and i understand so much but i usually just act kinda like childish, just for fun, but im really not. And because of that, whenever i say something nobody takes me seriously. I feel like maybe when we're older we'll find a perfect balance and it'll all come together.    All my love,  Diana|`|F4fWTwkyaa	act immature til ya grown @ my skool all the immature folks r popular|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	Okay...first of all, it's okay to act your age around people your age, life is supposed to be that way. I mean, I'm very mature and I'm top of all of my classes but I always act like a doofus in front of my friends because it's fun. And there's no reason for a low self esteem around guys. They're just guys.
Tn52aL3Zaa	That really does suck.  Get a different pair of colorful pants and wear those ones!  Yeah shes in your friend's group but theres always that really annoying person who seems to hang out with all your friends that you just don't like! I know it sucks, you have to grit your teeth and deal with it.  Put those yellow pants in the back of the closet. When she's not around wear them! Wear them when you want to! Not when she says you both should. Don't change because of her. Shes just one person!  Your not going to like everyone you have to "deal with".    Hope this helps.|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	Just tell her face to face your problems|`|xb7PJUifaa	start a rumor about her to get her mad but make sure that you aren't the one who said it  say that (insert name here) said it
6KVGwdBQaa	First of all, you should have been laying next to your sister, not her husband.  I don't care how close you are, this is the kind of crap that happens when you don't take precausions.  It could have been an accident, but I doubt it.  Did you lay next to him, or did he lay next to you.  If he layed next to you, it wasn't an accident.  And I guarentee you he wasn't asleep.  I NEVER fondle my husband "while i'm asleep and not know it" and I sleep next to him every night.  The more I think about it, this was definetly not an accident.  You need to confront him and your sister together at the same time.  Don't ignore this, it will cause problems between you and your sister later and I'm sure you don't want that.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	No sweetie, you were molested and as much as you may want to protect him you need to tell someone about this.  There might be other kids in the house and it could happen to them or possibly you again.  Confront this situation because a person like that will continue to do this to innocent kids.  I know you might be scared but definitely tell someone.  Good luck.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	he knew what he was doing and he's probably a big fat pervert pedophile. rat him out.|`|s3YmrM9zaa	i think its funny how the first person you told was the internet|`|yC6wINPcaa	well ur sister was on the other side so it must hav been a mistake  but, if u want some reasurance ask ur sister|`|PmG0Isnnaa	To Molest means to make an unwanted sexual advance.  So by that definition, yes you were.  I doubt that it was a "mistake".|`|z3uUtr33aa	rofl, people on here are hilarious. anyways, you sound like your trying to dodge the truth. you woke up and his hands were messing around in your pants? i think he can tell the difference between you and your sister but i'd say confront him even though you might seem really uncomfortable with it, it could make you feel A LOT better.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	there are no accidents. tell your sister right now. you were violated.|`|ujT5teZgaa	Dude, it's cool...maybe you should be nice and consider it next time and return the favor?|`|i8ySLyjLaa	molested. confront his spouse and if she would find it odd, sue or never see him again.    what a creeper...|`|M2JNgbI1aa	yea i think u were  there are no accidents (kung fu panda quote) lol|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	There is a chance it was an accident but there is a chance it was not.  Play it safe and talk to your parents ASAP.  Especially because you're a minor.|`|AA12169920	Keep in mind that this will ruin his life. You didn't mention his age. If he is more than a few years older than you, he is a scumbag and deserves to go to jail. but if he is 18 or even 19, demand an apology and ask him if he is aware of the possible consequences of his actions. Very serious business. He could arrested, do time in prison, and be labeled as a sex offender for the rest of his life.If he has a girlfriend, sister, or mother, they should all be told about this, at the very least.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	This is no accident tell your parents seriously he is messed up!|`|dkoGI9nfaa	I am not too sure about the accident bit.  Sound too good to be true  However, it is possible.  In the end it does not matter whether it was a case of mistaken identity or not, you have to talk at least to him about it as if you don't you are condoning his behaviour though your silence.   If you are totally happy and at easy with what he says you can decide what you do then but, if there is the slightest doubt you have to report the incident either to your sister, parents or the police.  You cannot just leave it.  Next time it could be very messy.|`|qeUoAW6naa	I think it was just an accident. He probably mistook you for his wife. But if you notice any further suspicious behaviour on his part, be on your guard!|`|om0zcFigaa	Go kick his butt.|`|oq0jpqAgaa	accident.  think about it.  if they were drinking as heavy as you described then yes he probably thought you were someone else and he probably has no memory of it.  just don't worry about it.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	u wer molested i wood tell someone right away|`|8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	I agree, it was not an accident.  You should tell someone you trust.  It is possible that he thought you were his wife, but not likely.  Most people would be extra careful about how they were sleeping knowing their teenage sister in law is next to them. I'm sorry this happened to you - you should really tell someone.|`|CZwJJetyaa	I think you need to tell your parents about this.|`|KiaoDGGZaa	its kinda hard to tell hun  i mean it could of very well been a accident if his wife was sleeping next to him he could of thought you were her  and plus if he was drinking that could have a affect  i personally wouldnt tell anyone  maybe confront him when you 2 are alone|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I'm not sure but I think it would be kinda hard to put your hands down somebody else's pants if your asleep. I would maybe talk to your mom or sister somebody you are comfortable with.|`|qJDNIRjraa	He probably knew exactly what he was doing, but he's going to pretend he didn't.  I'd tell your sister, though.  She needs to know.  It may not be the first time he's done this to somebody.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	yes, you dont "accidently" do things like that!  dont tell your sister, she wont believe you..  telling someone like your mum would be much better!  im sorry about what happened!  he's a creep!|`|cVhuFVWSaa	I do not think that could have been an accident. This was highly inappropriate and I think you should tell your sister and/or your parents. If you are feeling this uncomfortable you definitely need to deal with this issue. I wish you the best of luck and go to the family member that you are closest with and trust the most.|`|fHZjRA5Saa	be cautios..  dont ignore this..  cuz it couldve been an accident .. but then again it might have not...  just talk 2 him about it..|`|rgOBHB5uaa	report it to the police|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	Your overacting girl. He maybe thought u were ur sister and if he didn't rat him out of you.|`|E6W5TRZKaa	Thats not accident hun. You need to tell your sister about it. Talk to your parents too. Maybe even the police. He shouldn't be doing that to you its not right.|`|i0sgEZc6aa	your 16, he was only trying to finger you, You should have lapped it up and had a dripping wet orgasm|`|rp372bcYaa	you dont accidently stick your hand down someones pants....|`|eTm9uLqyaa	If you are close like you say you are..  Then ask him if he meant to..  And yeah.. There is a chance he will lie..  But then again there is that chance that he won't..|`|ucr4J8kcaa	It could have been an accident, but either way it was wrong. Talk to him about it. When I'm drunk I don't mistakenly stick my hand down someone's pants, so what he did was 100% wrong.    If he denies it, go to your parents or an authority. Maybe even talk to your sister. Just do not blame yourself or think of it as an accident. Even if he thought you were your sister, it was wrong.|`|8KMdXKTLaa	It might have been an accident...but I think you need to confront him.|`|58hfhPuNaa	I see nothing wrong with it. Happens all the time.|`|Bctc0cEEaa	you need to tell someone, because you just never know|`|CLkV4DTsaa	Even if it was an accident I think you should tell someone.  That's disgusting.  Actually, I don't know how it could be an accident...who reaches down someone else's pants while being asleep?|`|AA11739944	tell  your  sister  and your parents|`|XQH72YZWaa	you need to confront him if he was sleeping then it was an accident if he wasnt then thats serios (though he will probly just deny it) hmmm tuff|`|rSt7GCZvaa	Accident definately - unless he wanted sister action and none of you took the bait|`|jaGZW30Jaa	aaah not sure on that, if he purposly did it yah its wrong  message me or email me at hobsonjesse@yahoo.com|`|iBPqutK5aa	Maybe you should ask him in private and promise not to tell but if it was purposely then i'd report it|`|99MYd45Xaa	Tell your sister.  He only wants you to think that he was asleep or mistook you for your sister.  He meant to do it.  Tell someone. :]|`|N0WF1CuGaa	I don't know if you can subconsciously put your hand down an underaged girls pants in your sleep. That sounds pretty messed up even if he did think you were his wife. If you feel very uncomfortable i'd say let somebody know.|`|asEV10aXaa	sh*t man idk. I feel like if he did it intentionally he would of known that he was going to get in trouble and tried to do a little more than just feeling.|`|DNUPVvioaa	I agree with that blonde chick. you don't accidently stick your hand down someones pants.|`|K62ll0Zxaa	ok maybe he thought u were ur sister and if he didn't rat him out|`|4aN84K5eaa	Ask him about it. Pay careful attention to his face. If he looks normal, then it was an accident. and if he gives you a weird look, then he prolly meant it|`|IvwstV5Laa	he did it on purpose i dont see how you just stick your hand down somenones pants and not know your doing it even when your asleep|`|CaqxJS0Qaa	I really think it was just a mistake besides they were drinking. My boyfriend hugged and kissed my cousin when he was drunk. I was fine with it. Maybe your brother in law thought you were just your sister, and maybe you should tell your sister about it. Just say it in a funny way or make a joke out of it if you are nervous about about. I am sure your sister will forgive her husband and you for it.|`|1wJeITvdaa	You were definitely molested.  As much as it might hurt your family, you need to tell someone (mainly your sister and/or parents) ASAP.  I know it sounds easier than it might be, but you really need to not ignore this.  Things like this are not accidents.  Trust me, I know first-hand and I have had to live with what happened to me and I regret not telling someone sooner.    Good luck......|`|oztoPKrGaa	I dont care how hard you are sleeping you have to make an effort to get your hands down anyones pants.  I dont think it was an accidential move, although he could have thought it was your sister. * very doubtful *  Im not to sure I would say anything about it though.  Only because It would cause alot of problems  But... then again, if he did it to you, what if they have kids and he does it to them?  Maybe go to your mom about it first.  See what she says.  Or if you and your sister are really close go to her about it.  She may get mad at you, but trust me, in the end its just because she was scared.   Im sorry this happened to you.|`|5fEAD9smaa	i don't think it was case of thinking u were your sister, tell your sister or talk to HIM about it, get things sorted or you will feel weird for a long time its better to clear it up now|`|kKD0m7qUaa	uhmmmm I think your sister should be aware of this incident.    Why would he have his hands in your  pants?  He knew what he was trying to do and Yeah, I would consider this being violated.  I would tell someone.    Good luck|`|mITpAYReaa	I think that yes, perhaps you were molested. Though the troubling part is that it could've been an accident on his part as well. You were touched inappropriately, but with all the alcohol in his system he might have thought that he was actually touching your sister the entire time. You always want to be careful with such a statement, you never know if it was a mistake or not.|`|KsZQQkBfaa	Woah...    i'm pretty sure that shouldn't happen normally.   you definitely need to tell your sister.     even if it was an accident she needs to look out. these things can show up late in a marriage and usually it's a lot worse then.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	it is possible that it was an accident if u don't want to get him in trouble try and forget about it. or ask him why he did it and see what he says, if he hesitates then u know it was on purpose if he says omg i'm sorry and sounds honest then i would say it was an accident,but i defiantly wouldn't sleep next to him anymore|`|0RAuPEpaaa	Yes you were molested if I were u I should call the police now case if u don't later on you are bound to have emotional problems I can't give any sources but u. Chould have emotional problems for the rest of you're life but I'm sorry if you have to do this but if he was just messng around the next time u have to stay there it chould be rape.|`|pV8oOns7aa	That is why drinking is a bad habit. After that you cant differentiate.    Or     It is just easy to make use of the situation & then say OH I was drunk so it happened. Nice excuse.    I think the 2nd thing will be applied to you. If you will ask he will say Oh I was drunk i don't know what i did & I am sorry & ashamed of what happened.    I think you need to wait & see if it happens again means he considers the 1st try successful & now he is quit sure that if he will do it again you will not tell anyone. Give him little confidence to dare again & once he does that... Just slap him then & there.|`|fOPgMmnTaa	he probably thought that you were your sister|`|9ceIg9xnaa	Wowww..... I'm sorry hun. .I would tell ur sister.. He was drunk..he could have mistaken you. But either way.. I think she needs to so.. Its tough and my heart goes out to you.

It will accommodate your growing belly and will look gorgeous!|`|i41tUVtIaa	Yea I wore regular but larger sizes till about 6 months but toward the end you grow rapidly and it would be easier to buy maternity stuff.

I used to do this when talking to friends of mine (a habit which really should be stopped anyway). It is a little like "Your mama" jokes that you tell to your friends. Ya it is mean, but it just to be playful. Really he probably means that you are flirting with him, are leading him on, and he doesn't want to be "confused". If it really bothers you then you should talk to him about it, just put on a sad face and ask him not to do it anymore, if he likes you, he will see that it bothers him and he will stop.|`|GxbXseoqaa	ASSHOLEEEEEEE, forget him.|`|dvuttL6Taa	if he says yeeeeh ***** - he agrees with you  if he says nooooo ***** - he disagrees with you....etc..|`|RNUCiRhqaa	It's just another name for a girl|`|0cBEbHlHaa	same here...|`|sX6ZM0jVaa	Ignore it he's probably just joking. I have the same problem with one of my really good guy friends I know he likes me and acoupl other girls. They're just trying to be funnyand it's not ment to be taken personally. Just ignore it and laugh. If it continues and he starts being really rude to you all the time then start to worry alittle. But it sounds like he's trying to flirt, it's just not working for him.

Champagne is such a light colors you could almost use it in flowers, and maybe add the the green, but a light pale green with ivory and creams....deep pink might be ok...    i am doing Green...with accents of ivory creams and purples
FXCoGD44aa	One time my boyfriend wrote me a list of 100 reasons why he loved me, and mailed it to me.

I'm not saying to get her expensive stuff. Just get her a gift that leaves a very deep meaning to it! A gift that is precious to her! =D|`|AA11313824	Sometimes the best ways to show your girlfriend you love her are small, simple things. Write her a note saying you hope she has a great day. Leave it somewhere where she'll find it! Bake her some cookies (it's okay to cheat and use prepared dough), let her know how grateful you are to have her in your life,etc. For some really cheesy tips that work, see Enchanted's song "How does she know?"|`|7sxGW40qaa	-Kiss her deeply  -Look into her eyes and when she says "what?" just tell her you like her eyes  -If you come up behind her, wrap your arms around her  -Hold her like you never want to let her go  -When you 2 are standing around, put your hand on her back or around her waist.    Hope this helps!|`|fIeLH6HPaa	buy her little gifts for no reason , cards, write her love letter, leave her notes telling her how you feel about her for her to find when your not around.

Also, while your talking before/after perhaps give her a ring or necklace and tell her that you love her...idk|`|Df8GQoRkaa	well you could:  .any chance u get put ur arm around her   .do nice things for her without having to ask like make her lunch or hold her books or purse. not something casual anyone could do for her, like open a door for her.  .complement her every so often and MEAN IT  .spend lots of time with her, actually talking to her and not just standing there, staring off into the distance.    if she's a good gf then u dont have to do any of this. she knows u love her. but i suppose these are things u could do for her that will make u apperciate you more

QP1ZQqPfaa	I read in a book called How To Love Again that if every time he comes in you should hug him and every time a little longer.  When ever he is doing something else to pass by and give him little kisses, or touch him more often, but skin to skin not over the clothes (like make sure you touch his hand or face skin contact.)  Tell Him you love him more often and slowly the passion should start over and he will start wanting you again.  Hey i tried it and well it worked slowly we became bunnies again.  Also try to look good when he comes home.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Help him relax.  Stress is likely the true cause.  Help him out with a back rub and a beer, then go for the kill.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Things take a while to get back on track when a baby is introduced.  Make him feel wanted & needed & desirable and he will make you feel the same.  Things will work out if you put a little effort into it.  Congrats on the baby!|`|aOd0Djkaaa	Role play! take his mind off the stress.|`|FnGebaOLaa	If you just had a baby with him, he can NOT say he is turned off that would just be completely un acceptable!  If you enjoy things like giving massages, and blow jobs, or touching his favorite spots that could help!   Another thing is you could ask him if there is something you can do to help him with all of his stress full things!  Have you tried to take at least a few hours every week to spend time with ONLY him, and have him just talk to you about what is going on?  And spending "quality" time together?  *Good Luck*|`|AA10442322	Its most unfortunate that we have this economic turmoil. Your husband could be really undergoing a lot of stress lately. His sex drives will go down considerably. Its inevitable.    What i suggest you can do is:    1. Start by talking to him - not about work or sex drive, but about his favourite topics. Go read on it. Let him open up to you more and then go in slowly on the key issues that are troubling him. Don't do it on your first conversation with him.    2. Open up more - once he started to open up with you about his troubles, just listen and dont discourage him. Empathise with him and gives him positive feedbacks to move him on.    3. Dress up for the occasion - on the night that you managed to open him up, you may want to dress up to tease him. Don't go straight into the act, but go slowly again and speak to him more to open up. Take your time, you have lots of it.    4. Do it - spice up the evening or day with lots of things that you and him like. Rose petals or lavender ladened bath or a evening of fun and games. Do things together and leave the baby with the nanny for a few hours.     Have fun and the loving making will come naturally.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	get a part time job and help him with the finances. Or a full time if he's willing to help with child care.
Lj2mo4ooaa	I thought about a guy after 6 months.  We were also very emotionally involved.  Actually, I thought about him all during the 6 months too, but I just tried very hard to deny/avoid my feelings.  They finally just got the better of me.    In my case, I meant I cared a whole heck of a lot.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Not sure under what context he told you that he misses you.  If he called just to say he misses you, then this definitely shows some kind of feeling towards you.    But I cannot help to wonder why he waited so long to call?  Perhaps, he just had a bad breakup?  Or perhaps it took this long for him to realize that he shouldn't let you go?      The only thing matters is do you have any feel for him.  If you like him, then talk to him.  If not, ignore him.|`|fE5bC83Saa	maybe he broke up with some one else and wants to rebound

i7dCNCopaa	I was in a very similar situation with my gf. She didn't want a relationship at first, said she wasnt rdy for a bf. I said ok and started talking to another girl. After a little, she came to me, sayin she liked me so much and wanted to be with me. It worked for me, so if you think it can with whatever type of personality she has, I would reccommend trying it.|`|6bX8yZphaa	You are getting to her.... just let her go...let her come to you|`|i3epau0laa	Tell her she had no right to say that to you because she barely talks to you anyways. You're the one always talking to her! Just because you didn't say much this time doesn't mean you're being "emo" and maybe she thought you would like it better if she left you alone to get over it yourself. If you don't want that tell her, you want her to help you.|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	sounds like she doesn't like you, sorry, but you should just let her go, leave her alone and she'll probably come crawling back but don't act sad, just ignore her a little,|`|OEaBSuaWaa	she was probably either (a) being sarcastic or (b) freaking out because you didnt answer right away.  maybe she thought you were questioning yourself.  dont spazz out and dont give up hope. :)|`|76LpTu3Gaa	Dude, beware the friend zone, it is a damned place that guys get delegated to for no reason and can't ever get out of.

t4KC77Jbaa	well i don't think that you should masturbate be4 the day of and when ur in the mood and you start feeling  on her and when you get inside of her then u should be al good if u just stay cool and don't make her come early then u guys r gunna have a great time|`|pDqsFgjyaa	It's kind of contradicting to say you want to feel more, but last longer. The more sensation you have, the less time it lasts, and the more time it lasts is usually because of less "sensation." Sensation is an easy fix, just stop chokin' the chicken for a while, let your body repair itself. If you want to last longer, you could masturbate a couple hours before you get together with her, as long as you don't beat it to death.. hah or just use a desensitizing condom|`|KwNpyp3saa	Wait until the time comes.|`|nDSELNEHaa	i have been told  if you masturbate a few hours before you will last longer..|`|k9c7MoyPaa	I know how important this issue can be for a guy so I giving you all the real, no bull$hit option I have tried. If you are 21 you could get drunk the night before its a known fact that the day after a good drunk that your testosterone level that was slightly diminish from the alcohol comes back and raises your libido the next day.      But nothing can raise you confidence and libido like Viagra or Cialis. When you are finished it comes back immediatly, I have even blown mutiple times without loseing erections.Seriously your dick will hurt the next day because your erection was so big. But I cant recommend those without a prescription legaly.      There are also over the counter pills that are more easy to obtain and can be just as effective. One that I know used to be effective was a pill called stamina RX, but I later read reports that they were illegally putting the drug from cialis in them. I'm not sure which ones I got but they worked.  I generally never have trouble keeping a solid erection unless its the first time with a really hot chick(that doesn't make sense to me either, I guess its just perfomance anxiety), or if I am hammered drunk. So I keep a couple of these pills handy just in case. You take em 1hr to 45 minutes before you think it might be all systems go.  They may make your skin flush with blood so your face may get red, and I have even had it slightly effect my vision. But you will have a raging hard on and be able to go as long as you want.  If you are going this route I would highly recomend you spend I night before you get with her to field test them, make sure they work for you.    Or you could take a supplement I used to use for bodybuilding called Tribulus Testerus and the specific brand that actually works is made by Sopharma     http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/soph/t...    Since you have a lack of time, If you going to do tribestan I would recommend the brand in the link above, many tribestan supplement don't work and you don't have the time to be field testing.  I know this one works.  This natural supplement tricks your pituitary gland into producing more of your own natural testosterone than it does normally.  Which means you are super horny, all the time and get huge boners, But how long you last on this stuff isn't enhanced as much as with the real ***** pills. And with these pills you will need to take them at least 7 days in advance, and you have to take 3 to 6 a day in the right time schedules. But if you work out you will see results there also. I would buy 2 boxes, $70 with shipping and take them until you run out.
wf3S2avqaa	Go up to the hospital and spend a couple of nights with him so he doesnt feel scared and alone. Tell him you love him. Give him a big hug. Talk with him and make him relaxed it will help him take his mind off the hospital stay.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Just visiting is good.  You don't say how old your stepbro is, so it's hard to give any advice beyond just being there for him.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	bring him in some of his PJ's, boxers, Robe, socks, slippers    bring him video games, magazines, toys (dont know age here- but stuff to keep him busy)    See if they have a DVD player (most hospitals do now, if not see if you can hook one up and bring in movies) or a portable dvd player w/movies    collect some letters from his friends, that will make him feel missed (unstead of like he is missing something)    bring him in some food (something yummy, unless its contrindicated by the doctor) - we all know hospital food is not the greatest!    good luck - hope this gave you an idea or two!|`|T7vuRDCVaa	Find him a HOT nurse ;)|`|AA11138696	Visit as much as you can.

You get really freaked out when people talk to you like you're two (unless you are.) Bring in some pictures from home.  Bring in his favorite toys (If he's a kid) and DEFINITELY stuffed animals and "blankies." They make you feel really comfortable.  Spoil him (yes, it's bad, but if he has to stay in the hospital, he deserves it.)  Make him feel special.  Let him know you're there in case he wants to talk.  Don't act like the hospital is a scary place.  Eat the food like it's not disgusting.  Bring in some good food if possible.  If allowed, let his friends visit.  Let him choose the TV channels.  Don't treat him like a baby. (Yes, I know I said that, but it's very important!)  Any more questions, you can email me.|`|VygBNA0Waa	sneak him in a beer and some yum food a playboy and a prostitute|`|Mm2yIwGgaa	just be supportive of him. visit him when you have time and offer him things that he may need. sorry about him. i know its hard.|`|ad5ycXvvaa	let him know how much you care.And keep a since of humor.and cater to his needs.But dont over do it.
wf3S2avqaa	what defines a friend? To me a  friend is someone who you put 100 Percent trust and faith in. A friend is someone who'll be there for you during the good and bad times of life. A friend is not someone who will be a yes man, but will be someone who will tell you ur wrong when ur wrong and right when ur right. A friend is someone you respect. A friend is someone who will be back your side ready to beat someones *** if they tried to hurt you. A friend is someone who you gots much love for you. A true friend who go to hell and back for you. A friend is someone who would be there to help pick you up when your very low or in a depressed state. A friend is all of the above and more. If you ever get one don't let them go. There will be some good times and bad times. But, don't be a fool. Some are friends and some are 'DEVILS in DISGUISE'.     What puts me off: The reverse of everything i said above. Someone who lies, someone you cant trust, people who are backstabbers. Friends who always find time to include race and other things into a conversation. Can't stand|`|L6MLYMkhaa	If they are not judgemental, and do not criticize the way I do things in my life.     They are my friend b.c. they understand my peculiarality.

Lets me know if I have my "head up my azz", and to let it be known that something needs to be resolved.|`|97e5af975d0ce2df46e943e7aee67ea7aa	friend: someone who will always let me know how they feel about something regardless if it's what i want to hear or not,someone who truly cares about my health,someone who stops me long enough to think about what i am gonna do,someone who takes the time to make sure i am really ok.........someone who shows loyalty,empathy,sympaty and trust towards our relationship......|`|OssP3oKBaa	Friends mean where they will never put you in trouble.|`|dAMEZPxUaa	a friend-we have been friends since we were 12 we are now 48.we have learned to agree to disagree without prejudice. we can trust each other with our deepest secrets.we are there for each other when we need to be. we can laugh at the stupid things and nobody knows why we are laughing.they just think we are retarded.we can be.we can just be our selves we don't need to pretend to be some one we aren't. i guess you could say we are comfortable .|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Trust and respect.

v1Ujni1Daa	Hey I don't want so sound disrespectful, I would just like to share some of my thoughts with you.    You don't get to know a guy enough in a month, believe it or not. There's something really special going on, like romance, but you don't necessarily know him enough. Just consider this: would you give yourself to a person who might be just enjoying pleasure from you? Hey, you're not even sure he likes you. A lot of guys are jerks you know, and most of them have no respect for girls and will treat them like objects, not caring for their feelings and deceiving them. He COULD be one of those, as far as you know, and he COULD not. It's just not adecuate for you to be doing what "only lovers should do", specially when you're not even sure he likes you. Get to know him better, stop doing that, so you'll know him better, and you'll be fine. Just be patient ;)    And if you have any doubt about if what I'm saying is true, just hear the stories of thousands of girls who have been deceived by guys... If you wait until marriage, that won't happen. It is meant to be for marriage. Just have some patience and you'll enjoy it more later, giving yourself in real love to someone. Don't let anyone have that intimate, special relationship with you. You're really valuable and you deserve someone to respect you.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Yes, please do ask him.    You shouldn't continue in a relationship without knowing where you stand. If you wait any longer and than ask -- sometimes things don't turn out the way you want them to. It's for the best: ask him.    Good Luck|`|9eMYzY0Paa	HUH|`|nfYAIDGqaa	ask him.|`|CO5jcxMraa	well i dont know any of you personally so i dont know if he likes you but def dont ask him   how weird is that "do you like me"  i mean he has to like you enough to date you|`|wnbz5gNzaa	If you have the opportunity to listen/read "Women are from venus, Men are from Mars."

As long as you are happy!|`|SinN2bsAaa	No! It's pretty much depends on what YOU'RE comfortable with.    When I was BARELY 17, I was dating a 21 year old. I was fine with it, he was fine with it. It all just depends on the the people.    If you're fine with the age difference, I say go for it!|`|BsZPz3SUaa	haha, it just so happens that im 15 and my boyfriend is 17. i think it's the perfect age difference. just you gotta watch it though, because it can become illegal (depending what state you're in) if the 17 yr. old turns 18 yr. before the 15 yr. old turns 16. i would look into it. but DEFINATELY go for it.

You might want to make sure she's not a guy.    If you find out she is, well then I guess the date is up to you. ;)|`|AV9h7Dikaa	that you're the girl in the relationship.|`|WnRy6on6aa	maybe she just isn't into the whole "1 month anniversary" celebration thing.  it doesn't mean she doesn't like you, she just might not see it as big of a deal as you do.|`|peoM7XJhaa	U aren't supposed 2 think anything.

Just remind her of the dates & let her know that they're important 2 u then move on... geeez!!!|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Sometimes girls are the ones that are on top of that and other times there are girls that aren't on top of that.  I don't think it shows whether the girl likes you or not.  Just bring up the subject and tell her you would like to keep that date as a significant memory, most girls figure guys don't care, thats probably why she didn't note it.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Some girls don't take these things too personally.    I wouldn't be too worried about it.    I'm not a very sentimental kind of girl and neither do I celebrate anniversaries.    Just my 2 cents|`|mRun89yLaa	That she forgot.|`|uIpVvT1Saa	sometimes people are not good with dates at all. but others memorize them very well...    just ask her about it. =]|`|EQydFhzmaa	What does it matter when you met?

And it could mean that maybe it wasn't really important to her but at the same time it could just be that she doesn't care about what the specific date was.  Don't get too worked up about.  It could be no big deal at all.|`|wAoNbpVlaa	o hell man i dont even keep track of that kind of stuff. hey just be happy that you guys are toghether.|`|S6zEIEZXaa	I have been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years now and all we both know is we started dating sometime in the fall, not sure what day or month, but we are still together and that is all that we care about, when I get married I'll remember that date. I wouldn't worry about it.
wrtclm8Haa	Okay well then don't make time for him.  That's honestly the best way to go about it. Once he realizes your actually busy too & your not worrying about him, it'll drive him NUTS. Since he turned you down for sex it shows he kinda needs space, he's probably thinking about things. So stay away for a little bit. Go out with your friends, just do that & he will miss you trust me. Guys are weird, like 75% want what they can't have .. so be cool about it.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	he's cheating on you.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	news flash! he's not your boyfriend. he's your room mate. move out and find someone who treats you like a lady.|`|rp372bcYaa	Well if the only reason hes not spending time with you is because shes so busy with school, its understandable. But if he is hanging out with friends and stuff and not you, then i would just ask hiim about it.|`|HOK5C8n4aa	Tell him that you appreciate that school is taking a lot out of him and you know his education is important, however relationships take work too and you'd really like to have some time with him.      Tell him you miss being in his arms and the things you used to do together.  Let him know that you understand he has to devote time to school and that he sometimes needs friend time, but request that he devote some time to the two of you as well.      Maybe set up two nights a week that are just for the two of you.  Do something special those nights, like a special dinner and play dress up and have candles.  Or go to a movie or out to dinner.  Give him a massage on those nights.  Suggest that that time might help him unwind as well, which you know he probably needs with his stress load.    But whatever you end up doing, make the times you spend alone together as fun as possible for him and it will be time he looks forward to and hopefully will make it fun for you too ;)  Just try not to sound like you're whining or complaining, for some reason guys don't seem to like that,lol.    EDIT: And if my idea doesn't work, go with what Lilah said, because sometimes, absence does make the heart grow fonder and he might just expect you to be there.  He might get a real jolt when you're not.|`|AA11644956	well, college is consuming (even if it Univ. of Phoenix). some people can't handle the stress as well as others.      when in college, you would have to understand that the person isn't going to have as much time as you would like.    i'm not sure if you are in college yourself, but if you are, you would TOTALLY understand.      hopefully this pays off in the end, and after he graduates he has time for you.      also, why did you move in with him?? are you two engaged???    see how he's all focused on HIS life?    be focused on YOURS. because, honey, he'll be all focused on school and graduate and leave you in the wind because, "you weren't supportive" then YOU gotta find a new place to live....and you don't have anything but a chintzy job.    so take care of yourself, girl.    if you're not in school, get in school. you'll both be too busy. BUT you can set aside a day when he can chill with JUST you.      hang in there!        ---  Check out my fashion site:    www.styleandregalia.com|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	I think you guys should take a break for a while. It seems like he's just really too into Phoenix University to really think about anything right now.
WMR8hVlfaa	Not with that dumb look on your face.|`|5LEE91CGaa	screw 6s and 7s and the other comments about the facial expression. your pretty hot. not like that nasty kind of hot but more like an original hotness kind of thing. aim:mojado818. or yahoo me.|`|dsiuzvTHaa	yeah i will give you a 9 but  if you smiled ity would be a 10 i would date you no lie|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	I am not a guy, but you are very pretty (smile)|`|hNvILDqLaa	all guys think some girls are 10 and some think they are 0 but it just depends on the guy|`|1vigJEJtaa	I would say 7/10.  So, yes.|`|edfRUVeSaa	i usually don't answer rating questions but i looked at the link and i think you're very attractive. at least a 9 out a 10. but then again you just happen to fit what i like physically. not all guys will agree with me. but your cute ;-)  well everyone else gave ya there IM so i'd feel weird doing the same lol. Damnnit|`|AVAwtoVTaa	Great, You look pretty.  To be frank you have to get over with the conscious look on your face, just be cool and smiling. You have a good figure too, as far as i can see.     So be happy and Smiling|`|vjxroyxjaa	Ur very prtty. Id giv u a 9. I would hav given u a 10 if u would hav flashed a smile instead of ur little smirk. It looked lik an old man just said u were prtty and u gav him an eww look lol. Anyway great pic besides the smirk.  If u wanna chat-Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.com|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i give you a 6    whats with the long face    i could have given u a better rate if u didnt have that weird facial expression|`|IG4A4nuDaa	youre pretty hot  8
wqtwzzPeaa	She probably thinks that you're still into her because you asked her out earlier, and you asking her to the dance probably just confirmed it. Before the dance, tell her that you asked her to it because you liked her, but you're not looking for a serious relationship right now. Tell her you'd still like to go with her but she shouldn't expect it to be more then a date and if she'd like to ask the other guy out and just go to the dance as friends, that'd be fine. If you really don't care if you two go together, then tell her it'd be fine with you if she asked the other guy to go if that's what she wants.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Well, Tyler, I presume the best way to go about this would be to tell her as quickly as possible, but in a timely manner.    In saying that, I mean to say you should tell her you don't want to be in a relationship, but you enjoy hanging out with her. Just be honest and tell her how you feel, or she'll probably get hurt.     Good luck with your troubles, Tyler.|`|IUOomveYaa	maybe after the dance say that you don't really want to get into a relation ship right now. hope this helps|`|HbayB338aa	just tell her nicely and tell her u had ur chance with me
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if i were being cheated on, yes i would want to know it. as long as u really know its true send the letter if u don't want to personally involve yourself.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Your right , she should know about it . ... But she should find out herself or through her husband .... MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!!!!!!      You do not know what the future may bring . Do not interfere in things that are not your concern.|`|EroXBvDNaa	she should know about it, but she may not believe you, if it's a close friend you should just tell her, she might get mad but at least you did the right thing.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	Tough one, do you know them pretty well? If not I say send the letter!|`|AA10628838	If you are going to do something so despicable, be a man about it, and tell her to her face.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	I think you should...but make sure the letter proofs that he is cheating... pictures and evidence...ya'know.   Personally I would like to know if I am being cheated on...and I think most women would. So go ahead and do it.     Also make sure she gets the letter, not her husband.|`|vSJIorF7aa	Not alot of details there. Though, without any solid proof, the letter would probably do not good,.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	Yes tell her seriously my first husband was cheating and nobody bothered to say a word. I believe if you know you should say something! Trust me everybody has a right to know if they are being cheated on. If someone would have told me even if they kept who they were a secret it really would have made things so much easier.|`|ViFCEb7Paa	The best advice I can give you is .... Don't get involved. Liars, cheaters and sneaks will eventually get caught.|`|THuplVHpaa	I wouldn't give her an unsigned letter and run. If you're going to open a can of worms this big, you should either man up and say it to her face (gently of course) or leave it alone. He'll get caught eventually. It's inevitable.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	i would do something like that just make sure you send her something also so she knows its true like pic,|`|iD4ejChZaa	i wish somebody had told me 22 yrs ago|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Oh, go a little deeper than that. Write the letter and act like you are the girl that is doing the cheating. And sign her name and address to it.|`|yOFWD0unaa	She could think the letter is a hoax so prob not. Just say to her that you firmly believe that you are right in saying he is a cheater. Explain everything to her...unless it's you he's cheating with...|`|Mn1s77hOaa	how sure are you about it?|`|0VBESmFQaa	Well of course this will all back fire on you a lot in time when they get there **** together and then they will hate you,But sure go ahead|`|S8CZBCe2aa	If you think she should know about it then be brave enough and decent enough to tell her yourself|`|jLKcuMNraa	i'll put it this way: if i was being cheated on then yes i would want to know. some people might say to just butt out, but i think you should say something because chances are that she would want someone to tell her too.|`|jXD8eBFgaa	wake up,why dont you mind your own life ?|`|twEWTkL6aa	yeah, wouldn't you want to know? but, wouldn't you want evidence also?|`|YDXBmfVLaa	no he probably has a good reason thats why most people cheat maybe shes awful in bed|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	How well do you know the person? If you know them well enough that she would expect you to tell her if you knew then you should, but in person or on the phone. Let her know what you heard or saw and tell her that you just thought she should know because you would want her to do the same for you. If you don't know her all that well then leave it alone.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	It really depends on your intentions. If you want to say something to spare her the hurt down the road, and you're not involved in the situation then say something. If you're intention is to hurt, or to give you a edge with her romantically don't, it'll just cause problems for you in the long run.     Like said, you should really have some proof before hand. A lot of people won't just take some anonymous letter that seriously. You could let her know how to catch him, give her a time and place to check.|`|2yUhUV2Iaa	IF you are a family member, yes you must say something.|`|slJWqCI5aa	I think you should tell her yourself. Even if it backfires on you, or they hate you or they work things out, you will know that YOU did the right thing. I truly wished someone would have told me. Just be prepared for any backlash/drama. Sending good karma means receiving good karma!|`|a18ed11034264d2701f79f29d70c9050aa	Mail the letter. Just make sure you have your facts straight. Before you do it|`|nGafpEwoaa	No, you say nothing.  There are things you don't get involved in, and that's one of them.  Besides it wouldn't surprise me if she already knows about her husbands cheating. If she doesn't know now, she'll know sooner or later.      If she should find out that you were the one who wrote the note, then you become the enemy sorta speak.  In other words it will come back to you like a slap on the face.  So it's better to just keep it to yourself and leave their private lives be, cheating or no cheating.     Just read you addition .... like I said above you will become the enemy even if you are friends.  Your friendship will probably go right down the tubes.  If you saw them together, the same may happen to her. Then she'll know.  I'll tell you, most women know when they are being cheated on.  How they handle it, is up to them.      Don't send the letter. If she wants your advice she'll ask you for advice.|`|B1sT1t44aa	Yes I would tell her but ask her not tell her husband that you told her. This way she can catch him and that is how he will know that she found out. I would be very angry with my friend if they did not tell me especially if I wanted to fight for my marriage if I wanted the chance to save it. (which I doubt I would).  Because in many cases if you catch a cheater it can take the excitement out of the affair before it gets to deep and make them focus back on the spouse to deal with their issues. Telling her because she is your friend could also spare her from a possible life threatening disease because who ever this woman has slept with she is now exposed to every one of them and thensome.  I do not believe that a good friend should stay out of it even if they do not like the information you give them. Either way you go with it here you may be damned if you do and damned if you don't but at least you will sleep soundly at night because you knew you warned her.|`|02db2fc0115ea3b94253e8474b9c5015aa	I would not do it. I think he should be the one tell her.After all why would you want to hurt your friend. She may not want to know he is cheating. Some wife's know that their husbands are cheating but look the other way.|`|AG9msdUDaa	You could send HIM an anonymous letter saying that you are an acquaintance of his and you are painfully aware of what he is doing to his wife, and that if he doesn't do the right thing, you will. Leave him scared and wondering and then maybe he'll man up and deal with it himself.|`|kFADnOHdaa	I think you should. I wish I had known in advance.|`|fE5bC83Saa	send the letter to the man instead.and make it clear that you will tell her  if he did not|`|6a4027d3805f56239709dd808ba97b3aaa	dont say anything..its none of ur business..and am sure if your wife was cheatin on u, u wouldnt want to find out in a LETTER!!!!  either talk to the person cheating, try to make him stop or tell his wife, but dont get involved|`|WItKOQh7aa	MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS    (next day, after reading other responses)  It's amazing to me how many of you people condone interfering in the affairs of others.  You are not the morality police, and your opinions and standards are YOURS. Keep them to yourself.      Karma (or whatever the hell it is that doles out justice in this world) has been functioning just fine since the beginning of time, without any meddling from you tedious losers.      Worry about what's wrong with your own lives instead.|`|KnMdFqq0aa	No, stay out of it. Pray for them and maybe say something to the guy that you are aware of what is going on.
DxZepZg7aa	OMG i hate it when that happens.  Tell the strait up. i like you guys both your my besties and im NOT choosing to fight with one of you! make sure your talking to both of them at the SAME TIME in the SAME ROOM. not in seperate places at different times because thats how lies start.  good luck, and this has happend to me more than once.|`|yC6wINPcaa	tell them if they want you to choose they are not real best friends and say you choose yourself!|`|IN1X1CVGaa	yes, this has happened to me  and its stupid  tell both of them  that your not gonna pick between them  its immature and stupid  if they dont like each other, fine  but you like both of them  and they can share you  and if they get mad that you tell them that  stand up for yourself and tell them  they can talk to you when they're done being childish  i would never pick between friends  and you shouldnt either|`|om0zcFigaa	Don't pick. They're not your friends anyways, or "besties".|`|9btcOpxXaa	talk to them both and say how you two are both my best friends and I don't want to have to choose between you guys. Maybe get them together with you sometimes and fix your problems and hang out like old times. GOOD LUCK!!|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	so tell them both itz either friendz with both or with none also tell them if ur gonna be friendz 2 not talk about da other at ALL ! (less drama) and if they dont listen find a new best friend lol|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Don't choose. Tell them that if they both truly cared about you a lot, they would get over their differences and care about your feelings. Tell them you like them both equally and that they should accept that fact. After all, best friends should be there through thick and thin. I remember one time I went through a similar situation. I told my friends that, and sadly, one of them decided they couldn't sacrifice their pride for me. But that just shows you who your true friends are. Good Luck! And I definately agree with "Blondie" =). Lies can start very easily in these types of situations. You might slip telling one friend something just because you don't want to hurt their feelings, and soon it gets back to the other friend and it causes drama. Just be careful of what you say and how you say it, and make sure you don't accidently "diss" one friend to try to please the other. Just tell it to them straight. However, I wouldn't tell them at the same time. It may make them feel awkward and not want to accept. It may start more drama. But then again, its up to you!|`|axylPYftaa	get your own clique|`|uaIUBYTcaa	Say you dont want to get in the middle of it and leave them alone.|`|sUik60LTaa	gie up from now besties are not your besties youll find that there are no friends that are your besties do your own thing and if theyre there then theyre there if not forget about them cuz bestis are ot really besties|`|EShN5zNcaa	It has happened to me. (it's actually happening right now) Just last week they were best friends and we all shared the same friends. Now it's hard because they hate and talk about each other. I hate having to choose between them. What I do is talk to the both of them and i'm still just taking it from there..|`|7FAZYMy3aa	Tell them to work it out without you...  Or you could pick the more the friend that makes the most sense  stuff like this has happened to me a couple of times|`|zzfCVwgqaa	is meghan asking this question, jk, choose the one who u would most liekly want to hang with, or the closetest one, or better yet, start ur own clique also, but dont try to get them to be friends, becuase meghan tried to do tat with me and olga, but im not talking to the girl, and im starting to hang out with kenia more often(shes in a different cliwuee) so u just gotta do wats right inseide(ur heart) but most liekly, choose 1 (which im sure u dont want to do) or leave both! sry|`|4yVHE0hLaa	this kinda happened to me in a way. yeah i used to hang out with this group of people but there where some people who hung out with them that me and my 2 best friends couldn't stand. so we didn't sit with them at lunch. and some of the people at who we used to hang out with got mad cause we weren't hanging out with them. all you have to di is talk to them both and explain that you like them both equally and you want them to be friends again.|`|0eWePCWWaa	pick both of them without telling the other...    EVERYONES A WINNER!|`|EPVWrEOxaa	you tell them both that its not fair of them to make you choose sides and if they are your friends they will respect that|`|nksPs9xFaa	you're obviously either 12 or 13.  dont pick, tell them if their your real friends they wouldn't do this to you because they would respect you enough to know you love them both equally and could never choose between them.it happened before to me and that normally stops it. if they get mad, tell them to ***** off, and they need to grow up. and by the way, fights between good friends dont normally last long. i have had enough experience to know that.|`|apxKzwyzaa	Do not pick! You will lose when of your best friends in the process. You need to find a way to get them to stop fighting and being so childish. And if they won't stop do not join either and tell them that you will not be friends with them if they continue this or something along those lines.|`|i3ebFtbJaa	if they are wanting you to pick then i would tell them that if they are going to be that way then your going to find new friends and leave them in the dust.|`|Te6wS82Jaa	if they are true friends they would not expect u took choose.. tell them both that u like them both and u dont care if they dont like each other.. if they tell u they wont be ur friend if you are friends with the other person then they are not your friends. im 21 i have 2 friends that i would do anything for... i dont need more friends|`|ad5ycXvvaa	offer both of them your friendship.Dont get caught up in the hype.  In the long run  this will blow off and you wont have neither for a friend,   stand your ground and walk away let thenm choose.|`|YQDItpnVaa	You absolutely should not choose to become exclusive friends with either of them. If you do they will become even more split. If I were you I would tell both of them I wouldn't be their friend if it meant I couldn't be friends with both of them. If they aren't mature enough to let you be friends with both, they aren't worth your time.  Good luck!|`|2jnpvyzaaa	I would still talk 2 both of them, w/out passing any gossip,4rm any side.besides u wer all friends after all .and if 1 of them puts u into a situation of choosing;between them 2 probably they r not a good friend after all.|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	Advice:  Don't choose between them! Tell them to keep you out of this and that you don't want to be in the middle of this fight!|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	ok this has happened to me and i hated it but i think u should talk to them and tell them that they cant make u chose. and tell them that they arent true friends if they want u to chose between them.|`|6Wxn77iRaa	don't pick one tell theme them that's it you have had enough and to be friends again! and its happened to me to
aTMWP1T8aa	okay...about ur ex...i think u should talk to him and ask him if he wants to have that tension between u...now he may just be mad about the break up if he says yes but if he says no then ask him to tell his friends to mind their own business and not talk about u    about ur guys...the first one i think is nervous to be around u because he likes you and doesn't know what to say when hes around u, the second guy sounds like he really likes you and it sounds like u like him too so i would say go with ur second guy...u guys seem like u get along well and u like to joke around with each other which is always good...not so much tension in the relationship|`|zxVfTFoEaa	1) well since i don't know the "long story" it's hard to tell.  if you forgive him, ask his forgiveness. tell him you don't want any tension between the two of you if being friends is asking too much.    2) if guy A has been avoiding you i would ask him why. if you've recently became 'popular' maybe he's heard the same rumors that guy B has heard. as far as B goes it doesn't sound like he likes you but he's trying to see how far he can get you to go. i may be wrong but what you've said makes him sound a little shady.  either confront them both, or forget it and move on.|`|dbaPuwv4aa	Uh, it doesn't sound too much like he likes you, but he might  have before you became 'popular'.
E8hYgxN1aa	well it depends if you know how to read her.  if so when you guys go to the movies see how she's acting towards you.  if she flirts---make a move.  if not just watch the movie as friends.    but if you can't read her.  i would just play it safe and not make a move.    hope i helped.|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	yea it mite make it a lil akward but for me im always like so nervous so that kinda makes it a lil akward 2|`|SOkhzMVDaa	put your arm around her and i bet she will think it is sweet. but your still very young so dont excpet more.|`|THVIIcuTaa	If you guys are best friends, then you can talk about anything really. So..just ask her if it would be okay to put your arm around her.(:|`|0cBEbHlHaa	u shud pit your arm around her...if she says something jst be lyk"dis is jst a friendship kinda thing"|`|XzkvqTyxaa	it depends if she is ready if not don't if so do so she said she liked you BUT she said you guys will just be friends at the movies take her advice to just be friends at the movies then tell her you like her the next day you see her then ask her out.|`|fY68d3mAaa	try touching her hand first, then after a few minutes try holding it. if she pulls away, then you know not to do anything else at that time. if she holds your hand back wait a few more minutes then put your arm around her. and you are 13. do not start rubbing her leg. thank you =]|`|aq6z5AF1aa	She just wants to be friends so don't put your arm around her.|`|rJah1F4Iaa	Well, if she likes you, she's not going to mind if you put her arm around her. Girls can be confusing for us dudes, but we're just as confusing for them, so don't try to play it off. Watch her body language, if she seems comfortable and whatnot, go for it.|`|hJSiC3wraa	i don't think you shouldn't do anything yet. See how the movie goes. and maybe after the movie give her a hug maybe a kiss on the cheek. she might not like if you do anything because she said that you guys were just going as friends.     but its up to you. good luck :)|`|aTMWP1T8aa	if she told u u guys were going just as friends then i wouldnt make a move...i would wait and talk to her after the movie, tell her u like her and see how she reacts|`|dzs8Ta2Waa	i would like it if a guy did that to me i am 13 too btw but any who if she told you shes likes you than says movies just as friends maybe shes was just scared that you didn't like her back and she didn't want to make it awkward  so yeah you should and see what shes does:)|`|4OBLRQb6aa	sure just put it around her and maybe kiss her cheek|`|lwTk5YMEaa	That's cute, as long as she's okay with it. =) Just don't go any further than that.     Good luck! I hope she likes you too. =)|`|h2hpowxZaa	you better tell her you like her before you do that or she will be like "what is your problem!" because you said that you were just going as friends. If you don't she will just think that you are trying to play with her feelings. So I suggest that you tell her first that you like her, and who knows, you might end up with a kiss! I remember when I was thirteen, and when a boy said one thing and did another, for a hormonal thirteen-year-old that just crushes your world, so be careful, and good luck.|`|a1WK8NtYaa	Aweee lol hold he hand, touchhh her leg etc.|`|GTja6ouWaa	awkward.....|`|Cn6UklwGaa	playfully put your arm around her as you walk in or out of the theater but not during the movie if she says you are just friends, unless she gives signs she wants it|`|cd13d95b2d87570276968a19cc52e0b5aa	Honestly if my best guy friend did that to me and I sort of liked him it'd be a little awkward at first, but I'd really like it. If she lets you, she'll be comfortable enough to make any further moves (such as her head on your shoulder)    I've been there done that haha I'm 14 : )

aL0uWmSLaa	well kid with good questions i've got to say this is a very good question and my advice to u is to not over think things just remember it's just talking to a person girls like to be treated like a normal person so what i say u do is ask her what her interests are and when she tells u them try and relate to them as much as possible and make sure u make her feel comfortable around u because the more comfortable she is the more comfortable you'll be hence making better conversation pieces like i said just try not to over think it bro she likes u just take a deep breath and relax    Hope i could help :)|`|Sej3YHDTaa	its not that complicated, if your too shy or nervous to talk to her in person why don't you write letters? its less difficult and easy to do.  first off write to her, then once you finish what you needed to write give her the letter, then later on she'll write you a letter its just like middle ages type of communication, well good luck ^_^|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	music is a terific convo starter. hmm... maybe say "ugh i cant get this song out of my head i love/ hate it!" or listen 2 ur ipod and bring up the whole music thing. hope fully she will be talkitive so she helps it flow to the next topic. do u have health class 2geter? that could be an interestin class 2 talk about! lol    lol try not to be random. one time the new neighbor boy asked if i had ever been called "PHAT" and i was like umm excuss me? and he spelt it and i was like wat then he was like it stands for pretty hot and temptin.i was like umm no! ya i was super creeped out i hadnt even known the guy for like a week  then the next day i was super sad and depressed and i was like " god just kill me!" then he was like u dont wanna die! dont u want to grow up and get married and have kids?! i was creeped out by this too. im still afraid and paranoid to take a shower because there is a window in my shower 2 the out side towards his hous and a picnic table outside the window... lol! i wait till late at night to take a shower now. LOL! but hes a lot less creepier now that i kinda know him.|`|n9rdIfaqaa	well just be natural about it dont try to hard to impress her and dont try to little ive been there before try starting a conversation based on something you both like|`|aTMWP1T8aa	well with my experiences with talking to guys...when they something really random it makes me laugh and then we start a conversation about that...its not terrible to say something totally random...it lightens up the conversation and lets things flow easier|`|YekLLS2Yaa	I would love if someone asked me what I thought of the sky.  It's a great question...    Anyway, there's always Music, that's my favorite discussion topic.  Or something along the lines of religion, novels, at my school we have deep discussions about intelligent issues. I'm not sure how you are though.  Another thing is TV, family, movies, just basic things.|`|lXVwGgHmaa	it doesn't matter if the subject is random. you could talk about sports or movies or music or people|`|4M9gnZMDaa	ask her what things she likes to do in her spare time  what time she wakes up or goes to bed  favorite food, favourite animal,color  basically anything  ask her about her oppinions on types of guys or girls  she wont think of anything stupid of you  your just getting along with her =]|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Find out what she likes. If you also like any of the stuff she likes, work off of that. Plenty of conversations are made easier because the people on both ends can relate to each other.    If it turns out you don't have much in common, then you'll probably be wanting her for more shallow reasons, which is really not worth it.    Just learn more about her. Talk with her like you would with anyone else.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Always revert the convo to her, ask her about hobbies, sports, favorite color animal anything, trust me.  Keep asking about her and make sure you remember what she say.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	look at what she has, if she got a phone, become curious and ask her about it then she prolly mention some other stuff and from there, flow into asking some more questions where you get to know her|`|xO0IjDpNaa	ask her whats up and try to get to know her by asking questions like whats your fav band or what sports she likes. that could lead into many other conversations.|`|hChy7BAPaa	maybe ask her what kind of music she's into...what does she enjoy doing...what's going on in the world...what class does she have next...is she doing anything after school?|`|tK9vi25Daa	if it were me i would talk about anything really. just bring in something random and show her...something like that. good luck =)    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|wjD7vLrVaa	lol its typical guys problem, i feel you bro.  Sorry i don't know how to answer that,  i'm a natural when it comes to the ladies,  my flow is natural.|`|vsX1SpyXaa	I would suggest talking about HER.  For example, ask her what kind of sports she plays, or like something like that.  Make sure your talking about her-then when that gets boring talk about you(a little). Haha|`|Xe6XVvf5aa	start up a conversation that you are both interested in the rest should follow
HNP2GWRcaa	okay girl 1 sounds okay but is there a spark? girl 2 sounds really good actually i think you should stop smoking marijuana though. she pretty cool. girl 3 okay well see here is my opinion. i had a bf who asked me out i said yes not even the next day he was talking about making out and having sex. btw im 13 and he is a grade above me. (im 7th he is in 8th) we go to the same school and had the same p.e. class. anyway he wanted to have sex well i wouldnt do it. he broke up with me i got really pissed and yelled at him and said well im sorryim not like anyof your ex girlfriends. this was three months ago. icould barely face him at school the next day. much less go to p.e. i almost skipped but i knew i would get caught. i couldnt stay home because then i would have to tell my parents what happened. anyway i see almost everyday now/ im ttrying really hard to focus on school. and everytime i see him i get a horrible flashback. sometimes i get freaked even to be near him. i still feel like ****. ya know i feel used even though nothing happened between us. but im 13 and i didnt deserve what he dished out to me. btw i was he second choice of a girl to go out with. anyway girl number 3 is 14 you say. and if you had sex with her then walked away imagine how she would feel. dude think about what your doing before you do it, you could ruin her.  id stick with number 2. if you want go to my profile and email me back.|`|68tZ5fmWaa	You treat it like you're picking off a menu. I don't think any of them should get involved with you. You're way too immature. lol|`|AA11728166	not  3 hon its ok ur down that u got out of relationship but dont put on a 14 yr old plzzz umm i think u should try  2 sounds lik u hav much better relationship wid err and about the beardd dependss if u have a long face then shave ittt if u dont just get it to a short shot length :) nn the pottt u dont have to mention if u only do it that lil...just if it becomes a habit she needs to noo :)
sB7zvcZtaa	My gf and I have the same problem. We have been dating for almost 6 months, but she doesn't want any physical contact at all. To my regret, I formed a solutuion of masturbating to release all the sexual hype. I want to share this with her, but she just won't let me. This decision is all up to you, if affection is a big part of your relationships and you are really falling for your friend, then go for it. If you consider yourself being shallow and not loving him for himself, then get back together.|`|hUsW2Iymaa	Well something important to you is missing in the relationship. Shoot, Id hate my bf not kissing me too! Really really talk to him and show him you mean it hopefully hell try harder.  You could also make the first move on your bf more?|`|BqrQFLH5aa	um its cheating. cheating is black and white, always always wrong.     dont break your boyfriend's heart because you want a kiss. why dont you kiss him once in a while, be the initiator? or if its that bad break up with the poor guy. but dont break his heart like this: i dated a guy who'd been cheated on and i can say from personal experience it leaves scars.     just dont do it|`|wjD7vLrVaa	Yes mam, you are wrong don't cheat on him.  Just kiss your boyfriend!! and get what you want!  Problem solved.|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	Don't cheat. You will destroy the poor guy. If you're going to go out and kiss someone else then maybe you should think about breaking up with your man first.    On the other hand.. maybe this is just the kind of thing that will make your bf realize just how lucky he is to have you and he may start making more of an effort. You run the risk however of him never forgiving you. And if thats not a risk you're willing to take then its probably not the best idea.    Instead, I think your best bet is to talk about it with him some more. Get to the bottom of things. Maybe there is another reason why he doesn't like kissing. I mean, who doesn't like kissing really?! Explain to him that you can't be in a relationship with no kissing and romance and either he makes more of an effort or you break up with him.
HBWp3Fxhaa	If your biological father is a virgin...what strange world have you entered?|`|so9M313daa	Uhm, how is that even possible?

S-E-X?
AA10440098	First of all, your future daughter in law is very lucky to have an understanding mother in law to be! It sounds like you are supportive of the bride and really trying to keep the peace at the same time. It must be tough!  Now, while it's understandable that her mother doesn't want people to look down at her daughter, wearing a white wedding gown does not have the same connotation of virginity these days. Every bride is entitled to a white dress. Perhaps you can discuss this with someone traditional that the bride's mother respects and ask them to talk to her? I don't know what your religion says about this - if anything at all - but perhaps even an understanding priest or minister could assure her that her daughter may wear white?  Good luck and congratulation!!|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Her mother should stay home with an attitude like that. See if she wants you to try to talk some sense into her mom.|`|CqR6daqnaa	IIt's not a big deal, except to very few old-fashioned people. In this day and age, half the brides aren't virgins when they get married, but nobody cares if they wear white. The only  person who will have a problem is her mom.    If her mother isn't willing to attend her own daughter's wedding over a DRESS, then if I was that girl I'd say fine, don't come (and I'd be thinking one less mouth to feed). Just explain to mom that people would be a lot more weirded out if her daughter wears anything OTHER than white, and that it's no longer taboo to not wear a white dress even if the bride already has a child.    Good luck!|`|RJU9LMyyaa	I'm not hispanic,  but I am traditional in many ways. No, it is not wrong to wear a white wedding dress these days. White is Beautiful and very acceptable. It is the veil over the head (covering the face) that should not be done. It is perfectly fine to wear white! It is her first wedding. A veil is great too. Just not over the head. Tell your daughter in-law not to be upset, it's ok.     congratulations!|`|s6HO32hIaa	Tell her to wear the white dress!! So many people will try and tell you what to do and in the end the only people who really matter are the bride and groom. You spend so much time trying to make other people happy and it takes away from your own happiness. If she wants to wear the white dress, that is the only thing that matters! And no... I was with my husband for 8 years before we got married and was not a virgin when we got married. I wore a white dress and everyone loved it!|`|m0WUEtqXaa	What I understand is that you only omit the veil if you have kids. White is optional.Its her wedding , she decides....|`|ECe1rgsdaa	The old rules do not apply, if they did, there wouldn't be too many brides in white! I certainly wouldn't be ;)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Oh, that's so sad. There's nothing wrong with her wearing a white dress, just not a full-out pouffy wedding gown. There are lots of lovely styles out there which would be just right.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I would tell her mom to shove her thoughts where the sun don't shine. White is a common wedding gown color, whether you be a virgin or not. Let her not attend. Why would she want such an evil woman there?|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I expect it is a bigger deal in some cultures than in others.  In the broader North American culture, a white dress doesn't actually mean anything anymore.  Heck, women wear red and even black for wedding gowns.    Is there any hope that you can help get her Mother to soften her position on this topic?    This young woman is very lucky to be getting such a caring, compassionate woman for her mother-in-law.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	Tell your fdil to wear what she wants! If her mother doesn't come to the wedding, then that is on her mother.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	I've always thought that the white dress was for the Bride's first wedding, and the white over-the-face veil was for a virgin.  So, she can wear the white dress, but she cannot cover her face.    Your son and daughter in law to be are indeed very lucky to have you and your support.|`|utQC6dhjaa	just tell her to tell her mom that they she went back to the store to get the same dress that was exactly the same but was actually a little off white. problem solved|`|AA11029380	She can and should wear whatever she wants.  Too bad her mom might miss the big day but I say the girl is very lucky to have a future MIL like you.|`|6qgIXITSaa	There is nothing to be ashamed of honey. Look im a latina and in my church we have weddings in white gowns when the bride has like 4 sons. This is her wedding, her chance to shine. If her mom doesnt approve her then screw her. Maybe she doesnt want her daughter to marry or she never had a wedding in white. but her daughter can wear anything!|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	If you are friends with the mom maybe it would help if you had a chat. Otherwise all I can say is that it is not taboo to wear a white gown with a child.|`|di6p10Ifaa	She should wear it!! It is her wedding and the bride should wear what she wants to. White doesn't mean pure anymore, some old timers think so but it doesn't. Be there for her as best as you can. Comfort her and let her know that you support her and you think she is gorgeous! she is really going to need this support from you.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	she can wear whatever she wants.  her Mother is wrong to try to interfere.|`|AA10776535	You tell her to wear that white dress, if her mother doesn't come that's her loss.  It your future daughter in laws wedding, not her mothers.  Its not taboo, never has been its a sign of wealth not purity.|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	This poor girls mother sounds despicable! I feel sorry for her. A girl really needs the support and love that only a mother (apparently with the exception of this mother) can give.    In this day and age a bride can wear any color she wants. It is just a color and does not represent ones  sex life or the lack thereof.    Tell the poor child she can wear white and to tell her mother to .......  well you get the idea!|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Not at all. The whole "white for purity" thing is false anyway -- white for wedding gowns became popular in the 1800's after Queen Victoria wore a white gown. Because she was the ultimate in fashion at the time, it became a status symbol to be able to wear a white gown (since most people could only afford to own a few clothes and white was an impractical colour).     It's HER wedding. If she wants to wear white, she should be able to. Let her know that she has the support of your family 100% and try to impart upon her how important her happiness is on this day.|`|9ykAQxJxaa	Well I don't want to put her Mother down, but I think that is awful that she would make her feel so badly for wearing a (traditional) white gown for her first marriage.    What her Mother is referring to is that white is supposed to be a symbol of purity for a bride.  Since she already has a child, that is why it's "breaking the rule" so-to-say.    I'll be honest...I think the taboo is a bunch of sh*t if you ask me.  Worry more about the couple's love and dedication for each other is what I say!  It's her day, she can wear whatever she wants...and she's going traditional...a path that cannot be steared wrong.    Good luck!!|`|BgVWSApdaa	If she already has a beautiful white dress, would her mother approve of her putting a few colored ribbons on it?  I am divorced and when and if I get remarried, I would never wear a white dress, but I would maybe wear a white dress with maybe pink ribbon worked in somehow.  If she did something like that, maybe she could work some pink into the veil or hair decor.  I know my parents, if they would even attend, would have a fit if I wore white by itself.  I guess the tradition is still very important to some people, and I still respect it too.
TfPDMDZMaa	Wedding receptions are so expensive. You have to pay for everything by the person. Cake by the slice. Dinner by the plate. It's not that they don't want children, it's just they are trying to cut costs. Adults are going to remember the wedding reception and actually enjoy the $45 meal that they are being served.     I understand how you feel. My dad always said if my kids aren't welcomed, then I'm not welcomed.     I also understand the bride and groom's request - just going through my own wedding.     If you really feel strongly about being able to bring your child, then explain to the bride why you won't be able to come. They'll understand and appreciate being able to invite another person that they probably wouldn't have been able to invite due to budget restrictions.    Also I say - just try to keep in mind the bride and groom are beyond stressed out planning this day. So sometimes it's best to just keep to your opinions, and celebrate a special moment in your friends life.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	hmmmm...sounds to me like someone else is being selfish.    can anyone guess who i mean????|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I'm with you on this, but just don't use the word 'selfish' - maybe misguided...  Weddings are for families and friends to celebrate - so that includes children - yes, for both the ceremony and reception.  I get freaked sometimes when I read on here of a bride trying to plan a wedding, yet she has never been a guest at one. That just seems to odd to me - having missed on wonderful experiences attending weddings as a child.  We went to tons of weddings as kids - learned about love, commitment, socializing, practiced dancing, and all the social niceties to boot.  And, like you, out of dozens of weddings - all had a full open bar (except one which was a cash bar) - and NO problems.|`|PBdPD748aa	They are not selfish. just because people are asked if they would like to attend their ONCE IN A LIFETIME wedding they request a night for adults only its one night that kids are asked seperate from their parents.    I recently went to my cousins wedding and on their first dance there were kids (from different families) running around them in a circle screaming on the dance floor, not to mention during important speeches etc.    Why dont people have the right to choose whether they want children or not for their special night.    My advice to you - if you dont like it, dont go.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Here are some reasons why:    Kids get bored at weddings.    Kids like kid food, not 3 course wedding food.    Parents have to constantly monitor their kids behavior and not fully enjoy the night.    Parents have to leave early for the kids sake.    Kids are happier to be elsewhere playing games, rather than sitting quietly on their best behavior.    Everyone who attends a wedding costs money, when you have 12 cousins on each side wanting to bring their kids it really adds up ($2500 for me)    And kids can make alot of noise not realising they are being rude on a day when there are no do overs. Babies crying during vows, take the kid outside for gods sake!      Or you can just have an adults only wedding an avoid all this.  I'm not paying $20,000 (sorry $22,500 with kids) to be pissed off all day and worrying about others. There is a clause in my contract that all children have to be supervised at all times (they have had incidents before). If something happens to the property or the child "I" am responsible, not the parents.|`|AA11312653	You have a rather overwhelming sense of entitlement. There is nothing selfish about hosts choosing for themselves what sort of affair they wish to sponsor or in choosing the guests they wish to invite. That some of their guests may have children is not their concern, nor should it be. People who choose to become parents must deal with that responsibility as best they can, and not whinge and carp when hosts are unwilling to sacrifice their own wishes for the sake of parental convenience. People who cannot bear to parted from their offspring for a day are people who do not deserve to have a social life.    The whole tone of your "it's so selfish of people not to cater to my own preferances" question is laughable.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I agree that it's selfish. Adults in this day and age don't like kids in general because most parents don't know how to do their job and let them run wild and don't teach them any manners. Then they punish the ones that do raise their children properly and to be well-behaved saying that all kids are hellions when that is not true.     I went to tons of weddings as a kid and had a great time. But I was also raised in a strict home where you learned the proper place and time to let loose and when to behave.     I agree with you that there is nothing damaging about children being exposed to alcohol. It's not like anyone is forcing them to drink it and people know not to let them do so. But being in the same room won't kill them or turn them in wild animals, contrary to popular belief. Being overprotective is just as harmful to them as being neglectful.    The other thing that I don't get is people who invite them to the wedding quarantine them to a room with a tv babysitter for the duration of the reception. I have never seen anything like that in my life at any wedding I have attended, nor was there any need to do so. Every wedding I have been to with kids in attendance, they were able to entertain themselves with no problem and spent most of the time on the dance floor. But some people here believe that is harmful as well. Perhaps because kids shouldn't be exposed to adult music? Have never once seen a kid stick their finger in the cake either but apparantly that happens at every wedding as well and anyone who claims otherwise is delusional.|`|8IfePMa3aa	Selfish or not it's HER day, she can do whatever she wants. if she doesn't want to pay for the children being there and/or having them running around on her special day, it's within her right to request it.  If you don't like it, don't attend.|`|AA10690306	If the majority of those being invited are older and have no children living with them it is not selfish, it is a very thoughtful thing to do.  Especially if there is alcohol at the reception.|`|AA11138696	Children especially small ones often become tired and bored at such adult funcitons and begin to act out.  Many parents have not given their children any training and they could easily disrupt a very important day.     What would be selfish for parents to bring children to Adults Only receptions.  The bride has a right to be able to celebrate her marriage any way she wants.  The groom has this right as well and if they want an Adult affair it is their right and not selfish in the least.  If a parent does not want to get or cannot afford a baby sitter that parent should stay at home with their child.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	People have every right to have their wedding their way.   Why call them selfish??? just because it does not suit you??? You are the one being selfish.  thinking only of your situation in regard to their day.  I do not enjoy children running and making noise at a gathering of any kind.  If I have dinner out, I plan to go to an expensive restraurant after 8pm.  I do not go to a place that welcomes families.|`|agTCqkLDaa	My mom always took us to weddings-the worst thing that happened is my sister decided to hide under the table and taste all of the cookies...but only half way and so graciously return them.  Aside from this, we were fairly well behaved and I stopped her, took the cookies off the tray, and we went elsewhere.  We were 2 and 6.  The bride fortunately found it humorous/cute as well.    I guess it's because of those parents who DO have whiny, dirty brats (and let's face it we all know at least one couple who doesn't practice proper discipline) that it's a lot easier than saying "all of you with well behaved children are welcome at our wedding; all of you with brats need to find a sitter.  You know who you are" because they don't know who they are.    I think kids should be allowed at the wedding, but I think a kids center/table/blah blah is a waste of money.  If you're going to bring your kids to a wedding, they need to be able to handle the food and the atmosphere.    ETA:  Of course, my sister and I could entertain ourselves with very little mischievous; I was her supervisor and 99.9% of the time successful, we liked grown up food (not all kids like "kid" food), we never had to leave early, we didn't scream and cry during the ceremony, we danced during the receptions.    Some parents just don't discipline and for that reason is why some weddings are adult only.      I can understand it, but I think weddings should be celebratory for all from birth to death!|`|s6stLtvLaa	They are not being selfish.  If you are having a wedding that will be in the evening, you often get cranky kids up past their bedtimes.  The bride and groom would probably rather not have screaming kids during significant part of the ceremony or reception.      My brother and sister-in-law had a wedding that went until 11:30 at night.  They asked that no kids be there.  Perfectly understandable.  I got married last february and I had kids all over the place (not to mention I was pregnant!).  When I sent out invitations I told everyone to bring their children to the wedding.  Everyone was well behaved since my wedding was during the day and was over by 4 in the afternoon, so there were not to many cranky babies (I had allot of 3 and under kids there).  I could not have imagined my day without kids around.  But, I can understand some brides and grooms not wanting cranky children around at 10 at night screaming while someone is giving a speech, or they are having their special dance.  My husband and I had our dance interrupted because my niece wanted to dance with him, so I ended up dancing with his 1 year old cousin.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I see it differently. I think parents who expect their child to be invited to everything are being selfish.  Would you ask a 10-year-old to go to the bachelor party with drinking & strippers?  I really hope you would believe that the location & situation is inappropriate.  The same can be said for some wedding venues.  Not that there would be half-naked women disrobing at a wedding, but some venues aren't child-friendly ( I actually scrapped the museum venue my fiance & I LOVED because we are allowing kids to attend the wedding ).    It wouldn't bother me for a child to cry during the vows or to be fussy during the toasts.  What does bother me are parents these days who insist on bringing their child out then fail to watch or supervise them - - and this happens all too often.  The kids at my engagement party almost tore a chandelier down because the parents were off in a corner chatting and nobody was keeping an eye on them.    I sincerely have no problem with an adults-only reception, nor do I see them as selfish, because I see time & time again parents who will take their kid somewhere and let the child get into things or even get hurt - - then its the fault of the party-throwers or the venue, not the parents who weren't watching.    Most kids ought to have a bedtime and weddings very often run late into the night, so now you have a pack of overtired & cranky kids, too.  And the parents never seem to have the brains to anticipate that their kid needs to go to bed at a certain time and hire a sitter anyway when they are permitted to attend the wedding.    I am allowing kids at my wedding because the guests will have to travel & likely spend the night in our area in order to attend and I felt that was inappropriate to exclude the kids because finding a sitter overnight is not an easy task and I didn't think it would be right to saddle my guests with that burden.  BUT since I am allowing the kids, I have asked select people to help me buy things for the kids to do (coloring/crafts), I have asked other people to watch the cake to ensure the kids don't touch it (they did that at my engagement party, too), and I am providing the DJ with cheap little props & give-away items to help keep the kids occupied.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Honestly, there are so many sides to this argument that I agree with.  I'm not against kids at a wedding, but I don't think it should be against the law to exclude kids either.      Personally, I've never seen a child ruin a wedding.  I think it's the few trouble makers that spoil it for most kids.  It's the lazy parents who don't feel like teaching their kids manners that give other children a bad rap.    But it all depends on the situation.  I agree with nova queen here.  You wouldn't take your kid to a bar or a club (not that you could anyways but you know what I'm saying).  About a year ago I went to a New Years Eve wedding where there was full open bar and the reception went past midnight.  That's not kid appropriate.  There is a time and a place for kids.    So no, I don't think it's selfish.|`|8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	I recently went to an adult only wedding - I think it was because it was at a really nice place that was expensive and they couldn't afford for all the kids to go.  I know there are a lot of kids in her family so I'm sure some people felt hurt by it, but in the end, it's their day so you have to go with whatever they decide.  A babysitter for one night is not so bad....|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	I get if they don't want them at the cermony, but at the reception...i don't get it. But when people do request it, I think they should provide babysitting services for guests. I can see myself having an adults-only reception, but if I did that I would provide a babysitter for all the kids and have them nearby (like at the same hotel).|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	I agree with you,They are being selfish,I understand that it is there Bid day,But Children need  to be included as well.Someday they will see how it feels when They get an invite that say No children aloud and we will see how hurt and mad they are.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Because adults need some time together with other adults, without children... and children don't enjoy weddings anyway.....    I think if I were throwing a big wedding, I would provide child care.. somewhere else....|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	I see both sides of it. I was a good kid and around 5 or 6 when my mom told me that I wasn't invited to my cousin's wedding. I felt really hurt and I haven't forgotten that feeling until this day, especially when I see my cousin.   However I do understand why people would not want screaming kids at their wedding. (I would never have acted that way and I was so confused as to why I was being excluded. I was hurt.)  I see both sides. If it was my wedding I would probably allow kids but I think that we should try to avoid judging others who have dreamed of this day since they were kids themselves and are anal (I'm allowed to say this b/c I am in many ways) and want everything to run smoothly.  EDIT  I saw a question yesterday in which a woman was having nightmares that something bad would go wrong during the vows/ceremony! That's how nervous they get about it. It is like it is the best day of their life and everything needs to be 100% perfect or else it will be horrible. (I think it's kind of sad but it's true that they feel that way. Our society is obsessive.) In any case respect is key!|`|YHcyuka3aa	Since it is the Bride and Grooms day, they have every right to ask that children be left out of the reception. I have been at some weddings where the children are simple out of control and wreck the day by being unattended. They leave cake and food every where and make a playground out of the hall. I don't think it is selfish because a wedding is something one won't be able to do over. It also depends on the theme of the reception. If it is catered to adult theme the why would you want your children at something like that? I personally would feel much better with them some place else and besides that, i could enjoy the reception better myself. Get a setter and enjoy a good time without having to herd the children.|`|HRCdQ2vdaa	Inconvenient ? Everyone has phones, it's faster to find a sitter   then to take a shower.   Bride and Groom are paying for each person who attends.   Not the guests.   Preference, it's their day. That's not being selfish.   Not everyone drinks.   If "MeMeMe" is their mentality, good for them- it's their day.  If children are not invited and someone doesn't approve---  Then stay home and Congratulate the Happy Couple.     Cheers!|`|2P2K0rl2aa	"Leave all the whiny, dirty brats at home, so the rest of us can get drunk in peace." Well I guess that pretty much sums it up for a lot of people.    It's really an adults 'time out' from running around after kids all day and all night.        I won't be having them at my reception.  Selfish?  Maybe.  Do I care?  Nope.    So if you don't want to attend wedding receptions who won't allow kids that's your choice.  But don't give other people a hard time about their wedding - it's their choice who they invite and who they won't invite.|`|b69f867cd0e8c768ad08a228c35f9b04aa	So very overentitled. Just because you're a parent doesn't mean that the world must now bend to you. You chose to spawn, you live with the consequences - which means getting a babysitter when needed.    Would you complain to your boss that the company dinner is not child-friendly? Would you complain and throw a hissy fit if your adult friends wanted an adult night out to dinner or a bar? Why is it that parents can get a babysitter for any other adult-only activity, but throw overentitled hissy fits when it comes to a wedding? Someone else's wedding, I might add. Paid for by someone else's wallet.    Your party, you call the shots. Their party, they call it.|`|AA11545997	1st of all it's the right of the Bride and Groom to say NO children.  Thats not being selfish. If you don't like it, then do as you do and stay home, no one is forcing you to go.  But, it is nice to be able to go to a wedding and not have to worry about the kids.
K5IOSGXAaa	He told her he had a crush on you to try to get you out of her life, it's just one more trick to control her. Insecure little weasels do this to their women, also keep them isolated from the world, physically abuse them etc. What a creep. Having said that, your friend is pretty empty headed to get pregnant yet again. Tell her to get her tubes tied when she delivers this time. There is only so much you can say to her or actually do, she has to decide this guy's a total loser and get out of the mess she's put herself into. You can just keep telling her that she has to be strong and think of her children, does she really want them around this guy? maybe that will give her the strength to get away from him. That is a sad situation to watch, but you really can't do too much, you can't live someone else's life for them.|`|AA11644956	This is the thing:    she wanted to live a bit of a low-life lifestyle when she wanted to have the first baby. the fact that she didn't use contraceptives to prevent the 2nd pregnancy shows the level of her maturity (a baby doesn't make you grown).    i'm sorry that he's hitting her, but SHE has to make the decision to leave him. that's real talk.    and it's probably best that you stay away unless he's not home. see, i'm like you. i would stand up for my friend, but things that you say can get her smacked later. so you gotta chill out.    all you can do is be there to listen when she calls. tell her that you'll be there if she was to ever leave him (if this means letting her live with you or helping her move back to her parents. whatever).    again, SHE has to be ready to leave him. she can say she wants to leave, but she won't until she is really ready.              -----  Check out my fashion site:    www.styleandregalia.com|`|5GL2eFhyaa	this is bad...wtf is with her parents letting her get pregnant 2ce when shes that age?

Vf0bmaVGaa	You seem to be a very nice person and you get along with everyone. I think the reason your friends leave you is because they want you to make a choice. You might as well face it, you can please all of the people some of the time but you can't please all of the people all of the time.     If you are not ready to choose which group you want to be with then you may eventually loose the one that is trying to make you choose. As far as, "are they your friends" only time will tell. Each person is different. Don't judge them as a group but as individuals. It would be nice if everyone was like you but they aren't. Good luck!|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	lol i got a little confused there, but n e ways,  group b are NOT ur friends hun.  leaving u behind is just like being a "third" wheel to them.  do u really want to be considered a "tag along" to them?  lots of times, girls can say that they are ur friends but then as u walk away they start talking trash about u.  as for Group B, they sound like a very nice bunch who can help u along with school.  who would u rather have?  friends that leave u behind/make u feel bad?  OR friends that are nice/care about u + help u out with ur schooling at the same time?  its ur choice  but id go for group B. lol i dont really like book worms myself BUT they are super nice and really they are ALWAYS true friends in the end.  remember that.   good luck.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Group "A" doesn't sound like they are your friends if they are ignoring you.

Stay true to yourself.|`|qpGbQ3Zlaa	Friend's should be your friend regardless of who YOU'RE friends with.

Group B will be in college, having fun (at college parties) and meeting new people.      which Group is appealing in the long run???      you can still be cool with Group A, but you don't need to hang tough with them.     you know why they ditch school? because they don't feel the need to be there. it's not important.    you know why they ditch you? because they don't feel the need to hang out with you at the moment. you're not important.      think about it!    good luck!          ----  Check out my fashion site:    www.styleandregalia.com|`|V4LSo3iDaa	Group B is the one you should be friends with though, as you said may be boring but they like you for who you are and that better than someone that just ignores you
3PlT64Yuaa	The reason why you're not getting dates is because you're setting your standards too high. I'm sure you've heard that "nobody's perfect". It would be in your best interest to settle for someone who is human, and not someone who fits your list of 100+ must-have qualities.     Besides, do you believe that you are perfect? If you aren't perfect, why would "the perfect guy" want you? What do you have to offer a guy that has no weakness?     Find a guy that has what you lack, but lacks what you have. This balance naturally makes for the most stable relationships.    Life isn't a fairy tale, but if you open your eyes to truth of human imperfection, you will find beauty in areas you have never even thought of.  relationships.    p.s.

Thats all what a girl wants these days! Am I wrong or what???|`|kA1mYSOtaa	There are three major components of female interest in a man:    1. Confidence  2. Self-control  3. Challenge    With the first, women do not want a guy that they can walk all over. They want a MAN, not a doormat. A woman may stay with a guy who is a doormat for a while, but then she loses respect for him. Once that happens, assume the position because you just got dumped.    With the second, a woman does NOT want a man to fall all over her in an instant, no matter what that movie "He's Just Not That Into You" would have you believe. That's nothing but brainwashing crap that you would see on Oprah (no offense intended for you Oprah fans, understand. you can't help it if you buy that stuff). A woman wants a man who does NOT always agree with her, who does not always say, "I don't know. What do YOU want to do?", or a man who cannot stand up for himself. He must be mentally and emotionally strong or else respect is out the window.    Finally, challenge is an important aspect. Women love the chase. In fact, the successful man will let a woman chase him until HE catches HER. I don't mean pushing her away. What I mean is not spilling your guts on the first five or six dates. I mean responding to her every now and then, but NOT every time she says or does something. I mean keeping your hands to yourself and allowing HER to initiate contact, which she would only do if she is interested in the first place. Anyway, I hope this helps.|`|kCurvcj7aa	a pack, but not like way out there, just like flat tummy with the 'lines' a bit noticeable, ya know?  and a cute face, nice eyes/smile. healthy looking. no BIG acne prob.    haha, yah.|`|WMem5AGoaa	Great smile,fresh breath,eyes that are nice not cross eyed,great personality, great clean hands,arms,NO body oder and wearing a nice smelling after shave lotion/ cologne.

fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	You already have a general answer out of him, that is, yes, he is willing to help. Good. Procrastinator as we all are, he doesn't have the right habits of when and what needs to be done. You might have to provide more guidance at the beginning. Ask him for concrete things, for example "Honey, could you please pick up some oranges on the way home? Our youngest asked for them." This would give him a very tangible task that pleases you. This is just an example I came up with, cause you didn't say exactly what you would you like him to do for you. Eventually, he will develop this "caring muscle", but he needs a coach. That would be you.|`|kgZar9ZRaa	Be honest with your husband, and whatever you do, don't be judgmental. If you want to weather difficulties in your marriage, always approach them in a humble manner. Don't appoint blame, but just state the problem. People who are verbally attacked usually attack back, but if you use honesty and humility, placing yourself below them, not above, they will usually listen and be able to 'hear' you. If you're angry and you don't want to be, tell him that. If you're exhausted, just do what you can and let him know why you can't do everything-but above all be HUMBLE about it. Relationships crumble fast when each person is selfish.  All the best.|`|aOinzEvYaa	You have to graciously submit to your husband and recognize his authority over you.

d08rkYlpaa	Go ahead, you are not genetic cousins. This is not one of the things you need to worry about.   Getting pregnant is something to worry about. Consider what is best for her future. If you like her, and care about her, then take care of her, be a good person, more than just a sex partner.  Even if you were real cousins, it would not be a huge problem - most of the world lets cousins get together. 20 percent of all marriages in the world are cousins.  Don't stop the phone sex though, it's fun! Also, it helps you keep up your relationship, as long as you don't get selfish about it.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	If you aren't related it's no big deal.

wZs5dmvbaa	Well .... =P ....     You did the right thing before, because you obviously didn't like him at the time. Now you do.     It's human nature to be confused about if you really like some1 or not (think of me and cracker =/). Unless you are the type of person who has no problem making a move on a guy, there is really nothing you can do. Obviously he liked you before for who you are, so its not like you have to do anything either.  But, if you really wants this (ttly unknow) guy to ask you out again, you're gonna have to show him that you like him, because otherwise he'll probably be a little scared too since you blew him off before (excuse the sumwhat mean phrase). but other than that just be yourself. there is no need to change. he likes you for who you are. Believe me on that one Nessie! =P
35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	I find it a little weird that you say you "have to have her," she's not a possession. However, if you want to ask her out, make sure she feels the same way. You aren't going to keep her back from leaving for college if you tell her your feelings, she's still going to leave, so make sure you're going to be okay with that. Don't tell her everything you told us, because that comes across as a little forward and possibly overbearing, but tell her that you like her a lot, and you wondered if she reciprocated the feelings.      Good luck though.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	You should get her to hang out with you a couple times, movies or something, and then after about 3 "unofficial dates/hangouts" you can try to ask her if she'll be your girlfriend.

If you don't want to talk to him, try doing an activity that he does (like a boy and girl sport or play or something) that involves teamwork and then he may talk to you instead of you having to talk to him. what i did is my cross country team is really small and he did the sport so every one on the team became like best friends. Once you become more friendly with him you'll want to talk to him. Also, what you can do is try standing next to him (or near) in line for lunch. (if your in the same grade). He probably won't reject you for just talking to him. I would wait until you actually know him before you ask him out or something. Sometimes, if you and your friends go to the movie or the mall or something, you could ask your friends to invite him and some of his other friends. Also, try to be funny around him because alot of guys like funny girls. good luck and hope this helps!|`|G2K8gsKLaa	lol those people at the top wrote the same thing.. almost|`|2tklFwnHaa	ummm to be honest if you get rejected u'll get over it... its just 8th grade...ur like wat 12-13, you still have high school ahead of u remember that|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	Just start of by talking to him. If you really like him, then ask him out. If you're not interested...well, I think it's a bit obvious.|`|hHKagR8Zaa	just go for it!|`|SnYyUMJ2aa	Guys like girls who are straightforward and confident. Ask him!|`|Z7RiriL6aa	You're in 8th grade this is ridiculous.|`|H5DdF6V9aa	Stop yelling. Sheesh.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	I say since he is popular, he must be social, speaking to him is the only way to heat up anything, suck it up if you like him that much.  if you have a class with him, talk about that ask him for help, even if he's dumb and you know it.    base your conversations on facts.  smile his way, "accidentally" bump into him and apologize, do do it so harsh.    have a friend that talks to him ask him over to hang out with your friend and tag along.|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	well itz not like ur gonna ask him out caz datz just something gurls dont do but start a conversation flirt look ur best be his friend and in a matter of time he will ask U out ,,lol -- goood luck|`|hw6mnbzHaa	just go for it.|`|s3AwAF4saa	make up your mind girl!  just do it|`|EShN5zNcaa	Try talking to him! You'll know if doesn't like you. trust me.
Lj2mo4ooaa	You leave, but you try to plan it out so that she has support around her to help her through it.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Hypothetical questions are stupid . There would be no way to know that outcome would occur.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You stay and get marriage counseling.    Remember the vows you made to your wife.|`|vSJIorF7aa	First off I doubt the person found is your soulmate. That seems like the case often, when on is unhappy in a marriage. I don't believe you have tried hard enough, because a marriage can work, and obviously the woman was loved or you wouldn't have married her. Counseling, books, support groups, church affiliated counseling, etc. can help.  I would say, stay. But if all hope is lost and life is just unbearable, then leave.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Leave. Better for the both of you in the long run. But is the soul mate going to trust you after you left one for another?|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Many people are -constantly- thinking they've found their "soul mates", only to realize -later on- that they might not have made the right choice. Once you start living with your new "soul mate" and everyday things begin to turn your life into the habitual, routine-like, and ordinary, you'll meet someone else who you'll designate your new soul mate. Maybe you need to work harder at making your marriage work.  Talk to your wife and ask her to do her part if you're willing to do yours.|`|JA1Fo0O6aa	If you think that you have met your soul mate then you should be married to someone else. Fear of hurting her is fair enough but staying with her out of pity is worse. if youre heart isnt in it its not in it. talk to her|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Anyone who gets left will have a nervous breakdown of some sort. It's really what would make you the happiest.  Just be as sympathetic to your wife as possible. She will eventually move on.|`|91sBjTtAaa	if the marriage is over then you should leave and be with the one you love but get help for your wife|`|fE5bC83Saa	do you really care about your wife and marriage???  i think you can find the answer|`|AH9i63ydaa	I'm VERY interested in seeing your best answer.  Great question...gold star for you, my friend.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	You leave, staying in a relationship for the benefit of someone else will do no good for either of you. If it's over it's over, there's nothing you can do about how she handles it, and frankly it's not your responsibility. It may sound harsh, and yes there should be consideration for the other person in a relationship, but not when it's over. There comes a point when your feelings and needs have to be recognized and followed, regardless of what the other person will do. If you don't follow your heart, you're denying yourself the whole point of living.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	you stay    you made a commitment to your wife and the vows you took cannot be broken.|`|XVh1uf4Taa	You do not stay with someone you are not happy with.  It's probably gonna end anyway and if you see it now you should do something about it now.  However you need to do it in the most adult, mature way, making sure the other is going to be taken care of, talk to the family and friends of your significant other, ask them to be a shoulder for that person for a while and to take care of them until they get on their feet.  Don't rub it in their face that you have someone else, just let them know you love them, but its not working out. :D
77tcUSoUaa	most welcome & thank you. by the way , is it a farewell posting?|`|59CaFeS8aa	take a little water with the pills.|`|BfDM12ptaa	lol..thats a releif frm trolls! thanks !|`|Pl9lY7qCaa	Most welcome & thank you also.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Your Most Welcome and Thank You Too..|`|JTqiOaFcaa	most welcum|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	You are welcome|`|tK9vi25Daa	haha ok|`|UetO2I77aa	ok, where are you going with out me?
jpMoKkAkaa	tell him to snatch his dads *** in the bear trap|`|tHHHN9RFaa	might sound crazy but... you cant do nothing about it... if hes under 16 you cant do nothing about it. and if he if yea you should tell him to go over for a little while... and oh yea.. you can do one thing... CALL THE COPS|`|c4203ee224c3590cdd56e6c94008ab09aa	the smartest thing to do is to contact the Authority'ss and let them handle it.... and that will be the best  for him also. If you want to bring him to your house make sure its ok with your parents but still call the police to notify them of child abuse.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	tell him to come to your house...thats sad :( maybe you should call the police!|`|EQydFhzmaa	Take action. This is a serious issue. I'm not sure how old you (or him for that matter) are, and you don't have to say, but if you are underage, I would suggest having a parent or trusted adult help you in this situation. I would report this, and see if his mother or another family member would be able to take care of him. If you are of age, perhaps he could live with you. Do the right thing, but do it so that it won't hurt him - be responsible.|`|60UGQvMSaa	Tell your boyfriend to man up and sock him in the jaw. If that doesn't work, break out the shotgun, OR! Punch him in the eye, then go tell police it was his step dad.|`|M0mVCl4Uaa	u cnt do anything about it, im just gonna be straight up. if he wants sumthin done, he'll do it himself. let him lead his life, not u|`|xTwWM6UFaa	do whatever you can to keep him emotionally stable.  make sure he knows your here for him, that you love him. ive dealt with abuse, and the most important thing is to make sure he knows you love him, and want to help.  physical help is harder, yes, try to keep him away from his house as much as you can because that COULD mean safety, but you could also get him in trouble, so never ever keep him after curfew or break rules, that could be worse for him  if you can, carry advil or something with you too, you never know if hell be hurting when you see him.  good luck, and if it gets too serious, you HAVE to tell a parent or teacher, he could get seriously hurt.|`|ZH1IE8kLaa	get him out of there. i don't care how you do it or what you have to do.. but get him out of there. to be honest.. you should seriously call the police. abuse is never ok. EVER. get help and get help now.|`|AA11462348	Have him live with you for a bit  Let him run away|`|Gv69MTKuaa	call social services|`|jPLiMCPDaa	Tell a school counselor.  They have the authority to investigate and help him.|`|L2xa4gvYaa	YES..tell him to come to your house..and call chile services or the police that is the right thing that is not being a tattle tal..or whatever u call it..lol but he can get really hurt from that and if he doesnt get out of that kind of situation he could end up in the hospital or worse and he could turn out that way to his children one day if it gets into his head...so get help..everything will turn out great in the long run...but another thing is try to tell his mom or another family member too so they know  i hope everything goes well hun|`|kNLi16C6aa	yeah, I would offer for him to stay at your house.  I think to give someone the option of escape is a thoughtful gesture when they are under such extreme situations, even if they do not take up the offer. Maybe offer for him to come round for dinner instead if he can't stay over night.    Perhaps try and talk him into approaching some authority about this too. He should not have to be abused by anybody, especially a step father.|`|6KVGwdBQaa	I'm assuming you're a teenager since he lives with his stepdad and can't seem to get away.  Are your parents willing to let him come stay at your house.  This was happening to my brothers girlfriend in highschool, and I ended up letting her live with me for about a year (big mistake for many reasons)  From experience, I don't suggest him living with you or your family members, but i would try to help him.  Call dss or find out if he has other family members he can live with and let them know what is going on.  They may not know what is going on, but be willing to help him.  I hope this helps.|`|EShN5zNcaa	You should see if your parents will let him stay with you for about a week or so. If his mom or anyone else lives there and doesn't know, you guys should tell them. If they do know, you should call some kind of child abuse hotline if it's that bad. I Hope things get better and that I was some kind of help...:(
ezI5HwRWaa	You need to tell someone. His step dad needs to go to jail for this. Your boyfriend needs help somehow. It's only going to get worse. Talk to him and ask him what he was planning on doing about it. You NEED to call the police about it though.     No, you can't just let him keep living there. Let him come to your house as soon as possible if you can and then talk with him about it. He can't get rid of it on his own. Even if he leaves that house, his step dad is still a threat and needs to be put in jail. If not your boyfriend, he will find someone to hit.     Your boyfriend might get angry at you for it, but over time he will be greatfull and see how much you cared. This is going to be with him for the rest of his life but it will only get worse the longer you wait. It has to end now.     I'm sorry you both have to go through this :(|`|jQkRf7SLaa	call a very important number "911". u cant  let anyone be abused like that|`|KF5pitm8aa	My boyfriend used to get beat up by his mom when he was young. He would get thrown down the stairs and kicked in the groin. He has had so much testicular trauma, his doctor is not sure if he'll be able to father a child.    Call the police annonymously, tell your mom (or dad), or a teacher. No one deserves to live like that.|`|xArlqHtraa	Is there anyone you can go to? Like a school consular or social worker? I would suggest going to your school's social worker, because nobody should be abused like that.|`|DF49SpO9aa	call the police so his dad can go to the slammerz.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Go talk with a school counselor.    Things will be rough for a while if the authorities get involved.    But people who experience abuse - tend to do it when they get older.  Problem is - your boyfriend is learning how to do this type of behavior.  And he is likely to do it to his girl-friends, wife, and kids.
Qbczt3ivaa	All these signs show that she is definitley interested. Ask her out somewhere before she might lose interest(which she probably wont in some amount of time)     I just read the part where her sisters say she likes you and she kinda insults you- she talks to her sisters about you ALOT and she is teasing you. ( I have 2 sisters and we do that!)  when you get back to school, I would suggest talking with her more than you usually do. smile and laugh occasionally and  she will hopefully get the idea that you like her back :D      hope I helped!|`|lXVwGgHmaa	i say go for her right away. dont give her time to start developing something with another boy and if she was that flirty with yuou before all the signs say that she likes you. go for it|`|4jx4wAhgaa	If she has done and shown you those signs before, I guess she likes you! But now that new school term has start, I suggest you show her signs to show that you like her as well. But if you are in a competition with another guy, I suggest you just relax and show her how you feel! There's no point fighting with the other guy and things start to get worst! You wanna leave a good impression on the girl right? So do the right thing! =D|`|wlvKveAXaa	do wat ur heart tells u|`|WsFD3EQIaa	i think you should be perfectly honest and ask her out, because who knows you probably have a pretty good chance.....but if you wait to long she might think that you dont like her and she might get asked out by the other guy ans say yes|`|o7nAvIjSaa	Well i can't be sure if she is going to pick up on those signs again, but i do know that you better get a move on if you like this girl. If she is intersted in some other guy, then she is going to pick whoever wins her over first. I know that sounds a little weird, but its true. You have to flirt with her a lot, and just talk to her about anything. Girls really like guys that can make them laugh, so just joke around with her and stuff, but don't jokingly insult her, thats bad idea. But like txt her just to say whats up, little things like that will do the trick for you.     Good luck:)|`|cIF70lGMaa	if u like her then go straight ask her out and flirt  she probibly still likes u  since ur a guy pleeeeease answer my question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|V1FmI6EOaa	Just ask her out ... It's not that difficult, I mean you KNOW she likes you so what are you afraid of? Just walk up to her and ask her if she wants to go out with you... I'd suggest asking her when you two are walking home. But, that's just me. Anyway just do it, and good luck!|`|Bydye6Muaa	she likes you,ask her out|`|fIeLH6HPaa	If you ae interested in this girl ask her out the next time you see her. If she is shy this may help to draw her out to let you know that she likes you without her taking a risk that you will reject her.
9ykAQxJxaa	Well let me ask...when he's "dealing" with her, is it over the phone?  in person?  both?     My parents have been divorced now for 20 years but because they have me they talk frequently and they still do tell each other pretty much everything.  There is nothing between them...trust me...but they still talk constantly and my Dad is remarried a 3rd time.      Unless he's away at random times I would try not to worry about it.  I mean, of course ask him about it and try asking maybe what exactly it is that she's talking to him so much about.  If he tells without hesitation as to what she keeps confiding in him about...then I really wouldn't worry.  If he doesn't want to tell you, explain to him that you're asking because you can't understand what it is that keeps her coming back to you for advice on all the time that she can't ask someone maybe more appropriate.    Overall try not to be jealous...he could see it as insecure and he'll love you all the more for being understanding if, in fact, his "interactions" with her are innocent/appropriate.    Good luck.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	they have been married for years and they are certainly close. even if they are not involved romantically, they are friends. it depends what you want to believe. how is he supporting her anyway?  if he is seeing her very often, (dinner lunch etc)...if he is not spending time with you...then you might want to approach him...  Other than that...i think you just feel left out...|`|KnMdFqq0aa	Not knowing all of the situation, hard to say.....it is ok if they have a mutual respectful relationship. They don't have to be at odds all the time. It IS better for the kids if they can get along.     Just keep an eye on things and believe in yourself. They are divorced for a reason.|`|91sBjTtAaa	i would find it hard to deal with|`|fE5bC83Saa	my heart goes for you, i can imagine its very hard on you.  be simple and clear, and tell him how you feel.and about the lines that you think its NOT ok to be crossed|`|Vf0bmaVGaa	I really think you got yourself into a mess. If I were a woman, and I'm not, but if I were before anything went any further I would be honest with him and myself. I would tell him "when I married you I thought you were finished with her and that you would be mine alone. I made a mistake, maybe this is what you want but it isn't what I want." I'm sure he will not change as he has placed the kids above you as is his justification for being kind to the X. You have a choice now, do you want to be second fiddle in your life relationship for the rest of your life or do want to find some one who will make you number one? I wish you well.|`|f9crUDTwaa	He needs to have a relationship if at all possible for the sake of the kids .       Personally my ex is such a B**** that I can't remember the last time I spoke to her.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	I don't know exactly if its innapropriate or if you're over thinking it. I think the bigger issue is if you trust him and if he's giving you everything you need. If he's meeting your needs then you probably have nothing to worry about. If all is well you should be glad that they've got a decent friendship rather than a hostile relationship    I can see how it would make you uncomfortable though. You've got to talk to him. If he's not sharing things about whats going on then there might be a problem. All I can say, again, is talk to him about it.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	He should deal with her with only the kids not for her own emotional support or financial. No I don't think your over reacting I think he is way out of line! Sounds to me something is really shady here. Maybe you should look further into it and find out for yourself what is going on.|`|slJWqCI5aa	I am married to a man with 2 ex wives and he has 2 kids - one with each ex-wife. Let me tell you it has been interesting. When we first got married there was a lot of hatred flowing around from the exes...but I stood my ground and put myself in the equation but also forced my hubby to deal with them. He had a tough situation on both marriages and has been put through the ringer. Thankfully we all get along now and my hubby talks with his exes and sometimes I do not find out until later. There is no visiting w/o my knowledge - then again they both live out of state - but there is no way he would visit without me knowing. You believe there is an issue - therefore there is an issue - listen to what your gut is saying and confront your hubby about it. Talk it through - you could be over thinking it, but why take the risk. Put yourself out there and allow him to understand your feelings. If you let it go - he will never know there is a problem!
OwfoyXpraa	maybe he does like you, but he's just shy.. too self-conscious to tell you that he does like you, afraid that it could mess up your friendship with him. That means that your friendship is too important to him to risk losing you, if that makes you feel better, :P. Eventually I'm sure he'll either tell you that he does or doesn't like you.. give him time, don't rush him. :)    Good luck, dear.|`|6DXJJzEUaa	i totally agree with the 1st answer     I have a great guy friend and when he started to actually really like me i got kinda iffy about goin out with him or staying friends...    If the relationship ends badly you just lost a friend. You may never get the same old same old great friend of yours...|`|4752ed18091b7f30115bd3f05992d180aa	Maybe he's shy.The shy ones are the hottest in my book;)  Hahaha but anyways,MAKE A MOVE!  study shows that at least 50% of guys want the girls to make the first move.Ask him to go to the movies,and maybe lean into him.Bring up the topic casually "Hey,It's kinda weird how everybody thinks we're going out,huh?"  Odds are he'll say something like "Yeah,weird"  Then you say something like "What if we really WERE going out...Do you think it would be awkward?"  Then just go on and talk.Invite him to your house for a study night,get some chips or something and just let fate take it's place:)|`|fXmUiAYPaa	he's waiting to see what you do next and how long ou will wait?|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Personally, I think he may just be flattered that you like him. Don't draw that much into it, just tell him how you feel and that you'd like to know if he feels the same. If you're best friends, it shouldn't be that awkward to talk to him.|`|dxYgLvEBaa	You both like each other. Back in the years he was not grown into the boys and girl thing. I mean attraction for the opposite sex. Now he is.  You are the closest person he likes and can trust for the development of his opposite sex interaction. Just be careful because once he gain it from you? He might test it on others (which will hurt you ) while leaving you on the reserve. But don't trust me.|`|y9mdCYByaa	just wait for the time until he opens up his feelings.maybe right now, he isn't ready yet to tell you whatever he feels.and maybe he values your friendship so much that right now, he isn't still certain to push for a relationship which is more than friendship...just give him time.and what's more important is that you value whatever you have right now..be thankful about it..all the best!^_^|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	I think that he does like you because he is showing some signs of it. And the reason why he probably didn't tell you yes or no to why he liked you is because maybe he is too shy and doesn't want to let you know. Or maybe he doesn't know exactly how to go about telling you that he likes you. He maybe trying to find the right time, and the right thing to tell you.|`|7mQNq9ceaa	maybe he is just shy, he was blushing heheeheh, how cute. just keep everything the way they are and wait for him. or maybe make some moves on him such as kiss him on the cheek for good bye after school or something|`|AA11526389	maybe he does like you but is scared|`|fY68d3mAaa	boys are strange, theres absolutely no way to find out. you should just ask him if you were to ask him out would he go out with you? he might think thats cute.|`|4OBLRQb6aa	he may think that if he dates you it will hurt your friendship.  I have had this problem and im serious.He probally is thinking if i date her i don't want to lose our friendship.Just give it time and yes I do think that he likes you but just isn't sure on how to say it just give it time and see how things go|`|cKeghBi7aa	maybe hes scared of losing you as a friend if things dont work out if you had a relationship...    but he would have told you he liked you if he did|`|N2xzSXosaa	Hmm...  Sounds to me like he's a little shy. I wouldn't pressure him though. Being that you guys were such good friends for so long, he might be a little apprehensive about losing the great friendship. I'd just take what you're being handed from now, and if he gets comfortable enough, he'll ask you out. Other than that... I wouldn't take everyone else's word over something he hasn't spoken to you himself. If you like him as much as you say, he'll be worth the wait.    Best of wishes!|`|OYfJ9klHaa	just ask him out       im 99.99% sure he'll say yes|`|O1WxKk7uaa	Maybe he doesnt think hes ready to show how he really feels. When you guys are alone you should really talk about it. Like ask him if you wanted to take the next step would he be interested etc. And yea he does sound like he likes you cause he blushed for one|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Could be he's not into dating yet.      Could be issues at home with his parents are such that he doesn't want a girl-friend.    Could be he's in-experienced and doesn't know what to do.    Could be he doesn't have the money to date someone.    Why not just ask him - if you upset him by telling him you liked him?  A few days later, ask him how he feels about you?      Find a school event (sports game, play, etc) that he might like to go to and ask him to go with you.|`|SITgGHWaaa	Maybe he's scared and thinks it might be awkward if you ever break up, but he defs likes you.
NZVKTPonaa	dont be annoying and desperate and move too fast, just get close with him and it will probally work out eventually.|`|3qrSUE7uaa	Haha, well obviously, once you express interest in him he doesn't care anymore. DUH DUHHDHDuD DUH DHUHDH.|`|Ux2dBxtDaa	Ughh.  Go frolic somewhere amongst your hormones besides Y!A.|`|0cBEbHlHaa	make da 1st move|`|dkMceLYhaa	maybe you have a bad personality? or he has a gf or he like someone else|`|8PtMvfzBaa	Not everyone wants the 'hot girl'.  He probably doesn't find you all that interesting.    Find somebody else and get over him.|`|a0BHaB9paa	Keep talking to him, really this is how a relationship should be built. Also, have you considered that he is shy around you (this could be mistaken for seeming like he is not interested). You say that you are the "hot girl" at school, that being the case maybe he is nervous and only seems uninterested. Furthermore, maybe he notices you, but is simply picking and choosing when he sees you. For example, I once liked a girl, but I was a pretty clumsy kid. Therefore, I avoided her until i thought the time was right and i held off until I knew that the conversation would be meaningful and that I would not mess up. She later even said that she thought that I was uninterested. To me it seems like you may be that "unobtainable girl" if you really are who you say you are, so lighten up, talk to him more, and make him feel more comfortable around you.|`|CMF86r75aa	damn, conceded.|`|Df8GQoRkaa	yea i'm going through sorta the same thing. try to get to kno him better by going up to him, whenever there is a chance, like u catch him alone or something. it might not be that he's not interested, but shy. if he isnt willing to approach u, then u might as well go up to him if u really want him. but get to kno him first. who knows, he might be a jerk or hate all the things u cherish
MX1shAbcaa	Talk to her, comfort her, make sure she knows you are there for her.  ~William
LDKukrPVaa	get laid dude.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	probably not.. ur a guy. thats normal. im a girl and i think about it alot too. i guess u have to start feenin on somethin else.|`|MsSHhX8zaa	Honestly, you think about sex the most when you're not getting any.|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	not much you can do      the average guy thinks about sex every three seconds (or somewhere around there)
h9lPQCOVaa	You can't do anything to make her closer to God. The only thing I can tell you is to be strong in your faith and be an example to her. I have had this problem before. My youth leader told me to be an example and be strong in my faith. I ended up doing exactly what she said, and he ended up being in a great relationship with God. I hope things get better for her. =)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Ask her if she can join the youth group.|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	oh boy, hun im SORRY but there is no REAL way where u can change someone that cusses and wants to be pregnant in a sorta amount of time.  bringing her to god will take A LOT of work   what this girl REALLY needs is a reality check.   maybe what u can do is "dare" her to go a week without swearing, literally and then say "if i win then you need to come to church with me and LISTEN to the whole sermon"   and if she wins than tell her that u will like do her homework or something like that.  when my friends dared me to do that, i realized that i didnt even NEED swearing because it was so rude like.  maybe that will help her, it helped me.  if that does not happen, then just encourage her.   ive dealt with these people before and someone of them turned good but some did not. "/  just dont give up hope on her,   good luck.
PyjqMVqqaa	You're n the right. it was rude and disrespectful on her part and that says how little she cares about the friendship.|`|RbaXxTwkaa	shes nosy, your in the right|`|2jnpvyzaaa	is this a friend. ask ur self. someone that does not know what privacy means|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	wow i would have been pissed what  a b***h  u should do da same or just open her mail when ur over lol|`|O9jrkjgraa	You are right.|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	You!
z3uUtr33aa	awwwe, i went threw the same thing when i was 12. when i was 12 i thought time was going by waaaay too slow and i couldn't wait until i was like 16. it's hard for kids now days growing up because it's sooo many cool things out there that they can't do since they're so young. i have a younger sister's that's almost 13 and she's such a baby haha, i would be happy if she started acting like yours because she's almost 13 and she still sucks her thumb and plays with barbies. she needs to grow up, times running out! (: kids now days are also really bad... just be happy your sister's a virgin and all but as her older brother don't be up her *** too much, some things your not gonna like but what are you gonna do when she's turning 18 and having sex? calm down, she just have a crush on your friend's. it's not like they're gonna get together or anything.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	try letting your parents know what she is doing....  this is not your responsibility.    and by the way, loose the picture....  nasty.|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	She's just starting to go through a phase where she thinks she's such a big girl and growing up...even though she's not. Just see if it passes and if not...I don't know cuz my older sister went through something a little like that... Plus, there's nothing wrong with and AIM|`|JWnUVJHvaa	im not a girl, but i do have a sister like this. at twelve years old, all girls seem to get this way at least a little. in reality she probably doesnt even like them the way you think she does, she just wants to feel grown up, so probably no need to worry that much. there however are guys out there that could hurt her.  the best thing is to tell your parents if you think they would care. you may feel like a snitch, but your helping her save herself from a world of pain. if this isnt an option, try to talk directly to her, or if that doesnt work put a parental block on the computer and block msn and aim or just delete her accounts when shes not looking. its great that your trying to help her, many guys dont even care enough anymore to care about their siblings.|`|V1FmI6EOaa	It's totally normal and no offense but I hated when my brother was all protective of me... I'm not sure if that helps at all I just think you need to realize that it's not that big a deal.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	My little cousin went through this and man did it drive me nuts! Put a free key logger on the computer and you can see who she is talking to and what is being said.   Just keep a close eye on her make sure no sick o's get to talking to her. Try to have a talk with her tell her if she is into boys now guys like your friends are to old for her. she should talk to boys her own age. Just try to explain it to her the best you can.  My cousin didn't grow out of this until she was 18 in the meantime it was hell!
vjxroyxjaa	WHOAAA! 4 and a half years is a long time but this relationship does not sound healthy. Slapping u, u guys breakn it off, and all this stuff. Now not calling and stuff. U need to drop this guy. I know thats easy for me to say but for god's sake he treats u li crap. U gotta use ur head here. U could b with some other great guy out there instead of an obusive up and down guy ur with now. U deserve better. This guy really ticks me off. He's the kinda guy that gets guys a bad rep. Guys should nvr treat a girl lik he has. Anyway, i hope u hav the courage to do wat is right. Watever decision u make, use ur head and heart.  Hope this helped,  Best of Luck!

He is saying he can't be with you because of it to try to scare you into saying you wound him up and get him off the hook.  He is trying to control you ,I'd say because he is insecure.  It sounds like he needs counseling not just for hitting you people can lash out and truly regret it but that doesn't make it OK .  What is just as bad is the way he is trying to manipulate you.    I'd give it time to cool off and don't have anything to do with him until he is willing to face up to what he's done.   Good luck.|`|wFWytGlxaa	If he is not willing to go to therapy I suggest you do so by yourself. This isn't a healthy relationship no matter how many ways you slip it. Abuse/mental abuse should not be tolerated in a relationship. It's a good thing that he is not calling you to apologize -- because from where things stand now they only get worse.    Good Luck
6qgIXITSaa	Rule  1 - Never leave a fellow Crasher behind. Crashers take care of their own.   Rule  2 - Never use your real name.       Pretend to be a long-lost relative  Weddings are teeming with dozens of relations from all over the globe. From Aunt Gertrude from Glasgow to Great Uncle Terrence from Kalamazoo, the family tree is more than the happy couple -- or their parents -- can ever hope to keep track of. Depending on your desired level of theatricality, you could try putting on an accent and saying you're from "the old country" or -- if you're feeling extra bold -- try passing on best wishes from other long-lost (and equally elusive) relatives who weren't able to make the trip (just don't specify names). Important phrases to remember are "Sorry we haven't kept in touch," "It's been far too long" and "Second cousin thrice removed on your uncle's side."|`|4JGTC2MHaa	That is brilliant. I prom crashed when I was in high school. Maybe I could move on to weddings.|`|xkB4AiuAaa	Get a life?|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	you need to grow up|`|8dx4uAESaa	that is dumb and immature. what are you like 16? grow up and get a life. maybe find something prductive to do..lol|`|HcjCdLehaa	Fart in the middle really loud.

PXnn6LoPaa	This happened to me when I was in high school.  I even had a haunting dream I was raped by him because my subconscious felt so smothered by the whole idea.  Don't entertain the thought of changing schools any more.  Don't let him control you like that.  This will pass.  Obviously you're attractive and interesting, and life will prepare by you teaching you how to deal with stuff like this in the future, in the real world of adults, outside of school.      What I did was, when he would follow me around I would still talk to him as a friend, but subtly talk about or mention the other guys I was interested in (ex: " Justin told me he saw the GA game last night.  They got stomped!  Did you see it?"  Or, "Have you seen Justin around?  He has my favorite pen."  Or maybe "Justin and I are going to Subway this afternoon - do you ever eat there?  You always come out smelling like bread.")  You get the idea.      Another route could be to try to hook him up with someone else.      If you've said you just wanted to be friends, then he knows. And he'll accept it, he will see it eventually. He has no choice!      Good luck!|`|iBPqutK5aa	No, avoidance leads to school shootings, instead of rejecting him you should at least try to accept him and if that doesent work, i'd transfer schools|`|qVPYKZUSaa	Be firm and say no! I can see where you come from and you may not be as confrontational as you would like to be. Be firm and serious and say no and if it continues, tell the teacher... don't transfer for every single freak that herasses you. Sometimes you need to help the person understand that what they are doing really bothers you.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	avoid him...tell him that he is becoming a menace to u.....tell him he is disturbing ur well being.....transferring schools shud b the last on ur list...........there's more than one way to skin a cat!!!!!!|`|om0zcFigaa	Avoid him if u want to.
fH0cZIy1aa	No of course not. I've been internet dating a man for almost a year and its wonderful. I love waking up early to see if he's logged on yet. You can say so many things over the computer that you'd be too scared to say in real life. I was always shy when i was in school and never got involved with boys. but when i talk with him i can say anything, all the things i can't talk about with my family or my friends. You should do it if its what you want. Just be really careful who you pick. It has to be someone that is willing to take the time to talk with you and who you think will be able to stay interested for a long time. Once you find someone that you really like, keep talking to them and try to get closer. Who knows what will happen? :) Don't let all these mean people tell you its dumb or too dangerous. I've get alot of negative responses to me dating a guy over the computer, just try to ignore it. As long as your careful and act responsibly, there really isn't any reason why you shouldn't. Good luck and have fun :)|`|XRFznIZmaa	I have tried internet dating because I would like to meet new people.  I just find it difficult going up to someone and engaging a conversation, so it's easier for me to start with the internet and then meet them.  For girls it can be difficult because you don't really know what the guy is like.   A lot of it is based on image to.  I met a couple of girls and I thought it was pretty neat.  Alot of girls that I wanted to meet though ended up second guessing meeting a guy cuz they were nervous.|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	It's not wrong, but you have to be very careful with giving out personal information and meeting people.
fUBWB88laa	Obviously glamorous, considering the link you put up (Maggie Sottero) is my EXACT dress that I ordered! I have my first dress fitting in 3 weeks!! Great choice girl!|`|Bqpk2yZGaa	probably glamorous|`|8cDd70dSaa	None of these really, although I would say it's probably closest to romantic...I'm one of those girls who loves a big poofy princess dress. :)|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	vintage all the way. my dress is a 40s inspired cocktail dress.|`|AA11340375	get married naked and quit sending me this same  question over and over and over and over and over again  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DqetlSB6aa	Bohemian for me..All the way.

Having said that I wasn't mad about any of the dresses so maybe my wedding style is something else entirely.|`|EroXBvDNaa	dress-old hollywood,  hair-romantic|`|PBdPD748aa	Definately GLAMOROUS - oh my gosh that dress is absolutely amazing!!!

This is my style =)    http://notebook.drowned-world.net/img/ga...|`|HiSVA9p8aa	There's a huge difference in what I like and what I would wear.  The realities of my body shape have a lot to say about what I could pull off.    Of these dresses, I absolutely adored the glamorous.  I kind of liked the romantic.  I didn't care for the bohemian and I quite disliked the super-modern.  The old Hollywood was fine but that model didn't do a thing for the dress.
jbvabMIkaa	well it can sometimes turn into, "i dont want to lose" type thing and you feel like your caving by texting first, he may be feeling the same thing and thats why he doesnt text you. or it could be that maybe hes starting to move on, and doesnt think about you as much. i mean it seems like maybe you need some time to yourself to get back to where you want to be, and after thats done, maybe you can entertain the idea of being together. sometimes space is a good thing, you come to realizations even though sometimes you are miserable in the mean time. i have always been a firm believer you broke up for a reason, and if in time you can work things out, you know your supposed to. but a lot of people make mistakes where you get sad really easily so you jump to whats comfortable without resolving the issues at hand. maybe dont contact him as much, and do what everyone says keep busy, its so hard, but.. you wont feel this way forever. you will if you let yourself. you have to be better than that. take some time for yourself and work on you, and if he cares he will be there when you want.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	If you didn't get the answer you were looking for the last time you posted it, then you obviously already have an answer to what you want to do.  So asking us here is pointless.  Do what you think is right.    PS - your behavior WOULD be driving him crazy IF - he still had genuine feelings for you :S
mFZeEm9paa	I know it is hard... Your situation is da -ja-voo for me. I am 28 now, but when I was 17, my parents found out that I had had sex with my boyfriend because my sister snooped through my room and read it in my diary, and told my parents. They told me the same thing, that I was going to break it off and that was final. I however, was very stubborn, and not much into listening to my parents, who I thought at the time knew nothing about the "now adays" I left my house, moved in with my uncle (my dads brother) and within a few days, my parents came around, and my mom even offered to put me on the pill. My attitude was at 17 I was close enough to 18 to be making my own choices in life.     Now though at 28, Yes, I went on to marry him the next year ( I was 18 ) then I started having kids..3 of them to be exact, then he cheated on me while I was 8 months prego with my third son. We tried to patch things up for two years, but it just didn't work. We were divorced after 8 years of marraige, and I am finally happy in love again, even more so than I was at 18 when I thought I had the love of my life.     I do think that you guys need to live out your relationship. It is very good that she is actually listening to her parents, I know my parents would have enjoyed having a daughter like that! In the grand scheme of life, waiting until May is really nothing. You have waited so long and come so far, you do need to see if the flames are still there.     I do not regret for a second my marraige to my highschool sweatheart. He gave me three wonderful healthy kids who are everything in this world to me. He and I are not in a hugh fued and we didn't have a divorce battle. We actually sat down by ourselves without atterneys and did the paperwork. I am so thankful that I didn't listen to my parents, and they have actually said to me, "Laura, thank you so much for not listening to me/us when we told you you had to break up with Bill" (that came later, after a few years of marraige, and a few grandkids, not to mention the fact that they LOVE my ex husband, even still).    Hope this helps you, and I hope that you don't give up when you are so close to the end of the waiting game. Even if it isn't what you thought it might be, atleast you'll have the closure in knowing that, instead of wondering for the rest of your life.     Good Luck!|`|ic5JUantaa	If you feel like you need to see her in person once more to get some closure, then that's what you should do.     You should know some small part of her schedule... figure out a discreet time and place where you can go up to her. Make sure it's not a situation where you could embarrass her or get her in trouble, because that will only upset her. Beforehand, get together exactly what you think you need to say to her so that you can do it simply and quickly when you see her.    No matter what her reaction is, hopefully this will be the goodbye you need. I think the best thing to do, regardless of it it goes well or not, would be to stop with the texting and IMing after you've said goodbye.  You will need some time to just think clearly and focus on yourself.    Good luck honey, it sounds like a tough situation.|`|rNSzXo80aa	Wait for her.     tell her u still love her and you still care for her.    how old are ya?
TsgSCFMeaa	You've already partially answered your own question...so she hates your tone of voice with her... SO CHANGE IT THEN!  Isn't she worth it to be a little nice to her?? After all genius "leaving her Isn't an option.," right??  Relations are a give and take, so that is obviously something that needs to done. There's probably a bunch of things that you do that she just lets go because she cares about you    .... start becoming more aware of how you are communicating, you may be coming across as condescending without even realizing it.... be open minded and listen to her...Dont let your emotions control the way you handle the conversation...Also, judging by your tone, it sounds like you need some growing up to do    Remember that men and women generally handle problems and stress differently. Instead of being an *** and blaming it on her period, try being a real man and give her the emotional support that she needs!|`|AA10824931	Get to the bottom of this.  What is it about the tone in your voice that triggers her to over react?  Gentle find out when it first started and if you are to blame or is it someone in her past.  Reassure her that you need to work it out for the both of you.  The flip side to this...you may be triggering a reaction in her with out even knowing you are.  Arguments are growths.  You and her are growing to a new level in your relationship that is stronger.  Strive to be open without being critical and teach her the same.  Good luck.|`|yOFWD0unaa	dont call her|`|0mXQODsIaa	dont talk to her then.|`|X5Qzk78maa	say what i say, "okay honey ur so right, i love you, i have to go, talk to you later"|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	lol thiz is s000 funny i hate gurls like dat  1 i dont like talking on da phone why u ask ,well caz datz da kind of **** dat happens, i also dislike friendz who just fight with their boyfriends 4 no aparent reason i ask and they say 2 have fun lol,um u should try only saying sweet mushy things 2 her it always works with my guy friends or just ur tone u dont have 2 know what shes saying or even care  just say it like u know or u agree and ur interested  NEVER say it like ur pissed or sick of her -well my friend good luck|`|wnbz5gNzaa	You must listen/read "Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars." this will give you great understanding of communications, wants, feelings etc. on women|`|c4a36c088096bec045e2051f20d57305aa	Is this you, David?|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Just tell her that this is your normal voice, or sarcastic, I don' t know which.

Well this is a negative thing but hopefully ur situation is positive and she is really busy =D|`|fXmUiAYPaa	she could be really busy. the fact that she text oyo bak at all shows shes thinking of you so i dont think she pretending. also depends on how often you are both there? have a talk about it.|`|9Ltw4iMuaa	she def likes u, but shy|`|KzNoxRwbaa	**** her n' find out|`|SZ2zGmH8aa	i think she do mot want to talk to u|`|cGWbzf0gaa	msn and texting isnt the only way to do stuff.  try calling her.|`|BO4ND6x5aa	well... my gf used to do the same thing though my eyes shes just trying to see how far r u willing to go for her so dont give up man youll get her eventually =)|`|TjFR5y0Daa	i say call her bluff. ask her straight up why shes electronically avoiding u. it seems to bother u and if she likes u, she'll work on it.|`|dLeRiM76aa	she def likes u, but shy|`|ba0de6d3c47d87b162d7a9af3626f361aa	Doesn't sound too promising!! Obviously she isnt interested in texting you, so you might be bugging her|`|awbCfN7Iaa	i think you have it correct ..maybe she does not like to text or talk via IM...I hate it my boyfriend love it does the text thing all day long....he texted me last night and I reply tonight almost 24 hours later...so it may be she would rather talk to you in person and since she is smiling around you its a good indication she likes being in your company|`|dbaPuwv4aa	If she chooses to hang out with you but doesn't answer on msn or texting, maybe she just doesn't like to use those things. But she obviously isn't annoyed if she chooses to hang out with you.|`|EShN5zNcaa	I used to always get text messages an myspace messages, etc. from this guy. I liked him after a while, but then he started doing it too much. It ended up being everyday that I would get some kind of message from. I started to give him short answers, then eventually no answers. One day he asked why, and so we talked about it. It turns out, after we talked it over and he didn't bother me so much, we became a couple. I guess it depends on how much you message her. You should talk to her about it. If she really likes you, then she'll tell you the truth...Hope I helped!|`|ooJaKmssaa	i dont think so....personally with my bad exp with girls LMAO.... sounds like she sees u as just a good friend. i really cant say bc i dont know the details and etc. but u can still have her if u know how to play the game correctly|`|3yltQ2Euaa	I would rethink the whole thing. Why wouldn't she want to talk to you? If she was shy, it would be only in person not on the internet- I think she does not know what she wants, and is not sure if you are a friend or more- she might be as confused as you are in a certain way. Something you could do is simply ask her- simple eh? lol - i know it might take all your guts to do it but it will be suddenly really clear!  "Hey, i was just wondering.. What's going on between us?" i dont really know, make it sound right. Ask friends if it looks like she's flirting.     Final test, when you go out, ask to pay for her and see how she reacts, if she lets you pay, well this is good! (not for your wallet thought lol)
9XazchJ6aa	well whenever he brings up girls he likes just be like "yeah, i like Noah" then it wont be that obvious because he mentioned girls he likes.
3BOK0PNmaa	Of course it is. When i was 7 i had a crush. You want to make sure that he doesn't get carried away. It is always better to have friends than crushes any day. My 6th grade crush was the cutest guy ever! But i knew i was too young to get in a relationship so i just played it cool. It is great to like someone but at his age he shouldn't get too serious.|`|dQDL8iM6aa	Yeah its normal! I used to have so many crushes when i was in third grade. I was seven turning eight, but its better to be friends than to be asking them out! Just tell him that he likes them, and never tell him that he's in love.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	uhh yeeeeaaaah!!!!!
H5DdF6V9aa	Oh no. Button up your pants. Read a book. Wait 5 years.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	Pesonally I think you sound a little effed up.|`|CtNs7EAsaa	touch him and i promise you he wont be turned off. guys will get turned on if they even get rubbed the right way by a chair. haha we cant help it. dont worry if hes getting some he will be turned on.
H5DdF6V9aa	My ex's husband was my bestman. My ex was my wife's bridesmaid. Anything is possible.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	It's very possible for some. And impossible for others.|`|dFlc9DVsaa	Were you married with your ex-husband?  And is the man you're with now married to his ex-wife?    Honestly, the only time you can call him husband or he can call you wife is when you're married.  Other than that you'll be considered the other party.      There is a possibility his ex-wife still wants to keep him if they're married.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	I think you just answered your own question. So, yes.
UgS1Jpu8aa	Most teenage guys go for pokemon trainers.|`|s5d2VFVQaa	personally they are a big turnoff for me|`|pn88K8UXaa	guys dont care... my bf loves mine. if they do care, they suck and i wouldnt bother with them anyway.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	You are just getting used to your shape honey...believe me, when you hit yer mid twenties you are gonna look back at pics of yourself right now and wonder why you thought you had love handles when you didn't. The hormonal teenage years make you feel like you are looking into a circus mirror...don't sweat it...fact is you are probably 100x prettier than you think you are.|`|vWrpyzQZaa	It should only matter what YOU care, but unfortunately,a lot of guys are shallow. If you're going to get rid of them, do it for yourself.|`|I3oE6FpPaa	i like all girls as long as they aren like 200 pounds u know nothin wrong wit love handles thats why they say love :)|`|ob61TSgjaa	curves are beautiful! work it!|`|sB7zvcZtaa	Ew.|`|wAoNbpVlaa	i have love handles to, their not big though only when i lean over to my sides you can see them. think of it this way, its more love to handle! XD|`|hQHWVRyTaa	Curvy women RULE!!!|`|NSm34kaQaa	Curves are nothing to be afraid of. :) Just find clothes that flatter your figure most. So longer shirts and boot cut jeans probably. It's all about wearing what you have with confidence.|`|YkK8D8Ilaa	Hey, whats wrong with being skinny and athletic? lol There's guys that go crazy over girls with basically any figure. In my school, guys tend to go crazy over girls who are bigger, because they tend to have bigger butts and not as flat chested. Just be happy with your figure, i guess there could be ups and downs to any body type.|`|QSodlfMraa	my boyfriend loves chubby girls thats just him, all his ex girls where chubby too, but i think i am the only one that dont like me love handles. i use to evy them because they were so hot with their chubbiness.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Hour glass is ideal to me, sticks are sick and jock girls usually have tiny ****. 130 sounds perfect, unless you are just oddly misshapen haha, if your taller than 5'2" i'm sure your gorgeous "weight more distributed than if you were say 4'2"
fIK9LBEuaa	I know they haven't kissed. They've said it many, many times and anytime they went out they were with a chaperone. I think that if they did kiss, they would admit it.     Also, did you see the way they kissed on their wedding night? You could tell it was their first time they've ever kissed another person. He was about to tear her face off|`|ZbCLP2Kxaa	I don't believe they kissed. I agree with the person above me...he basically ate her face!|`|YpN50jFDaa	I watched the show too (there was nothing good on tv) and I remember the guy saying that they had not kissed and wanted their first kiss to be the one after the minister said that they were man and wife.  He even went so far to say that they had spoken about it and wanted to make sure that they didn't look awkward for it.|`|6SIjchQUaa	I don't believe they kissed before the wedding.  They are both old fashioned and very religious.|`|AA10034051	I believe they did not do anything but hold hands|`|pn88K8UXaa	i watched it. and i think that HE did, but that she didn't, because he went right in and had his hands ready and in the right place and all. there is no way he didnt. but she looked awkward like sdidn'tdnt know what she was doing.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	They probably hadn't kissed before the wedding.  To me the funniest part was that after the minister made them pledge that they would welcome all the babies God chooses to give them there was a commercial break.  The first commercial was for the "morning after pill", brilliant juxtaposition on someones part!
SOkhzMVDaa	first how old are you?  and you need to sit down and talk with your mom. it looks like your mom had the same issue you just need to tell her and hope she will have the most understanding. then see what your mom decides and then talk with you dad once your mom gives you advice on what to do!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	There is no way to sugar coat this.  Just say it.  The fur will fly, and nothing you can say will make it easier.      Good luck.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Uhm... be like... "mom dad...can we talk...about somethin" and then wait till you guys are alone and be like "im having a baby... im pregnant" and then ya...work from there|`|dGBbFwFWaa	all i can say is.. why would u  have unprotected sex? when there is soo much out there to prevent pregnancies. yes i am sure your parents will be dissapointed.. but it will all pass.. good luck..|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	i guess, if you spent a little more time thinking of the consequences of being on you back with your legs in the air, you wouldn't be having this problem.......
NHG8JPIAaa	If there was then maybe we would get so many violations|`|3lssqacfaa	yea i'm sick and tired of hearing about 13 year old girls wanting to know if a dude likes her.|`|6246e0d306150f8d4539a4e8c29e2600aa	yep, i agree. they should really do something about that.|`|ecd5b22a3f931f907d69a5b7daa4b25caa	yeah same here, there shouldn't even be a section for people 14 and under!|`|C7C3vVeYaa	It doesn't really matter. Do you think people are going to bother. Some older people could help out on previous experiences. If you don't know the answer to a question. DON'T POST.|`|PBX0h0zyaa	Im sick of kids asking "does he/she like me" how would i know? i don't know his mind.. lol    but yes that would be less annoying [=
QSJDp6E2aa	well im not sure on the i love u forever thing i thnk he is playing along   not suree    if his friend says he said that he likes u then he probably does unless that friend is lying :S     but other than that i think well he may not like u a lot cause he does the same things to ur friend but he kisses her on top of all that   so im not really sure     hang out a little have fun then c were it leads   if anything happens from there ask a question im sure a lot of ppl will help u :)|`|uKYPmVG0aa	do not make this a fight between u and ur friend. it doesn't sound like he likes u but still if ur friends...tell him how u feel maybe he'll feel the same way/
IUOomveYaa	maybe sit next to he in class, start small conversations with him and try to hang out with him.
MX1shAbcaa	..............why do you need to convince her, you don't need to. She really does know you think she is a good person.  ~William|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	give her examples why she is a good person.  she sounds like she is sorta lonely when she says that she is not a good person.  what u need to do is basically SHOW her all she does for u and how she makes u feel.  basically tell her what u just told us.  and also, ask her if there has been n e thing bugging her.  there could be something bugging her.  good luck.
7FAZYMy3aa	Don't lose sleep over it, she knows you think she's a good person if you told her.|`|2jnpvyzaaa	DO NOT TRY!|`|V1FmI6EOaa	Idk.. just show her all that she's done for you I guess
CLcgQWfUaa	There's no "should".  It's just something that happens very often.
9ko5WUFkaa	Please girl, find your strength and leave him.  I know it's a scary thought, especially being pregnant but is this the life you want to have?  Clearly not.  He is an absolute a**hole and you deserve far better than this.  Talk to your family and friends, they shouldn't judge you and if they love you they will do anything they can to get you out of this.  You have a baby coming and your husband is already showing that what you and your baby need is far less important than what he wants.  It's not likely he's ever going to change - especially now that you've let him introduce a third person into your relationship.  He's not, nor will ever be, committed to you and the coming baby.  He's too worried about fulfilling his sexual fantasies.      Please talk to someone and get yourself out.  You can't spend you life with such a selfish man.  He will never care about you and your child the way you want and deserve.  All he seems to care about if himself.  People love you and will not want you to have to live like this.  There is help out there - you don't have to do it alone.|`|S6zEIEZXaa	This guy is not worth it, it sounds like he is just bored right now that you are pregnant, and wants something new for awhile. I would say you are better off without him; you are probably scared to be alone, but don't worry, your family will not reject you based on this. Ditch this guy and get someone new. Besides, there is something super hot about being pregnant, you can find someone better.    PS - This is not a bogus question, it can be scary to be young and in that type of situation, especially being pregnant.|`|riVwJLqYaa	honey this man is sick to approach this topic while you are pregnant.  i think you and him probably will not be together after time anyway.  i would leave him. it seems like as bad as it would be without the father around, having him near seems more painful.|`|KnMdFqq0aa	You need to leave him. You will survive. You cannot bring your baby up like this. What if you get some kind of STD? You are risking your health and the health of your baby. Leave now.|`|jIFg1Ubaaa	He sounds like a jerk. I mean, this kind of thing may not be uncommon for couples who have been together for a while and who would like to spice things up, but only upon mutual agreement, and certainly not when you are pregnant!   If he loves you, talk to him. You should talk to your family. You will not be alone.|`|4GIJ4mfwaa	Wow thats terrible.  He sounds like a jerk if he doesn't care about how you feel.  And honestly, if I were in that situation, I would leave in a second.      Im pregnant too right now, and if my husband said that, I'd leave on the dot eventhough I am pregnant (I'm only 20).  But you don't need him.  You're young and have plenty of time to find someone better.  Don't be afraid to leave him.  Stand up for yourself.|`|91sBjTtAaa	what the leave him|`|Cknjsqapaa	I think you will be better off leaving him, you are gonna get cheated on and he is going to like her more than you. if he liked you more, she wouldn't be around. its better to leave him, he is nasty want to have sex with more than just you at a time...eww...leave. good luck|`|fE5bC83Saa	he is SICK so as your need for him,abort the baby if its still possible and move out|`|OSxReGI6aa	you should find a guy that only wants you only you girl You deserve better dont you think? That baby inside your womb, thats the thing that can make you happy|`|aOd0Djkaaa	Girl you can be a single mom, he sounds like a douchbag and took advantage of you when you were weak. you are letting that man have his cake and eat it too. Well get your stuff and leave him, when the baby is born put his butt on child support. You don't need him, he doesn't care about anyone but himself.   I have 5 daughters and I do it on my own, but you better believe I make his butt pay child support, or he goes to jail. You have to think of what matters here and it is your baby.|`|kNLi16C6aa	You have more than 2 choices.   - move out, and kick him in the balls on the way out. then give him the kid to look after.  - move out, kick him in the balls, and get child endowment off this mongrel.  - allow this 3rd person in your house and your marriage, and do as your husband says.  - adoption, kick him in the balls, and move out.  - divorce his ****, kick him in the balls, and collect his money for the child, find a new partner.  - tell your parents and everybody you know how your husband is such a loser, and a mongrel.   - get this 3rd person, conspire with her, and Kick him out of the house and set up a relationship with the new person.  - tell him, ok, as long as you are allowed to bring a friend too, and then bring a big burly guy to kick your hubby in the balls.      There is WAY more than 2 options for you. NEVER let anybody tell you how your future will span out. YOU ARE IN CHARGE.|`|8LEPfGoBaa	Well, if u really want space, and u feel like he don' really care about u. Then u should be a single mother. There are alot of mothers that survive w/o a husband. & if your lucky u mite find a guy that love u, and r willing to take care of u and ur child. It's up to u, make the rite choice.|`|slJWqCI5aa	Be a single 19 year old mom - girl you need to drop him like he is a virus! He is not worthy of you or your child...let him have his lil woman...be strong! You really want someone like that being a role model for your child?? You have to think about that!|`|AXqmo8rlaa	I'm sure your family who loves you and wants the best for you would listen to your situation and help you any way they can. You dont need to put up with him at any age, much less at 19. You have more options than you know of....your life should be so much better. People who truly love you dont ask you to do things like that. People who love you, listen and want to help if you will let them. Talk to them. Or talk to your Dr. or Pastor/Priest|`|CyS0OlOzaa	Look>If your man has to have a third person then he is NOT worth it,you are better off alone than with him.Sorry!This is what everyone is gonna tell you even a licensed therapist.He don't love you he loves sex and plenty of it.You are young enough to find someone else to be with whom does love you and ONLY YOU.I am a stranger and if you want  to chat with me my messenger id is    babsntenn on yahoo.com.I am online most nights and I am online now.Good Luck.|`|3jwXB5araa	your husband is......a morman?|`|AA10766729	Just move out.  Your "husband" is a JERK...and if I read the cards right, a polygamist (at least in his own mind).      Get a divorce from that a$$hole as soon as you can. Your family won't judge....just move home!  I wouldn't stand for that crap, that's for sure.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Sounds like the beginning of a cult, get out now!|`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	If I was in your situation and had to choose the lesser of evils, I think being the single parent is far better than being in a polygamist relationship.|`|4ZLEXHPaaa	Get out and Get out NOW!!!!!  There are places for young single mothers you may have to research or get involved with someone in your area.  this will not end well.  I promose please for you and your baby GET OUT~!!!!!!!!!      You can write to talk if you want, hon.|`|AA11538662	Cool Guys response is a virus I just read about.    Dump the hubby & other woman!    Mary in Camden, MI|`|q0Z6vSyBaa	i really don't think he's worth it...u should find some1 better.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	I wouldn't do it.  It can cause a drift in your marriage, and you are essentially saying, "sure, cheat on me with these three people.  It's fine."  Don't think that he won't for an instant abuse that privilege.  You should really make the focus on your family, and not his sexual desires.|`|iBPqutK5aa	WTF??? is he screwed up in the head or what... usually i wold post something serious but WTF?|`|6qPndPvXaa	I can't even read past the first sentence of this...you need to walk away from this cheating lying scumbag of a so called d*ck immediatly...your setting yourself up for a lifetime a short one at that..of heartache and your child will be scar'd for life...You know the old saying and this pertains to you..."you can lead a horse to water but you can't make her drink"..good luck g/f you will surely need it..oh and remember one other word...S..T..D.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Get yourself out of the crazy situation!  Your husband can not force his ideas on you like this! You don't need to be making YA friends right now you need to find a safe place for your baby & you to live! Do something!!!!!|`|YJlrgs5Daa	single mom looks like a safer option hun    if hes saying this now, looks like you'll be a single mom eventually anyway :( sorry.    its not as bad as it seems. and think of your child, do you want her/him to have that kind of lifestyle or father?  i wouldnt.    best of luck
8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	I don't think there is a way - just know that everyone has it no matter who they are.  No one wants to be rejected.  You just have to decide if it's worth it to put yourself out there for someone.  Are you already friends with this guy?  That can be a good way to lead up to it....|`|I5mNvqGoaa	Feel the situation out.  You might get some clues from this guy by the way he acts around you whether he's attracted to you or not.  If he seems like he thinks you're pretty and stuff, then go for it.  If he doesn't seem to be really interested, maybe it's not such a good idea to try it out (you don't want your feelings hurt).|`|Tn52aL3Zaa	Fear the worst.  As if your going to get rejected.  It doesn't make it easyer!!    But even if he does - whats the worst? your not going to die if he does reject you.    *hugs* I hope for the best!|`|JA1Fo0O6aa	not really. Im still in the same place and i have been like this for as long as i can remember. i guess one way to look at it is if you never try you'll never know. i guess in my eyes though sometimes its better to avoid the hurt/ Read his signs though make sure hes definatly into you before you make a move. good luck!
di6p10Ifaa	since you are petite. Find some nice cardigans, blues are great on me, i have brown hair and am fair complected. Pencil skirts are a must they should fit at the thigh and fall away from the knee. Get a few maybe in a few different colors. Stay away from anything that falls below the calf...this will make you look shorter. Stay with lengths that hit right at the knee cap. Invest in some great pointy toe heels to elongate your leg. Slacks are great. Trouser style denims in a dark wash. Choose jackets and blazers that hit a bit under your belly button and create shape. You also need at least one great suite in your closet. And of course don't be scared to pair up your look with some great accessories like funky beads and earrings and bangle bracelets. I hope this helps hon!|`|dc75f7d1a7ec916a7fe15fc901425d22aa	Alright since you are petite which is not a bad thing! I'm 5'3! You need something thats going to set you apart from either other person that comes in and out of that office. The market is down and people are just need investing or buying. I know it sound frumpy but a good suit will be great...try grays and black. Then my favorite party....take a bright blue or yellow pink anything that pops to add to the shirt, then the shoes....say for example if you did a yellow fitted shirt...tuck it in(your little enough to where it looks good) but use maybe navy blue necklace, and navy shoes to off set it, yellow might not be great for your complexion but use a color that best suits you.... Colors are important. Pull you hair back low and and lose....you will be a professional knock out!    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...  http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...
ZH1IE8kLaa	height and eyes. nice eyes give me goosebumps. and i need a tall guy cause i'm on the taller side. after that it's usually the smile, hair, body build (i'm a voluptuous girl) and somewhere in there i notice a guy's butt. i know it sounds weird, but guy's who have a nice butt really attract me. oh and i'm 18.|`|AA10025781	well i look for a sense of humor and an air of confidence. usually the first thing i notice about a guy is their hair or their eyes or their height(im a tall girl). but all that is just my first impression before i get to know them. im 16 btw.|`|KzTV5ECUaa	humor, fun to be around, kind, honest, comfortable to be around, some what good looking(doesn't matter), and supportive. I'm 14|`|iU8toMpOaa	A Smile, hair (love the 'wave')! personality, and he has to be semi-smart!|`|gbBVscbJaa	Well i like to see his personality. i like a guy that does sports and that for surly isnt lazy! And the firs thing i notice is whether he is hot or not, I know thats pretty bad but its true! oh yah im 15.
sEEQ9xrbaa	Take off all your clothes and jump up and down on the trampoline in front of him.    That should do it.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	He's a guy, and you're offering sex....it shouldn't be that hard to get him to do it.|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	Replace your bed with a trampoline and I'm sure he'll take the hint.|`|9Nguvwvdaa	If you are not a LOUD person (if you know what I mean) then ask him and make sure you do it at night. I think he will like it.|`|k9njLOLuaa	Just tell him that you have a wild idea, and when he asks what tell him this and see what he says. Most guys do NOT oppose to having sex ANYWHERE!!!! GOOD LUCK!!! ;)|`|1eoMM4DLaa	Ask him in a sexy voice.
CKpPpK0saa	cheating is when you GO OUT with another guy or makeout with him etc.    not talk on the phone and have a little bit of feelings for him. also DONT use your boyfriend to make your feelings from your ex. it doesnt work.
edfRUVeSaa	if your both shy, then maybe the least confrontational approach is the best. (i can't believe i'm saying this cuz i hate texting) but go up to him and just say "hey". if he's in one of your classes or takes any of the same classes be like, can i maybe get your number just in case i need to ask about some homework or anything if i miss school." even if it sounds unlikely it doesn't matter and i dont think he'll care lol. guys would like that. especially a shy guy. then slowly get to know him via text then hang out. idk. but let me now how it goes. i have AIM, my sn is shadeofgreen28 and id personally just like to know how it goes as my own social experiment. sorry ;)|`|4f752e2d3f5f42ca67188c6c79a7a283aa	jus go to him and be like hay? how yah been if you know him but if u dnt then introduce yourself and get the conversation going. and if you have a class with him than find a good chance to sit and tlk to him!! gud luck!|`|Df8GQoRkaa	well you could start by everytime u see him or make eye contact, wave and/or say hi. if u ever get the chance to just start having a casual conversation. if he's there alone just come up to him, introduce urself or ask hows it going. start to get to kno each other. eventually u guys will get closer hopefully
T7vuRDCVaa	describe to him what you look like nekkid but don't show him yet. He'll be thinking about you- trust me!|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Depends on the guy. Depends on what he wants. Depends on what you mean to him.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	Strut your stuff in front of him and dress up all sexy, but not trashy.  Do your hair, makeup, and outfit all nice to catch his eye. Give him a quick glance when you walk by him and smile and then just keep walking straight. He'll eventually just have to confront you because you'll be continuously on his mind. Also to keep yourself on his mind don't give it up quick! Ya i mean don't put out fast. If you guys get something started then keep it for a good one in a half months at least before you get into the sheets. Make him work for it! Just don't act like a bizzitch or else he'll look elsewhere for it. Instead be really sweat so he'll love being around you!|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	give him a gift|`|m0Kn06JFaa	LEAVE HIM WANTING MORE sorry caps|`|wE2etBzbaa	your dress, smile , and hotness|`|h6NRQFxxaa	Give him a kiss on the cheek.|`|hChy7BAPaa	umm....grab him randomly and kiss him. or if you guys are going out or are close to going out...maybe go down on him. that'll get him thinking about you hahah|`|iaVwgiL9aa	**** out for the boys|`|vNzc4RnAaa	start to tell him something like its important, then stop.  and dont tell him no matter how much he asks    drives me crazy when girls do that anyway. i spend half my time thinking what she couldve been talking about|`|MbfDuEmZaa	be a girl.|`|By4HPyFyaa	If a girl "grabs" me with her personality shes usually on my mind for a wile, oh confidence and eye contact help greatly in my opinion.|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	Go shopping for sexy panties and bras and maybe take him to your place, or ask to go to his, and surprise him. That is enough to make a guy think about you all the damn time wit a big smile on his face. Or maybe give him a gift.|`|pX8qJzjIaa	Just talk with him a lot and spend time together.  Not really a material guy so the whole gift thing wouldn't really do much for me, but thats just me.|`|TQHHH7kxaa	send him ur picture all the time|`|ggTDw6Diaa	Hi there. Take this from a guy, one of the best ways to keep on a guy's mind is to find an activity he REALLY enjoys and spend an hour or two doing just that. It could be anything from fourwheeling, snowmobiling, or even something a bit less adrenaline-pumping.    Also, if you are going to get this person a gift, consider it bide with his activity... Let's say a cherry bomb exhaust if he loves cars, and his muffler's a piece of crap (I wish someone would do this for me :P haha)    I remember years ago I had a friend that came with me snowmobiling, and we ended up sitting over a high pier at sunset. She recently moved away, but I'll never as long as I live forget that day.    Hope my rambling answer helped. :P
7zVc53ebaa	well, maybe she's just not comfortable enough yet saying that she loves you. Or she's just not ready to say that she loves you. that's the case a lot of the times. hope this helps you! :)|`|Qbczt3ivaa	oooh...the "smile".....I think thats usually a sign that she likes you, but not in that deep connection kind of way. It sounds like you two have a great relationship, but I dont think she is ready for that kind of "love" yet. Give it some more time and soon she'll feel the same way!      good luck!|`|hChy7BAPaa	well...i think she loves you. and you love her...but maybe she's not used to feeling this way about anyone before and so she might be having a hard time that this is actually for real. you know? i feel that way too...i feel like it's too good to be true.|`|Mn1s77hOaa	ease up a bit. she likes you but if you get too clingy you might scare her away|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I think she really loves you, but she's just not that much of an affectionate person. It seems like when you love someone, you jump into it and like to show it. With her, she loves you but she's more slow going and subdued. Your feelings may be stronger honestly, but she still loves you :)|`|YekLLS2Yaa	I am sort of like that, with one of my exes anyway  The more he pushed the 'love' thing the more I got annoyed and pushed HIM away  Just ask her if she doesn't feel the same, and cool it down I guess, because she seems a little bit less serious than you are right now
mtIEsgzfaa	Its a tough one because I am in the same situation with this guy. Is he being just nice and friendly and a gentleman or is he interested in me?  I don't know until you actually tell me that you like me or ask me out. HE hold doors open for me waves, initiates convo's, smiles, asks how my day was, waits and walks from our vehicles into our building.   I get the feeling he may like me but like i said don't really know unless you say it.
zwaXYoRbaa	Stop being "the nice guy":   http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/single...  Start emulating the "bad boy":  http://www.askmen.com/dating/curtsmith_1...|`|BsZPz3SUaa	aww, i know alot of girls who would be inlove with you. if she doesnt realize what she had with you, then YOU are too good for HER! She is stubborn and obviously doesn't value her life or her daughter's if she is with a gang member and drugdealer. that's horrible!    i wish you the best of luck. put yourself out there and i know you will find someone willing to be waited on hand in foot by you and will actually return the favor or love by waiting on you hand in foot.  good luck!(:|`|afpeWY7Jaa	i dont think girls actually want to be with a ' bad guy" it''s not like we go out looking for them. but we want a guy that will keep us on our toes. for example i have one guy talking to me that is the nicest guy i ever met, but he is too nice and bores me. And thier is this other guy i am talking to that hardly ever calls me but for some  reason i cant stay away from him, cause i want him to to want me. it's like a game, you want what you cant have, but once you have it, you will most likely move on to something new. not all girls are like this, but i happen to be and it sounds like your ex is too.
EetB3Jpyaa	We got married in a garden. It was so beautiful with a pegasus fountain and flowers. We didn't even spend any money on flowers or decorations.|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	We're renting a hall and having ours there    if that helps.|`|soJwuVdnaa	It depends on your religious association. If you are relgious then have it in a church or temple. If not, have it outside. Outside is prettier.|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	I am getting married outside. My fiance and I are both religious, but we are getting married outside instead. My mom and step dad have a big white two story house with a balcony and porch with a lot of acres (100+) so we're going to get married there. We're pretty excited... we'll be saving a lot of money.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you are a practicing member of a certain church, then get married there. Otherwise get married elsewhere. It is considered disrespectful and sacreligious to marry in a church if you are just using it as a pretty backdrop or to satisfy your family when you don't even believe in what the church teaches. It's a house of worship, not a community hall for rent.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	outside as long as its not to cold or to hot|`|AA11656721	If you are religious and your family is very traditional, than a church or local organized religious place is appropriate.  But if it is impossible to do this and you want something unique, then outside is okay too.  Look for a place that is appropriate for weddings and nice.  Like a garden or park.  Or at a beautiful beach.  Some where that you both approve of.  You can make this a very great occasion, just remember this:  The Wedding is just the first day of your married life.  There are many more days that you will have to worry about, so don't over stress your self on the wedding plans.|`|wzpCMI44aa	As a photographer, I find that the lighting situations and scenery are both more pleasant in an outdoor wedding. If you have a church wedding, at least have it in a beautiful church!

8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	Yes, I think everyone falls in love at least once- you are so young!  Your time will come!|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Does everyone become infatuated with someone at some point or another? Yes. Always. Does everyone become lucky enough to truly fall in love? No. The world is not so perfect.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	*sigh* i ask myself everyday, "will i ever find true love?"  i'm fourteen too and i really, really, really like this guy, this married man.  I refuse to love him, only because he is married.  i've never been in love, i've been infatuated and ohmydear, did it hurt when he chose her. my heart evaporated.    Give it time, I'm sure you someone out there waiting for you.|`|4jx4wAhgaa	The time will come when you reach the right age! Just be patient ok! =D|`|wE2etBzbaa	yes sure.  somebody probably loves you right now.    but you need to grow up and study so you can have intelligence to go with prettiness|`|E6W5TRZKaa	Yes. You are very young still. I didn't find love until I was 18 (now). I thought I loved a guy when I was 16, but it was puppy love. You have to wait for good things to come. They just dont show up. You will find love though! Just wait.|`|fHZjRA5Saa	yes everyone falls in love  its a natrual emotion  and yes someone will love u one day  heyy im 13 :))) ??  hahhaha    if your a chikk then MY BAD!!!

Oh and subtract like 12 years before puberty. Oh gee, 2 years? You expect love to whiz by you in 2 years? My friend...stop hurting yourself, you brain called me, it says "Stop, kill me now, its torture in here"|`|oJdyMMkUaa	let my get my crystal ball and tell you your future....    no one knows if you will find love.    some people do, and others dont.  is your night in shining armer out there?

Me3Tsul0aa	There sounds to be some type of connection possibly between you guys. One day when you guys are just chatting ask him something like "so do you like anyone right now?" and if asks you why , say "oh, just wondering.".  That's a way to bring up a conversation in which you might get to know how he feels and if he asks you the same questions say something like "well yeh but I hope he likes me too." and then if he asks who say, "i dunno. im not sure what your reaction will be if I tell you" and so on...and then finally tell him that its him. Its hard but you want to tell him right?    I hope I helped you.  Takecare and All the Best, girl ! =]    XOXO
q6sRSLI1aa	Speaking from experience, I would say that you and she need to sit down and talk about how you feel, what you think is going right in your relationship, what is going wrong in your relationship, and ways that you can fix it. I'm not sure what you could do if you two are so paranoid about being cheated on. Don't get me wrong! There could be just reasoning behind it, but I would say that you and she need to sit down and talk about it before it ruins your relationship. In regards to your anger, try closing your eyes, take a deep breath, hold it for 10 seconds, and then exhale. That has always helped me and I hope it helps you too!|`|KifasiMraa	You can;t force a healthy relationship, and you guys sound like you have trust issues that aren't going to allow you to really love each other right now.  Not only that, but relationships at your age shouldn't be work.  They should be fun and make you feel good.  Life is short, go find someone you can feel good around, someone you feel like you can trust.  Right now, you're only being childish and ridiculous to each other and frankly, its not going to change.  Once you're in a relationship, however you guys are used to acting is how its going to be.  Go find happiness somewhere else.|`|9EkFrApiaa	I think you guys have MAJOR trust issues.  You need to stop arguing and START talking and trusting.  Tell each other things that only you and she know so that each of you feel special to the other.  Also, listen to her and make her feel SUPER wonderful.|`|vUn67S7Uaa	I know were your coming from man me and my girl had the same problem u guys just need to remind each other how much u still care for one an other and why u guys first said i love you  some times the tention just get high and us being human get man u know? as for the cheating let her know u love her and mistakes were made and you both have to work on the trust issue|`|kep1iGHpaa	Make a plan that says each time you start to argue you say banana and whenever someone says banana you have to say exactly what your doing at that second. In detail. Who ever says banana goes first at saying what their doing. Then the other person goes. Then the banana sayer says what he feels right then. Then the other person. See if you can add things to this. It's important to say that you don't like fighting and that you want to stop and this is why your doing the whole banana thing. Just say to her one day when your not fighting "I've been thinking a lot lately. I don't like when we fight. And...well...this might sound kinda stupid but if means we fight less then I want to at least give it a try. So I came up with this idea. Well it goes like this...ever time we start to fight we say banana. Whoever says banana..." then just explain it. Feel free to modify any part of it to fit your circumstance. Good luck. Best wishes.|`|jXCjw64Iaa	anger is something you have to fix. i have a temper too. Just don't ever bring it out in front of your gf, much less direct it at her. Be composed and rational, thats one of the most respectable things you can do if you control it.     to Make it work...just keep going out of your way to make her feel special, and don't give her any reasons like "up and down glances" or anything like that to make her suspicious. let her know where you are and what you are doing every once in a while to prove to her that you aren't cheating but don't say that of course...don't just text, call. Calling will be much more believable. Answer more often by staying awake. if it is that important to you, you will find a way to go out of your way and stay awake.|`|KPR0tQtfaa	you just need to learn how to trust each other. have a talk with her. if you know that nothing would ever happen, look into her eyes and tell her. let your heart do the talking.|`|0eWePCWWaa	well first off the fact that you are trying to get help is a step in the right direction. Maybe giving each other a little space would be good. You two really need to build trust with eachother on even the smallest things so work on that first and remember the reasons you two got together in the first place and remind her that.if in the end it really isnt working out try to find a place that is comfortable for both of you-whether that means staying friends or not.    good luck!|`|qhAyzVaiaa	just tell her that your not cheating and that if she dealt likes you shell believe it. if she doesn't her lose. and try to have her tell u what she think wrong and u tell her. just relax and be nice to her|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	ok bro take a step back and have a look at this.    you're both worried about the other person cheating on the other? ovbiously if you are worried shes going to cheat on you, it must mean you really like her and care about her and want her all to yourself. And the same goes for her. Shes worried about your cheating on her because she loves you and wants you all to her self. this should bring you closer.    every couple argues. its natural. just try not to raise your voice and become tooo scary or she will really start to worry. Have a good old fashioned ***** to your mates or anyone that will listen. it helps.    good luck.|`|LOA5yQh0aa	My boyfriend and I have had a strong, steady relationship for over three years now. One thing that has helped us keep this up is space. We're both fairly busy and so when we started dating, we promised each other that we would be understanding about that. We don't always get to each others phone call right away, but we never fight about it, because we always have a viable explanation for each other. It sounds like you guys need to maybe try giving each other a little more independence, and it looks like you really do not trust each other. A stable relationship is based on trust. Instead of jumping to conclusions, ask each other what's been going on, and if you can do anything to help or whatever.     Anger is a self-control issue. Maybe try counting to ten, or doing some slow breathing before opening your mouth. Think of exactly what you are going to say before you do so.     How can you stop arguing? Start trusting each other a little more. That will help a ton. I know you are worried about cheating, but if the both of you have never cheated, and have only been cheated on, then you really should not worry about it. Despite this, you probably will argue a little, it's only natural. I hope this helps. :)|`|uGRS7ldmaa	TRUST  Relationship is base on trust, and this seems to be your issue. You both have to let go of the past and give each other a fair chance. Without doing this, or attempting to try, its never going to work.  As far as you loosing your temper, you need to figure out whats the real reason behind your anger, and get some type of comfort in resort. If its really out of control, get some type of professional help so you don't destroy your relationship or yourself in the process.
J9uxN55Laa	I honestly think that is a GREAT idea!! Age should not matter if there's love between two people. Cause I'm dating a guy who is 5 years older than me!! So I don't see anything wrong! If your good friends that will make more sense!! send it to her and she'll find out probably that you like her and I don't see nothing wrong, but if she's that type of girl that cares about age than I suggest you back off cause she might not even want to talk to you!! I don't it's weird, but it's your choice and not mine! Good luck though, best wishes and take care!!!=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D|`|1vigJEJtaa	yes, it would be weird.  that's not the way I'd go about pursuing a relationship|`|AA11313824	Because legally she is not an adult yet, you need to wait. Wait until she graduates before you start anything. You are risking your internship and possibly risking legal action.
BwJOeHDEaa	i know that it can be crappy having parents like that, they just want the best for you, its not like they are 'out to get you' or anything like that, they just believe that you can do better, and as for girls, your young, they are oging to come and go so dont get down on that, and if your parents are willing to put up money for piano, tutors, and trips and stuff like that, take advantage of it..i promise that the things you get out of stuff like that will be more fulfilling and might make things easier for you down the road,   and thats a good thing that you come from a well mannered family, girls like that, as well as a guy who can play the piano..  but dont be too mad at them, theyre not trying to hurt you, they just want whats best for you|`|FNptdIVfaa	tell them you want to grow up|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	i feel so sorry for you. parents that care and want the best for you are outrageous. imagine wanting you to have a good life, a respectable girlfriend, and good experiences to grow up with. boy your parents are despicable. if i were you i would go to an orphanage and try to get adopted......you spoiled little brat.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you may want to have a family like that but, too bad sooooo sad, that is not your lot in life...    your gona have to live with what ya got!|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	Look...you go to hollister ae and a&f. They pay for piano and they pay for trips in basketball teams. If they don't want to buy you a ps3, that's their decision. They are the ones paying for your clothes your food your home. And if they don't want you to have a girlfriend with a belly ring, big deal...some people aren't even allowed to date so you shouldn't complain.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	that's all you have to complain about? you are so spoiled.........|`|kz06wH7yaa	You may want a different family but you kinda have to stick with what you have  All I can say about a PS3 is to save up your allowance or something like that, they justify spending money on lessons and basketball and that stuff because its either educational or because its good for you but they don't see the benefit of a games console.   As for friends, you can pretty easily ask your friends not to come over when your parents are around or not give your parents their phone numbers.    I cant really give you help on girlfriends because I dont really introduce my parents to people I go out with and even when my siblings did my parents never tried to interfere    Em that's all, I hope it was helpful.   Just remember that they only want the best for you
tK9vi25Daa	its another girl, or hes trying to get you to think that    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|MsSHhX8zaa	Just ask him what's up. Sit down and talk to him. Ask him what he wants from you, if he wants a relationship or just to be friends.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Leave him alone, and tell him to see guys instead, as he might be gay secretly.|`|258mrT2Paa	FART|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	Stay away and get over it|`|XQH72YZWaa	hmm sumtimes guys get cought up in drama... go out with another guy if u want then ull see if he likes u just move on girl trust me less u really like him|`|GxbXseoqaa	Move on. He apparently doesn't know what he wants, and dont wait around to see what it is, then he will use you as a mat and walk all over you. He broke up with you, his fault, your better than that. If he is stupid enough to walk away, be strong enough to let him go! Don't deal with his pointless ****.|`|RNUCiRhqaa	He wants to see if he can still use you for bj's and it seems he can.|`|DsgGSkRcaa	it sounds like he deff still likes you but dosnt want to sound like a lil girl expresing his feelings.  you should give him another chance i think that you to could start out again try it c what happens and if it dosnt work out tell him your done with his non sence.    hope everything works out!|`|mITpAYReaa	I don't think that he even knows what it is that he wants, most of guys don't. I know that I play games like that all the time with my girl when we're on and off, or if I'm hanging out with someone new and want her to put a little attention on me. I think that he wants you to be all flustered, wants you to think about him and perhaps wants you to think that he is thinking about you. Try to talk to the guy once more, ask him how he feels and to put it on the table once and for all. If you both throw out your feelings about one another, and set guidelines not throwing out weird vibes or claims out. Good luck.|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	trust me i know how u feel and in my opinion i think that if he isnt willin to tell u then he is not worth it and i think that u would be better off with someone that would be honest with u and tell u if he is missin u..
jD0nfrIBaa	I can see how he could have some trust issues.  Just think, how would you feel if you found out he found some other girl attractive and had a crush on her?  It would probably make you second guess yourself and make you feel like you weren't good enough.  The best thing you can probably do is try to be as loyal and you can, and slowly gain his trust back.  It could take some time, but if you love him, then it'll be worth it. Make sure you don't lie or anything.|`|wlvKveAXaa	tell the truth and just state ur causes ( I kno I sound like a total dork) but it works|`|dalNxu8zaa	dont be ashamed...  i think he just wants to know that u wont cheat on him|`|I5mNvqGoaa	I have the same problem.  Two years later and it still seems like it must have had a huge bearing on our relationship.  I told him in the beginning about a crush I had on a guy for like a day while we were first dating.  After that we had huge trust issues.  It never really got better, we have always gone back and forth with each other about jealousy and mistrust.  I don't have much experience with this type of situation except the one I'm in, but I do know that my prior relationship didn't start that way and went much smoother.  I don't know if it will continue to be a problem in yours like it has been in mine, but if I could talk to myself a couple years ago I probably would have said to get out while you still can.|`|KPR0tQtfaa	be careful not to play games with your boyfriend. when you have a boyfriend you shouldn't really be having crushes.     if you really like your boyfriend you need to prove to him that you only like him.
tyNzkO0waa	if you have something im common with the person, bring up that, like if you share a class with them you can talk about a hard test you had, or how annoying the theater is or something. If you know something they are interested in, bring up that. Like if they they play a sport, ask them when their next game is. If you can bring up an easy simple topic that they have interest in, usually the other person will add to the conversation to keep it going. Don't stress about it too much, just keep it light and it will get easier. good luck!|`|TPn3CEK0aa	"Soo... I think my *** looks big in these jeans... do you think so?"

85F0BwUPaa	Dang! I am in the same boat but a little different see we were together for four years and are still trying to work things out! But that trust issue is there and though he talks about getting married and having kids with me it doesn't change what happened in the past. The first four months that we broke up we were still dating but when we did get back together it got worse and now we are friends but dating again and seeing if we can be together. See the love is there and all but no trust and that is a big thing. Soo..... I can tell that you are still beating yourself up about it and you have to think about it, can you trust him because if you keep thinking about him breaking it up then you will never be happy and this may take time it is not an easy step I, myself am still learning about this and I am serious now that if it doesn't work out now then why will it work out if we marry, or if it did not work in those four years why would it work out in another four? You just have to think about what also makes YOU happy and that, that trust issue you have can turn into something very ugly if you ignore it. Trust me, I know.     Good Luck!     XOXO|`|fE5bC83Saa	ok,so hello mike's sister:)),  i think the break up would build the relation stronger if you have both worked out the reasons why broke in the first place .and remember that what have brought you back is far greater than any fear to come.  good luck
q2tT8ecraa	I think it is a good idea to wait to get engaged.  Sounds like you guys need to have some more time where you are actually together vs. having him so far away.      The  fact that you fight so much is not a very good sign, to be honest.  But what is most concerning to me is that you say he gets mean and offensive.  Those are not good signs.  Who knows?  Maybe it is a sign of his maturity?  Or maybe things are really not that good between you two.      I think it is good you are waiting for a while before becoming engaged.  In the meantime you can be here and work on yourself (not that there is anything wrong with you!).  Just try to be happy, be with your good friends and family, etc.    Good luck!|`|hEcKmleVaa	Honey, if you fight about everything and he gets mean and offended, what kind of husband will he be for you?  You are too young to think about marriage.  I think this year apart was a God-send.  It will hurt, but you need to officially end this and move on.  There is life after a broken heart.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	well i dont kno what u guys are fighting about but heres my input. ull prolly have to deal with this alot since hes in the army. what probly causing the agruements is a lack of communication since hes gone alot. just make sure u dont question him too much or ask him too many questions. that usually is what sets it off.|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	sounds like you aren't happy. maybe you two should re-evaluate your relationship and see if this can really work between you two with you both being so far apart. since you all can't see each other, you have to be willing to put your feelings and everything out on the table and talk about them. he has to tell you whats going on with him. you have to tell him what's going on with you and how you feel. if you both can't share your feelings through words you have no chance of making it.
ZwDdYnM5aa	Well after the game is over maybe wait by the guys locker room and wait until the guy comes out and give him a cute/flirty smile and say this softly "Hey." then make conversation maybe even ask him to walk to you out. You can then before you leave ask for his number. Wait a day or two call him up and ask if he wants to hang out.

JPBh5WT3aa	Don't panic is the first thing. I know there is anger going on....and this has got to have you worried....but your parents have survived through some really hard things for 25 years....and they can survive this too.     Your dad is pissed about this contact, which is kind of good in a way. That means he cares about your mom. So I would say overall, at first it is really upsetting but with time it will bring your parents closer and make their marriage stronger. Give them space to work it out, and don't get pulled into the middle of it.     Best of luck.|`|f9crUDTwaa	What you do is " mind your own business" . This is not your problem . It belongs to your parents . Leave it alone.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Your dad should suggest having him over for dinner. What the hell, I was contacted by a former sweetheart just recently and thought I had died and gone to heaven. Come to find out, my former gal had converted to Catholicism and believed in marriage. I thought for sure we were going to hit the rac that night. I finally came down from my pedestal and got on with my life.
ebc5e2e4098b7079e0c6cfb2ee412605aa	I can't believe you're actually thinking of doing this?  1st, HR will know you're primarily doing this to try and get her in trouble as a last-ditch low blow. It would be hard for them to even take you seriously.  2nd, if she is leaving in a week, HR wouldn't even have time to fully investigate before she is gone. If they process a term form for her, they aren't going to write her up after a term form is already in process.  3rd, you'll be scrutinized for all your past emailings. It is kind of HR's job to eliminate idle employees (haven't you heard of the millions of job cuts in the past year???) Employees who have a lot of time to email will be 'watched' -- or on the mental list of HR.    It was actually a nice thing of her to care enough to say goodbye, and to try and leave on a good note.  You are either 1) young (professionally immature) or 2) old and cranky  5 seconds ago - Edit - Delete|`|AA11644956	ummm...no.    this is really YOUR mess.     1st, you used company email and time to play friends at work....when you should've been working.    so if you snitch, you're just going to get in trouble for some bullsh*t that you shouldn't have even been doing at work.      2nd, she's trying to apologize. why don't you meet her on break and squash it for the sake of work???    3rd, if she's leaving the company, let this mess fly. it will be out of your hair soon enough.    her email account will be no good once HR boots her out of the system. and if she tries to contact you via her personal email, you can just block it.      go to work....and actually DO work.           ---  check out my fashion site:    www.styleandregalia.com|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	No...and besides, why is she apologizing for? What did she do? That doesn't matter though. If you guys were really friends, you would be able to accept her apology.
IWFI6ey4aa	there are alot of things that make or break a relationship and yeah laughter is one of those things. You really have three options here:    1.) learn what kind of things make her laugh or what kind of things she finds humorous and try and do or say those things. the downside to this is that you're pretending to be someone you aren't. (or your changing for someone you love, take your pick).    2.) Focus on the other things in the relationship that make it strong. Make sure she knows that you are always there for her. Do sweet things for her (surprise her at work or whatever it is you think will make her smile). Be creative in other aspects of the relationship. downside to this is that you still won't be making her laugh.    3.) Tell your friend that it bugs you when he makes her laugh. This of the three might be the worst if you really care about her for a couple reasons. First, she will be laughing less often... and we wouldn't want that would we? Second, it might create some awkward tension wit you boi, and I dunno if that's worth it for you (I'd say bros before hos, but we all know there's a million loopholes to that).     Overall I'd stick with option 1 & 2, a combination of both would be spectacular. As an addition, you could try to team up wit ur boi and have both of you make her laugh at stuff. That way you're kool with your friend, more laughs all around, and when she see's the two of you goofing off together, she'll think of him more as her boyfriend's (you) friend instead of just some random guy.     hope that helps and I didn't just ramble, good luck eitha way!|`|kvcIdORcaa	you're feeling insecure. don't sweat it. the way she looks at him (hopefully and probably) isn't the same way she looks at you. i have guy friends that i would really never consider going out with but are funny, then i have my boyfriend who is the one i really love and care about in the boyfriend way|`|7OjiB7vWaa	if your friend is really a funny guy chill if he is totally not that worry but it sounds like he is funny so just put your arm around your girl while shes laughing you know to reassure your dating or that you love her....your not going to loose her maybe you should laugh with her too.|`|ISzhKvE8aa	why dont you make your gf laugh? o.O|`|dL2SelcBaa	tell him.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Wtf are you gonna do?  Tell him to quit being funny?  Is it his fault you're lame?  Dont confront him, because he is the innocent bysrtander here.  If you feel you need to do something, ask her if there is a problem and you need to know where you stand.  Tell her why you're asking. You're going to look like a little biiitch, though.|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	yeah well gurls usually go 4 da funny guyz s0 watch out. and thats mad selfish and dumb on ur part caz if ur friendz a funny guy what are gonna say "0h dont make my girlfriend laugh no more" OF COURSE NOT u should play ur game and if it doesnt work it didnt work|`|4JGTC2MHaa	I think maybe you should look at her instead of him. Laughing at what your crush says is a way girls flirt. If she's laughing at him instead of you there might be a problem.    Unless, of course, he is actually really a funny guy.|`|se0NiMTVaa	try to make her laugh &  tell him if it doesnt work.|`|WlnnsGM5aa	Quit being so insecure and have fun with her, or you will lose her, not because your friend makes her laugh, but because he is easier to be around and more fun. Lighten up andenjoy being with both of them. Besides which is more important, the friend or the girl?|`|vhraHxtNaa	punch her in the mouth
t9rTToWYaa	High school is tough, believe me, I'm going through it too.  Let's tackle each issue one by one.    First, friends.  Those people that leave you, aren't your friends.  Friends don't leave you.  I know it's hard, but meet new people.  Volunteer somewhere, join a team, etc.  You can find new friends this way.    Second, appearance.  Don't put yourself down!  I know, I'm not perfect either.  But no body is perfect.  Those supermodels on the covers of magazines, puh-leez.  Airbrushed and photoshopped.  I want you to look at yourself and name three things that you love.  Your eyes, hair, smile, etc.  I want you to look yourself everday and remind yourself that you're beautiful.  You might not be the next Megan Fox, but no real person is skinny as a toothpick.  Short=cute.  Little fat=try some exercises and watch what you eat.  very ugly= not true.  Work with what you have.  Wear clothes that flatter your figure.    Third, parents.  I know that they're stressing you out, but that's because they care.  Confront them that they don't need to remind you all the time and tell them that you will work hard.  The verbal and emotion abuse, tell them about it.  If they don't understand, learn to deal with it.  Counter with something positive.  If they say that you're stupid, tell them that you got a good grade on your test today.  Make everything positive and they'll learn to trust you.    Fourth, you want to be a writer, director, actor!  You know what those jobs need?  Confidence.  Follow your dreams, okay?    Don't be depressed.  Whenever I'm depressed, I cry it out.  I get angry, slam doors, turn the volume on my radio so high the floor shakes.  You know why?  Cause I don't need my burden of sadness holding me down.  So I get rid of it.  I write mean notes, I cry, I throw things.  I'm getting rid of my depression and I want you to do the same.  Don't let all this hold you down.  I want to see you be the next big writer, famous director, or walking down the red carpet as an actor.    Good luck.  Stay confident.  And remember that you're beautiful.|`|sLtmg9xzaa	I'm sorry... but it's really hard for me to answer to whatever that might satisfy you. I don't really know how to answer such a question.    I wish and want to help you. I really do. But I can't. All I can do is tell you a few things and all you can do is listen and choose to take the advice or not.    But I feel that in high school, there are a lot of challenges and things that we would constantly battle and face. It's because it's high school, social and academic pressures are constantly on the edge hitting at us to become part of it and work at it. We're not good at everything.     Try joining a community activity in the local area, doesn't have to be part of school. To be honest, I never fit well in school. School isn't really my thing. I try making friends and only to find myself at the back of the line of the "new friends" who are so much "greater" than I.    Just skip a school day and head out to the community centre and look at the volunteering that you could do. Do something that is part of your interest or something close to it, don't force yourself to take whatever. But take something you might enjoy.... who knows until you try it out!!! You will find people who have the same interest or someone who may be similar to you-- you might even be friends with them..    Here's something that I've learnt in my years.... the strong stick with the strong, the weak with the weak. In my case, I was part of the weak, I ended up being with the weak and I tried hard to be part of te strong, but I wasn't good enough. So I stayed with people who are SIMILAR to me....|`|EgUxu5kjaa	awww, have you tried talking to a school consellor about this?  joining a club out of school is a good thing to do too!  writing your thoughts and dreams down is also a good idea!|`|H5DdF6V9aa	Believe me when I say - high school is not any kind of indicator of what the rest of your life will be like. You are young and have not even sampled what real life can be like. Spend the rest of your H.S time doing your best to set yourself up for the life you desire in the future. You will be surprised how different things will be once your life really begins. You have a ton to look forward to.|`|BHeBSGemaa	Hey girl, if you need someone to talk to or just vent you can e-mail me. Just go to my profile, I allow e-mails. I understand the depression and I definitely felt really crappy during high school. I am sorry that your friends are leaving you. Is there anyone like you, that you see alone a lot that you can befriend? Look for girls that seem lonely and see if they want to hang out sometime. I don't know if that sounds pathetic or not, haha, but you can probably meet girls that way that feel the same way as you do. Have you tried talking to the friends that have left you? Ask them what's up. Focus on school more, because good grades will help boost your self esteem. Join the drama club if you like acting, you can meet more people that way as well. Does your school have a counselor? Seeing the school counselor can also help with your depression. As for your parents, I don't know what to tell you. Try explaining to them how you feel. Good luck to you and e-mail me if you need to.|`|BgVWSApdaa	It sounds like you need antidepressants and maybe counseling.  The right medicine really does help!  Is it possible for you to get an appointment with your doctor for this?    The other thing is that you are at a really tough phase of your life but I promise that it's just a phase.  It won't last forever.  Having friends move away is so hard and feeling alone can be very overwhelming.  I understand where you are at.  Having parents that put pressure on you is so hard too.      I suggest that you realize that you are treating yourself pretty bad.  Look at your question.  You really put yourself down.  You need to knock that off.  Treat yourself with kindness and cut yourself a little slack.  All you can do is your best.    I don't know if you are a person of faith or not, but know that you are known completely and loved very dearly already by the creator of the entire universe.  Just talk to Him - He will be there when no one else can.  And He knows your future so you can put your trust iin Him.  God bless -|`|IYhf0X5raa	well joining a sport at school might help you, you get to be part of a team and you will make friends. try not to strees too much and continue with your life. try making new friends by starting to talk to poeple in your classes and you might even find a best friend.good luck!|`|ou3TcHdmaa	you just need to stay true to your ambitions, and don't let anyone stop you    in a lot of cases there have been people who have had a rough high-school experiences, but experiencing all of it will only make you stronger in the end, now is not the time to put yourself down, you just have to ignore all negative aspects and look towards making things positive|`|IWFI6ey4aa	join some clubs at school that you find interesting, you'll find people there that you may have things in common with and you'll make friends. Try and make jokes when you think they are going to be funny (and appropriate in case teachers n' stuff are around) and ppl will notice you. Don't be corny tho, then u'll just get an awkward look and silence.     When you're really feeling down grab a pen and paper and just write down everything that pops into your mind, don't skip or ignore anything. That way you'll be forced to realize what bothers you and you can address all the little (or big) things one at a time.    keep you head up, things will hopefully play out for the best in the end :)|`|AA10792445	hey. its okay. life is short enough. don't make it any shorter.   just chill and relax. i actually suffer from depression. and have thought about harming myself. but u may not realize it, but people do care about you, and would be really sad if you would do harm to yourself.   and im sorry about ur parents. sometimes they can be that way. but if tell them that they are putting to much pressure on u. and u cant handle it. help them understand.   and i have had friend problems myself. but in the end u are to good for them, and they dont matter. your life wil turn around. just look for a bright side.. and maybe to gain or meet new people, join  a new activity, like choir, or dance, or theatre. there are a ton of great people. just put ur self out there, and dont give up.|`|hJ08mpk1aa	Father GOD loves you.You want approval from people and most likely mediocre people.You are a person destine for greatest.

Get to the voice of Father GOD.|`|JPcFDfMaaa	You need to find at least one person to trust and talk to because it would help you take a load of things off you're chest. My best friend is someone I have never met before yet I tell him everything that happens and he does the same. We are extremely close yet we have never met. It may seem weird but when I was all suicidal and depressed, he helped a lot by just being there when I had to get things off my chest. If you need someone to talk to then I'm always here. E-mail me or something if you need someone to listen to your problems. Good luck with everything.|`|v6Ihgewqaa	You're not the only one that feels lost, I do too sometimes. I was depressed for a few months over something stupid, heck I'm still not over it, but you should learn to love yourself first. Every now and then just tell yourself a compliment, like a nice hair day. Not much, but it helps, well me. Everyone's different and has their own way of doing things. Your parents are just trying to let you have a secure future, mine are the same, and heck it sinks .    Feeling lost is normal, so don't feel bad about it. Eventually, you'll figure out what you want to do, I still don't know what to do.. So just relax about grades and look for things that make you happy. Maybe a walk around the nieghborhood?
AA11544150	She's a overprotective, controlling freak.  Good riddens to her!     who's the weirdo who is exacting revenge through a questions. gross.|`|fc3bbedf8713faf65217aa31c090c66caa	stop yapping, get over it. blah blah you guys fight too much.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You are mad because she is keeping her kids away from your verbally abusive husband? I'm glad she cares about her kids. Even if he doesn't do it in front of people, she should not let her kids get anywhere near a guy like that. And why are you still with him if he treats you so bad? Your kids could be next, or has he started to verbally abuse them? Take your kids and go.    There is a difference between arguing and verbal abuse. Yes, couples argue, but verbal abuse is not arguing, it is abuse.

BeAVEk2yaa	Well, I think I answered another one of your questions...haha.  What a coincidence, right?  Thanks for the best answer, by the way. :)    Well, I'm 6'1. Right about now you sound pretty hot. :)  Honestly I wish I knew you.   (I don't mean that in a weird, stalker way or anything haha)  I don't meet many guys as tall as you.   It would be refreshing.   Plus tall guys are sexxxxy. hah. :)  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with you in terms of personality and appearance.     I think if I were a short girl, I'd like a tall guy like you to "protect" me.     Consider using your height as a conversation starter.  Next time a girl asks you how tall you are say something witty and make her laugh.  If she says you make her feel really short, say something like "Yeah, I'm tall but I bet you could beat me up."  She'll remember you, and not only because you're tall but because you're funny. :)    Also be on the look out for tall girls.  It's pretty embarrassing to be a girl with a boyfriend shorter than you.  So if a tall girl sees you, I'd bet she would try to talk to you. ;)    One day, some nice (and pretty) girl will look at you and she'll see more than how tall you are.     I hope it happens for you. :)|`|TRrTunqvaa	well i think tall guys are sexy too, so maybe youre just ugly. sorry, but im being honest. i mean, maybe you not and girls are just intimidated, but i wouldnt be.|`|8IhNkHZ9aa	I prefer a guy whos taller than me, but it doesnt matter if hes nice and stuff. he could b 4' or 9' and i wudnt care as long as i liked him|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	at least 5ft 10 and over no shorter|`|w2yh8Acraa	it depends... my bf is 5'7.5" but i am usually more attracted to the over 6'2" crowd... i'm 5'5.5" and done growing... i think...

Height doesn't matter.|`|UVYrXcGOaa	i dont care about hieght  if you have good personality & dress well then you shouldnt matter about your heightt|`|XzkvqTyxaa	i like a guy who is taller than me and i am 5"7 still growing and it depends on your age. considering your height.|`|K5BLCZPkaa	Well I'm only  5'2" so I would prefer under, but over is fine too. You are one tall kidd!|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	well personality is also a major key for me. if they try talking to you like that they might be interested. when they ask how tall u are return the favor ur sumthin try to keep talking to them. the reason it seems like every one shorter gets the girls is because your the only one you know of your hight. guys usually wont get girls by just being tall or short. every thing matters . but dont be shy. be confident. no confidence is a total and complete turn off for me. be gentle and sweet and they will notice. but you have to put your self out there u know?    (im not sure if thist confidence stuff relates to you im just guessing but i might be wrong. if i am im really sorry. i couldnt tell by the question)    things that are turn offs for me:  no personality  shy  quiet  fat(some chub is definately ok. just not morbid obessity ; ])  stank!  greasy hair  man whores  ect...    turn ons for me:  big personality  sweet   caring  loveable  cuddly  able to talk to  talkitive  eyes and hair are a big thing with me  ext...    those are all just me but i think a lot of girls could relate. it all changes with the type of personality they have.|`|JKKR67M9aa	I like guys over 6 foot... mmm|`|bljEhh86aa	yes, I LOVE IT
AA12113076	hm... the fact that he told you "how he knows i want him to take me out on a real date" doesn't sound good at all, he might like you but not too much  you don't have to show him that you like him, he already know it  you shouldn't do anything, just mind you own business and if he ever liked you at all he'll be back asking you out|`|8nexYdUjaa	lol I think he may like you =) he may not know exactly how you feel about him ! The next time you see him, maybe you could let him know that you really like him & it would be great if you guys could get to know eachother more. if you're not too comfortable doing that yet, invite him to go do something with you (movies, etc.) and see what he says ! you could also just talk to him more, get to know him more, and then when you feel the time is right, tell him how you feel =) just take things slow, there's no need to rush into anything. it sounds like you two already have something going, so all you have to do it keep the motion rolling at your own pace. good luck, i hope i helped*
O9jrkjgraa	Just go hang out....|`|C2DJZfrVaa	kiss him on the lips he'd like that
GBr9YngTaa	Perhaps she did, or she thought it was childish. If someone deleted me off facebook (even though I don't have one) I wouldn't readd them because I know they deleted me for a reason.    Should you readd her? There is no harm in doing so.|`|utQC6dhjaa	just say you created a new facebook
ODf41iN4aa	Yeah, if you were meant to be together, then it will happen.  If you're not right for each other, & that's his viewpoint, then wanting it to be true won't make it true.  Just take it as it comes.  I hope it works out the way you want.      If not, then take a long break from dating to reestablish your identity & to feel good about yourself as a person, & then try again.  It would be a heart breaker at this point, but there is more than one possible guy who is right for you, & you know it has to be mutual.  Maybe it is with this one, & maybe it isn't,  Again, I wish you the best.|`|HcjCdLehaa	Aww. I am so sorry. You might. It depends on the situation.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	time will tell. and if he feels the same way then you ain't got nothing to worry about.|`|a1WK8NtYaa	Explain to him how you feel and who knows he might be thinking that same though.  Also if your over 18 start talking about finding away to get closer, moving in with eachtoher--bahh blahh.  Lol.  Stuff like that.,|`|fH8unJ3Jaa	You will be together if you want to be. Trust me if you love each other that much, wait for each other. Try to see each other by driving to meet up at a movie or food place or something.|`|FVDTXM68aa	Why give up on Love?! NEVER!! If you two are meant to be, things will work out!! :) Just be patient and take each day at a time!! But seriously, don't give up!!!|`|ZGJZvGjZaa	If in a relationship you ever question it, that means in itself that the relationship isn't worth it.   I've been married 22 years.  Parts of the relationship get better over time, but not the feeling of needing to be together.  If you are already having trouble with that the relationship is definately over.  You need to move on, find a nice man who is there for you.  Good luck!
vHwYENVjaa	ok, basically you are asking for girls to cyber with.    i'll be straight up with you, have a webcam, and download camfrog.    there are tons of girls on there who do "shows" for guys who wack off to them.. TONS. and IT'S FREE. it's just like a yahoo or msn chat.|`|Og4Wuqn4aa	Lol why are you looking for this??? Go out and meet real people. (:
pQFENLOSaa	she might have been blushing because she was embarrassed for some reason and you may have misunderstood... i blush veryy easily and it generally does not mean anything even though some people think so... for example i blush at compliments from anyone    but maybe she did have an assignment due or doesnt like coffee... its not like you gave her a chance to make another date because you havent seen her since and she doesnt have a way to talk to you    my advice is to go to the place you asked her out which ur friend sees her at all the time and start another conversation... wait for her to suggest meeting somewhere else to avoid appearing desperate|`|WMR8hVlfaa	I think you misread her. If she turned you down, she's not interested.|`|2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	Simple, you suprised the mess out of her, she probably didnt expect that, your in. Next time you see her, say, "now that you've time to think about me overnight, is your answer still no?" If she says no, you've caught yourself a dame. Thats good what you did. Keep it going mick. Your on your way!
AA10270012	well really when you been with some one for a while you tend to bond with each other. that's  when you know each other really well and you would always have a spot in your heart for that person because that is how love works but if you have any doubt in your heart that yall wont get back together i say no i wouldent wait for that person cause it takes a chance from you meeting someone better. or some one that will make you happy.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Keep trying to move on. Do not wait for a man. If he wanted you, he would be with you. Since he clearly moved on: you should, too!|`|96RDuDofaa	I think you should keep trying to move on because even though its been 2 years, love takes time to fade away and there could be someone out there @ this very second you will come to love even more than your ex, but you will never know because you are stuck on only that 1 person. Give yourself more time and keep dating, you'll find an escape soon, trust me.  xD|`|F5gtYbDVaa	move on! what the fuuucck...  hes got a girlfriend for christs sake. and theyve been together for 2 years?  uhh.. i dont think he should be saying he still loves you.. thats basically cheating on his girlfriend.. :p|`|0NQL7yRPaa	means ur dumb if hes with another girl move on damn it|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	I am sorry! I know how you feel, I haven't been able to stop loving or get this one guy off of my mind for over 15 years!! So I guess I can't help you much. I moved on and have a good relationship for many years and I still have him in my heart. Just try your hardest to not do things that make it worse, like listening to certain songs , or talking to him often.|`|AA11108018	Remember this for ever  Only love can break a heart and only love can mend it again  I don't know why  it is but your first love always stays in your heart forever.

It sounds like he's having fun being in control of your emotions. He just on a power trip. A girlfriend for 2 damn years??!!! please, he's def a bastard. Think about the other girl too and how she must feel.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Keep trying to move on! But dont think bad of urself cuz you still love him....its not controllable|`|zhq5sW4laa	Move on, be hid fridn but move on. He's been with his girlfirnd for two years and thats how it is. be his friend if you can but if you cant get rid of those feelings while being his friend then you need  to drop it. You need to look out for yourself  now|`|FJVwsYCOaa	its very hard to forget someone you love so much such as you ex. and thats just plain LOVE. no wonder they say "wherever there is a fire ashes remain". but you need to realize that he is not yours any more. and if he really loves you and cares about you then he needs to be honest with his current girlfriend and tell her who he really cares about. but thats his call and only his. not yours. that way he and his girlfriend are not waisting their time. good luck honey.|`|s7Ze2Y3Haa	you can't be friends... one of you will always be holding on, and in this case it looks like it's you who is holding on|`|L2xa4gvYaa	i had the same thing happen to me but worse he cheated on me with 8 girls, he shouldnt be saying he loves you when he is with someone else unless its in a brotherly sister best friend kind of way...but if he is trying to keep u there that either means that he is afraid to let you go just in case something happens with his other girl.. or he is just confused, but if you are hurt and confused i think you should confront him about it and ask him what exactly he is trying to do? but if he doesnt answer that or he says a weird answer just tell him that you want to move on  or just to stay away from eachother for awhile because you are confusing me and i dont like it..or you can move on completly but trust me you dont want to be with a guy that leads you on when he is dating someone else because it might lead into a bigger heartbreak....  good luck hun
zUdxoRbyaa	my twin daughters are 17 y/o. most of it is normal. you will find a lot of ways to calm them down. one of the best ways is that when they behave they get an hour of cartoons with you or dad in your bed. it calms them down for sleep and gives them something to look forward to. there is another thing is i always was the one that read to them at night. the one thing i insisted on is that i would never let them go to bed crying, they shared a room. i would joke around with them until they were happy and laughing. sometimes it took over an hour but it was time well spent.|`|i8FtcBWgaa	if they throw food take it away  if they don't want to pee, make it a fun by awarding them with a cookie or something  and give them time outs and if they get up from their time outs keep putting them back in the time out area until they are quiet and then go and talk to them  don't get angry with them, stay calm  and in charge  don't let them know that they are getting to you, you're the boss, show them you mean what you say and don't give up.|`|iD4ejChZaa	Bible, it doesn't matter what you think, our kids are on loan to us from God and he says 'folly is bound up in the heart of a child but the rod of correction will drive it far from him'. [Proverbs]. I used a wooden spoon when my boy was that age, & my kids ended up college educated, contributing members of a tax paying society. Nobody on welfare, nobody ever in jails, etc. Even my high functioning autistic son does volunteer work.    He also drives and is into sports and very much into church activities. Trust me he got the spoon when he deserved it yrs. ago. Take her aside, alone & discipline her, then when she stops crying give her a little hug. There should be tears of repentence. That is your job. Do not nag her about what she did wrong, just be swift & consistent, then back to play time, It only has to sting. She'll get the idea who is boss. I saw boy of about 4 in the market screaming and hitting his mom even kicking her, when I asked her why she din't discipline him she replied she doesn't believe in 'violence' I said 'too bad your son does'.|`|iyLV1CADaa	I think I can help you. Basically, you need to understand Skinner's theories involving rewarding good behavior. The two nanny shows sometimes demonstrates these. The other good source are dog training books. There is a wonderful theory that nothing is given unless it is given as a reward for good behavior. So, don't ever give your children anything like cookies or ice cream unless they have demonstrated good behavior. What you do is say that the house rule is that no food can be thrown and if food is thrown, the child will be given only bread or something equally unappealing for the meal. If the food is not thrown, the child will get a cookie for desert.     Dogs are kept in an enclosed space until they are potty trained. With supervision, you could set your daughter on a potty seat and tell her that when she goes, she can get up and go play. Otherwise, she needs to remain on her child potty seat. If she gets up, there will be no dessert or playground activity for that day.     Another idea is to keep M&Ms in your pocket and tell your daughters that you want them to listen to what you say and if they do, they will each get to select 5 M&Ms.      I think kids are a lot like dogs and I wish I had read the dog training books when my kids were young rather than when I got a dog.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	At three, it's normal to throw temper tantrums.  It's also normal to test the limits of your parents' patience.  The fact that your kids feel like terrors to you at age three doesn't mean that they won't grow into lovely children and adults.  Toddlers are just trying people!    Tantrums are just a toddler's way of expressing anger.  There's no way to stop them from feeling angry sometimes.  After all, even as adults, we all have to wrestle with anger.  Tantrum management should focus on helping the child to verbalize their feelings and to make it clear to them that while it's okay to feel angry or disappointed, they cannot continue with their tantrum in a public area.  Feel free to send them to time out or to their room to cool down.  Before they return to a public area, the tantrum needs to have ceased.    To make yourself feel better about your kids, you should try joining a playground or even hanging around a playground for an afternoon.  You'll see that other three year olds probably exhibit the same behaviors that your kids do.  Most parents find their four year olds are easier to deal with!    You really can't ensure that your kids are happy.  Kids have their own temperaments, motivations and stress-thresholds.  It's not a good idea to focus on making them happy.  It's better to focus on making them healthy and ensuring that they know they're loved for who they are.    You can't control their happiness, but you can control the environment they're in: you can make sure that they're around positive people, exposed to positive television shows and music and their contact with negative influences is minimized.  You can set expectations of behaviors and consistently observe consequences when they fall short.  You can praise the heck out of them for their achievements.  You can let them know that they're loved no matter what, etc.  You can set a good example with your own behavior, language and attitude.    My point is, you can't MAKE your kids BE anything - including happy.  To use a metaphor, kids are like seeds.  You plant them and watch them grow.  If you're a good gardener, you make sure you're planting them in fertile soil, watering them regularly, keeping out the weeds, and pruning them when necessary.  You can't make a rose a tulip or a daisy a dandelion; what you can do is make sure they have the nourishment, protection and love to become the best whatever they are that they can be.  This is the best way to help them toward happiness; you can't make them happy, but you can give them the tools that can help them to make themselves happy.    Trips to Disney and the like are lovely, but lavish trips don't ensure lasting happiness.  Stuff doesn't bring happiness.  Having intimate relationships with a loving family attracts happiness.  There are a lot of ways to create that relationship that don't require loads of cash.|`|QQ1Vwsj8aa	Honey I thinkl twins are just more of handful, I've got twin boys and O, my god I wanted to scream so much when they where younger....twins usually develop slower than single kiddos and add really might be something.  Maybe in the house to much or with you to much, they need a break also.  Money dosen't buy happiness...Good luck|`|1nPHS0Eoaa	Well I have friends who are twins and when they were little...they ate dirt, magazines, fought, and did a lot of crazy things.  You should just get some coloring books and go in your room and shut the door and color with them and keep them away from anything that could cause trouble. Even though coloring could trigger some thoughts to them, but just try to be with them and have mother child bonding time. Or even play with their toys with them.|`|2DVr4C5Baa	Im a twin. and i think we were like that when we were younger. we always did things together against my parents we would make big messes, climb on windows,etc. i think its normal.( we also had our own little language)|`|JKKR67M9aa	Maybe they have ADD??
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Weddings were very simple back then.  A woman would have worn her best dress and gotten married at their local church, frequently right after Sunday church.  White dresses weren't popular until the 1950s.    Are you wanting a 20s theme or to know about actual 1920s weddings?    A wedding band would have been very thin.  Only the bride would have received one.  The practice of grooms receiving them wasn't until WWII.  Also the bride's band would not have held diamonds.  DeBeers didn't start that marketing campaign until 1947.  In the early 1900s, it would have been platinum but WWI restricted metal usage.  Due to this shortage, gold became more common.  Other metals became popular and the 1920s and 30s involved detailed bands engraved with orange blossums and wreaths.    The wedding would have cost next to nothing.  Every state did not have a marriage license law until 1929.  So this couple probably did not get a marriage license, only the close family was invited, and the only fees were a small donation to the church and a small meal to the family.  Remember a HOUSE only cost 2000-3000 dollars.  A car was $850.  A wedding would have never been more than $20.  The ring would have most likely been a piece handed down through the family or whatever stone was local.    However if you are interested in a 1920s theme wedding there are lots of sites on that.    A Flapper style dress, jazz music, and gangsters of the 1920s Chicago era.    http://www.wedthemes.com/1920s-theme-wed...
TRrTunqvaa	it really sounds that you were just depressed from losing the baby, and youre probably over it.    if you have sex, i do think feelings will flood back. i really really do think.    whatever happens, i wish you the best of luck, and im so sorry for the loss of your baby =\
aeC6Qp8Eaa	maybe he realized how much he liked you & wants to give it another shot (:    i would definetly go on that date but i wouldn't make all the moves...let him be first. it's better -trust me.     good luck :D|`|iGZWeWwBaa	my opinion is either:   A) He is trying to make-up & be friends  or   B) he is being more than a friend & you should go!    If he is blushing, or always has good breath near you or those signs, then it's B|`|tC4cESaCaa	well as i think....he is using u...definately he want u back...but not because he likes u or love u....there must be some other reason behind it    u should better ask him before again going out with him ''after break up why u called me''.....n wen he tell u why judge his ans....then u will know wat he actully want from u!!|`|tTTtNLfhaa	I think you have to go because I have lost someone I love before  or if you don't go I think you will suffer more then the boy you meet.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may want to keep a close eye on him because it seems that he is taking advantage of you.  To me, it looks like he is trying to be a friend which should be a number one after the breakup.|`|vpvITq2Daa	Yes! why? cus may be he didnt know what he was doing the first time around. he whant u back and it sound promising. go for it. if all els fails then qwite
JDltTREfaa	If you are not going to forget him or leave him, then what difference does it make if you believe him or not?    So if you are not going to forget him or leave him, you should absolutely ignore it when he flirts and does things intentionally to piss you off and/or hurt you.  And yes, you should believe him when he gives you an explanation.  There's no point in fighting with him so you might as well be sweet and loving to him, right?    But it's really nice that you forgave your best friend for flirting with her ex-boyfriend in front of you when YOU are deceiving her about seeing him in the first place.  That was really generous of you.|`|b04999b0e7ff207909ed958e37c605caaa	is it necessary for the bra?|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Ya he's telling the truth. No guy (unless a real player) would start flirting with another chick that soon after a break up. If that was me and I still loved you, and I did that, it would be my way of trying to make you jealous and make you want me back.|`|7OjiB7vWaa	ok well tell your best rfriend to clear everything out that will be hard for you but trust me tell her it will clear lots of things and tell your bf first.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Well, there's nothing really wrong with what he did since you were supposed to be broken up when he flirted with her.  And if you two are keeping things a secret from her of course she's going to flirt back with him if she doesn't know you're together.  It sounds like you're actually creating more unnecessary drama by not telling her the truth because if she's really your friend and knows you guys are together then she wouldn't flirt back with him.    In short, I think you should believe him because you two weren't together at the time.  But if he still does it when you're together then I would say talk to him about it and tell him how much it bothers you.    Edit:  I think you're not really looking for an answer because you're only looking to read what you want to hear.  If you're telling us that you don't want to forget him because you love him, then what's the point of asking for any advice?|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you answer your own question by saying don't tell me just forget him.  now if you can't see want he is doing you need some help!!!|`|ISzhKvE8aa	1. why do you have a pic of you in your bra..  2. tell her who the hell cares they broke up right? so waht if she finds out she should accept the fact that your bf and her are over   3) im pretty sure he did that to make you jelous or something...from waht im reading.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	wow your relationship that you have with your boyfriend doesn't sound like it is going to last first of all he is your best friend ex-b/f ouch you should have come clean with her about that and now the only thing your b/f can think to do is to flirt with his ex your best friend|`|22EVxBYWaa	yea i think u should give him another chance.(: he seems ok.    answer mine plz?? go to my profile && click on da latest question ive asked. plz && thank youu(:|`|0FvFzgniaa	a bit of both.  he prob did wanna piss you off, no doubt.  but to be honest, he probably wanted to tap your best friend as well.  I mean, if she laid herself out naked for him, do u think he would of turned it down?    He's a man, of course not.|`|hUsW2Iymaa	Yeah forgive him, he was just trying to make you jealous which lots of people do even though it isnt really the greatest idea.    Id reconsider your best friend honestly. What were her reasons?|`|q2tT8ecraa	This doesn't sound "weird" (your word) - it sounds really immature.  If you love him, great, work it out with him, but won't you feel better having a relationship that you can put out in the open?  Why not let your best friend know?  Why keep you guys a secret, especially if you love him!?      So I say be with him, work on an open, honest relationship in which you let people know you are together and that you really care about each other.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Ae you in middle school  because it sounds like it  In two years you will remeber this and just laugh about it    Do what you want, it will b over in a good 2 months  and you'll find a new "love"|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	If you broke up for "just 7 hours" and he immediately ran back to his old girl-friend - but then he went back to you but didn't tell his old girl-friend.....    I have to ask - Does he have 1 or 2 girl-friends?    But if he just "flirted with her" why not tell her unless there was more there than just flirting?    Are you sure his ex-girl friend hasn't been told that she is his girl-friend cause you and him broke up?  And not to talk to you so there will be no drama from you?|`|jPLiMCPDaa	You already know what the best advice is, that's why you said "and don't tell me"...|`|eTm9uLqyaa	If he loves you..  He wouldn't need to piss you off..  He should know that yall would end up getting back together..|`|50fc8503a82ad4a3d7a2568f22b34236aa	Well...if it was just flirting I wouldn't worry about it too much. If he has never given you a reason to doubt him before I wouldn't start now..    But on the other hand if it has been a problem in the past then he might be lying to you.     Good Luck|`|yiceglu7aa	Well do YOU believe him when he tells you that?   Just be careful with the situation if you really don't believe him 100%.   I'm sorry i can't really help much!|`|nBXIGU8Zaa	Well guys are like that, bc you guys broke up, he was hurt and he didnt want to show it so he tried to make you jealous, i think you should believe him bc it seems like he loves you.|`|CLcgQWfUaa	If your friend doesn't know you're together, she can't be faulted for flirting with him.

I say you shouldn't believe him.    That said, I know what it's like to love someone that hurts you with something like that. And if they break your trust once, they're likely to do it again. But give him another try if you want, just make sure you don't trust him TOOO much.. people can change, but a lot of the time they don't.    I don't know if I helped at all, but I hope things work out for you and him. =)|`|0aH1KvbEaa	Afew thing.. If you break up once it gets easier to breakup again.He sounds like he needs to grow up a bit with the whole flirting to piss you off. Both of you shouldn't be keeping it from your "best" friend she'll find out eventually anyway and you'll get more drama then just telling her. If you were his everything.. he wouldn't have broken up with you. He came back because he found out that he missed what he lost.

Might also try www.netdetective.com  They cahrage about $30 for you to search databse created by copying all public records from all states.

Vf0bmaVGaa	Revenge is sweet so they say, I don't know if I would take that route but if there were something that person really coveted that you could get before him. Like something that he would consider a prize. Do you know what I mean? What does this person really desire that you could take away? Does that give you any ideas?|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	I love this method:  If you know where he works/lives/hangs out on a regular basis, buy a buttload of shaving cream, cover his windows/windshield of his car and buy tubes of cheap lipstick (I repeat - lipstick, NOT PAINT) and write some lovely descriptive words all over his car, such as "cheat" and "liar" and "jerk", etc etc  Preferably do it when his car is parked in a public place, like at work or at the mall or grocery store or even when he's over at a friends.  Get a bunch of your girlfriends together so you can get the job done super fast and not be caught ;)  Make sure to bring your camera for kicks!
iIWWeD7Taa	I only see four choices here, ordered from best to worst:    1.  Threaten her. Confront her alone and scare the shitt outta her.  No witnesses.  Tell her you're gonna kick her biiitch asss if she does that bullshitt again.  She will probably get scared and not do it ever again.    2.  Find different friends    3.  Ignore it.... although you'll look like a punk    4.  Beat the shitt outta her in front of everyone.  You'll get in big trouble but you'll save your reputation.      If you end up fighting her, you HAVE to win... remember that|`|OwfoyXpraa	Just ignore her, pretend she's invisible.. don't listen to her, and try not to get mad. She's looking for a reaction, don't give it to her.  Don't even look at her or talk to her..  Think about it.. how long has she been acting like this? Maybe she doesn't like you.. not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to be honest. :)  Give it a try, pretend she doesn't even exist; it'll drive her insane.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Grow up and move on from this crap. *sigh* Honestly, just stop it. Rise above it.|`|nW0UanIzaa	you calm the **** down and stop playing into her little trick.  When she started saying all that crap at lunch, you should have just looked at her and said something like "what's wrong, PMSing?" and sat down with your friends, make it seem like she was crazy. if they were ur friends too you could have just laughed it off with them. dont go getting angry cuz now you sunk to her level...
vgW9L7fZaa	Well... You should TALK to her! Talk face to face! Tell her that you want nothing but honesty and that by now you deserve it, and if she isn't giving it to you then you need to let her know... Also, she is probably having problems at home or with other friends and doesn't know how to control it. She is probably upset, and needs someone to to talk to and she cant find anyone so she is taking her anger out on other people, like you. You aren't alone Erin. I know what it is like. You just need to be supportive, no matter how frustrated you get you need to let her know that you are there for her. She just needs a shoulder to cry on, or an arm to punch.. You know what I mean.....|`|PzbRJrTKaa	ohhh, IM having the same problem right now too, tell her, and if she doesn't understand, then tell her that she is being a b^tch'.! lol|`|AA10824931	This sounds like raging hormones....pms....puberty!|`|60UGQvMSaa	Do a barrel roll!|`|e3AnmkfUaa	omg, like, my bff is going to be like, the worst roommate in the old folks home|`|KVlaTr9maa	okay, i dont care how much the ***** means to you, tell her how you feel. if not, she'll torment you the rest of your life. she's trying to be popular, gawdammit! tell her to knock that **** off or your not going to be her friend.|`|PMWfbgUZaa	Omg i actually know how u feel a year ago i had a bf who kept quiet about everything and then there i was loud told everyone how i felt and she also acted like she hated me at times..then it came to a point i relized that i couldnt deal with that i didnt want her telling me bad stuff about someone to me and then in front of them being all nothing happend or if she wanted me to say something to stick up for her so.. basically u have three choices tell her how u feel , the second is just drop her as a friend..just start hanging out with other people but dont just drop her all of a sudden....first meet some new people and hang out with them and then just stop meeting her all the time...YOUR third choice is both...i did the third choice i told my best friend how i felt and i told her i wanted to branch out, i wanted to be happy....and that i really thought of her as a good friend but it our friendship was hurting her after i told she got mad but still hung out with now its been a year and we probly only hang out maybe once in a month..  YOU should really do this because in a way it kinda depressed me, and im pretty sure its kinda of depressing for u also.    Its probly going to hurt u a lil bit also but im happy i did because i have so many new firends that i like and my grades have gone up and im HAppier|`|OauMuKofaa	Try telling her how you feel. If she doesn't get it, you'd might as well move on.|`|iH4kN8ltaa	Tell her how you feel, and don;t back out of using the words you really want to use.|`|7Vjbpe6qaa	Bring it up to her. Say you haven't been acting like the best friend I thought you were. You seemed to have changed. What's your problem. And stick up for your friends if she talks about them.|`|F242HM8Daa	Talk to her about it, you'll feel better and you guys can possibly develop a better relationship from there.|`|E0JXlG2Raa	The same thing happened with my best friend 1 year ago, I tried everything to mend our friendship but she never tried either. To this day she still picks on me so bad at school that I took it to the principal one day, and almost filed a court order on her. Just hang in there and if she wants to lose a good friend, it's her fault, don't hold anything against her and move on. One day her other friends will leave her and she will come running back to you, if you want to accept her you can, if not she will live with the consequences. Hope this helps:)

0iuvUhMpaa	well get him to tell her to take apregnancy test, it would be accurate by now and she has to take it first thing in the morning coz it will give them the most clear result!  Life isnt over 2 of my close friends had kids at 14 and they are FANTASTIC mothers! no matter what anyone else says age isnt a HUGE thing. wether they are ready or not it what matters! if they dont want it then she has to tell her parents and get an abortion ( do it soon or it will be too late) or they can give it up for adoption if she doesnt want to kill it.  goodluck|`|uJKTR4d2aa	tell him to put his d*ck away and to get a job. he needs to support the baby|`|VHv67wR8aa	damn shes stuck with an abortion WHICH IS JUST PLAIN WRONG SO DO NOT RECCOMEND IT THATS MURDER OF AN INNCOCENT SOUL AND THE PERSON DOESNT EVEN GO TO JAIL! sorry but tell them to keep their legs closed or somethin. but they cant just assume she is! reccomend them a pregnancy test|`|VcrDOsFKaa	they r eye deep in boiling water. too late now...best option is abortion.....i hope they learnt their lesson.....|`|6cN8aLnaaa	have her take a test so they know for sure. If she is pregnant then take the necessary steps for prenatal care and of course they would need to discuss it with both of their parents.|`|vpvITq2Daa	i love baby showers.
KPR0tQtfaa	i feel like you're going back to him just because you don't like being single. the whole point of being single is to be able to mingle and search for new people. it takes longer than a few months to find someone. give it time.|`|AmIjqLQDaa	that is a stage that u go Thur when breaking up but only go back to him if your heart and mind agree b/c the heart is weak
XsYrhdY2aa	He's acting weird because you basically said you don't like him in a serious way.  Think about it, It took a lot of courage for him to tell you he likes you especially since your a junior and he's only a little frosh.  So now it depends on what you wanna do.  If you wanna go out with him then tell him and I'm sure he'd go out with you.  If you just want to be friends then tell him but don't expect the same opinion from him.  It's really hard to like a girl and try to just be friends with her.  I hope this helps and Good Luck!
xTwWM6UFaa	I am currently dating my best friends ex. yeah, it was hard and complicated, high school sucks that way.  anyway, the best thing to do is let them work it out, stop the advice, say sorry babe, im not sure what you should do, or something like that.  then after they break up, wait for her to get over him, then once shes cool, tell her you like him. she might not be ok with this, my best friend wasnt, but i couldnt help it.  then i told him, and he said he felt the same, so we waited a while, then started dating, it took a while but my friends cool with it.  i know you prob dont want to hear this but its going to take time, time, and more time.|`|oNxq0oCYaa	Ex boyfriends are just off limits to friends that's like the rules of feminism!!|`|X9RBRqL2aa	i have kinda the same situation with one of my ex's best friends. so im the guy in this situation. youre kinda stuck but just give it time and they will grow apart and youll get your chance. if you end up really liking him you might have to wait after high school.|`|nfYAIDGqaa	You should tell your friend how you feel about him.|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	get what you want girl, its not that serious, your in high school|`|lbW3b73Taa	tell your friend.  you can't help who you like.  if you like him, that's how it is, no one can change it.  just tell her straight up.  say that you really like this kid but you realize that it could be a disaster.  tell her that you understand if she doesn't want you to be with him.  and if she says that then you really should back off.  friends always come first.  but if she says that she doesn't care then go for it.  but you must realize that it could still make the friendship awkward.|`|lbO5sgVwaa	something similar to this has happend to me before. the best way to know if its okay with your friend is to ask permission. it sounds stupid but then you will get an answer!    hope this helped :) !|`|XVs6Pp5Daa	thats a tough one but i think that first you should wait a little while maybe you'll get over him and if you dont well then i think you should talk to your friend. tell her you dont want to hurt her and you wont go out with him if she doesnt want you to. but just have patients and wait to see if you really want this guy or not. all your feelings maybe just blow over.|`|uGRS7ldmaa	I think you should let this feeling go,if you really consider yourself as a true friend. Boys come, go, and there are a million of them out there. He's not worth your friendship. I'm positively sure you can fall heads over heals with a guy you can call your own.|`|ad5ycXvvaa	It would be a disaster,first of all you said she is your (friend )key word.    A friend is someone that you love and trust and wouldn't want to hurt.  So how do you value this friendship.Ask yourself that.Is he worth what    you to share.

UFDPIDlzaa	it sounds like shes into you! i totally say go for it. i remember being totally in love with one of my guy friends in the eighth grade and at one point i though he liked me too but nothing ever happened and he went to a different highschool so i only see him like once a year.  and everytime i do i totally regret not going for it.  even if you get rejected it doesnt have to ruin your friendship and at least it will give you some experience for highschool.    before my highschool graduation a guy i hung out with asked me out i hadnt ever thought about him that way but said yes and now am in totall love.    take a chance! im sure youll both appreciate it! love is fearless!      hope you go for it but good luck either way  :)|`|9eMYzY0Paa	Get 2 know her better.|`|dbaPuwv4aa	Ask her out.

Disliked songs about breaking up and such. But I like music alot (shrug) first love is always the hardest fall and you never forget them. And yeah you will feel more vulnerable and you won't fall as hard every time or should I say it'll take longer. There are exceptions but yeah generally that's how it goes -).|`|nDAMB2Uuaa	Dizzy.  Butterfly in the stomach   :-))|`|RC5Ums57aa	When I fell in love for the first time...it basically just enveloped me and all my senses. He was all I could think about most of the time, as sad as that is. And time wouldn't start again until we were together, and when we were apart things weren't as important as they were before him. It's almost ridiculous how much we sacrifice for love, but it's because we want to feel accepted and we want that partnership portrayed in movies or that we see in our parents or other couples. Ending it with the one you love is probably the worst feeling, because love never really goes away. Love's just really general and overused, and its a delicious and dangerous feeling at the same time, kind of bittersweet.

QAGaQUDRaa	Yeah, I'm bad about that. I enjoy the chase, but then a lot of times once I get them, I lose interest.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	to quote G N' R lyrics "Nothing lasts forever and we both know hearts can change."|`|QQd8wdLDaa	so over three years ago i started dating this boy brandon. he was real cool and stuff and we dated for a year and a half before things started getting bad. he met this girl and started chilling with her and things started gettin real bad, so he decided to break up with me 2 weeks before we were suppose to go on vacation. then he said he made a mistake and wanted to date again so i said alright assuming our trip was back on, but instead he decieded to go camping instead with this girl instead of going  with me. i thought he was going with his friends but nooo hes a darn liar. so WHILE i was on vacation with my family, he broke up with me. that pretty much ruined my vacation. i went throught a state of depression that summer and lost 20 pounds and weight about 90. it was bad. but then at the end of the summer he said he was so sorry blah blah blah and me being as dumb as i am i went back with him. things were okay but we were in 2 different schools now so it was super weird. but then things started getting bad again and we would fight about random crap. and then he decided to break up with me AGAIN. and i thought well jeez isnt 3 enough? but then he asked me out again about 4 months later. and me being stupid said yes. and we dated again and things were fine and he randomly broke up with me! all the other times things led up to it but this time it was pretty random!! and then i found out that he was dating some chick from a different school and i was like wtf. so them he dumped her and drove to my house and said he was sorry and i believed him and went out with thim again. then we started having sex and that made us fight and idk why but it did and then he dumped me again for my best friend at the time. and then on christmas he dumped her for me but i decided to move on and i was kinda casualy dating him but i liked this boy named josh. so i tryed just chillin with em both but that didnt work for long so i ditched brandon. then i met bobby and i really like him so i decided to get rida josh and then brandon started telling everyone that i was dating josh just so brandon wouldnt like me!!! what a jerk, so i went and yelled at him today and told him to mind his own business. i used to get all nervous around him and it felt like iwas going to fall over when i saw him and we werent dating but i dont feel that way anyone, after him dumping me 5 or 6 times (i cant remember) i just gave up all hope with him and lost all feelings because i finally realized hes a big stupid jerk. idk if this was what you wanted but yea i turned down brandon. thats my life story right there : ) ( i used weird words cuz im trying to stop swearing) lol|`|BHC52gWraa	in the beqinninq thinqs are qreat dates.talkinq,textinq.    then after a few months someone new comes alonq & they keep me interested. until i find the nerve to dump my current bf

IF you are sick of waiting I suggest you go find another man, this one has not married you in 3 years and after a baby, he is not gonna marry you unless you do something drastic and that still means you must be 100% prepared to leave him when the ultimatum does not work.|`|YDXBmfVLaa	Marriage is the worst mistake one could ever make be glad he doesn't own you stay single its more fun.|`|vSJIorF7aa	When he and you are both ready. Having a kid does not make you ready!|`|q6vVxmJZaa	Some guys want to be the bread winner of the family. Or maybe he's just scared. Have you talked to him about it? What is his answer?  Maybe with the way the "new age" is maybe you should propose to him? Maybe that would let him know that you are serious about marriage.  It is a big commitment a life changer, and that scares a lot of people. Just remember if it is meant to be it will happen. Eventually.|`|Bh82isDSaa	Hi,  This is a common question that I have seen often.  Many guys like to have their cake and when they are satisfied, they move on to new desserts.  That is what comes along sooner or later. You might try being the best of the best as a wife and lover. First, make sure he is someone you want to live with for the rest of your life and you have worked out your differences. After you have done that, set the scenario where you will give him an unforgettable night. Afterwords, just start purring and tell him that you love him so much, and you want some permanent security in your life. If he comes back at you with positive remarks, let him give you an idea how you could work out the details together. Be happy during all this.   Use "I" statements and not "you" statements. Keep it all very positive.   Wishing you the best.|`|W1mPMQmOaa	What makes you think he wants to marry you anyway? He has free sex, a daughter and companionship. Why would he bother when he already has this and you were dumb enough to allow it?|`|BCiKDsGwaa	hey i have been with my fiancee for 3 years also and we have a 17 mth old baby boy and i got tired of waiting to so  i kept asking him until a few months ago when he bought me  an engagment ring and popped the question and we are actually getting married next week..so just ask
qA1LilZkaa	One piece of advice is not to even mention it to him. Don't push.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Use reverse psychology to find out what's on his mind. =P|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	You can't.  Why don't you do it?|`|vSJIorF7aa	You cant. He needs to be ready.|`|kep1iGHpaa	Make him watch Wedding Crashers with you.  Then say "Hey, this was fun. Lets make a movie night."  Then take turns picking movies, and make sure every movie you pick has something to do with a wedding.  About a wedding, takes place during a wedding, has a wedding in it, main characters are getting married. Every time their up there taking vows or when he gets on his knee, give your man a sign. Squeeze his hand. Get a little closer. Kiss his cheek. Any sign.   I really do hope this helps. Good luck. Best wishes.|`|YgUXtpg9aa	Guys think in simple terms, why pay for the milk, when we already own a cow. not calling you a cow or anything. he thinking he got you already. tell him you are not going to wait forever.|`|CaqxJS0Qaa	Hey whenever he is ready to do so he will. Be patient.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	1 Wait for a Leap Year & ask him.  2 Drag him to the jewelers and show him the ring you want.  3 Tell his mother to make him!|`|WjxqhZG9aa	You really can't make him do anything that he's not ready to do.  Have you talked about marriage?  Or your futures?  You need to find out where he stands in life and your relationship before you go off trying to push him into marriage.

WMR8hVlfaa	If you think that semen could have gotten into her vagina, then call your local Planned Parenthood or pharmacy and inquire about Plan B. Make sure you do this soon as you only have a 72-hour window. Also, if you don't want children and condoms are your only method of protection you might want to look into her getting on some form of birth control. Two methods are always better than one, especially since condoms do break.|`|lp5YR0HRaa	Tell her to get plan B. You can usually get it from some type of planned parenthood clinic. It's back up for situations like yours it's a pill that she takes with in 24 hrs after to prevent pregnancy.

q0LMxKcjaa	Don't you dare get yourself in any situation with these scumbags.  And for goodness sake ... quit sending inappropriate pictures of yourself.  Don't let any guy take advantage of you!  You're worth much more than that.  You are "one of a kind".... a very special person.  And your virginity is meant to be given to your husband......wait till you have that band on your finger....a "Mrs"....I know they say everyone "is doing it"....but NO THEY ARE NOT!!!!!!      If you could get any honest answer from most girls.....they wish they could go back and not have hadsex ....still be a virgin.     Don't you ever forget, dear one, that when some guy says to you.... "if you love me you'll have sex with me".....you tell that scumbag as you are WALKING AWAY.....if you loved me YOU WOULDN'T ASK!!!  He doesn't love you...he lusts after you.  A guy who really respects you and honors you would never put you in that situation.  They just want to satisfy THEIR needs, they couldn't care less about honoring you.      So you wait......for that special someone who honors you and respects you as a young woman and then YOU'LL HAVE NO REGRETS....stay strong, ....take that stand for yourself that you know is right!  I applaud you for wanting to keep your virginity....you are a rare gem....a diamond in the rough.  Don't...please don't give in...you'll never regret it.      You'll be in my prayers!|`|7miBbkR1aa	if your hot then get some buff guy to kick their asses|`|WBrExD6Saa	you should think of disgusting things and tell them that is the only thing u woul ddo and see what they say|`|jpMoKkAkaa	why did u show them anything in the first place......|`|GxbXseoqaa	STOP TALKING TO THEM! I wish by the time im 18 i could call myself a virgin but i cant. That is something to be very proud of! You apparently have a lot of self respect and someone like me, reading this can already say such possitive things about you. Do NOT let a guy pull your guard down. Stay strong!|`|K9PQkQFGaa	Right off the bat i gotta say if sexual activities is not what you want in your life right now, then kick them both to the curve...  If you continue listening to them the only person that gonna get hurt is you.  so what if they tell people you slutty, you know it's not true and that's all that counts.  As for threats, last i check they are still cops in the United States.  So stop talking to them and if they keep harassing you tell them you'll call the cops and if they don't stop, do call the cops.  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|JA1Fo0O6aa	WOW what *******. cut ties immediatly! any guy that pressures you into something is not worth it. they dont want you they just want sex... sadly this is the case with most males. but the ones that are worth it will be willing to wait|`|ptclgKl5aa	Don't give in, there's nice guys out there like me that wouldn't make you do anything you weren't comfortalbe with|`|WIczM4URaa	do it with someone you really like and feels same for you. obviously not either of those 2 creepos who likely do each other starved as they are.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Call the cops, STAY AWAY FROM THEM, keep a friend close by, and ALWAYS SAY NO.    If you are in serious fear about this matter, then DO NOT blow it off as something not serious.  I do suggest if you feel very threatened to call the cops.|`|xO0IjDpNaa	thats sexual harassment, they could not make you do something that you are not comfortable with. i wouldnt do anything because they seem like bad news. if they do say sh*t to people, people should know that you are not that kind of person.|`|wE2etBzbaa	come on, say no to them, and threat them with filing police reports for stalking and sexual  harassment    and don't make any contact with them.   if they don't stop, then file police report. and make restraining order against them.|`|AA10541300	MNGH,      1) You aren't slutty, so anything they might say is a lie.  People know liars when they hear and meet them (unless they are skilled sociopaths. these guys are punks).  Anyone that matters to you will believe your side of anything that goes on.          2) If you don't want to get involved with either one (and you should be running the other way), then don't.  IF they threaten you, call the cops,  tell the principal, tell your dad, etc.  Tell 5 guy friends that you trust that you need protection.  Just tell others.  (ps. I reread and missed the part initially where you have already been threatenend. - you need to go down to the police station and file a complaint. )       3) Don't let them trick, cajole, pressure, or beg you into being alone with them anywhere, anytime.  They might want to "just talk" about it, or "resolve things" or some other crap.  Trust me, I have several sisters, and plenty of women friends.  The lines of crap are a mile wide if you know what to look for.  The key is - they want to get you alone.  What will get you alone?  Does their little request sound harmless?  Maybe, but does it get you alone? Well, it will escalate from there.        4) The only pressure someone can bring to bear is the pressure you let yourself feel.  Simply tell them to go jump in a lake.  I would use the f word, and refer to some form of self gratification, but you get the drift.  There is nothing they can do short of lying or being violent.  That would be against the law.  The one that threatened you - that's against the law.  Simply threatening someone with the perceived ability to carry it out is against the law.  You are 18.  I presume they are as well.  That makes them adults.  You should tell the cops asap.   Then - on the phone, let him know you called the cops and that if he gets within a mile of you, he's the first one they'll go find.       5) You sound very nervous and somewhat insecure.  It's up to you to draw the line, hard as that may be.  If they wanted to carry this forward indefinitely, would you marry them and bear their children because you are afraid to say no?  Of course not.  If they are sh*** bags,  the time to draw a line is now, before any of this goes any further.   You can do it.        6)  You don't need to worry about he cleavage thing. Trust me - in the scheme of it, that's nothing.  LIke showing your bare arm almost.  It's not even wrong - just a bit sensual.   If you aren't comfortable with it, don't tell anyone, and if they surface, so what, it's really not a big deal and does not reflect on your moral values.  It shows that you are a woman and a human.  It's also your personal business and not anyone else's to talk about, or pass unfair judgment on something that is not a crime or wrong in any way).         7)  Let me repeat this: TELL EVERYONE YOU TRUST ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING!  You need to emotional support, encouragement, and you might need someone with muscle or authority to discourage these bastards.  Don't be afraid to lean on people you trust for this, even if you don't know them extremely well (say for example, a school counselor if you are in HS, or someone of that nature).   I personally think you should go talk to the cops, find a female cop from which you sense kind energy, and tell her the whole thing.  She'll advise you from here.   Remember - you are justified in going to the cops.  The guy made a threat.  You feel in danger, and you very well could be.  That's their job.  I'm sure if they could listen to pre-emptive stories all day long instead of cleaning up after it's too late, they would love that.  There is nothing solid that anyone can do through yahoo answers.  You need help in person and  you need it asap, from several people.  Please get it and please do not underestimate or blow these guys off.  They sound like the type that are out of control.  Normal guys, even jerks, do not act like this - ever, period, ever.    -Kevin|`|XRFznIZmaa	Don't do anything with them!  They sound like 2 of the biggest jerks that I've ever heard of.  They're douche bags!|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Nobody has a right to make you feel uncomfortable or make you do something you don't feel comfortable doing. Honestly? I would sever all contact with both guys. They sound like bad news. You need to find friends who respect you. Anyone who asks for sexual favors right off the bat is not someone you want in your life - they are only interested in using you.     You can't control what people say about you, but if you feel like you are in danger PLEASE call the police and file a report for harassment.|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	Tell them to leave you alone and that you not some sexual object. If that doesn't work tell them you fill sexual harassment charges if they don't stop and if they don't do it.|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	wait, take your time, leave them jerks alone. you will have plenty of opportunities to have sex, you are a women. save your self for a man who cares about you.|`|258mrT2Paa	don't send any pics, you know your a good girl keep it that way.|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Tell them both to **** off and say you are not ready. If they hurt you call the police get a restraining order.|`|ic5JUantaa	Don't give in to their threats, girl. No one should ever try to force you to do anything you feel uncomfortable doing. It's your body!    If you are worried about your safety, tell someone who you trust about what's going on. Don't encourage a confrontation, or an '***-kicking', though... violence will not solve any problems.    Stay strong and keep your head held high. They can say anything about you, try to bring down your reputation, but you know the truth and so do the people who truly care about you.
fecbf408215596f591d1b18076b9611baa	I think you have the right idea. Open and honest is the way to go. I am sure he is not a mind reader, as you are not. So, the only way to find out what you want to know is to just ask. Good luck!!!!

tK7XacH7aa	First get to know her as friends, once you get to know her better and see some compatibility ask her out. Keep going on dates as long as you two are compatible. Just show off your personality really. After a while if she really likes you, you will win her heart. It takes a while, but its worth it.
rywgn8HLaa	I think that your colors would definitely work with a Christmas theme - maybe add a few hints of green to your colors as well.   For your centerpieces you can use ornaments. I've seen some really cute centerpieces done that way. Maybe something like this, but just change the ornament colors:  http://z.about.com/d/entertaining/1/0/X/...  http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/4d/...  http://z.about.com/d/entertaining/1/0/T/...  For your flowers you could use some poinsettias...you could even add a few pinecones in your bouquet:  http://www.arenaflowers.com/assets/Image...  If you are getting married in the church around Christmas time then most of the decorating will probably already be done for you...which can save some money.   There are plenty of things you can do to incorporate Christmas into your wedding - just try to think of all the things you love about Christmas...snow, snowflakes, candy canes, gifts, trees, etc.  Good luck!|`|k6F9zkIRaa	Have a christmas tree at the reception site. Incorporate it into the wedding. Like have the favors on the tree or something of the sort. You could also have your favors be christmas ornaments with your names and wedding date on it. Add all kinds of holly, garland and lights to the decor. Talk to your florist I"m sure they will have some ideas of christmas flowers! Here's a picture of a wedding cake in the shape of presents!  http://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67...    That's all I can think of for now! lol Good Luck!|`|bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	Wish Tree      Here is what you need to recreate the tree shown in the picture:     8 Manzanita Branches: You can spray-paint them gold or silver, or you can leave it the way nature intended.  Crystal Garland for use on the tree and in the vases  2 Large Glass Hurricanes or Floral Vases  Ornament Hooks  2 pens for guests to write with  2 Large serving trays which can be used to display the wish cards before the guests hang them on the tree. (If you want the guests to be able to access both sides of the table you will need 2 Large serving platters 2 frames and 4 pens.)  1-2 frames: The frames are placed between the hurricanes on either side of the table. Inside the frame, place card stock with the wording: Best Wishes Brides Names & Grooms Name.   Wish Tree Notes: To keep it simple, you could have your invitation vendor create the notes in the same style and card stock as your wedding invitations, place cards, programs and guest cards. Or, you could choose card stock in any shape or color you want to fit the theme or look of your wedding. It could look like an actual leaf or it could be done in the shape of a sea shell or snow flake. You just want to make sure there is enough surface space on the card for the guest to write her message.     Useful tip: Make sure to get 15-20 extra notes more than your total guest count. You can take the cards to Kinkos and have them drill a hole in each one.    Most of these materials can be found at Crate & Barrel and Target. You can pick them up while you are registering for your wedding gifts.    Here is how you would construct your Wish Tree:    1. Wrap the inside the hurricanes with the crystal garland in a circular direction so that you get a good base in which to place the manzanita branches.    2. Place the two hurricanes about a foot apart from each other on the table on which the wish tree will be displayed.    3. Arrange the manzanita branches in the hurricanes.    4. Take the remaining crystal garland and drape them throughout the branches. This could take some time and you might need to make adjustments. You just dont want to have any huge holes.    5. Place a ornament hook on each wish card and display them on the table. You can use the a serving platter to display the cards on, like it is in the picture, or you can just spread them on the table itself. (This step was the most time consuming for me.)    6. Place the frames in the center of the two hurricanes    7. Place the pens on either side of the serving platter    Useful tip: To get the most sparkle out of your tree place it near a great light source or add a few votive candles around the tree.    Youre done! You now have a show-stopping place for guests to send their good wishes.    Technorati Tags  dutch wedding,  guest book,  how to,  wedding tips,  wish tree|`|HRCdQ2vdaa	Make sure to include some Green, Red, Gold, siliver and White- those are chistmas colors. Look at upcoming bridal magazines and catalogs, Macy's, to get some inspration. Maybe red gows for the girls and green ribbons hanging from flowers. Large pointers in church on pew, as center pieces.

IN1X1CVGaa	well if he was cheating on your best friend  hes most likely gonna cheat on you too  not that im one to judge  cause ive been in your situation  i did fall for my best guy friend, and he was amazing  but it ended badly, and we dont talk anymore  and honestly you might like him  but sometimes its better to have him as a friend then nothing at all  and your friends obviously dont want you to date him either  so you should really think about this  but the only way to tell him, is to just tell him  he might feel the same  i just hope you dont get hurt with all of this  cause i was miserable for the longest time  and still kinda am :/
173vsiacaa	well, things will pan out naturally itself.     i was 16 (17 going on 18 now) when i moved about 4000 miles to a new country where i had to go to a new high school and all (not to mention new climate, culture, etc). i guess things just flowed, and it feels all normal in no time.   something to remember and my personal advice for you would be to relax and be yourself.    as for the girls, just chat up with them like you will with the boys (as in casual talk like how are you, etc; forget the macho dude talk).    the key is to be natural, and things will flow well naturally.  hope this helps a bit, all the best :)
k3t9dzciaa	Girls usually glance at me, wink, or wave at me and say hey.  Try doing one of those.|`|HFmh8uF4aa	Well about a week ago i had the same question.. Try talkin to him. Then start laughing with him.. The you take little steps.. You can then do little things for u to see him ( for example in the hallway ) then you wave say hi n talk to him

GOOD LUCK ;)|`|vjxroyxjaa	Cmon ur 17. U hav plenty of time. Its not a race. If ur asking us this question then ur not ready. Take ur time. U might wanna cheat on a test but that doesnt mean u do it does it? Just because u want to do something doesnt mean u can and/or should. Just take ur time and hav fun. U can make out and all but waiting a little longer couldnt hurt.  Hope this helped,   Best of Luck!  If u wanna chat-Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.com|`|E6W5TRZKaa	Well I lost my viginity when I was 16 almost 17. I will tell you if you aren't sure then you aren't ready. Just wait! When you do it it'll be amazing!|`|4jx4wAhgaa	The answer is: you're not ready yet! Wait till you're at the right age!|`|S4Puwubnaa	You may think you want to have sex, if you think of it as sex, than that's all it is,is sex. On the other hand if you truly love this guy, than it is making love to the person that you truly love, which makes sex a hell of a lot better. But if you have sex and you are not really ready to, than it will mean nothing to you. And if that's the case than you will feel like crap during and after words. That is a big decision, for a person to make just make sure you are ready to feel good about what ever decision you make.|`|XZSp2ORPaa	You didnt say if you were a virgin or not. But if so, just remember the 1st time should be special and with someone you love. After 3 months im sure you care a great deal for him but at 17 it may be lust. You should wait a while longer just remember virginity is the 1 thing a girl/woman has control over. At 17 for a male it may b just another notch in his belt to go and brag. If you decide to, use protection no matter what, if he says no then you know in the back of your mind hes told other girls no protection and you could get std.|`|fecbf408215596f591d1b18076b9611baa	I say you should wait. You are still very young and once your virginity is gone(if you still have it) you can never get it back. It is a special thing to have. Three months is not enough time for a relationship to develop, and as someone else said your first time should be special. When the time is right,  you will know it and you wont have questions. Hope this helps.
mcywqcHuaa	would love to debate/talk about this, but you have your email disabled. try emailing me.
LaJn6jxJaa	I went through a similar situation a while back.  Writing a note is a good thing saying something like this:  Dear mom,        I am writing this note to you because I though it was the best way to tell you that I am seeing a boy.  I don't want you to be upset with me, I just want to be honest with you.  I hope that you're not too mad.  When you're ready I want to talk about it with you.  I am nervous about what you will have to say, but I really needed to get this off my chest.  Love you!  Your name  Edit it however you like but I think something like this would be effective.  I also think that talking to her in person may work, thats what I did and my mom was pretty calm surprisingly.  Just make sure that you offer to let her meet your bf so she can decide if she approves.  I hope this helped!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	if you talk to your mom the way you write, then you don't stand a chance. you need to talk to her like a responsible adult then maybe she will respect your choices|`|sFPV2KbBaa	if you talk like you type, then it could be a reason that she "freaks out".  think about years from now when you have a teenage girl to raise and see your self. how do you think that you will react to most of the things that you do that she will do???  ask yourself when you have teeenage kids if your mom was overreacting...  Because your kids will think that you are.  just talk to her, like a normal adult.  your "almost 18"  I remember 18.  I, like most, was going on 30,  and had the wold by the balls...|`|aOd0Djkaaa	I would just tell her that you need her, that you are about to make major life decisions and you want her guidance and input, because you know that she has your best intrest in mind, But if she is going to scream at you then you will not be able to talk to her. Tell her some stuff like that make her think that she is in control of the situtaion, she is more likey to listen|`|AA11674544	Don't tell your mom that he is your boyfriend. Tell her there is this guy you are interested in and you want to invite him to meet the family.
DdfrWkbQaa	If I were you, I would go talk to your friends (again) and let them know exactly how you feel. Don't be embarrassed, it's really important letting your friends know when you are feeling this way. If they tell you that nothing is going on, and you still feel concerned, keep pushing them until you get the answers you are searching for.|`|tK7XacH7aa	No you shouldn't be worried if this is their honest viewpoint. There's nothing wrong with just hanging out as friends. They've known each other for a long time and they just want to continue their friendship. They don't want to include you because they want to be together without you just to catch up on their friendship. This is perfectly reasonable. As long as you know your boyfriend is loyal to you and really likes you/loves you, you have nothing to worry about.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	unless they give you a reason not to trust them, i think that you should just be chill about it. after all, it is your best friend and your boyfriend. if they care about you as much as they should they would never do something to hurt you. you always have to remember that they are friends too, even before you and him, so they probably want to hang out too. just because you aren't always involved in their hangout session doesn't mean anything, i'm sure you hang out with them individually too.|`|wE2etBzbaa	it depends on your preference, do you prefer your boyfriend to have extra fun with other girls?  if so, don't worry.  if you do, then worry and make sure their benefits deal stop.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	probably :) my best friend is benifits too.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yes you should be worried. D=|`|RnQFwIuUaa	They have a special relationship. It's not the typical friends, but, unless he has shown some kind of strange behavior when you all are together, then I think you should trust him. Do you feel like you can trust him? Is he still benefiting your friend openly or in secret? Do you have a vibe or feeling that something is just not right? If you don't and he seems trustworthy, I think you can trust him. Good luck|`|0cBEbHlHaa	dnt be worried if hes dating u he probly wnts to date u..|`|XQH72YZWaa	dont be worriied ask him out they both told u they had no feelings she gave u "sort of permission" so if she gets mad then tell her shes a b!tch|`|GprXlBQ5aa	to be perfectly honest, i'd be a little worried. if your best friend is flirting with your boyfriend then i don't think that's right. it sounds like they might be hiding something. maybe you should talk to your friend and tell her to be really honest if she really has no feelings for him. that way there will be nothing to hide and nothing to worry about. :)  hope this helped! best of luck!|`|bqLHVHGGaa	YA B WORRIED B VERY WORRIED CUZ ITS PROBABLE DAT HES CHEATING ON U IF THEY DONE IT BEFORE ITS POSSIABLE DAT THEYLL DO IT AGAIN|`|CEm8asvYaa	Well i think what you need to do is have a talk with them, a serious talk.  I really don't think they should be hanging out without you if before they were friends with benefits and if there was an attraction.  You need to talk to the guy and tell him exactly how you feel about the situation. If you don't care that they hang out but you don't want them to do anything like.. yeah, then tell him.  If you don't like that they hang out without you a lot then you need to tell him that.|`|IPfvar5Waa	If you know you can trust your best friend and your boyfriend then don't worry. If they're good people they wouldn't do something like that to you.|`|dbaPuwv4aa	Personally, I'd be worried.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	love at first sight is only lust, love is something that comes only from really getting to know that person well.|`|VygBNA0Waa	no   lust at first sight oh yeah|`|WjxqhZG9aa	At first what?  Sight?  Yes and no.  Like looking across at a person and falling in love... no.  Like on the first date, yes.|`|aOd0Djkaaa	yes! the first time I saw my fiance, I told my best friend that he was going to be my husband. something about him attracted me to him.|`|rH33ty23aa	I beleive in lust at first sight. Love takes time.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Maybe love after a few shots but no never at first sight|`|vSJIorF7aa	Yes. in rare cases.|`|b5UV15gCaa	definitely! I am not saying you know when you see them for the first time or that you should jump in to anything too quickly. But yes I believe you can have a loving caring feeling for someone at first meeting them.|`|pwcEvd4taa	yes i do|`|91sBjTtAaa	you have to know somebody to love them so on first sight it would be lust|`|KnMdFqq0aa	No...love takes a lot of getting to know the person....you cannot know anyone at first sight....and everyone always put their best on for the first year or so.....|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No its more like lust at first sight.    I dont think its possible to fall in love at first sight cause you have to get to know the person before you can call it love.|`|WMem5AGoaa	No, there's lust in first sight, love takes time.|`|gfHutvEFaa	no such thing.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I do believe in love at first sight.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	Yes I do!    Love (GOD is love) is present in everything and everyone..we catch a glimpse of eternity when we look at the object of our affection and we see them through the eyes of love, the eyes of our soul..and in that one 'moment'...we glimpse do forever.    However..staying in 'that' particualr moment is impossible. And just because you fall in love at first sight, it does not mean that your 'egos/personalities' in this life we be compatible.     The 'love' is already made...God made us in His/Her likeness.  So of course it is possible to fall in love at first sight..most folks do not have a clue what love really is.
B9KdOxMSaa	Yeah sure|`|AA12255498	ya|`|EhvRkW1raa	yes
wf3S2avqaa	Wow, all i can do is tell you is stay strong. It's going to hurt and your going to think about him every single day of your life. Pray and ask the lord for strength. You will get through it. God doenst let anyone go through things he knows we can't handle. Even if you have to seek help or consuling or maybe even a support group. It will help you. I feel so bad for you right now. It's making me think of my daddy. ((((((((((((HUGGGGGGGS))))))))))    Feel free to message me on yahoo messenger if you need someone to talk with.or email me.|`|ViFCEb7Paa	The way I dealt with my fathers death was I was present when he was taken off life support, and I watched him take his last breaths. As morbid as that sounds, it actually made his passing much easier to cope with. Try to make peace with him before his time comes. There is really no set way to deal with death, each person has a different coping method. Reach out to people and don't repress your feelings. I wish you the best and I am sorry to hear about your circumstances.|`|LaJn6jxJaa	I lost my father 7 years ago, when I was 10.  I had a very different situation than yours but regardless a loss is a loss.  I think that a lot of people think that getting over someone is forgetting, but that is not a good way at all.  I think that if you remember all the time that you spent with your father, or write your emotions down it will help a lot.  Pictures are also part of the healing process.  Don't be afraid to ask people for support, I found that people tend to forget after a week or two, so you might need to reach out to a friend to get help.  I am really sorry about your father, and I hope everything works out!|`|31mUPnAdaa	Take comfort of having the luxury of knowing when he's passing. It's better than being surprised.|`|AA11674544	Tell yourself that you will think about it later. just keep telling yourself that you don't have to think about it right now, that you can think about it later. Then distract yourself with something and if it comes to your mind again, tell yourself over and over that you will think about it later. Good luck!|`|nSsIGlF1aa	My children lost their father unexpectly and ther eis no real answer on how to deal with it... Just know that the Lord is an awesome place to seek comfort and your biggest resource of fatherly love... God bless you and your family|`|6KVGwdBQaa	I am so sorry this is happening and can't imagine how you feel right now, but I am so happy that you have asked this question and I hope you find comfort in my answer. Please read my whole answer. I know a lot of people will tell you either your dad is in heaven, or some will say your dad is in hell, but the bible is where we can get the real anwer. The bible teaches us that when we die, we are dead. Our soul does not leave our body and go somewhere. We are living souls. The soul can die. For example Ezekiel 18:4 says: "Look! All the souls- to me they belong. As the soul of the father so likewise the soul of the son- to me they belong. The soul that is sinning-it itself will die." So, that verse tells us that it is possible for a soul to die. The bible also teaches us in Ecclesiastes 9:5: For the living are conscious that they will die, but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all." So there we see they are unconscious. One more verse I want to show is in John 11:11. There Jesus compares death to sleeping. Jesus' friend Lazarus had died and Jesus was going to wake him up from his sleep. So I hope that helps you to see that your dad will be resting. The best part of this is the hope you have of the resurection. There will be a ressurection of the righteous and the UNrighteous Acts 24:15 tells us that. So, on the day of the ressurection, your Dad WILL be ressurected. When he wakes up, it will be just like he was sleeping and he won't feel like it took along time (just like when you sleep all night, unless you look at a clock, you don't know how long you slept) The only difference is, when he wakes up, this world will be a different place. Revelations 21:4 says " And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." So your Dad will wake up in a perfect place and you will be reunited with him. Also, know that Romans 6:23 says: "For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our lord"  So, there we see, when we die, we have been aquitted of all of our sins, death is the price we pay for sin.  So, no matter what your dad did, his death is the price he pays to be forgiven.  None of us are perfect and we will all go through that.    When you start to feel sad, keep this in mind, Psalms 55:22: "Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, And he himself will sustain you.  Never will he allow the righteous one to totter."  I hope this helps and my heart goes out to your and your dad.
ic5JUantaa	Tell him the truth, as simply as possible. Say exactly what you've said here - that you love the idea of saving yourself, you also love your relationship with him, and you're not trying to weasel him into a commitment. If he respects you, he will wait.    Good luck!|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	don't let him try and talk you into doing something you don't want to. what if you become pregnant? you owe yourself more than that.....|`|KPR0tQtfaa	if your boyfriend truly cares about you, he will respect you. there are a lot of girls that wait till marriage you're not alone.
sqmIO2u5aa	First thing you must do is to find out the reason of their fight. Then try to figure out what moves you can make to help them settle and resolve their problem... I suggest that you will set some time for both of them in a place you usually hang out. Then let them talk about it, be with them during the conversation to avoid more tension and fight... Help them to settle things right...Don't be bias to both of them, be conscious which side you will agree for or better don't ally to any of them, just be neutral.    You're really a good friend..Good luck!!hoping that you can settle things right...|`|AA11635095	well...  i guess the first thing to do..  is find out...  what happened...  between  friend 1 and friend 2.  they can't possibly just hate each other for no reason right?  and i think if u did have to choose...  between those 2..  friend 2..  seems like  a good choice.  and if it doesn't turn out that well..  i'm sry 2 hear that..  but maybe..  they weren't bff's after alll...  well good luck with it!!:)
wE2etBzbaa	Ask for his ID, and show him your ID, and tell him you don't have the same last name, you are not brothers and sisters, and your father have been faithful to your mother as far as you know|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Theres always a natural connection that you can't push.  It's how a guy sees you when he first meets you.  If he doesn't get that significant OMG she's sexy feeling then I don't think there is a way that you can make it.  I mean, the two of you could try taking the relationship to the next level and actually be more then friends, other then that I don't see how you could make him see it naturally|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well to have that kind of relationship before hand can lead to a nice strong relationship dating wise but just talk to him|`|qFiWcJogaa	yes there is, by being your self, & letting him know that You would like to be his girl friend. Invite him over some time for dinner or a movie.|`|OID8OB1eaa	flirt, talk about relationships. touch him a little, but dont get all over him, like just sit in his lap or somethin. he should get the idea:)
h4BolDXVaa	Sounds like yu got a predicament... this is hard cause either way one will be hurt and if yu pick yur best friend there is a chance that if it doesn't work she won't be yur friend... and then if yu pick the other one yu still might loose yur best friend.... I say yu think about which one yu like more and which one yu think will like yu
v3e6NDYbaa	The friends being present sometimes trips a girls 'anti-slut image switch'.  One thing that is VERY important to girls is not to ever look slutty or too easy to her friends and relatives.      Suppose a girl is with her friends and you walk up and try to get her phone  .  She may like you and even want to give it to you but because her friends would see how easily she is won over her value would be lowered and so she will resist.    Probably the same thing is going on here.  Her friends don't see the flirting and the texts so they haven't seen why you've won her over so she doesn't want to appear that she is won over.    The proper tactic is when she is with the friends ignore her and try to win over the friends.  Not flirting but just trying to make friends and show how much of a catch you would be.  Once her friends are 'won over' she will then not be afraid to show how she is won over.|`|hChy7BAPaa	maybe her friends are the type to go "OOOOOOOHHH HES' SO CUTE!" or maybe one of her friends is a betch that likes every guy she likes so maybe she doesnt want to show it or want word getting around just yet. who knows? it could be a million things.|`|svvza3gcaa	lol, she's leading you on|`|xzX3NSUjaa	She sounds like one of those girls who cares way too much what other people think. She doesn't want her friends to know she likes you. Probably because they would make fun of her or she is embarassed of you.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Ask her what is going on. If you talk privately, just say, why won't you ever talk to me when others are around. I think you like me but then when we are with others you seem to ignore me and I just want to know why? I think she is the only one who can answer this question. I think you might be afraid to ask her for fear of the answer but you have to hear it.
S6zEIEZXaa	Question: Why do you want to get kinky if you don't want to go ahead with the deed? I know when I've done something special with my boyfriend, eevn though I did not have the intention of going all the way (like when we first started dating) and I would kiss on his neck or something "kinky" he would get increditbly turned on and then get upset and be in pain if we didn't go all the way. I'm not really sure what to suggest to you but thought I would share that this doesn't always go in the right direction.|`|fc9e9bb4aa	then why don't you do something really sweet and sentimental rather than kinky and hinting for something you don't want?....|`|nkzwSX8qaa	Make him a cake in the shape of breasts|`|aL0uWmSLaa	well if u don't want to get too sexual then going off what MY "sweet" spots are i would say mess around with his ears and his abs for some reason i liked it when a girl would run her hands up and down my abs and also the neck but to be brutally honest i love when a girl would just kiss my ear and what not it's frickin awesome well those are my suggestions    Hope i could help :)

Because by him putting himself at last, shows u how awesome of a man u have and what a great heart he has; and that my dear, makes u see beyond everything, therefore you love him that much.

mxOT8aw3aa	it doesnt matter what section you write in. I believe that you shouldnt give up on your boyfriend, its obvious that you love him and he loves you, because you guys are faithful and committed to one another. honestly men are different than females. so alot of times once they get settled in a relationship they just let time roll. They become less spontaneous, so you have to switch it up on them. become less predictable and start doing things on your own time. Guys love to chaase its in their nature. focus more on yourself and he will come around.|`|AA11138696	You can't make anyone do anything they do not want to do.

You need to give him space so that he has time to miss you and appreciate what he has.|`|fE5bC83Saa	tolerance and understanding ,and stop the hostility|`|CyS0OlOzaa	well if he does'nt want to spend time with you then nothing you can do will change that.If you two have already broken up many times before then it sounds like your relationship is already unstable and don't stand a good chance anyway.Maybe you both should consider moving on and going your seperate ways.It always takes a long time for ANYONE to show their true colors and really show you who they really are when being themselves.|`|FnGebaOLaa	There is probably something else going on "underneath the surface" If you think about all of your fights, you should think about what they have in common, and work from there!
173vsiacaa	don't.  just be who you are. if you really want to, just go say hi or something. if he scoffs you off or anything of that nature, it's not worth it at all girl ;)    the main reason why i say to just forget about 'impressing' him is because, as a popular guy, he receives a lot of attention and have probably encountered many other girls trying to impress him. if you simply be who you are, he might just find you special and that you stand out from the others, and a higher chance of a friendship being developed is more likely.    if he responds nicely, just continue with the friendly conversation. start with simple things like, 'how are you?' and stuff you know. be you, be natural.
cp7fjeJhaa	no it's not being a coward, a friend of mine is a black belt he can kick the crap out of anyone, he was at a bar with a bunch of friends, some drunk guy bumped into my friend and the drunk guy said  hey asshole watch where you are going idiot, my friend said sorry/excuse me......and let it go........why?   he diffused the situation......no one wins a fight.......say you tell the guy to F off  he pushes you, you push him back, he falls and cracks his head open   you go to jail for manslaughter,NOT WORTH IT..........DIFFUSE DIFFUSE DIFFUSE.........    unless your girlfriends life is in danger or she is being touched, hit etc   walk away  people are drunken idiots at parties.........|`|5PBfj1EEaa	no it wouldnt show that you are a coward if they didnt do anything to them physically or sexually. u could say hey dude leave my girl alone like give him a warning if it really bothered her but if u dont feel its worth that much then just ignore him|`|KPR0tQtfaa	no, just next time pull her away from the situation.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	What it would show is that you are man enough to handle it in a responsible way.|`|s5d2VFVQaa	just say to the guy in a non threatenting manor to knoc it off and then smile or laugh so he doesnt think you are pissed if he then starts to talk crap destroy hiim with words and embarrass him but not serious stuff just joking around if ya now what i mean you never want to end up in a fight|`|MMvoS6Ysaa	well u cud go to that guy who annoyed ur gf n tell him dat u dont wanna fight, u just want  him to stay away from her ... be sure to go wid a frnd who u can trust to stop u guys if any fighting starts|`|jVx7pmCgaa	I guess that is the responsible thing to do, but id want my man to scare him/her off not physically but maybe point and tell them where to go :)|`|JA1Fo0O6aa	Its not really your place to say anything and given the situation it would probably make it worse, and aggravate both partys more. if its just a matter of your gf getting annoyed let it go.. she probably should too!|`|3f8AMQeNaa	Try to defend her and help her with her problems.|`|zGhDt3dpaa	well in terms of simple annoyance there is not much u can do. If a girl was annoying her, then it is really not your place to much of anything. But if it was a guy, he may have been flirting with her. Then you should defiantly get involved.|`|BJuwGkUJaa	By no means are you a coward for not saying nothing. Stay away from conflict. Walk away and say Sorry it shouldn't happen again and if them 2 can't get a long keep them apart and then you can just see how the relationship with her turns out. Then don't keep putting up with the crap put this person in there place.|`|jpMoKkAkaa	if you replace the c in coward with an h, it spells howard
c9df3bd9f369154d93aaff27c1c3b49aaa	Your condition is known as Psychosomatic Illness. It's when someone's emotional problems begin to interfere with their physical health. It doesn't "normally" happen to people who are depressed, but it has been proven to exist. People who are very upset about something for a long time begin to see their health deteriorate and basically become physically ill. It could also be that your depression is simply causing you to not take as good care of yourself as you usually do, like not sleeping enough or eating right.    So no, everyone is not in physical pain like you are after being dumped. But it's perfectly normal to be depressed after being emotionally hurt in a relationship. There is no magic cure to make you feel better, and I've been in your shoes, I know how it feels. All you can do is try to move on a little bit at a time and eventually you'll be alright again.
q7ZMQeCMaa	i don't care as long as you don't beg me for money but you loving me and caring for me and being loyal to me is all i need.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Very, very cheap. All I need is someone who cares and shows me, and I'm set!|`|a8a9triNaa	LOVE HAS NO EXPENCE!
zUdxoRbyaa	wow! my daughters are 17 and i would sooner put a bullit through my head than to talk to either one of them like that. sometimes even a parent needs to be cursed out. blaming you for being raped? sorry to say but the man is a jackass. well, i hope it works out. im gonna give you a star, you deserve it.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	does he drink a lot?
O9jrkjgraa	He's just a friend....|`|7FAZYMy3aa	Try dating someone that's not your ''best friend''|`|xjZNnFLtaa	You dont have feelings for him.  he is just a friend.|`|NZVKTPonaa	wtf, the only thing i get outta that is that you like two guys at once   idk, i guess follow your gut feeling|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	If you're not sure, don't think about it so much. Because if you think about it a lot, your mind creates an illusion that makes you think you like him.|`|AA12324940	Hey its ok to like 2 guys at once. And your feelings are your own,if your friends fail to understand that, then they aren't true friends at all.. And regarding whether or not to tell him,I suggest you wait a bit,try knowing your own feelings better and then tell. Because later on you shouldn't regret that you started liking someone just because of something of a rebound or so (its possible,i've been through it myself).  So,just wait a bit before telling,and when you do tell,don't be afraid.  All the best!!!|`|VXdSc5h4aa	well, I think that you should just tell him. I being a guy know that guys want to know if a girl likes them. If your friends are upset they will get over it, your feelings are yours, and just because they will get mad doesn't mean you shouldn't tell him.
EPLfj2Zfaa	I think your bf would most definitely loose all trust in you and probably be extremely upset if you started going out with your best friend! You're best friends ex girlfriend would probably be very upset too.     Firstly you need to decide which guy you like. If you do decide you want to be with your best friend you need to consider a few things. Does he feel the same way about you? Is all this worth ruining some so called "best" friendships?     Either way, you're obviously still young so just go ahead and live life i reckon.
AA10766729	The first time I got married, I was 24; the marriage lasted 5 years (and a few days).  And rather than waiting, I should never have done it at all!  The second time I got married, I was 35; we've been together for 11 years, and just celebrated our 5th anniversary.      Sadly, I know far too many people who got married young and ended up divorced.  I hope you don't end up in that statistics pile.|`|f9crUDTwaa	First marriage 19 ... definitely too young .|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I was 22 and no i dont think i should have waited cause i am very happily married to my husband.    Its to late now for you to worry if you was to young to get married.....Whats done is done.|`|KILFoc6kaa	I was 18 and my husband was 21.  We just celebrated our 7 the wedding anniversary and I wouldn't change it for anything.    You sound like you are happy, that's what matters.   I would have waited until I was 18 if I were you, but we are different people, so I can't say that would have been better for you.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	29|`|pnxzK1nhaa	I am 22 and I am still not married.I am in no rush to walk off that plank.I think you were way too young and i think you sound like you regret it.You probably haven't even experienced anyone else, is that the man you want for the rest of your life??|`|WjxqhZG9aa	In my opinion that was really young, but it's not my place to pass any judgments.  I was 20 when I got married.  In retrospect, I thought that I was young, but I was just comparing to everyone else.  If you really love each other and give your partner 110 percent, the so be it.  I'm really glad that I didn't wait.|`|xUCXXb73aa	i was 21 and to young|`|Ekmg7wbgaa	i got married at 19    and we divorced at 21    got remarried to each other AGAIN at 22     been married 2 years     im 24 hes now 26     marriage is hard but rewarding|`|b5UV15gCaa	Well I have been married 2 times the first time I was 18, the second time I was 27. I was too young the first time. People change so much in their early 20's and they are just finding out who they are and what they really want in life. Well its to late for you to wait till your older now. :) I hope your marriage survives but if it doesn't you will have a second chance. good Luck!|`|RHux2Fmnaa	The first time I got married as soon as I turned 18, but got divorced less than a year later. Second time -and hopefully last- got married when I was about to turn 20. I think you and I got married too young, but I don't really have any regrets.|`|sR6vhbataa	32. First marriage. Yes, I'm a late bloomer. In my 40s now and marriage is shaky. But if I'd gotten married in my early 20s I am pretty sure I'd be divorced by now.|`|rhHgrohdaa	Got married two months after I turned 19.

I was also too young to have a child...but you know you never learn these things unless you do them....    Make the best of your situation. Be forgiving, be loving and make a commitment to work things out, no matter what.     Lots of people get married at your age and stay married for 60 years...you can do it.|`|slJWqCI5aa	Every relationship is different. Some last and some do not. It is all a matter of your own judgment. I was first married when I was 23. I believe I was too young at the time. He was all wrong for me and I knew it the day we got married. Sad, I know. I remarried (oh yes-it did not work-divorced when I was 27) when I was 30.|`|QQ1Vwsj8aa	Got married when I was 18 and it has been a roller coaster, I love him and are child but at times I wish I would have done more for myself first...|`|GJ3s6g2laa	I am 22 and not married and m loving it.

I will be celebrating my 13th anniversary this year.|`|T63eolm6aa	I got married just last November, we were both 20...  17 is kinda young, but it doesn't matter cause ya'll have been married going on 2 years now...  People think we should have waited but they knew we was still going to marry, I think the time was right and so does he....  When you're in love, and as long as you are able to get married or if someone needs to sign that is willing it shouldn't matter... just as long as it's not too young like 15 or 16 or younger....
P9oP8CS9aa	Say "I'd like to ask you out, but I don't know which way you came in" Keep your humor and don't worry, confidence is important in attracting women to find you interesting.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Don't get too worked up about it. You don't want to sound too bummed or too excited, depending on her answer, but you especially don't want to feel too bummed.     Just keep your emotions relatively stable, and ask her.   It would be good to note she's in an alright mood, too, because if she's not, she might not want to think about relationships. Just wait, if that's the case.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	i also plan on asking a girl out tomorrow we have already agreed to hang out as friends after school where i'll try to get a read on if she likes me or not then i'm going to bring up casual talk and eventually get to a spot in conversation where i can ask her out.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Don't you think it would be better if you knew her a little bit better? You might blind side her, and put her in an awkward place. Have you tried to talk to her before? Have you flirted with her? Are you going to walk up to a girl who doesn't know you and ask her to accompany you somewhere? My advice is to take some time to get to know her and then ask her out. She will feel better about saying yes.
pCpNBTalaa	I don't know who you are asking. I've been dating black guys for quite a while, and not one of them ever had an issue with this. Let's face it, if my man didn't return the favor, he wouldn't be around for long!|`|QSodlfMraa	i so do know what you mean, my boyfriend say its because of the hair i have that i chose not to shave completely, he say he wouldnt like it if he went on the road with hair in his teeth, i dont pay him no mine anyways.|`|fecbf408215596f591d1b18076b9611baa	That guy is lying!!!! A lot of guys would prefer no one knows they go down but they do. Most of them are completely turned on by it. I am sorry to say, but he may just be trying to forewarn you in case you end up having sex. If you do, just be sure to remember not to go down on him. Hope it helps.|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	black men only go down on black girls, everyone esle they just expect to go down on them|`|OKzeXNbtaa	Black guys will go down on black girls.    But my brother told me whte girls smell like fish...or they are afriad they have herpes.  Apparently 65% of herpes diagnosis are to white ppl.    You never see black ppl wth cold sores, only whites.
aLgY4l3Naa	First of all, when you love someone you just don't stop loving them out of no were, so i wonder if you really did love him at all?? Second you say that his looks are not a factor on the way you feel but yet you bring it up, i don't think your being honest with yourself!! You need to sit down with your boyfriend and let him know were you are right now with this relationship, be honest and open and don't leave anything for question that's the only way you both can work it out or decide to let it go, but to just hold these feelings inside is only leaving you in a place to be vulnerable to other men and you might end up doing something you will regret and also hurt someone in the process!! You need to stand up and do the right thing, good luck to you and i wish you the best!!|`|uu1IUxAkaa	if he is not willing to work on you two then time to split and look for someone new that catches your eye. take it slow.    not all guys are bad like that first posting says. i hope he don't breed.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	You and I have already gone over this...

ffJfKTrHaa	Yes, if she has pink eye, it is highly contagious.  If she rubbed her eye and handled something that you later picked up, you could contract it as well.  It's not a done deal, though that you will get it just sitting by her.      As far as your eyes feeling weird now, it's like when someone just talks about lice, you start itching, you know?  So, you're probably okay.|`|1HHn3LZkaa	Look I don't think you can get pink eye from sharing the erasers with her but like if she put the eraser to her eye and then you put to your face then yeah I pretty sure you might get ut otherwise no I don't think you could have I think your just over reacting and your mind is playing tricks on you.
6KVGwdBQaa	There is no right or wrong answer to this question.  Whatever you and your wife want to do is what you should do.  Maybe, if your kids do go, get them their own room and you and your wife a seperate next door room, so you will feel like you have a little privacy.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Absolutely not.    They should stay home with a family member or the other parent.

But I've also known people who have taken their kids and enjoyed the experience immensely.

Otherwise it will be called familymoons.|`|ki7NUhU8aa	no honeymoon is a time for you and your husband to spend time together make love hang out laugh cry do everything and have it be just you two....im pretty sure you guys will have lots of other vacations to go to with you kids , but a honeymoon should just not be one of them...|`|9boLbsonaa	I agree with Coldrain.  Take the kids and it becomes a family vacation.  Doesn't matter that it's your 2nd marriage, take the time to have a nice trip by yourselves and make some memories that will carry you through the hard work of merging two families.  Plan a family vacation for later, and let the kids be involved in the planning.

If your parents are worried about privacy, set up two accounts. Only have one with pictures and one without.    Show the "Private" account to satisfy your parents and use the one with pictures (if you chose to put pictures up).    Its easier and everyone is happy.|`|3d046e751337bb678cdbb959fdb7e1d2aa	I had this same problem with Xanga.

You sound like a really, really great guy and she probably likes you back but is waiting for you to make the first move.     If you freeze up every time you try and ask her in person, write her a cute love note. Don't just write "hey, want to go out?" try to find a cute poem on line and then put a piece of chocolate or something with the note. (chocolate is a very good thing to give!) If you don't want to give it to her yourself sneak it into her backpack or give it to one of her friends to give to her!    Don't give up, and don't let her get away! If you really love her, then go for it!    Hope I Helped! ;-)|`|dNJG3EDCaa	DAMN, you need some more man meat in ya to balance out all the freaking weak *** **** that you just typed.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No you should not have to pay anything. You also should make sure that a vendor allows you a tasting before you book them. If they don't allow this, run fast to someone who will. Because if you book someone first and then find out at the tasting that you don't like the food or cake, you won't be able to back out.|`|HOK5C8n4aa	It depends on the place you go.  Some places will have relatively cheap sample platters for you to choose from.  Some places will do it for for free.      I remember it was free to sample the cake and I only went to one place because I fell in love with the first place.  The food it depended on where I went.|`|YHcyuka3aa	I don't know of any that give food samples. If you really want your wedding to be the best, why worry about a small fee for samples?

2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	because most guys are slow to mature, and they dont know what words or what feelings to say or use.|`|wAoNbpVlaa	i think guys think their in love they just find the chick attractive. they think "wow that chick is hot". thats pretty much it.|`|CEm8asvYaa	lust.|`|a82R4jTAaa	we're idiots =D|`|6Eq6x8P5aa	in the moment we probably do but it's usually just a crush or a real attraction why? the only thing i can think of is "im a guy"|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Because they know if they say it they can melt a girls heart. Ever heard of "whispering sweet nothings"? They see a hot girl and want to screw her so they say love. When they are thinking with their 2nd head instead of their heart it's the other L word, lust.|`|3J3IH2maaa	sometimes but a lot of the times it is just a crush and lust of the moment!!!!|`|H5DdF6V9aa	They're not, they just tell you they are. Consider yourself warned.
vtW3qPZmaa	We purposely chose a long weekend (Easter in our case) so that our out of town friends could fly in and wouldn't have to take time off work to do it (in the case of a couple of them they wouldn't have been able to take time off because they're teachers).    If people want to do something other than support you on your wedding day for the weekend, they will.  The people that care about you will be happy to spend the long weekend with you  - perhaps look at having other activities that weekend as well for your guests to enjoy; maybe a barbeque or picnic, if people are outdoor-sy organise water sports or a hike or something for one of the days.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That is my date too! Just be sure to send out save the dates asap, because people tend to plan things for that day. Our families loved the idea of having on a long weekend because they have more time to "recuperate" from partying and dancing all night!|`|rywgn8HLaa	I've had two of my friends have their weddings on Labor Day weekend. Almost all of their guests showed up, and I certainly didn't have a problem with it. If you have a lot of out of town guests flying in I think it's nice because it gives them an extra day off of school/work as well.   I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just send out Save the Date cards to let people know ahead of  time. It shouldn't be a problem...|`|pMsMx817aa	i dont think its bad  but maybe more expensive because its a holiday but other than that i dont think bad    good luck and congrats :)  ella|`|6fLxNyVpaa	lol either way you'll probably end up a bridezilla in the end with all your stress. but not because of that day. it sound like a good plan|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Nothing wrong with that weekend.      You'll have some people decline because they want to do their end of summer thing.  You'll have others that will accept simply because they have an extra day for revelling.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Nothing wrong with that weekend for a wedding. Not everyone makes plans for Labor Day weekend. Just make sure that you send out save the dates well in advance (6 months) so that people have time to make preparations.|`|AA10766729	Most people like to cut loose over the Labor Day weekend; its kind of the last hoorah for the summer.  So I think you'd probably have a lower guest turn-out than if you planned it for the weekend after.|`|YzpJxYBOaa	My daughter had her wedding on Memorial Day weekend and it was great.  It's not like it's Christmas, Easter or New Year's so you should be fine.    Since you're starting well in advance, your guests have months and months to set aside that time to attend.  In fact, it would be a good idea to send out Save The Date cards around March to give all your guests a head's up.  Then around June or July mail the invitations.    And you may have to spend a little extra or premiums depending on where you're having your ceremony & reception, but you'll want to book those venues NOW before they're all taken!    Congratulations!!    Karen  www.low-budget-fairy-tale-weddings.com|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	The people that cared about your wedding would go. Isn't that what matters?    Plus compare this to another person on here who asked if it's ok to have her wedding on a Friday... just because she likes Fridays. So everyone would have to take a vacation day off if they were to come. ummm ok???    EDIT  Still, it is a bit of a drag if someone really wants to do a road trip for example and they can't. It's up to you.. Also depends on whether you have a lot of guests coming from out of town or not.  EDIT  Also you can ask some of your guests what they think about it. Maybe that can give you direction too.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I think you should get married whenever YOU want to!    Congrats in advance!!!|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I love it when weddings are on Memorial Day or Labor Day weekend. Especially if it's in a place where you can go sightseeing and things like that. I like the option of having an extra day to travel or/ go home and have another day before going back to work.     I've been to weddings on Labor Day for the past two years and they were a blast. And there were a ton of guests, too. Go for it and have fun. Last year was in Madison, WI. I thought there wouldn't be anything to do, but we went to breweries, toured cheese factories, went to a ball game, toured the capitol; it was a ton of fun!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Bad?  No.  You have the right idea "the world doesn't revolve around us" - - so you know that everyone might not show up.    Go for Sept 5th if that works for you (and besides more cake, fewer guests will cost less!)

ynBEFO5Caa	The consanguinity between cousins is approximately one in sixteen. Although this does increase the risk of a recessive trait's being reinforced in the union's offspring, the increase in risk of a congenital defect is less than 3% compared to the risk in the general population. And, the chance of a positive recessive trait appearing is also increased by the same amount. Genetic counselling may help identify what the baseline risk is, and if the baseline risk is low enough the 3% increase may be insignificant.    First cousin marriage is legal in substantially more of the world's jurisdictions than it is prohibited, and is broadly accepted. The "ew, gross" reflex is not warranted by the scientific facts and is frankly ethnocetric.    As for the original question: yes, 23 out of 50 if you want to stay in the United States, and every country in Europe plus Canada and Mexico.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	don't do it.  there are many severe health problems that children from such a union can suffer from.|`|KglW7g96aa	wow, ew.   virginia.|`|AA11148143	Legal, shmegal, it's a lousy idea.

It's legal in these states:    Alabama  Alaska  California  Colorado  Connecticut  District of Columbia  Florida  Georgia  Hawaii  Maryland  Massachusetts  New Jersey  New Mexico  New York  North Carolina (not double first cousins)  Rhode Island  South Carolina  Tennessee  Vermont  Virginia  And in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Utah, and Wisconsin they can marry if they can't have children.    I'm proud of you guys... Staying together even though what your family did was so horrible.  The way I see it...   Love is unconditional. If your family doesn't want you just because of a reason like that then they never really loved you at all.    Geez, I wish my cousin (First, once removed - or my first cousins son) would of been like you guys!  But no... He wimped out on me even though I put it all on the line for him (seeing as how it's illegal where I live and legal where he lives, painfully ironic).    I hope you guys end up very happy, 'kay?

Pg3voqXkaa	He's probably really stressed out and tired from school and all other aspects of life.  I'm sure he wants to spend lots of time with you but he's just realy tired...maybe he has to get up earlier these days.      It sounds like his sleeping schedule is definitely an inconvenience for you.  I would talk to him about your concern about him sleeping early and getting tired more often and not force him to stay awake.|`|3J3IH2maaa	you need to have a talk with him sounds like he is exhausted!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|236T6hnaaa	umm buy him a red bull?  he should want to call and talk to you...maybe reconsider what you really want out of this relationship...let him call you and tell him what you want to tell him and if he still isnt interested then just be like ok well i am gonna go if you dont want to talk|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	well it really matters on what time he gets up my husband gets up at 4am to go to work and by 8:30 9 he is ready for bed|`|6V72glzFaa	I had a relationship where my boyfriend was working non stop so when i got to see him we would start watching a movie and he would fall asleep. I ended up breaking up with him basically because we never got to spend quality time together. The second guy after him was perfect forever, then as soon as he went back to school and got a new job it was like the same problem all over again, so much so that when i lost my job and was talking to him about it he litterally was snoring as i was talking to him.     All i can say to you and this may not be very helpful,but you cant force someone to stay awake if they are honestly tired. If you love him and want to be with him then talk to him about alternatives. Maybe try doing new things that you havent done before to spark the relationship again, or dont spend time with him when you know he is just going to fall asleep. I know how you feel I HATED it when my two ex boyfriends would be too tired to hang out, and still want me to come over.|`|SzubaKbuaa	When you're sleepy just tell him the same thing. If it bothers him then he'll know. Otherwise, it may be something that honestly doesn't bother him. Some people can't concentrate when they're sleepy, so he prob doesn't want you telling him something and then he has no clue what you said, cause that would make you mad too i think!

If she is a good friend she will understand because she loves you.    2) They are catty, hateful, sorry bitches.         Solution- **** them and find new friends|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	girls don't wanna fail in relationship's usually men do|`|3b913qbjaa	do what you feel. tell her she has her own life to worry about.|`|8ZARrsnXaa	she wants you to fail in life? what kind a friend is that . dump her 911 dude.do what you want!|`|dNJG3EDCaa	DO IT, shes probably just afraid of losing you or something, or has next inferiority complex going on
xA1uSaZPaa	The best thing to do first is to try to convince you are not a stalker.  Instead of texting her, try talking to her in person. Say hi to her when you see her, but be charming. (: Take is slow, since at the moment she feels "stalked". Become her friend, and gradually start to flirt with her. Give her compliments,  be thoughtful, listen to her and all that jazz. Overtime, she'll start to notice you. Most importantly, as cliche as this sounds BUT... be yourself. :D    Hope I helped.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Man, she's bi and taken, just walk away....|`|lczzYLmSaa	i agree with memy|`|wE2etBzbaa	stop stalking her, and date girls , don't stalk them.  she might said to you she is BI to push your butt away from her. so grab it away from her|`|7BL05FtAaa	If she thinks your a stalker you obliviously text her too much. Chill out and next time play it a little cooler.|`|v3e6NDYbaa	Why do you even like this girl so much?  You barely know her and have not gone out with her.  Because she's cute?  There are plenty of cute women out there!  Go find another one and stop being so needy.      Trust me, your chances on this girl are blown, move on.  If you still want to get her attention you are a stalker.|`|EgfL2c86aa	if she's dating another girl, leave her alone. she said she thinks your a stalker so if you keep talking to her she'll think your even more of a stalker. move on there's plenty of other fish in the sea, i promise =]|`|K7N0pkU8aa	back off for a while...if she doesn't come around, let it go|`|cbvRRZ5Oaa	stop texting her and talk to her in person  the worst she cold do is say she doesnt like you  and thats happened to everyone before|`|zGhDt3dpaa	Try to talk to her in person. The texting thing is a bit stalker like, especially because she is in a relationship...just be friendly and casual in person. That's about all u can do|`|8ZARrsnXaa	whats the situation is this at school? work? be more specific. if its school go out with other girls don't peruse her anymore. act like you don't want it, she may come back she may not don't stress it.there are tons of other girls out there don't be to obsess with just one. move on!|`|880810d4326c921557a558c16c9d1c6daa	Hun, if she thinks you are a stalker, then she is not interested in you. Also, she is dating someone else right now, so you'll have to back off. She's in a relationship, and you don't want to be that kind of person. There are some many girls out there, and lots of them are pretty. Look around, find someone new. Your approach with getting her number and texting her is really good. She's just not interested. Try not to text her too much either. You don't want to be the "friend", that is just putting you in a bad situation. Get another girls number, text her to make plans, and get out together. Get to know them while on a date in person, not over text message. Hope this helps!|`|JLQMyKCvaa	tell her that you think she and her girlfriend look so cute together and she is going to think about how you already know and accept her relationship and keep comin around u will see u will get something i know cause that happened to me the same exact way

cKLrhh1daa	I'm really sorry for your loss. I think you need to keep Jeff in your heart, but not in your head. You need to stop thinking about him all the time. He wouldn't want you to do this to yourself, just be logical. If you don't think about him all the time, if you don't cry yourself to sleep every night, it doesn't mean that you don't love him as much as you used to. Jeff will always remain your beloved one but if you really do love him, you'll keep going and live just for him. Make love your current boyfriend and don't ever compare him to Jeff, he'd get jealous if you did. You will be much happier in a relationship.|`|LGkb4xibaa	dont try to force yourself to get over him. Your in mourning. That period can take months or even years. Yes of course jeff would want you to move on. He'd hate to see you mourn your life away. But if your not ready, your not.    You do love your family. Your just numb. You have to much hurt overriding anything else. As in time that gets less (and it will), you will start to feel more emotionally alive again. And realise you do still have the feelings for your family, and also become more aware of what you feel for yourself.    Crying is not a crime and it will release the tension. So cry all you like. You should definately try to keep yourself busy, and keep going out and about though. As this will occupy your mind more and help you through it.    As for the guy your with. Tell him the truth. Say you still havent got over things and you'd like his support through it. Hopefully he will understand.     When i lost my grandfather who i was extremely close to, i went to bereavement counselling. It helped me quite a lot. Maybe you could try that if things get really hard.    To answer your initial question-Love means many things to different people. But to me, Family love is a feeling of protection. A deep caring and the feeling of wanting to make their life the best it can be. A feeling of belonging and sometimes pride for them. Love for a partner should be all the above plus a feeling of euphoria (in the early stages at least), and a state where you ache if you are away from them and feel excited when your with them.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Loving someone and being "in love" is different, there is no list I can write down to say why I am in love with him, there are no words to describe my feelings and emotions for him, there are no descriptives I can find that will adequately portray who he is to me.I love him with a love that is beyond love and I know my heart and soul are safe with him.  He is me and I am him and being committed is not something that you think about as once your heart has found its home, you are home.|`|YjGYQrlMaa	you will know when you fall in love one day.  Answer Mine:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|hChy7BAPaa	i am exteremely sorry about the loss dear. my reguards..  you are strong! this is normal..and i know it's tough right now...but Jeff wants you to be happy. he doesnt want to see you this way. you MUST move on hun. you can fight this. love is all around you. i'm sending you loving vibes right now. i don't even know you and i love you. i feel like you are a sister to me. an inspiration. i don't think i am emotionally as strong as you..but you must also have love for yourself. you have to realize that Jeff IS here! and he's still living because you still love him..that goes for your brothers and your best friend as well. the only difference is that you are energy in a body..and they are just energy...and it's ok if it's that way! i would take on some meditation.  peace and love hun. you are loved by the living and the loved ones who passed on.. eternal peace and love to you :)|`|V1i6c9qMaa	WOW!!! I can't even begin to imagine going through such hardships in life, all my problems are pail in comparison. All I can say is its great you have friends and family to be there for you, but everybody grieves for different periods of time. You may just take longer then others around you. I know when my grandfather died (we were really really close) It took me almost a year before I accepted him being gone! You may need a grief counselor as well to help you through this. You might want to look into it. At any rate with this new guy if it goes sour then you probably know you shouldn't be dating right now. You need to get over your inner problems and demons before you can look outward for love and relationships. Deal with you first and make yourself happy first, then everything else will fall into place for you! I wish you the best of luck and you will be in my prayers tonight!|`|zlVqm6QHaa	You'll know, Trust me.,|`|q9mFfx0Raa	you have to understand that he's gone and of all things he'd probably want you to be happy and he'd want to see you happy, not crying yourself to sleep.  you have to know that you can't just start a relationship with guys because you feel it's necessary i mean the guy you were in love with just past away and you're trying to make yourself feel better by going out with multiple guys and that's obviously not working out for you.   you are breaking these guys' hearts and it's unfair to them because you should know that you would feel this way.  you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else, you have to forget the past but always remember the good times and that will help you move on and moving on doesn't just happen overnight it takes time and it takes time to get over your love and it takes time to accept it and love yourself again but for now you should stay single, do something for yourself and keep boys out for now. they'll come to you when you're ready, you'll see. but you should tell this current guy the gist of it that you're just not over jeff, but you wish you could be and you wish you coluld give him a chance but not yet because you're not ready.  i know it's a lot to read but i hope it helps.  im soooo sorry for your loss|`|57a4b9e6d894d32c05bb3d57bee43606aa	You need to look at your new boyfriend in a whole different perspective. Try and find the positive good things about him. Maybe something he does that touches your heart in a way Jeff never did. I know you don't want to hear it and it feels impossible, but you do have to let go of Jeff.

pDqsFgjyaa	Lets say i bought you the ugliest *** thing ever, something you hate, say a clown figurine. You'd throw it away right? But if you kept it "physical desire" then eventually after a while you'd think it's ok, then get used to it and like it being there. And finally, I'd come back one day to reclaim it.

She is definitely jealous of you. I don't want to say that she has an ego but that is the closest I can get. Just don't practically praise her whenever she accomplishes something and don't worry if she says congradulations on your accomplishments like she means it.  By the way, if you have just started high school....yeah....high school can sometimes change people for the worst....but NOT everyone.|`|AA11756996	yes probably but she sounds like she has a very low self esteem and so take it easy on her because she is not normal and for some reason she feels less then. which means putting others down. do not take it personally cause she does not mean to hurt you. your the strong one your the better person remember that ok!|`|AA12104677	i think you are thirteen and need to grow up|`|7a17263e04243b3074b63c2d58f887bfaa	As you grow up you will realize that girls are ALL catty and jealous of each other.  They all view other girls as competition regardless of the situation and the truth of the matter.
rkx61liHaa	dang girl !! well....he's a dick! just try to flirt with him and talk to jim and maybe he will start to like you and leave him girlfriend! good luck!|`|3J3IH2maaa	i think he loves you more but is unsure how to break up with his current GF i think you should sit him down adn talk about it
AA10441846	I disagree with everyone, I think if you truly love someone, you will always love them. I was with a guy for 7 years, we broke up, and after about 2 years I was still missing him. I cried many nights, just wanting my life back with him...If its meant to be, you will be together again in time. I think true love only comes once. Lucky for me, we got back together and married this time. I am very happy to be home again, sometimes it just takes time to realize you dont know what youve got til its gone. but that's just my opinion....I have heard that you can meet someone new and fall in love, but your true love will always be there.|`|1b1c2638b760ab32ca91a9a5d41a446eaa	its hard it sucks if i was u find someone else which will listen or get a hobby 2 pass the time till u get of it try 2 tell yourself your not still in love wit them and try 2 find someone else i know it just dosen`t feel right but u just need 2 forget him  i hope it helps|`|949846dd3d21a3fad6640e025e04c9dfaa	If he does not care anymore, just deal with it. You do not want to waste your time thinking about him or trying to make him love you again when you know very well it is not going to happen. Be realistic and accept the harsh truth. Move on and time will heal your wound.  I am sure the right man will come along.|`|526bc7e0dca70aa224bc8d8bb5978177aa	i think in cases like this, we learn to deal with it. cos there will always be that part of us that still cares for and loves them. we learn to deal with it by understanding that people change and go in different directions. however we should always remember the good times we had with them.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	If you would just stay busy you will get over him.  If you start going out with friends you might find that there are others out there.|`|134a2e3a8efcf35dbb20131113467971aa	well it goin to take some times but as time goes by u will find ur mr. right again trust me :)|`|f233e67ebd7e407e2b828ea2b140b2aeaa	Well considering your situation, its going to be very hard to get over that person. You have probably heard this before but it just takes time. And in your case ...alot of time. I went out with someone for a year, but they were nothin special so i got over it very quickly. So u will get over them, but it might take a long time. However, it might not be over...if the other person realizes how much you guys went through together.. he could change his mind. As hard as it sounds... just try to forget. Hang out with friends as much as you can to get over him and find something to do at all times. Good luck
JZkCVHJAaa	it worked out in you've got mail... but personally i would meet the guy first and talk to him to get to know him better maybe with a friend to be on the safe side|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It isn't wrong to feel a special attraction for someone you meet online.  Its isn't hard to fall for someone online.  I think a conversation on the internet is one of the most comfortable ones you will ever have.  You can think about what you say before you say it and you don't have to worry about what is in between your teeth.  This just makes the two of you more relaxed.  I think basically, a person you find funny and interesting over the internet may not be found the same way had you hung out with him in person first.|`|fLDEHFKJaa	For the record, it is important to know for sure about the people you meet online. There are serious predators and police looking for predators online, so be very cautious.  But on the other hand, in very rare cases, true love can be found online. Be very cautious, but if you truly think you trust the person, it is possible that you could love someone that you'd never met.    B|`|gQpoSC6Baa	go out with him.  that is so cute, right.  i have done it, its fun.|`|KwWwB22Zaa	yea, i wouldnt do anything with a person you have only met online.|`|VtGH1bDaaa	same problemn here. been datin for 2 months now and we still havnt met. but we talk over the phone and ive sen him beofre. just havnt really hung out alone. but if ur both commited to it then its cool.|`|Tn52aL3Zaa	they are who you want them to be online, they can be anyone!  When you meet them sometimes they aren't the person they say they are, and are well total losers.  Date someone from your area - not over the internet.|`|dNJG3EDCaa	be careful, thats how girls get raped or become internet stalkers or those crazy people that have like a million cats living with them in their one bedroom apartment|`|wE2etBzbaa	It is not wrong, it is just stupid.  since you don't know really who they are, they might be 88 years old man, or 7 years old guy, or your neighbor, or  a stalker or convicted felon|`|BJuwGkUJaa	That seems to be the way of life is internet dating, but keep your guard up you just never know what you are meeting. I know some people it has worked for and some that were horrified. Just be careful!!!!  cb|`|cAPf4kdIaa	it is so not wrong ask for his   and call him try to set up a time to meet figure out if you really like this guy first find out some info about him then call him and if he sounds ok then try to meet him somewhere|`|173vsiacaa	no, because technically we meet everyone whom we've never bet before.   i'm not sure about the part about falling in love, mostly because you sound very young.     my friend has met a bunch of guys online, but it is always good to have a trusted friend or adult to go along. i went along with her once, and he turned out to be a pretty sweet guy.     BUT like i said, you sound young (i may be wrong), and maybe it isn't the best idea to meet up with a guy you met online. he could be anyone - that is the most obvious reason, and you wouldn't want it to go wrong!     PLEASE keep in mind that safety is key.|`|fH0cZIy1aa	I don't think its wrong at all. But it can hurt at times. I'm dating a guy online and most of the time it feels wonderful. I still feel crazy about him after almost a year. Sometimes we have arguments but we work threw it. You didn't say your age but if you old enough then i say go right ahead. This guy sounds nice and if you like talking to him then keep doing it. You should use msn or yahoo messenger though. Its alot easier to talk then just through email. Good luck with this guy :)|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	No its not wrong to like a guy you never met. And you talk to him online and you think your in love. That is what happened to me, that is how I found my fiance is talking to him online, and then eventually falling in love with him. He moved up here to be closer to me, and to live in the same state as me. =] We have now been together 1 year, 3 in a half months, and two days. We are now engaged and in love then ever before. Just as long as you make sure that you love him, and make sure he is the age he says, and he looks like the way he says, and just be careful. You should be fine. I hope everything works out for you. Good Luck! =]

For example, I used to talk to a girl who liked smart cars, i would ask her why, make some jokes, and just go wherever the conversion took us. The good thing with this is that when you want to talk to her again, you can reference back to previous conversions. Like, "Hey I saw a crashed smart car the other day! Remember when I said they weren't save, well you were totally right, that thing held up so well!" I hope this helped, really all you can do it remember what you said in previous conversions.|`|01RA3LH9aa	ok take it from a girl. girls don't like to hear about guys brag about how long their dick is. that is a major turn off!!! ask them about them. we like that. find out what she likes. if she likes flowers... buy her flowers. if she likes music, sing her a song. show her that u actually care and respect her and don't make it seem that all u want to do is bang her. i hope this helped|`|qg4cN0Tqaa	there is no one answer to this....its all situational....notice something about her and bam, the secret is talk about them. ask about their life ask about whats going on in it....do you go to school? work? and then feed off theyre answers...just whatever u do dont talk about how cool u are or how big like the first guy said....whata bum....make em laugh and they always call back....|`|enAhUrLfaa	shoes|`|LkeGdqBvaa	movies.   music.   talk about fun things you do and start up a conversation about summer   uum   sorry   i dont really know aynthing else.|`|yC6wINPcaa	wht classes they enjoy most.

20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Have you told your Dad that you would rather live with your Mom ? Maybe, he would agree with you. If so, and he won't let you live with your Mom,  do exactly what the lawyer tells you to do. He knows the law and what will help you. Good luck,  M|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You need to understand that the judge doesn't just do what you want.  They have to take all factors, including your testimony, into consideration.  For your mother to get the custody changed, she needs to prove that there has been a significant change in circumstances since the original custody order was put in place.  If she can't do that, then the custody order will remain intact.|`|5k7BexD3aa	When you talk to the Judge, be very mature.  Don't walk in looking punk or smacking on chewing gum.  Answer all of his questions and be prepared to answer why you would rather live with your Mom.|`|AA11138696	So say that to the judge and do not try to run your dad down to get custody changed.  There maybe other factors that you are not aware of that have decided the custody question.  Just tell the judge that as you are now becoming a young woman you would feel more comfortable living with your mother so you would be with her for support as you transform to womanhood.  That is a good reason without making your dad out to be a bad guy.|`|afkygHMgaa	I am going to be honest with you. I am not buying the whole story about your mom and dad and how they relate to you. You asked in another question about getting your nipples pierced. You said your mother is fine with that. That is so wrong there is not a word for that kind of wrong and it is also probably illegal. Clearly you are far too promiscuous for someone of your age and being with a mother that condones that is not going to fare well with the judge. You were placed with your father for a reason, as judges seldom place a child with the father if the mother is stable. I'd suggest you remain where you are and get yourself together.|`|aOd0Djkaaa	I guess what comes into play is how your dad got full custody of you anyway. I would stay with Dad. He obiviously had your best intrest from the start.
lmESBQb7aa	Your idea seems good! I have never thought of going to the spa for an anniversary...clever. Maybe you could write him a poem/speech for your anniversary.

0cCZkuBOaa	I had the same thing happen to me (except the friends moving away thing). For me, it all starts with adding them on Facebook or MySpace (if they have). About 70% the next day they will ask you "Did you add me on Facebook/Myspace/(or any blog site). If they confirm the friendship, then thats a good start^^. Also maybe talk about common intrests such as video games etc. I find that talking about the weather and other "non-captivating" stuff is not effective.

If that happens to be the "cool" kids then have fun! But if its not, don't worry there are plenty of other wonderful people you can befriend. You can talk to them at lunch or ask them homework questions or make jokes or say hi as you pass them in the hall. Have them get used to your presence. If they never see you than they won't consider you when have a party or going out on the weekends. make sure they know your name and can match it with your face.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Why don't you hang out with people who are into the same things?

If you don't like looking at a girl you will probably not like hanging out with her. If she has a bad personality, you wouldn't want to hang out with her for extended periods of time.    So yea, it's both really.|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	for teenage guys it looks, for old guys its looks, for christian guys it's looks, for gay guys its personality of their boyfriends|`|XsYrhdY2aa	It's really a mix.  I need someone I'm physically attracted to but I can't have a girl who's personality and values are poor.
O9jrkjgraa	She needs to take him to court for child support...|`|JZkCVHJAaa	she could give the baby to a family not able to like in the movie Juno|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	u should just stick by her and give her good advice shes gonna need a friend who cares, now 4 the IDIOT of the guy u cant do nuthing about it sooo just make sure everyone knows what kind of person he is , her if she cant support da child or is gonna make it suffer shes better off aborting if shes in a good financial situation and could support it them she should keep it ,or she can give it up 4 adoption ,it ALL depends on da kind of person she iz .|`|2sdOlbOxaa	In my opinion, she needs to keep the baby and after it is born have the guy sign his rights away or make him pay child support.  Either way, she knew this could happen when she had sex, and she should just stand up and take care of her baby with or without him.      You could just be a friend, she may need someone to talk to, and to hang with.  If you are there she will not feel alone.  But it isn't the end of the world for her....it's a new beginning.  Just keep her thinking positive.
O9jrkjgraa	Talk to them in person and find out.|`|v6s30PHXaa	people are mean... someone i thought was a good friend deleted me off of myspace and facebook. just stay strong. you WILL find people who like you for you, and who will be there for you no matter what.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Don`t worry for those called friends they weren`t true and honest to you.  We lose "friends" in every path of our lives. We want them to be our close and dear friends...sometimes they play false, they deceive us. Taking this facts of life as lessons make us grow and be more selective choosing friends. If I were you I`ll try to find out what happened with this two guys..just to know and be more careful next time I give my effort and time to people who want to play a role in my life..Yes, its my life and I have to take care of what or who is in it..I`m the one to choose not to be chosen...And whatever isn`t good (like those friends) I have the option to discard it or take it and then feel hurt and rejected...So Make sure you make the right choices..  Good luck!..|`|HBWp3Fxhaa	The dude "Steve" probably just got mad and told "Jon" to delete you or something. They weren't your real friends. Just find some new ones, The world is filled with people!
O9jrkjgraa	Send him to a therapist|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	This is something you need to strongly encourage him to see a psychotherapist about. This is not a "simple habit" you can just get "Rid off". Something is there deeply inside that makes him like doing this. It will be kept confidential by law and they can help him. Be sure he knows that it will be private what he tells them. take care.|`|V4LSo3iDaa	chew some gum so he wont think about it
V1i6c9qMaa	Just go on the date if he asks you. don't read to much into it and if it s feels right afterward then proceed. It would only feel wierd if you guys didnt get along after the date and thatll pass to if your both mature.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	When you're that age, casual dating is very normal. I don't think it would be awkward to go on a date with him. And if things are awkward between you after, the bonus is that you have a group of friends surrounding you when you're around him so that it eases the pressure off of you, as you can mingle with your other friends rather than try to ignore him. A date may LEAD to a relationship, but I think it's way too soon to even bring up a possible relationship. Just relax, go on the date and see how it goes. Just be yourself and have fun! After all, it's been a while since you went out with anyone, so I think it's about time you start!|`|HMUEO3NTaa	just go and "hang out" if its meant to be, its meant to be|`|OfBG0jNjaa	It may not be awkward if you don't let it.  You can go out together casual, meaning just as mostly friends and not more.  I don't use he words "hang out" because when i was in high school that just meant sex.|`|UR5GfThJaa	I think you should do it. I hadn't been on a single date or had a boyfriend until the one I have now and I'm 18. We've been together for almost a year. We were originally friends and we hung out with the same group of people. It doesn't change anything or make things akward if you are in a group. I know from experience|`|M7JBySp2aa	haha just go with it ! you said that you have had a crush on him and he is obviously feeling you too. If things go good on the first date then things shouldn't be awkward when you're hanging out with everyone else.  On the other hand if you really aren't that into the whole thing then just have a good time on the date and just give subtle hints that you would rather be friends. i wouldnt think too much about your past relationships because everyone is different|`|LOA5yQh0aa	Go on the date, and have a good time! :) Wait and see what happens until after the date.|`|dNJG3EDCaa	DO IT|`|d6CoLLWDaa	i think it depends on how u feel about him. It shouldn't be awkward if youse like each other. try it out and see what happens. no matter what girly dont let him disrespect u in anyway...im not sayin he will but if he should happen to let it go. but all in all i say GO FOR IT! get ta know him and see what happens. always remember to take it slow. when u do things fast it messes stuff up. Good luck.|`|aatk3g4iaa	it won't make hang out time awkward, you should do it.|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	i think u should go and no it wouldnt make the hole group thing awkward just go for it youll never know what will happen. taking risks can come out good.!|`|PYqT2Pgqaa	3 words.   GO FOR IT(:   He is obviously interested in you or he wouldn't of texted your friend.   I doubt things would be awkward between you too, because he likes you. You should go out with him, you need to open yourself up and make yourself avaliable again. School is hard to manage when you have a boyfriend but just put school at the top of your list.   Try dating him, if you two don't work out simply tell him you don't wantthings to be awkward.
gduUlcXoaa	Firstly you must decide who you are more interested in. If you were in a position where you could go out with either, who would you choose?    If the answer is your current girlfriend, obviously keep it that way. It is great that things are going well for you two, and you could be throwing it away for a relationship with someone else that might not even happen.    If the answer is the other girl, things are bit more complicated. You should let your girlfriend know as soon as possible, because the longer you lead her on, the more you will hurt her.   Judging from the details, my advice would be to get to know the other girl better before you decide.    Hope this helps!|`|tK7XacH7aa	Okay you are already going out with this girl. Get to know her a lot more than now and see if you are compatible. It's your choice if you want to dump her or not, if you want to just say that you just want to be friends.  before you make that move though really try to get to know each girl, don't take to long though, because it could come off as if you are cheating and if you do that you could ruin it with both of them.   Whomever you seem most compatible with should be the choice for you, just think things through    Good Luck|`|5gG2OfHIaa	When I was young I was always thinking in terms of "a better deal."  With hard lessons learned,  I would stick with the first girl.
pX8qJzjIaa	Well its school, talking to girls is the easiest thing to do in school.  Just start it off with something about class, just to get the conversation started.  Then move on to other things like sports or anything.  Once youve broken the ice it will come naturally.|`|VpxQ7Du9aa	just talk 2 her, its like my situation, except 4 the fact that its a guy that i like, and idk if he likes me!|`|4m3z1ztEaa	Are you good at school? Is she good at it?  You can either offer help or ask her for help to start it  If you two are equal, start to work with her on class work. Like exchange answers after you two are finished and see who got what answer right/wrong  This way you two got to know each other  Then slowly and gradually let her know you, know the best side of you  Then ask her out|`|Fi8AIi4baa	If you know any of her friends, talk to them, get into a conversation with her, and get to know her a bit.    An easy way to get to know a girl is through her friends, and if her friends like you, she's way more likely to like you, whether as a friend, or even to be considered for a relationship.|`|GuVNYGqyaa	hey my names.........   so how have u been........  what class u goin to next........  what r u doin this weekened........  jus start a simple conversation|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	OK, Darryl...grow some balls...I'm jk.  Sounds like she's into you...trust me, she is, or she wouldn't say you're cute...at least I wouldn't.   She probably really wants you to like her too, and can't wait till you show some interest in her.  When I was in high school, I used to hate it when I would find out that this and that guy liked me, and I never even knew about it.  I would find out later on...happened all the time...and most of those guys I would even go for, so just DO IT.  Good luck!|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	Just walk by her to sharpen ur pencil or sumthing be like heey!|`|3f8AMQeNaa	Try to get into a project  with her and get to know her. When your in the group try to ask her to join you and your friends to the movies or something else.|`|dNJG3EDCaa	yo, she got the hots for you O_O use that to fuel your fire xD|`|k3t9dzciaa	Duudddde i was the same way. Be like what other school did you come from and where did you live. And then joke with her.|`|EgfL2c86aa	just start up a conversation over something random. ask to borrow a pen and start talking to her about ANYTHING. even what was for lunch in the caf that day. she said you were cute right, so what are you so nervous for? try her, she might be interested. =]|`|fOT1HDn9aa	man just talk to her something random and don't forget ask her name|`|SNKVKZyCaa	You might want to say something very simple like "Hi name is Darryl", then reach out to shake her hand. More than likely, she will be polite and introduce herself to you in return. You can also ask her how does she like the class since this is something you both have in common. Keep it simple because she already thinks you're cute.  Good Luck!
O9jrkjgraa	hang out with both...|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Try to manage both together that would help you..|`|0ClA7HlEaa	Hang out both :) !  it'll work out in the end dont worry ;]|`|7FAZYMy3aa	I used to try to make friends with everyone in middle school. I can honestly say that everyone could call me their friend.|`|CTI1c2mGaa	I agree with the majority that you can hang out with both to a great extent.  Some will be really good friends, while others will be just friends you know and see sometimes.  Just remember that the people you hang out with should be ones that you can honestly respect.  Being popular is great but being yourself is most important.  As difficult as it is, you will find that one year your best friend may not be your best friend the next year.  We all change as we grow but in the end you will be able to look back with great memories of the times you shared with each of them.  Good luck, I know you can handle it well.
AA10766729	I vote for leaving the sh*t where it lays.  You're not her maid.  Don't do ANYTHING....no cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry.  Take care of yourself ONLY.  She'll get the hint.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Leave it .. just clean up after yourself .|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	When you say old lady do you mean wife? If she is your wife then did you not know that she was a slob when you married her?  I say this because usually people are either neat or sloppy and usually you can figure this out before you marry them. If your not married to her then obviously she is not the woman for you. She is a slob and she will always be a slob so you either live with it or leave it. You won't ever change her and it will become a major issue in your relationship. I don't think you have much respect for her just from you referring to her as your old lady. That is just not cool.|`|AA11138696	leave it. IF you always come and fix it why should she?|`|M2JNgbI1aa	Well just live it  its her responsibility|`|b5UV15gCaa	well if you leave it you will probably end up doing it 3 days later. Just when you see her leaving something out say "honey could you put that away?" and if she doesn't tell her she is being disrespectful in a kind way. If she loves you she will want to respect you and will clean up after herself. She may need to be reminded multipule times. good luck! :)|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Leave it.  She's an adult.  It's not your job to look after her like a child.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Let her live in her mess, she will soon run out of clothes, not be able to find stuff etc.  Then tell her you are going to call one of the TV shows that shame people in to smarting up!|`|KnMdFqq0aa	She probably does this because you cannot talk correctly and also because you refer to her as your old lady.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Why does she have to do it - if she knows that you will.  Leave her mess and just  take care of your mess.  M|`|slJWqCI5aa	You are not her daddy are you?? Leave it!|`|9boLbsonaa	Remember that your standards may not be her standards.  Different people have different ideas about "clean".  Also, maybe refer to her as your "bride" rather than "old Lady", it'll make her feel good, and you might get a better response.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Since you refer to your wife, the love of your life, your partner for life, as "Old lady", I shall refer to you as "A@@hole".  Dear A@@hole,  Stop being so OCD and controlling and just leave her things alone. She may not want you to touch or move her things, so just leave them alone.
Fi8AIi4baa	Easiest thing to do is just relax and don't worry about it.    Unless the behavior is constant and repetitive, in which case he might have ADD, or he might like being with you. Probably the latter.    But really, just don't worry about it.|`|5s90en0iaa	i think he probably was just doing his poster...obviously he probably noticed you but it doesn't seem like anything that serious...next time you see him just talk to him like you do with the guys you don't like. don't think about it too much. when you do that you get nervous and start acting wierd...it's okay to have a crush but always be in control!!

aatk3g4iaa	sorry you feel that i have no life and all that but since i'm nice here's some help. first i think that if you feel that you smart, talented, outgoing, charming, and clever then you should act like it don't try to go out your way to impress anybody because if they don't like you for how you are then they can go suck nuts o.k. and if this girl doesn't like you than forget her just wait and one day another girl will come and you'll like her and she'll like you so go out there and be your self and if you feel real passionate about something then just write about it or type it up on the internet someone with listen.|`|vzDgu1xkaa	Hmm..... if you like the girl, try to find if she goes out with other friends in your class that you know. that way you can see her outside of school where you can develop a realantionship. and being shy is actually a big hit ith the girls because they feel your really sensitive and nice. just dont say anything unless you know the whole sentence and if its the right time to ay it. oh and just be queit around her dont be to outgoing. hope you get the girl|`|meHwFnQ1aa	I don't leave nasty comments because I do not have a life.

Hope I helped(:|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Well, Jeremy, at your age, this sort of thing is going to happen. I was probably clumsier, uglier, and even more awkward than you when I was your age. I want you to take comfort in the fact that this is only temporary. You're in between boyhood and manhood, and this shall all pass. In fact, you haven't got much longer to go if you're 14. Soon, you will see that you will gain some confidence, a surer step, and an overall better life. As for this girl, forget about it. She's not worth it. Wouldn't you rather spend your time getting to know someone who would NOT treat you like you're an alien? You'll be just fine. I am confident of it.|`|VXdSc5h4aa	Well, I can say one thing, your not alone. I have those same exact problems. For acne, try getting some acne creme. When you start to get clumsy, which happens to me all the time, just try to stay cool, think about something that's not nerve racking, and calming. Also, remember, think about what you say before you say it, so you can make sure it doesn't sound stupid. Actually, I'm probably clumsier than you, a couple days ago, I picked up my math book, and accidentally hit myself in the head with it, and the list goes on. Just remember, your not alone.|`|nW0tr84saa	maybe if you stopped being rude and disgusting maybe perhaps you'll get a girl talk to her private and try to tell her if you tell her how you feel about her and why your so rude and disgusting because i know you want her attention just tell from your heart and she'll probably like you too you never always give it a try|`|EPLfj2Zfaa	Mate, you'll be fine.     My guess is, once you finish school you'll probably never see any of the people from school again anyway. My point is, stop stressing out! Just relax and forget about what other people think about you. Ache happens when your young. It will pass.    Pour your passion into your studies.    One thing I have discovered over the years is that girls love someone who is passionate and ambitious, so just keep that in mind.|`|WnRy6on6aa	all that stuff (the clumsiness, the acne, etc) will go away with time. i actually think it's kinda cute when a guy is clumsy, so don't feel bad about yourself. if you're insecure about your acne, then start trying to fix it. see a dermatologist or just go to the drugstore and ask a pharmacists what kind of soap and cream you should get.  as for girls being disgusted by you, take more showers, wash your hair every night, wear a nice-smelling cologne, dress nicer, and just don't do disgusting things.   it seems like the girl really doesn't like you, and girls are pretty stubborn. you just shouldn't even bother with a girl that can't give you five minutes. if you have so much passion and need a way to express it, try writing everything down in a private notebook. i'm not saying it will fix everything, but it will make you feel better to get everything onto paper so you can sort it out easier.   don't worry about girls not liking you. give it some time, get out of the house more often and talk to girls outside of school, the right girl will come along, she just might not come as soon as you want her to.|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	ok ill try to help but i aint the greatest.. so try to like get in to different things in school and maybe like try to talk to this girl that u like but if she doesnt want to talk then she aint worth it.. but just cause u say stupid things dont mean people think ur stupid or not smart,. the best thing i could say is dont worry about what other people think if they dont like u it aint the end of the world just be like ok whatever...      hope that helps u and dont be bummed about the girl not liking u|`|cp2CYB0caa	im around your age too. I'm also very clumsy and don't have the best skin. most girls like a outgoing, charming, clever, talented guy. what i would do is try to ignore the fact that your clumsy and have acme. that's what i do and it makes me alot more confident. If you really think the only thing that's stopping you from having her like you is your acme, then i wouldn't try to impress a girl like that. shes probably to self centered, rude, and pays too much attention to her self. i would try to find a girl with the same problems that goes to the same school as you to talk to and you will probably end up liking that girl too. Try to become good friends with a girl that you can 100% trust and try talking to her. Good luck and i hope this helps!
3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Give her a shot.  She's your Mom.  She'll be your mom for the rest of your lives.  She admits that she screwed up and she's trying to make amends.|`|3secB3Smaa	my thoughts are your thoughts . You have the right idea.|`|AA11674544	She has nothing to lose. Her relationship with you is over, so she is trying. You have a lot to lose. You can be hurt again. I suggest you allow a relationship on YOUR terms this time. Be strong and let the relationship stay at the "talk about the weather" or other non-important matters. Deep down you want their acceptance. You will not get it. She is hoping to get forgiveness from you. She is hoping you won't talk about your personal life because she can't accept that. So every conversation avoids the big elephant in the room. So, the question really is, how much are you willing to risk? I strongly suggest you leave the relationship at an arm's distance and just talk about nothing important. You are in serious danger of getting hurt by this and you know it. It will never be like you want it to be. You have to accept that first and then YOU have to decide, with that understanding, what you want from a woman who loves you but can't accept you. Don't get hurt again. You may be kind and tell her you forgive her (for her sake), but you don't have to get burned twice. The world is big and you can find love and acceptance elsewhere. She can just be a casual penpal. Good luck!
