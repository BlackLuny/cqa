cR4W88GYaa	JJ was. He also played against way better schools then Curry does but still scored alot of points.|`|2cywkJ5Uaa	JJ Redick.|`|D2CC2t0kaa	Reddick was a better shooter in college but i think Curry will still end up havin the same NBA career that Reddick has now: bench warmer. The Nba is a whole different level. Curry can create his shot a little better than Reddick but not much. In the L u need to be able to create space to shoot. You cant just catch and shoot all the time.|`|pdu0ZEfIaa	Stephen Curry|`|6yoQhXsOaa	STEPHEN CURRY EASILY!|`|xg4NjusZaa	JJ was the better shooter|`|jbXTn7RXaa	JJ Redick for sure|`|aupDanleaa	reddick
AA11620976	Bear Mtn Bridge NY to the northern side of Mahoosuc Notch ME [Me Rt 26 ] is 559 miles<br>  Do it in that direction so that you're strong when you reach VT & especially WMNF|`|J9HEPVdaaa	I was going to give an opinion but it could be a matter of life and death depending on what you do. So I will just take some points and wish you luck.
i0Igqvroaa	no actually doris burke actually knows the game pretty well|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Doris Burke to me always sounds like Clarice Starling from Slience Of the Lambs. It must be the southern accent or something.<br>  <br>  I'm always waiting for her to say "Dr. Lecter, that was a sensational drive to basket"|`|fAMpj8s2aa	yeah, and you can always hear how ugly they are in their voice.
k96aZXY2aa	1) Warm ups are stretching and conditioning.<br>  2) It is important because if you don't stretch your muscles out before you throw skills you are more likely to get hurt.<br>  3) Spotters are the people who teach you a new skill and are there to catch you if you fall.<br>  4) They are important because they make sure you do not get hurt and build your confidence by offering tips to improve your skills.<br>  5) pike stretch: sit down with your legs straight in front of you and reach for your toes. <br>  straddle: sit down with your legs straight and apart. reach for the middle, put one arm across your belly and reach over your head with the other, switch sides<br>  bridge: lay on your back with your feet and hands on the ground and push your belly and head off the ground|`|pC6KstvHaa	Well i cheer so it might be similar!<br>  1.  A warm-up is when you warm up your routine or tumbling passes or stunts.<br>  <br>  2. Warm-up is important because you get to practice it before you actually go, so you know that you are more confident in your skill. Also it helps stretch out.<br>  <br>  3. Spotters are people that lift you up when you are first trying a skill, before you can do it by yourself.  They pretty much save you from falls, and landing on your head.<br>  <br>  4. Spotters are important because they help you build confidence, over advice, and help you not land on your head.<br>  <br>  5. ? Sorry i have no idea what that means =[|`|jxxWZoHeaa	same as MegaMe<br>  5) straddle stretch (stretch with legs apart), lunge(one foot forward one foot back), pike stretch(both feet out in a strait line and reach ur hands forward)
1z7M3Tntaa	Yeah he's a very good wrestler very athletic for his size he's a fairly big guy I think he was an IWGP champ once, actually he still is. That show's alone that he's good because over there they dont give the title to just anybody. I would recommend doing some research on him in your free time insted of just taking my word for it .  Look at a few videos of him maybe his macthes in TNA if you dont like Japanese style wrestling.
b7JS16dyaa	Why would it be weird if anyone is obsessed with wrestling? As for action figures, do what you want. Who are others to judge you? I'd like anyone to define weird/abnormal, because in today's society, it just means uncommon.|`|Vbfq5YUTaa	No im 14 too and I still play with them nothing wrong with it|`|yIiKFxU5aa	Im a 15 year old girl and I love playing with mine.<br>  All seriousness<br>  <br>  Don't you hate how inaccurate they are?<br>  Like my JBL one is all muscle when he's not/

I still keep finding things on there that i never seen before.  The glossary is the quickest way to get around.|`|oPbLcfKoaa	Forget the web- there are just too many sites and almost none of them witll be helpful with an old Huffy.<br>  <br>  I suggest going to your local library and finding a copy of Glenns Complete Bicycle Manual, preferably the first printing in 1973. That'll do you more than just about any website. You can find used copies on the web for under $20. Excellent investment.
QcmNHRzyaa	the new azodin pump is cool. i think it is released in a few days<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azodin.com/kp/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.azodin.com/kp/default.asp</a><br>  <br>  and a video of it<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWC1GIssAVQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWC1GIssA...</a>|`|xfRwel49aa	The new Azodin Kaos it is under one hundred dollars and has a closed bolt but the paintball do not roll out of the barrel because the barrel has three slits in the back of the barrel that has an oring around it so the oring is holding the ball in place. It is a great pump marker under 100.
fS8joiTaaa	<a href="http://www.danscomp.com/101667.php?cat=BIKES" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscomp.com/101667.php?cat=B...</a> Ok this is a very good price for what your getting. Even better if you buy it this month and you use the promotion code 39d1 you get 15% off :)  so i think this is a very good deal for under 300$ since you have about 500$ you will be left with some money over. It is a very good bike for a begginer it has everything you need but if you ever want to upgrade some parts for some lighter ones you have the option to do so with the money left over. If you dont think this bike will suite you i could always find another one but this is the best bike ive seen for the price.<br>  <br>  Since you are also starting to bmx i made this site for people new and old to bmx to help them out <a href="http://we-bmx.fairtopic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://we-bmx.fairtopic.com/</a> its a pretty cool website and everyones pretty friendly but can be sarcastic sometimes. So i think you would get a better bmx experience asking questions and talking to other riders on my site than on yahoo answers because you cant really reply back in your questions on yahoo answers. <br>  <br>  So its nice to see your taking up bmxing as a sport and something fun to do. I hope i helped. I hope you join so if you ever need help you wont be completely lost.

BSU9pNUWaa	I'm assuming your referring to two different drills. <br>  <br>  The dots drill is a quick drill done on a mat with 5 dots. It works on footwork by jumping to various dots as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  The latter is a huge part of football practice and development and offer many different drills. The latter itself can either be raised off the ground or placed flat on the ground. This is also used to develop footwork by jumping or running through the latter in different techniques. One foot in, two feet in, criss-cross, etc.

NIB about $800. Since there is a gun ban scare looming it will cost you about $1000. Still not worth nearly as much. $550-600 tops.<br>  <br>  Selling used all together I would pay about $900. Remember, extras don't fetch much of a return. You might want to sell seperately @ 25-35% less than retail.
3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Holding the parts together in place is crucial, but there's likely no ready made jig for that block. If you can't fabricate a jig, try a few friends to hold the parts. <br>  <br>  Also, of critical importance is a Roll Pin Punch in the correct size. Messing with roll pins without the right tool, these punches, is always hard.|`|1c0c973b392b482e30be82d985344c50aa	there is a jig that you can buy to insert and remove roll pins.|`|5sEgGWJlaa	Next time spend a little more money and get a quality part instead of a Chinese piece of crap that is out of spec|`|QNX9NET3aa	Does the roll pin have a taper on one end? That is the end you want to start in the hole. You may want to try and squeeze the end of the pin closing it as you push it in with pliers. There are roll pin punches. Sometimes if the hole is a little on the small side you will have to use one.

oDEtXTjNaa	OK 3000 are good for front players that dont use alot of paint but you going to the fill station after every game get a 4500 psi you last 2 games plus use a carbon fiber tank not steel there way back heavy <br>   <br>  <br>  THIS IS FOR SPEEDBALL PLAYERS <br>  front and mid inserts go with a 45ci or a 50ci <br>  mid PLayers can alternate from back to front so its hard to say but i'd go with a 68ci(its my position and i use a 68ci)<br>  for back players that use alot of paint to lay down cover fire i'd go for a 72Ci any bigger would just be to back heavy.<br>  <br>  THIS IS FOR WOODSBALL PLAYERS<br>  Id go with a 50ci 4500 and a 68ci 4500 <br>  i do alot of woods ball and need to last in games but i like the feel of the 50 for woodsball<br>  <br>  ok this is my personal opinion this is how i see it, the best way you can pick the right size for you is if you go to your local field and ask them to try out different size tanks(not all fields will have variety of tank size's)|`|xfRwel49aa	The 72/30 gets 900-1000 shots the 48/30 gets around 450-600 shots the weight difference kinda sucks but it may be worth if you use a remote line i would definitely get the 72/30.

Really now does anyone think Grandpa Norman can win anywhere with a real field like the Masters|`|13QSETvPaa	It would be great to see him win it.  After his near-misses at this event.  But then Norman showed us at the British Open last year how he usually plays in a major.  Three rounds god enough to be in with the leaders mixed with one that hopefully doesn't kill his chances of making the top-15.<br>  <br>  Besides, with the return of Tiger, Phil coming off a win this week, Vijay playing well last year, and a bunch of young guys, like Anthony Kim and Danny Lee (who won the '08 U.S. Am and just won the Johnnie Walker Classic.  It is hopefully going to be a good show.  Also, Karlsson has always played well at Augusta and somehow Immelman held on to win last year.  <br>  <br>  Should be fun!|`|W2bYc2ghaa	I think the Masters is set up for the modern power game now, unlike the Open championship.  I would like to see him do it but I don't think it suits his game.

2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	A lot depends on you and to a lesser extent the other guy.  As you get into the later rounds it is harder to knock someone out if you are not in good shape yourself.  Your muscles may lack the strength, snap, and resilience to do that in the later rounds.  At the same time it is easier to hurt and knock out a tired fighter rather than a fresh fighter.  If you lose the rounds and don't knock him out then you lose the fight so there is a lot of thought and a lot of strategy that goes into this and it changes from fight to fight as well as through the course of each fight sometimes.<br>  <br>  Hooks and hay-makers tire you out especially when you miss and so you have to have a game plan more sophisticated than just what you are asking here.  Perhaps your opponent takes a good shot and you can't knock him out or has good defense and movement and you never really connect flush or solidly.  I would start off by using my best weapons to establish control of the fight and dominate each round; especially the first one.  In a three round fight winning that first round really is a lot more important than in a five to ten round fight.  If at the same time it looks like you have your opponent in a bad position or hurt you may want to go for it and try and really hurt or stop him by knocking him out.  You have to be careful though not to burn all your energy and endurance on that effort because if you don't get him then you make yourself more vulnerable in subsequent rounds.  Talk to your coach about what he feels you should do and start ingraining that in your mind for your fight.  At the same time as he works with you, you should be developing a good understanding of things with him and how well you both communicate with each other.  Up in the ring between rounds during a fight a minute rest is pretty short and if you can't do that in the gym then you won't do it in a fight either.  His experience and your training and skill hopefully will be enough for you to win.|`|fgbZugDlaa	It depends on the fighter.  If he has a lot of stamina, then he can go at you with jabs all fight and never get tired.  If he is a power puncher, parry him and make him miss and then attack in the middle rounds and he should be yours.  Either way, go to the body the whole fight so that he has less wind later, that is important.
jaP6STpLaa	you could sign up for a track team. Take advantage of it- i joined when i was 16 and wished i had joined sooner|`|2gz6ad5kaa	i say start with doing 30 mins daily till u can complete the entire run without stopping.on my xc and track team my coach has to rookies do this. once they can complete 30 minutes nonstop than they can do other workouts.|`|1UID5JtNaa	You begin with an alterating jog/walk program about 4 days a week.  Each week your workout gets progressively more difficult by adding time to your run.  Once you can jog 20 minutes non-stop, then work toward reaching 30 non stop.   I think you'll notice a change after consistent training for 3 months.  You can run year round unless you live inside the Artic Circle.   Layer up.  The body generates plenty of heat.  Cover exposed areas.   I grew up in Wisconsin and with the exception of a few -20 F with wind I was always able to run.   Always run into the wind first so you finish with the wind.
GWQXdw2qaa	No, standing on the right leg (for most people) feels more stable since the right leg is dominant.<br>  Also, I believe someone once told me that right handed people are usually (not always) naturally are better at left leg splits (left leg in the air).  <br>  <br>  Therefore, people usually stand on their right leg in a lib unless its a pyramid and they want the flyers/tops  to mirror each other or there's a "tick tock" stunt etc.<br>  <br>  Edit: also, think about the  main base.  If they were right handed and you stood on your left leg, the base would have to use her weaker left hand to lift you!|`|8mSXZD6qaa	well when you stand on your right leg<br>  since it is dominant you got a lot better balance on it.<br>  thats prolly why
LAdeGGGFaa	he made a mistake i think he is letting the team know that every has a possibility to be benched if they don't work hard enough.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Naa..He said he switched him out so that the Midfield could get more action|`|8zgFyfibaa	Yeah maybe but, don't you remember el chucho ramirez said anybody could play in america he just gave somebody a chance so next time castillo won't mae the same mistake twice.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	He probably wanted to test out new players or maybe he wasn't feeling 100%.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Whoever is playing good goes to the starting 11. If your doing bad, then Chucho will say,"next to Navarette and Esqueda."|`|6uc8ROfWaa	yea prolly dissapointed|`|sx78czbxaa	Most likely. Probably because he knows how good of a player Edgar Castillo is, but recently he's been messing up. Either he's getting lazy, or the fact that he plays for America got to his head. I hope it's the first one.|`|V10DGvWSaa	no...edgar castillo said it himself that he felt he wasent passing thru a good moment and he is working in improving...i guess chucho also wanted to try a line of 4 and not 5 like his last 2 games|`|5x4MlPlHaa	NO he did it because he saw in the last two games there was no need for so many defenders.....he came out with una formacion mas offensiva.... ur going to see startin defenders are gonna be changing from game to game|`|gPQLOPFDaa	Yea most likely he is mad at him but he shouldent because every player makes mistakes he is not the only one|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Hmm thats probably why. Good observation
Cb5N6UaQaa	Kevin Durant is an All Star he just was not selected. I think he deserved but that spot waas of Brandon Roy's . It would have been difficult to knock him down from there. In the next years Carmelo Anthony will miss some more All Stars because of him.|`|dDhTMacAaa	c[: did I do it right?<br>  <br>  <br>  and Yea!|`|vzYJJCdqaa	Yah..i agree|`|OmT2BzJPaa	yes no doubt|`|NuV7IsDhaa	I think he can be an allstar in his rookie year. Man hes beast he in the last 2 weeks avg. 30 poinnts per game. So my answer is yes!|`|AA11461490	Totally|`|MPz9APZDaa	Yes for sure.

13QSETvPaa	Anthony Kim anyone?<br>  <br>  I like Tiger, Sergio, Anthony, Phil, Vijay, and Goosen.  DL III is playing better, which is good to see, <br>  <br>  My bets would have to be on:<br>  Masters @ Augusta: Tiger as he already has a few of those Jackets.<br>  U.S. Open @ Bethpage: Tiger, or have we forgetten he was the only person under par last time the Open was at Bethpage...<br>  Open Championship @ Turnberry: Now this is a tough one.  Harrington for a 3-peat?  Tiger? Norman 23 years after his first? I'll take D: Sergio.<br>  PGA Championship @ Hazeltine.  Again, hard to say.  Rich Beem won the last major here in 2002.  Time for another "unknown" to win.  Although he is well known, I'll take the youngster, Anthony Kim.<br>  <br>  There you have it.  Tiger, Tiger, Sergio, Anthony Kim.  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS.

dfBwVxXFaa	your not going to want a pistol for your first hunting trip. Your gonna need a license too, which means your gonna need to pass a hunter safety course. There are also laws about hunting with semi-auto pistols, so that limits you to a revolver. Not sure what you are hunting for, but a revolver is no good for small game, so you should stick with a shotty. It is a very versatile firearm, it will be good for small game and larger game such as white tail deer.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	If the hunting trip is a one time thing and you know very little about firearms I would recommend borrowing a shotgun.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	Your state should do a Instant background check on you and you can walk out the door with a shotgun in a 1/2 hr.That's the way it works in PA.<br>  <br>    As far as what kind fo shotgun to buy I would get a Remington 12ga pump model 870. It is a very versatile shotgun and you can buy different barrels for it .Maybe try to find a use one if you are not sure you are going to like hunting.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Well...any time you spend money on something , especially a gun, you should know what you want, as well as what you will be using it for.<br>  <br>  The questions on the sheet will be personal info, but you may have to take hunters safety if you have not already done so.<br>  <br>  What are you going to hunt?|`|uJFXbHA7aa	You may try to borrow rather than buy.  If you have no experience, you don't know what to get.<br>  <br>  Don't go and buy a cheap shotgun that you won't like.<br>  <br>  A good shotgun is worth its weight in gold.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I've been going to a Kung Fu institution for about 8 months now and I can tell you its great for keeping in shape. The particular school I attend also offers kick boxing and Brazillian Jujitsu which is a boxing form, and a ground form. So you can learn 3 disciplines on a single tuition cost. Just call any Kung Fu academies in your area and see if they offer other things.

BKg7030Iaa	You've got great hitting but need more high quality pitching.  Try to use more of your bench positions to add starters and relievers. <br>  <br>  I plugged your roster into my draft software program (purchased from Rotowire if you're interested). Here's what your team was projected to do, compared to the target numbers I try to shoot for in a standard Yahoo 5x5 team (in other words, if you hit these targets in each category, you would be pretty certain to win or come in close to first in your league). [target numbers are in brackets]<br>  <br>  Average  287 [283]<br>  Runs   779 [790]<br>  HR   208 [200]<br>  RBI  750 [780]<br>  SB   132 [140]<br>  <br>  Wins  66 [80]<br>  Saves  76 [100]<br>  Ks   1023 [1100]<br>  ERA 3.37 [3.40]<br>  WHIP 1.258 [1.24]<br>  <br>  In other words you beat or come close to meeting all of the hitting categories, but you are low on Wins, Saves and Strikeouts.  Your ERA is good. Your WHIP is a little high.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.
CZvrFqZ1aa	Height doesn't matter, in fact, being small is better for a Halfback, have a good look at some of the good halfbacks in the NRL like Cooper Cronk, Prince and of course Orford, they're not that tall, with the last being pretty damn small.<br>  Just work on your kicking game and how to get them into pinpoint positions, and also your passing game because them two things are they keys to being a good number 7.<br>  If you've got good vision then that's good, just work on your tactics and short and long passing games and also your relationships with the other players, because the half is pretty much the most important player on the field.|`|v976wfRnaa	come on man height is not an issue if u r fast and your pass and vision are good.<br>  watch thio wallcott in aresnal and wright phillips in man city they are are also short.  <br>  dont think about it and improve your skill rather than strength.|`|371249d16660f0f3a82c0e3130485084aa	League or Union?

AA11370645	I've always heard in through the nose and out of the mouth. This allows the air to be warmed and filtered by your nose. Breathing out of your mouth allows you to quickly evacuate carbon dioxide, while at the same time keeping your nose free for an inhale immediately after the exhale. I agree with you thought, this is hard to do, and I always get out of rhythm when I try to do it.|`|6a91ef17781aa668a6aafc54f2b72b02aa	in through the nose out through the mouth,  and yes it is much harder to do.  this is mainly to prevent cramping and to keep your breathing under control.  though i found that eating bananas to prevent cramping (extremely effective due to the potassium)  and trying to breathe to a beat (such as to the beat of a song you may be singing in your head, or the beat to your foot steps)  is much more effective (at least for me).  to stay energized throughout a run, eat a healthy high carb dinner (such as pasta) the night before and dont eat too late.  also make sure you are consuming plenty of water daily.
AA12170560	Piano Drills are great - so are M drills.<br>  <br>  From ready position, attack the line of scrimmage, plant and back away at a 45 degree angle - attack again and back away (same as previous direction) at 45 degrees. 3 to 4 evolutions each way.<br>  <br>  Reverse it...back pedal 5 yards, plant and attack forward at 45 degrees. 3 to 40 evolutions each way.<br>  <br>  45 degree slants with a leg crossover<br>  25 degree drops with shuttle steps and double handed punch<br>  <br>  Sprint steps<br>  <br>  I agree with tire drill for agility work...as well as ladder drills...<br>  <br>  Make sure you stretch before and after.<br>  Also include in your pre-stretch; ankle and knee rotations.|`|f3DYQgzUaa	run up and down stairs or go up and down constantly on one step , also try skipping !|`|gVkb75R1aa	Go with the ladder drill.  Go forward and sideways as fast as possible.  Using tires works as well.<br>  Another drill that works if you have a lack of materials is the high knee drill.  Get a bench and go up and touch the seat with one foot, then switch to the other foot-kind of like running in place.  <br>  Also believe it or not, I've met coaches that have their kids play "dance dance revolution."  As silly as it may sound, it is a good way to engage yourself in doing quick foot drills.<br>  Use the 5 cone drill as well, as this is a great way to practice your drop, and also a very good way to hit the line with force.<br>  And you can never go wrong with the lateral agility test either.  Stand on a yard line, go to the left 5 yards, touch the line, turn and run back 10 yards and touch, turn and run through the original line.  This is a drill you should get very comfortable with, as it is used all the way up to the college level.|`|K892W8KIaa	the way i increased my foot speed when i was boxing was jump rope. I would jump for one minute as fast as i could and count how many jumps i did. The next time I tried to beat the amount of times jumped from the last time jumped. 5 to 10 times a day with your regular workout 3 times a week. In 3 months you will have increased foot speed. Hope this helps
xfpJGBfwaa	The best martial art for you is the one that suits your body and mind the best.  <br>  <br>  Grapplers are stocky and often short, they have a lot of core strength.  Americans who are tall often like the kicking/punching varieties like TKD, or any school of Karate.  Their longer reach gives them an advantage there.<br>  <br>  My cousin loves Kung Fu and he is tall and skinny (extremely). He loves the strategy. His main concern is self-defense.<br>  <br>  I'm medium-height and stocky and I love Judo and Aikido.  I also love the philosophy.  I don't care if I can defend myself or not.  That's not to say that I can't, just that it's not foremost on my mind. <br>  <br>  What suits you?  Maybe try MMA for a while and ask, "Where did that move come from?"  when you find one you like, or that works well for you.  If after a few years, the answer is always one type of martial art, then try to find a teacher for it.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	There is no best martial art. From Muay Thai to Tai Chi, no martial art is better than another.<br>  <br>  As for what you take next, take an art that interests you and will give you what you want out of it. Best to start of by seeing what arts are available in your area and see which one has the best teacher. Now that you have training in a striking art, you should try a grappling art like Jujitsu, Judo, Brazilian Jujitsu, Maharlika Kuntaw, or Ninjutsu.|`|fgbZugDlaa	There is no "best" martial art.  It all comes from your game and what works for you.  The best martial art is a combination of the best elements of every martial art.  For example, Anderson Silva has amazing Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Karate and Boxing, along with amazing wrestling and Jiu Jitsu.  It's his dedication to all of the martial arts that makes him so dangerous.<br>  <br>  No one martial art is superior.  They all have their benefits.  It's all in how you exact your martial art.  With that said, I think a Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai base is the best way to go for starters, as Muay Thai will teach you to hit and get hit, and Jiu Jitsu will teach you a lot about position and how to damage the human body from any position.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	the best MA is the one that saves you life or limb in a real situation.<br>  freestyle karate woud be a good martial art to compliment your muay thai training.freestyle karate will teach you stand up,ground/grappling,weaons and practicle self defence.|`|AA10179458	I like Brazilian Ju Jitsu and Capoweira. It really is a personal preference.|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	The one you enjoy studying the most.|`|hSFxvwm2aa	Well that depends on what you plan on doing. For instance, if your looking for a martial art to help or incorporate in competition, you should take a look at Jiu jitsu(the japanese version is more rounded than brazilian), or Tai kwon do. If your looking for a martial art to help in real life scenarios without any ref or rules my suggestions would be tai chi and ninjitsu(aka budo taijutsu, also be careful which style you take up there are many imitators out there and practitioners that don't even understand the art) however in latter of the two it does take years of practice to be a very effective and efficient martial artist because they are real martial arts(they are some exceptions to tai chi), and a real martial art is a lifetime art.<br>  And Last but not least if your looking for hard hitting martial arts there are karate and judo(composed mostly of throws) also these martial arts can also be incorporated in mma type competition or standatrd competition.|`|tjpYieEKaa	I second the motion that there's no "better" martial art. There are simply different systems with different focuses. If your goal is to be the next winner at "contender" or just make a career as a professional fighter (not me) then take up boxing or MMA. If your goal is to emphasize self defense combatives and not be concerned with forms (katas) and the dance like moves then you probably should take up Krav Maga or one of the "reality based" systems (I warn you. Though extremely effective, the moves don't look pretty; so keep that in mind if the beauty of your art is a concern). <br>  <br>  Then you have all the different schools, some of them like contact (don't join them if you don't like getting owies) some of them don't. Some are like a "martial health club" with a lot of calisthenics  others leave that up to you and focus on technique. Either way the art is as strong as the practitioners. Imagine someone who says he practices Muay Thai but has a glass chin or has never worked on developing his strikes... (sad picture isn't it?) <br>  <br>  Just find a school near you and join them. Give them a few months and, if you think they have what you are looking for, stick with them. Whatever style you choose, train hard and you'll be very good.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Muay Thai is great. It is difficult to say which is the best, because there are so many different levels of martial arts. I think a good supplement would be wrestling or judo.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	judo as it uses every part of your body|`|mFl3gS5taa	krav maga or bjj because its a fad ma that gets talked about a lot and doesnt work in real life.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	None. It's the person behind it. <br>  <br>  You'll understand that when you continue to train and expand your horizon in life.
lECmz3SEaa	I personally use live bait such as baby anchovies.

Having been a Div. 1 football player (S. Miss) myself I know that the time is now for him to gain experience in order to be successful in this sport. In High School Junior year's are really critical for any athlete to showcase his talent for his final season. And he seems intelligent, but without experience or being a physically superior athlete, he needs to get out there and give it a shot. And he can always become a walk-on for a college football team so don't rule out that possibility. Many an athlete has taken that route and come out to become great players. And, with that being said GOOD LUCK to your friend and keep pursuing his dream.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He can, but its not something thats common.  Most people who play football, if they don't start as little kids, at least start in high school.  Theres a lot to the game that you learn by playing that you just cant get not being a part of it.  <br>  <br>  As for being a QB, its not all about throwinig a ball far, though arm strength helps a lot.  Most of being a great quarterback has to do with accuracy and anticipation.  Lets say me and you are standing in a field and passing, and we throw the ball right to each other every time.  That doesn't even constitute being an accurate passer.  Almost never will a QB throw to a stationary target.  Your WRs will be in motion and you have to throw the ball to a spot that you anticipate he will be when the ball arrives.  On top of that, you have to also anticipate where the defenders will be and make sure you throw a pass that only your WR can catch.  None of that you're going to get good at just watching games or playing catch with a friend, thats all stuff that you learn by playing, by playing with your WRs and knowing their speed and how they run a route, by facing defenses and being able to read them.  Theres no subsititute for experience, and the bad thing for your friend is that by the college level, most of his competition will have long had experience with that, while he will be starting anew.<br>  <br>  Anything is possible if you try hard enough, and being intelligent certainly helps as he'll likely pick things up quicker, but he's still got a long road ahead of him.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	You sure you aren't talking about yourself? 5'11 is a bit short for a QB. Gotta be able to see over those O-linemen.|`|UlXBL8tbaa	yes. He can go to a community(junior) college and try out for their team.. gain much needed experience at the college level then transfer.<br>  <br>   Good luck!<br>  <br>   :)<br>   ;)|`|ICOmnGIUaa	that is one of the most skilled positions and he will need a stronger arm thn that.|`|AA12170560	Of course your friend can play football in college.<br>  <br>  Race isn't the issue - it's the barriers and perceptions about race that he holds for himself.<br>  <br>  Your friend should also be prepared to play other positions as well.<br>  During the first cut phase, coaches that like what they see in a player will invite the player to try to work into a different position.<br>  <br>  So if the team he chooses doesn't need another quarterback, or he's just not what they need in that position - he may have to play another position. If he declines, he may be cut. It won't be because of his race.|`|HOYuWR4gaa	Blah if this guy is scared!!!!!! Of playin football @ a difference school cause he's Indian then he shouldn't be playin football in the first. Regardless of race if he was a leader an mentally tough I would respect an he could be my quarterback but sounds like dude is a ***** tell to get in the weightroom can man up an if he wants to play callin his black teamates thugs an white one hicks ain't gonna cut it, without me in game experience it's gonna be hard to play at the collegiate level, race dnt matter it's all about wary can do on the field|`|RLoilwCNaa	First of all get into a flag league or something where he's throwing all of the time. Anything's better than nothing. Yes he can play without high school experiance. I played college ball after never starting a game in high school and had a pretty good career as a tight end. It takes hard work, but it can be done.|`|YuAQ18pdaa	experience is prefered, as well as a recomendation from previous coaches<br>  <br>  thhis wont prevent your friend from being on te team, but he will ave less of a chance,sorry|`|CgzgTNPAaa	he sounds pretty good for never playing high school ball. his race has nothing to do with it. its all up to the coaches. good luck|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	YEs but it will be hard everyone else will know the game way better|`|8S8MqwnOaa	No.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	if i were him id just go to a shool that has a team and tryout|`|K892W8KIaa	First of all, if you cannot transfer to a school that has football, and will not be able to play high school football, for whatever reasons, here's what I would do. <br>  first i would video tape myself in the 40.<br>  next video tape throwing the football.( all distances)<br>  next i would make certain my grades did not faulter.<br>  i would then take a trip to a community college show the football coach my grades and video.<br>  if he likes you, your video and grades, anything is possible. <br>  Good luck|`|gVkb75R1aa	Of course he can play at the college level.  Many junior colleges do not make cuts.  It may be a bad idea to go into it thinking he will play QB right off the bat, but if he's open minded there is reason why he can't get some reps out there.  Believe it or not, QB is a much more complex thing than just being able to run and throw.<br>  The real question is if he wants to sacrifice going to a 4 year school on scholarship just to play football.  Those SAT scores will get him in to many schools, and there are loads of scholarships out there that he could get.
QuLapuE7aa	I agree with you, for me the real challenge that awaits the lakers are the celtics and the magic. celtics because they are still the defending champs and they are hard to beat then magic because they swept us this year in the 2 games we played them. Lakers can match-up well againts the cavs as we saw during the 2 games we played them so I think the lakers will handle them. I'm confident also by the return of bynum the Lakers can beat all teams because we are the deepest team in the nba.|`|3teWTOPqaa	I think the Celtics is a bigger threat, but that's not to say we should under-estimate the Cavs.<br>  <br>  W/O Bynum it's going to be tough to beat the Cavs, we are not going to get that super-star play from Lamar for the whole series, but Cavs biggest weakness is they are a jump shooting team, once they start missing, which on some nights you will, they are fairly easy to contain. Kobe can cancle out LeBron at the expense of scoring less, and Lakers supporting cast is better than the Cavs.<br>  <br>  Celtics big 3 is another situation, they play tough D and are consistent as hell. Rondo can roam w/o Bynum inside, which will cause problems, and through and through the Lakers still don't have a definite answer on Pierce other than Kobe.|`|A7OCbBJNaa	MC, the Magic swept the Lakers this season with Andrew Bynum and you guys don't fear them at all..|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Yeah I feel the same way.  I am more worried about the Hornets, they are crazy good and the Celtics always play us hard.  We have stopped Lebron 2 times this year and therefore, we can do it again in the finals.|`|P93I8CHtaa	im a cav fan,im not afraid<br>  <br>  yet im a bigger laker fan|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm not a Lakers fan, but I agree with you.  They are a one man show and if you contain LBJ you contain the Cavs.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Oh.|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Absolutely not!  The reason why the Cavs are so darn good is because of the Lebron James! He is the one that is doing the work in dunks, points, rebounds, and assists and so forth. Clearly he is the opposite of Kobe!<br>  <br>  Imagine the Cavs without Lebron?! I sense it would be a different team! Just like you said "one man team."<br>  <br>  <br>  Because of the "one man team," I am starting to realized there is more Lebron fans than the Cavs fans/bandwagon fans as in today!|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	No. The Cavs don't matchup well against the Lakers. Cavs can't seem to be able to guard neither Pau Gasol nor Andrew Bynum. They can be harmed by Lamar Odom too if he shows up to play like he did in their last game. Plus if Kobe takes over their no one that can deny him of getting his points. Not in the Cavs, not in any team. It would take a miracle for the Cavs to beat the Lakers in a 7 game series.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Magic and Celtics are biggest concerns to me. But we will beat Magic next time we play them even without Bynum. And celtics got good defense but we beat em twice now, dont worry much about cavs|`|884gmUZBaa	I don't fear them because they have the formula to contain LeBron James.|`|Ab1P99rzaa	HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Once you stop LeBron<br>  <br>  The end for the Cavs|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	haaaa. lets keep it that way, i love the underdog role.|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	Honestly i fear more the Lakers Defense|`|RbCry06Taa	Superman,<br>  <br>  I give your Magic big credit for beating the Lakers twice this year but I think the Magic relied too much on 3pt shooting during those 2 games. Plus, regular season games and playoff games are 2 very different things. Also, you have to take care of the East first before you land the NBA Finals.<br>  <br>  Oh and back to the topic, no I dont fear the Cavs but I do respect them. Fearless is a good trait but respecting the opposition's capabilities is also a good trait.|`|HOTtmEsgaa	To be honest, No.<br>  <br>  Kobe and Trevor seemed to do a SOLID job on James allowing him to not get in the paint.<br>  <br>  When you stop LeBron, you basically stop the Cavs. <br>  <br>  We also got the best player in the world to carry our team if need be, and no one in the Cavs roster can stop Kobe Bryant.|`|82Vo9DXCaa	i think the cavs are as much a one man team as the lakers are. Looks like you're underrating the cavs supporters like Mo Williams and Big Z, now they got delonte west back. I'm not a Cavs fan, but I think you're underestimating their talent.|`|5SxHOjWIaa	i feel like the lakers r a one man team if they dident have kobe they will probably be a 8th seed|`|UMthwrPQaa	Laker fans y'all should fear the San Antonio Spurs before you say anything else.|`|f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	If the Lakers can contain King James, then the Cavs are done.  Who else is gonna step in? Varejao?  LOL|`|65H77wolaa	not really,<br>  threat for the lakers is the<br>  Celtics,|`|Lpv6UY7Iaa	No we don't, the celtics are a bigger threat!|`|Qwx082wIaa	NO ONE CAN BEAT THE LAKERS!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  LAKERS ALL DAY|`|W6jjsiMxaa	threath to lakers are the lakers....no one can stop us now.

7FUQ24p8aa	There are a lot of things to consider with each team you compare them too. The 1989 Dodgers had Kirk Gibson (1988 MVP) injured all year. The 1991 Reds had a particularly touch division.  The Braves and Dodgers were great that year, with the Braves outlasting the Dodgers with Glavine and Smoltz. The 1998 Marlins were tore apart after their Championship to begin a profitable rebuilding scene. And the 2007 Cardinals played about what is expected.  The anomaly with them is that they actually won the WS in|`|2VYjOqnpaa	Who's in their way? The Mets?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	To be totally honest, most of those stats you have are meaningless.  I mean, they are good stats, they show how hard it is for a WS champ to repeat their success, but you can't really base their chances soley on what past teams have done.  <br>  <br>  For example, one of the teams youre using as comparison is the Cardinals, in a few different statistics.  Yes, they were one of the teams to win the WS and finish sub .500, but there were resons to that.  With the exception of Chris Carpenter, they lost the rest of their starting roataion, 4 were free agents, 3 left, 1 was injured.  With as important as pitching is, thats the type of overhaul that I think any team would suffer from.<br>  <br>  The 1998 Marlins were another one of those teams you listed, and I don't know if you remember that far back, but that was the year that had the firesale following the WS and got rid of pretty much every high paid player they have.<br>  <br>  This year's Phillies team doesn't have any excuses.  They have their stars back, they have a good team, theres no reason they shouldn't be good.  I don't think they'll win the WS again.  They'll have more competition from the Mets, the Cubs should be good again, and even the Dodgers will be good again in the NL.  You also have teams in the AL who have gotten better and will make it hard to repeat as champions.  I do think they'll be good, but not WS champions good.  Don't think the past troubles of former NL teams is going to affect their chances though.<br>  <br>  Edit:  First of all, you missed my point about the 2007 Cards.  It wasnt Carpenter playing poorly that made them dip below .500, it was losing their ENTIRE ROTATION except for Carpenter that affected that.<br>  <br>  As for why I think those past stats are meaningless is because they're really irrelevant when it comes to this years teams.  You're talking about the failures of other players and other teams, which in no way directly compare to the success or lack thereof of current teams.  I mean, if you want to go by historical data alone, one would also say the Cubs have absolutely no chance, since they haven't won in over 100 years.  Based on that, the Red Sox never would have broken their streak.<br>  <br>  I don't disagree with you that the Phillies won't win the WS, but I don't think that the old stats are the reason.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Too many stats, and most of them don't mean anything.<br>  <br>  The Phillies will be competitive and will be over .500, but, in all honesty, I think this is the year that the Mets finally get it right, and do what they're expected to do, and that's win.<br>  <br>  Last year, they won 89 games with no bullpen at all in the last 2 1/2 months of the season, this year, he went and addressed the problem, and they might have the best bullpen in baseball. That, adds 10-12 more wins, and gives the Mets 99-101 wins, and that is where the Phillies can't go.<br>  <br>  But, they could win 90 games, and get a wildcard.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	They will finish above .500 this season. BUT, they will finish second to the Mets.<br>  <br>  NL East standings: 1.)Mets<br>                               2.)Phillies GB-2.0<br>                               3.)Braves GB-6.5<br>                               4.)Marlins GB-16.5<br>                               5.)Nationals GB-24.0|`|DrT7eYvPaa	yea they're screwed as bad as ur mom was screwed last night|`|dJnRFpWWaa	It may mean that one or more peripheral players had career years offensively that they could not duplicate the following season, or a number of key players who were in the final year of their contracts all stepped up their play, or you had a very good team remain  major injury free during the key stretches during their season and that wasn't the case the following year, or the team became self-satisfied and content following a championship season.<br>  <br>  Luck and motivation have plenty to do with how successful a team will be. Motivation among some players will inevitably wane after a championship season. A starting pitcher can only pitch every fifth game. If someone is taking games off, he can't somehow fill the breach to compensate for another guy's indifference. If you're closer suffers an injury that's a tremendous blow to your chances. If an everyday player isn't playing with urgency, how likely is it that a guy promoted from Triple A is going to get the job done well enough to repeat?<br>  <br>  I don't really know the answer to your question, but it's an interesting dilemma for one GM every season.|`|wApoUG2baa	Wow lots of stuff here. As a mets fan I certianly hope so!  But, that team is young, that line-up is great and while the rotation isn't great, besides Hamels, that bull pen is great.  I've seen teams with less talent make the postseason.  Besides, I don't see them taking anything for granted in this upcoming year, unlike some teams. coughmetscough<br>  <br>  here's the other thing:  Besides the mets, who else really improved in that division?  The braves offense has a lot of holes (anderson is not the player he once was),  their starters are young but talented (Lowe exculded and glavine can't be trusted at this point) and the pen isn't overly impressive.  And how will younger guys stack up against the philly offense?  The marlins are the hanley and uggla show and thats about it.  Sure, they aren't afraid of the mets, but can they beat philly?  And for the nationals, the lineup improved with Dunn but where's the pitching? <br>  <br>  So, really the mets have improved their bullpen, braves replaced Smoltz with Lowe and Vasquez and the marlins and the nationals haven't improved enough to make a dent into the phillies.  Meanwhile, the phillies bring back almost everyone from last year's team, with the exception of Met killer Burrell in exchange for Ibanez, which is a wash for me.<br>  <br>  Regardless of trends, I just can't see them finish below .500, let alone not make playoffs.  And yes, I just made myself depressed about the upcoming season.

GswnLKtQaa	I'm not sure, I really think they should start james jones because he can run and shoot the three. moon is new to the system so it's better for him to come off the bench.<br>  <br>  diawara is a decent defender than jones though...<br>  <br>  edit:  we are missing dorell wright now also, he can help the heat because he's a SG/SF player.

"Why me?'...LMFAO!<br>  __________________________________<br>  <br>  Shut the hell up 2.0! I wasn't even dissing you or nothing. Anyways, you're not a Wade fan.

He's definitely not throwin down like Moon. However, Miami signed him with hopes that he could be the kind of defensive stopper that they just didn't have the last few seasons.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Maybe they are just introducing Moon to their system, for sure Jamario will be the starter when it's time to playoff basketball.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Yeah... Hey 2.0 open up your email so I can send you a message okay?|`|UMthwrPQaa	Because you have to understand that all the offense is run thru Wade, it shouldnt be that way like 95% of the time because it makes them so predictable, but it has to be that way because they have real number two option.<br>  But to answer your question in more detail, is that they really need bench scoring right now because they have like one of the weakest benches in the NBA, but now with Moon and Cook and Beasley they have threats coming off the bench and that is like gold in the NBA|`|NCrRvdGpaa	Hey 2.0, are you Phil 2.0 from RealGM?

Uh, last time I checked, LA Lakers had the biggest following and sell-out crowds every year, for the past 16 years. Thats long before Kobe, Gasol, Fisher, Fox, Horry, or anyone else joined the franchise. This question would better be suited for Cleveland or Boston fans. Since nobody cared to talk about them until the past 2-3 seasons...|`|HiuNSScLaa	i agree with mamba no reason to be bashing someones team the bandwagoners are in cleveland lakers have a long time good team and players and never have a reason to hate there team cause it never sucks its a great franchise full of great names as much as i hate the "**** talking fans" that they have (not you mamba) they i think are the best franchise ever and now plus kobe pau and bynum gonna be added to that great list and i think ariza if he gets the chance <br>  <br>  but look at the cavs who talked about the cavs before lebron was there no one so go there and ask this question|`|Lpv6UY7Iaa	Hahaha that's so funny, but seriously it ain't happening!|`|65H77wolaa	1 and it's you!!!!!!|`|xhHfXuKFaa	hmm...i would say 11% of are fans are bandwagoners. about 18% of the cavs fan base is bandwagoners...and 87% celtics fans are bandwagoners.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not a Laker fan here, so being completely objective, but I don't really think the Lakers have bandwagon fans.  I mean, yeah, sure, they're doing well so you'll get some, but I wouldn't call someone a bandwagon fan just because they're a Lakers fan, because I remember a lot of Laker fans being around before they even got Shaq and won the championships, before Kobe was even thought of, and I live 3.500 miles away from LA.  They're a big market and going to have fans regardless.  I mean, even when Shaq first left and they weren't that good with just Kobe, I still saw a lot of Kobe fans and a lot of Laker fans.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I would call the Cavs fans bandwagoners.  I never once saw a Cavs fan before LeBron.  I mean, seriously, how many Ilgauskas or Ricky Davis jerseys did you see back then?  I never once saw a Cavs fan before LeBron turned them into contenders, that is my definition of a bandwagon fan.

Seems his numbers are perfectly believable, bud.<br>  <br>  Apologies?<br>  <br>  And yes, it is safe, OF.  If you loaded it properly, there's nothing that can be wrong with it that will cause it to be dangerous to fire.  It'll either fire or it won't....but it'll not be dangerous to try.  My advice, cap it, cock it, aim it, and pull the trigger.  If it fires, you can clean it and store it or whatever you had planned.  Beats pulling balls if you don't have to.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	It's perfectly safe, and it should fire.

The worst thing that will happen is that it wont go off and will have to be pulled with a bullet puller, or if it is a more modern muzzleloader, just unscrew the nut on the end of the barrel and push it out the back end using the ramrod. As for the guy that commented on the weather, in my state this month, the weather was 21 degrees one day and 2 days later it hit 85. This was in a 2 day period, much less a 2 month period.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	OK I'll be nice but first a reprimand...if you're not up on black powder firs arms you get what you deserve...'nuf said! Now listen, there should be no problem firing this but make certain the projectile is seated firmly on the powder. If it doesnt go off simply either sprinkle some 4F powder, just a little either in the flash hole or remove the nipple and put it in there.Lastly if that doesnt work, pour water down the barrel and let soak for 15 minets and use a ball puller to remove projectile and clean gun.

AA12170560	My guess would be that on your team, everyone plays and your coaches don't presume the outside passing lanes to be a threat.<br>  There isn't much other position for tiny, wimpy, terrible dude to play.<br>  <br>  If you have a better place for them to play - suggest it to your coach.<br>  <br>  On our team, tiny, wimpy, terrible dudes get to pick 2 of the following:<br>  special teams<br>  depth for wide receiver positions<br>  practice quarterback|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Depends on what you're talking about, as in what level of play.  When I look at college and pro ball, the CBs are usually very athletic players, they're not the biggest, but they're usually among the fastest.<br>  <br>  I guess one of the reasons could be that, if they're "tiny and wimpy" as you say, where else can you put them.  Assuming you're talking about high school football, most high school offenses I've seen are more run heavy than pass heavy, meaning your CBs will be less involved in the play than your other positions. <br>  <br>  For example, if a person is undersized, where can you put them.  They obviously arent big enough to play either line.  You need someone with a good arm for QB.  You need people who can catch for WR.  You need to have some strength to break tackles to be a RB.  You need to be able to take down a RB to play LB.  So whats left, defensive back.  Granted, having a bad DB can result in giving up the big pass, but in order for that to happen, the QB has to make a good throw and the WR has to make the catch.  More chances for them to screw up even if your DB plays poor coverage.  Its most likely a result of "where will they hurt me the least"|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	1. Your presumption is wrong<br>  <br>  2. CB's don't need to be big, or necessarily fast to do their job.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	your league is probably young kids right? not yet high school when you get to high school youl notice the CBs will probably be two of the best athletes on the team unless its a crappy high school league with no passing
AA12170560	Know what I think...<br>  <br>  I think I'd like tickets to see you play; because with your positive, confident attitude - you WILL play.<br>  <br>  Here's what else I think: I think you should call Texas Tech and talk to the coach. Even better, if it's close by, visit the coaching staff.<br>  <br>  Sure, you can try out for a collegiate team.<br>  Contact them first and see what they think before you go through the matriculation process.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't happen the way you want it, there are still semi-pro options out there.<br>  <br>  I hope you continue to follow your dreams.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	In all honesty, its gonna be hard.  I love your enthusiasm and your determination, but playing RB/WR is going to be VERY difficult for a girl, because, well, like you said, those guys are huge.  WR may be a little easier, because CBs are usually a little smaller, but being a RB and dealing with DTs and LBs, you'd be squashed.<br>  <br>  I'd really like to see what happens with you though, because you do seem to be determined, and ya never know.  I just hope you don't get really hurt playing.

Keep at it and perhaps you will accomplish the 'near' impossible.|`|e4ekb1amaa	Good luck. You're going to need it.<br>  <br>  You're a small person, and you have a long road ahead of you still. Will you even be able to play in high school? <br>  <br>  At the moment, you may be one of the fastest and even strongest players on your team, but you're neglecting a lot of gigantic factors...<br>  <br>  1) Women mature faster than men. You're already probably as tall as you're going to be, and your frame will reach its "peak" at a younger age. Those boys are starting to grow a lot faster, and on your high school team, they'll all be much bigger and stronger than you. <br>  <br>  2) You're in a small pond. Each level "weeds out" many people to get the best athletes and competitors. Right now you're playing for an elementary school. You're only the 5th fastest on your team. When you join a high school, you'll not only have the best kids from your team to compete against, you'll have the best kids from however many contributing districts to compete against. In elementary/middle school, I was the best player in the league, and I played safety and runningback. I also was probably one of the fastest and strongest in the league. When I hit high school, I was not the best at either of those positions in my school (much less my conference or state) until my sophomore year - the older players were simply bigger, faster, and stronger than me. It took a lot of hard work for me to become a starter, and much more work for me to get named to the all-state team. Being a woman will only make it harder. <br>  <br>  3) Your numbers mean nothing. Yes, people emphasize them a lot here, but realistically, bragging about your 40 times to strangers on the internet is pointless, and the fact that you're in 8th grade confirms that they're pointless - they weren't officially collected, and I'd be willing to bet that over 75% of 40 times done by anyone who isn't a college coach or official scout are off by as much as half a second, and 50% are closer to being off by a full second. In any case, your "measurables" won't mean squat on the field, especially at the high school level - the best football players will start. <br>  <br>  4) It takes a lot of skill, and a little bit of luck to be recruited to ANY college, much less one with a stellar program. Guy, girl, whatever, this is the case for everyone. Many high school players are ignored for a myriad of reasons. I didn't get recruited by any teams I wanted to play for (I was by a couple of really good football program schools, but I focused more on academics, and other than Ivy league schools, many I wanted wouldn't give me the time of day for some reason). I ended up having to walk on to a school's team and earn my scholarship, even though it was a D I-AA school, and I had full ride offers from some D-IA schools. It isn't always about pure skill - it's about getting noticed and going to where you're needed. <br>  <br>  So best of luck to you. Is it impossible? No, it's not, but the odds are definitely against you - I don't know of any girl who made it to D 1A (although I want to say Joe Thomas's or AJ Hawks or someones sister was a borderline candidate), so you'd have to really be a very, very special player to make it. I wouldn't hold my breath, but there's also a first time for everything.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	I like your optimism and all. But I'd oppose you all the way. I don't think its fair for a woman to be allowed to participate in mens sports. I don't mean football is for guys only but I mean guys and girls teams should remain that way, guys and girls. The reason is if you'll allow girls to join a guys team then that means guys should be eligible to play in girls teams, and in no time the girls teams will become guys teams. So just keep it separate. Its like that thing where that girl who was 16 at the time wanted to play in a mens pro golf tournament.|`|luYkDhOraa	kickers are real positions. and theyre are a lot of 5'2 125 pound BOYS that have a dream of college ball, and are denied because they are to small.

You are already halfway there just because you believe in yourself.  Don't let anyone take that away.  <br>  <br>  Second, it is going to require a lot of work.  You will have to develop a lot of upper body strength and quickness.  Its good that you are fast at such a young age, but quickness is probably more important (especially for the positions you are talking about).  You need to develop your hands so that you can catch anything even remotely in your area.  <br>  <br>  You are starting in a disadvantage already due to your gender.  As one answerer already stated, this is a men's sport.  Well that's only because most women don't want to play so don't let that drivel get you down.  Also, your size may be a problem even if you grow some.  You might want to think about going to a junior college or another small school before transferring to Tech.  That will allow for greater development of your skills and prepare you for the competition level in the Big 12.  One more thing to consider is positions.  Don't discount defense, especially corner back.  It is usually more fun to be on the giving side of a hit :)<br>  <br>  The most important thing that you can do is be yourself.  If this is what you want then go do it.  Don't let anyone tell you that you can't or shouldn't, but never compromise your self or your values.  Good luck, I hope you can make your dreams come true.

d0bd239f3c115d58ab2ab71d96618ad2aa	The Queensland Government has already changed the law to allow ANYBODY the option to ride on the foot path. There are of course provisos attached.  It has been working quite well with a lot of beginners gaining their confidence on the footpaths before venturing out on the roads.<br>  <br>  See s250 and s288<br>  <a href="http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/General_information/Cycling/Bike_user_guide/Road_rules_for_cyclists/" rel="nofollow">http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Gen...</a><br>  <br>  This is, in my opinion, one of the most sensible law changes. No longer do you need to risk life and limb to travel the many places that are not designed with bicycles in mind.

fUDlbOP0aa	if you search ".22LR lethality" in Google, the first result should answer your question. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=504301&fpart=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthre...</a><br>  <br>  basically a test on .22LR penetration up to 300 yards, using a turkey and 3 layers of clothing over it. <br>  <br>  the bullet at 250 and 300 yards was able to enter and nearly exit the turkey, about 7" of bones and meat. If this was a headshot or a shot in the vitals in a human, the shot could be fatal. <br>  Could be fatal means that it may or may not result in a death. There has been kids and various people who's been shot multiple times in the head at extremely close to point-blank range with a .22 and lived without any brain damage. One such true story appeared in a Reader's Digest magazine a number of years ago. <br>  <br>  The bullet will only be fatal if it hits where its aimed. in the forum post it mentions its a 80 moa drop at 400 yards, a good ways down, probably around 50" drop. a 200 meter shot with ironsights would be extremely difficult add shooting from a boat that's probably moving in the water and a soda bottle as a crude suppressor, its pretty much luck if the character would be able to hit his mark at all. At 200 meters range its much more plausible if the shots were taken from a bench rest and with a good scope. Even that its not the type of thing a normal person could do (I haven't seen the movie).|`|kQSSz2X2aa	If you are wondering weather a .22 is lethal or not you just need to look at the Bobby Kennedy assassination. As long as the shot is placed correctly, a .22 can be lethal. Also, many mobsters prefer a .22 to commit their crimes because a .22 will often penetrate the body and not exit. This means that all of the energy from the bullet is transferred into the body this making any internal organs it comes in contact with look like hamburger.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	There is no such thing as a 'non-lethal bullet'Even a .22 has enough<br>  energy/velocity to pass thru an average torso at 150 yards.Alethal shot at 200 yards is not impossible,if the bullet hits the right place.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	he probably:<br>  1. modified the bullets to be more solid, thus having more penetration and having a better chance of being lethal.<br>  2. did you notice their weren't any headshots? this is because he was aiming for exposed weakspots on the human body like the neck, where you can hit a nerve or blood vessel and kill the person quickly and efficiently.<br>  this is mostly fiction anyways, those shots were so incredible that it could never be really done, too many variables and the movement of the boat, I'd give the chances of it in the 100's of millions to one, and he did it twice!|`|CFQbdDRNaa	I thought he was about 100 yards but its been awhile since I've seen the movie.A shot placed in the right spot with a 22 LR would easily kill a man.The preferred weapon of the mob was always a 22 since ballistics aren't good  to trace on that round.My dad hunted with a 22 for deer for years with good success.MI6 uses the 22 in their silencers at about 50 yards ....so yah , sure it can be done!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes to it being Lethal, but for someone to accurately terminate three (3*) people in a row consistently, or consecutively is unrealistic under the conditions portrayed in the movie.*|`|dpSr0icwaa	the 22LR is not terribly lethal....yet it has managed to kill a LOT of people.<br>  <br>  I'd not count on anyone hit with a 22LR from a rifle at 200 yards dying quickly or quietly, but yes, it can definately kill, especially if you deliver multiple hits to the head|`|VP48PjM9aa	One of my favorite movies.  I think the rifle you are referring to was chambered for the .22-250 Rem.  It will be lethal at way more than 600 yards.  Never underestimate a fast moving little bullet, they are deadly.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Yes, the .22 is lethal at that range.  In fact, suppressed .22 LR weapons have been used for years by security forces at the Olympics.  The idea is that they can take out a threat without causing panic.|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	i shoot 200 m with my .22 all the time. a bullet is a bullet. if you hit someone in the head from that far it would still have potential to kill. it's just as powerfull at 2m as it is at 200m|`|TtMKPBR3aa	really now... do you need to be reminded that movies are just made up stuff!|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Didn't see the movie but the old .22 LR shell boxes bore the disclaimer:<br>  <br>  RANGE 1 MILE BE CAREFUL<br>  <br>  That was then when .22 LR hollow-point ammo was the most lethal type of .22 ammo you could buy and even the .22 Long and .22 Short ammo boxes bore the same disclaimer.  Today we have .22:  Mini Mags, Yellow Jackets, Stingers, and who knows what else, hyper-velocity type .22 Long Rifle ammo.  Can a .22 Long Rifle bullet fired out of a bot-action rifle kill at 200 meters?  Sure it can, either by accident or by design (in a hands of a good rifle-man).  Will a pop bottle suppressor significantly muffle the sound of a .22 shot?  Efficiently, only in the movies.<br>  <br>  H|`|9Rt93HJ3aa	Never seen the movie, but I know that .22 rounds are very lightweight and can travel extremely fast and be lethal from a distance. Now, depending on wind, humidity, and such it will lose power slowly, but it can still penetrate.|`|fVfXWp1Paa	Extremely unlikely, but within the realm of physical possibility.|`|AA11162346	Having grown up on a farm and living off of the meat of the animals we raised for food, I would say the lowly 22 gets no respect. I have killed or have seen killed, animals that weigh a thousand pounds with the 22. Cows, pigs sick horses and every other farm animal or pest, coyote wild dog,etc.you can think of.<br>  The kills were all very clean and quick with a shot to the head.<br>  The ammo is also quite important. The larger animals need to have a denser bullet for better penetration . A jacketed round. Anything smaller, just about any round will do the job.<br>  The 22 gets my respect and attention because I know first hand what it can do.Don't make the mistake of underestimating this little killer.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Pure Hollywood!<br>  <br>  According to the ballistics tables I have on hand, the best .22 LR has 95 ft/lb of energy at 100 years.  That is enough to kill with a properly place shot.  But at 220 yards, it would take a helluva rifleman to make a head shot with a .22, and that is the only way a .22 would have much chance of killing a man at that range.<br>  <br>  Yeah, the Mob has often used a .22 for assassinations. But there is a big difference between shooting some one in the back of the head at powder burn range than making a killing shot at 200 meters.<br>  <br>  The .22 LR is also popular with poachers killing deer, but most of the shots are taken at very close range in the night while deer are dazzled by a spotlight. It is neither legal nor sporting to hunt deer with a .22 rimfire.<br>  <br>  Doc
39zXLixDaa	it was more a blow to professional wrestling... Hollywood refusing once again to acknowledge professional wrestling as an entertainment entity. I haven't seen the Wrestler, but it would be nice for the industry we care about to get some recognition.|`|W6uJFb9oaa	I am very sad. I have been a Mickey Rourke fan since the 80s. I saw The Wrestler, and as always, Mickey did an extraordinary job. I have not seen Milk, but you can't overlook the fact that is *is* Sean Penn, and it is about a heavy political issue that is weighing on this country. I do believe that the award should go to the best actor in the role, and what the movie was about should have no bearing on the best actor award.|`|YyEOi1Tpaa	I have to admit I was kind of pissed about him not winning but glad he didn't bcause this would have opened to more movies about wrestling and that is not the most sane idea for a movie to make it about someone who beats the s*** out of people for a living|`|877b51cb2afa65e2a996aa8fe5885d12aa	Mickey Rourke did well in the Wrestler. I guess its a little sad he didnt win. The movie in general was sad.. and the ending sort of leaves u hanging..|`|Xkm4PstOaa	I love to watch movies, especially good ones.  And I think that the Wrestler was a great movie.  Not only was it well acted, but it was about something I love...wrestling.  While I would have liked for Mickey Rourke to win; I think that Sean Penn was deserving of the Oscar.  And anyone that says otherwise, obviously hasn't seen Milk.  Penn was superb...<br>  But welcome back Mickey Rourke!!|`|41WXZPnCaa	Sad<br>  <br>  Really I Saw <br>  <br>  The Wrestler<br>  THe Curios Case Of Benjamin Button<br>  And Slumgod Millionare<br>  <br>  And<br>  <br>  Rouck's Actuation Deserv's The Oscar<br>  <br>  Also Was Mickey's Return To The Movies After 9 F'n Years|`|plhLIIeAaa	I saw the one movie that everyone else on Earth saw. Batman. The acting by Ledger was freakin fantastic. I didn't see The Wrestler, so I cannot make a decision on whether he should have won, or he shouldn't have won. The Academy Awards will never give an Oscar to anything that doesn't have Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Opie the Director, or Tom Hanks. <br>  <br>  Weren't we supposed to have Jericho attack Rourke at the ceremony?|`|a0RgVoScaa	I would have liked to seen MR win anyone but Sean Penn.

Sean Penn was promoting gay rights...|`|2qjIcSY6aa	pissed off because he had the performance of a freaking lifetime in the wrestler. instead they give it to fricking Spicoli, who wins because he has so much courage playing a gay man in a movie. I hate hollywood.|`|rBC2YLdNaa	Milk was a great movie, but Josh Brolin and Dennis Quaid were the ones who kicked *** with their acting.  I'm pissed about that.

Can't blame them if they weren't born during a time with those great wrestlers. I was only around during the 90's, but I try to dig up old wrestling material wherever/whenever I can. I've watched stuff from the 80's, but that's pretty much all I can find these days.|`|a0RgVoScaa	Maybe because their too young to remember them...|`|4eQqTiYwaa	because most people didnt watch wrestling that long ago|`|39zXLixDaa	it is sad that people are unaware of the pioneers of pro wrestling. i started watched wrestling in the 80s, but i still know of people like Georg Hackenschmidt.

b7JS16dyaa	It seems highly unlikely. WWE just did that to start his rivalry with Matt and to shut up his crazy fans. It could happen again, but I think WWE is afraid they might have to release him during a reign. He's also not exactly gold on the mic. Hopefully, they look back at his first reign and realize he didn't screw up.<br>  <br>  P.S.

gVkb75R1aa	The Colts are really looking to fill 3 holes in the draft.  They will be looking first and foremost at defensive tackle, then looking for a speedy WR, and also looking to patch up that O Line.  If one of the top 3 (Maclin, Crabtree, Harvin) fall to the Colts way down at 27 I find it hard to imagine they won't bite.  I do think that possible selections here would be at DT SenDerrick Marks out of Auburn, Tyson Jackson of LSU or Peria Jerry out of MSU.  At O Line it is possible to grab Alex Mack out of Cal or Max Unger out of Oregon.  <br>  Wild card-watch to see if Aaron Maybin out of Penn State is still around, they just may go after this freak talent.  Though he is young, he is very versatile and could make a lot of plays for new defensive coordinator, Larry Coyer.|`|r0HYuHubaa	They need a WR. Marvs gone...And we know they need playmakers on offense to go with Peyt...<br>  <br>  Id luv them to pick up a big defensive player...They are small on D|`|VTN4Qun9aa	Their biggest need is definitely DT.  Lack of talent at DT has been costing them for years.  They'd be lucky to get Tyson Jackson out of LSU or Peria Jerry out of Ole Miss.  Ron Brace out of BC is a possibility, but I think Fili Moala from USC is a bit of a reach in the Colts' first round spot.<br>  <br>  However, since this is a bit of a weak year for DTs, they might decide to address some of their other needs: they could use upgrades at several spots on their offensive line and at linebacker.  A little more depth at WR wouldn't hurt, either.|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Analysts say Percy Harvin but that all depends on what we do with Marvin Harrison. I think it's important at this point to address the defense because that's what has hurt us most in the important games. Our offensive line need to be worked out as well if the guys we drafted last year aren't going to contribute.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	Wide receiver should be a high priority for them.  And this is a deep class for offensive linemen.  The Colts could definitely use some depth there.  Manning really struggled early in 2008 when the offensive line was beat up with injuries.

And you won't be bored doing it either.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	ANY martial art will get you into shape. Find the ones that are available in your area and find the one with the best teacher. A quick Google search will tell you the martial arts schools in your area and what their martial art is about.|`|fgbZugDlaa	Jiu Jitsu.  I think that will get you in the best possible shape and is very female-friendly.  You'll work the weight off at a comfortable pace and get in great cardio shape.<br>  <br>  Plus, it truly is the best martial art for protecting yourself from a bigger, stronger person.  So, go for it.  Train some Jiu Jitsu, you'll love it!<br>  <br>  Edit: The person below me selected kick boxing and I gave it a thumbs up, but...  That is more of a work-out than a specific martial art.  A specific type of kick boxing you should train to get in wicked good shape would be Muay Thai.  <br>  <br>  Don't take Japanese Jiu Jitsu.  It's for stronger people and Brazillian Jiu Jitsu is designed for a smaller person or girl to be able to take out a much larger opponent.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	16 is a very good age to start and any martial art will help you lose weight(except maybe sumo,lol.) and help you with a healthy lifestyle.of cause it takes more than just training you will also need to look at your whole lifestyle and eating habits and make changes.<br>  i would suggest you take a martial art that will help you defend yourself especially since your a female.i would suggest freestyle karate or japanese ju-jitsu.|`|AA10069553	I would go for BJJ (Brazilian Ju Jitsu) because it will give you good cardio, will help you in some self defense, and there are always BJJ competitions someplace if you wanted to.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	You should try out capoeira, it's more of a dance martial arts and is more playful. It will work everywhere on your body. People believe it's ineffective in combat; but it'll help you with dodging and reflexes in the long run. It's a very demanding sport, but it's pretty fun depending which instructor you go for.<br>  <br>  All martial arts will help you get in shape, actually. As for Tai-Chi... that'll take a while. Take a look at schools that'll have classes at least 3-4 times a week without charging 100/month. Also, look for an instructor you will enjoy! Because without a good teacher, it'll be difficult to apply what you learn for yourself.|`|niztxto9aa	Your answer is a bit of trick question. Do you want to get into shape or do martial arts? If it's getting into shape you want to do and lose the weight, running is the way to go. Any type of cardio. Run on a treadmill with a sauna suit on and you'll drop weight very quickly due to all the extra sweating. Mix in other types of cardio work and you'll get back in to shape in no time.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	MUAY THAI KICK BOXING OR SOME SORT OF KICKBOXING IS EXCELLENT WAY TO GET IN SHAPE AND LEARN THE MARTIAL ARTS.

AA12170560	You could easily wiki this, but since you didn't I'll give you my version.<br>  Try to keep in mind I'm a 49er fan for life.<br>  <br>  Bill Walsh (Former 49er head coach) is the father of the West Coast Offense. He had no idea it would ever work and he utilized it for an entire season before the press asked him about his unusual game plan...boxed in...he just threw it out there that it was a West Coast Offense...<br>  Keep in mind a successful coach with an origional concept is a genius...a losing coach with a novel idea either reverts to something successful or he finds another job.<br>  <br>  The West Coast OffenseIt wasn't just about short passes, as some want you to believe, it's about gaining 4 or more yards per play...<br>  using the clock to your advantage...<br>  capitalizing on controlling the ball...<br>  keeping the defense guessing and steering clear of age old traditions like passing on second and long.<br>  <br>  - short passes and out of bounds to stop the clock...<br>  - short passes and staying in bounds to keep it running<br>  - alternating sides of the field and using the wide side as the "12th man"<br>  - simplifying the passing tree and utilizing multiple receivers (to include running backs).<br>  <br>  So the main idea was short outs and ball control (knocking out 4 yards per down)...keeping the chains moving and dominating the clock and possession time.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps|`|gVkb75R1aa	Hard to put an exact answer to that question, since so many offenses run a version of it today.  As it started out, it was an offense based on short controlled passes to take place of the run first mentality.  Bill Walsh brought this to the 49ers and revolutionized the NFL's offensive philosophy.  Typically you have possession type receivers to catch and run the ball on shorter routes, instead of fast guys that stretch the field vertically.  Also you would have more of an all around style of back that can catch and block, instead of just having your typical bruising I formation back.  <br>  But, like I said before, everyone runs a hybrid offense these days.  If you don't take a little from a bunch of different systems you become too predictable.  The west coast offense is to the NFL what the spread offense is to NCAA football today.|`|5a1aa56c6591c1edf54e7a20cf077fc4aa	an offense that west coast teams run!!!  DUH!!!  lol just kidding they already explained it.... It was formed by Bill Walsh and the 80's 49ers teams|`|r0HYuHubaa	google it...|`|BzSmD7LNaa	Pass happy. That's all you gotta know.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, the West Coast Offense is more an overall strategy than a specific type of offense.<br>  <br>  Pretty much, the West Coast Offense focuses most of thier plays on short and quick passes.  It requires a very accurate QB, since he'll likely be throwing short passes to WRs who will be closely defended, and it requires WRs with very good hands, since, again, they'll be running a lot of short routes and they'll have DBs covering them tightly as well as a lot of speed on the passes they're catching, due to them being short.<br>  <br>  The advantage to the WCO is that the short quick passes are used to open up the running game and the deep passes.  Generally would be done with a lot of 3 step drops and quick releases.  <br>  <br>  The reason its so hard to give an exact definition of the WCO, is that many teams have used their own versions of Bill Walsh's original WCO.  Teams have played around with going single back, shotgun, etc.  Theres really no one formation that constitutes WCO, and in fact, they actually run a lot of the same plays out of many formations.|`|UxooffHZaa	Lots of short passes.<br>  <br>  (that's my short definition)<br>  It can be longer. There aren't as many long passes, nor as many run plays called in the West Coast philosophy. Short passes take up the role a running game normally would. You therefore want an accurate passer (arm strength isn't as important) and athletic receivers who can make yardage after the catch. In WC offenses, running backs often have to make a lot of catches.

There's an order to which the muscles fire for each of these events, and our muscles typically 'learn' and become good at only a few particular sequences.

(apparte Thomas...nn lo vedo bene vicino a MJ)<br>  Vediamo...:<br>  <br>  1)  Playmaker:<br>                                EARVIN ''MAGIC'' JOHNSON :<br>   forse il giocatore + forte d sempre ( ke supera anke MJ...forse...), un giocatore universale, un grande, lui era un playmaker puro d 2.05, i migliori contropiedi d sempre, ma non era quello ke faceva la differenza, era il suo grande cuore e la sua grinta...<br>  ...addirittura nei playoff in cui mancava Kareem (nn ricordo l' anno), lui ha giocato da centro !!! Era addirittura ambidestro in campo. Conosco una storia... Earvin a circa 13 anni d età andava a fare la spesa con la madre, con il braccio destro teneva la busta della spesa e con quello sinistro palleggiava !!<br>  <br>  Come secondo play sceglierei JOHN STOCKTON, non il secondo d sempre, ma mi serve X fare il quintetto con Malone.Però PRIMO d sempre in ASSIST e palle recuperate, era l' artista del pick and roll, ma sottovalutato come tiratore.<br>  <br>  2)  Guardia:<br>                             MICHAEL JORDAN:<br>  E' quasi d' obbligo sceglierlo (sottolineo ''quasi''), forse ( e sottolineo ''forse'') il migliore d sempre. Servirebbero pagine X descrivere una parte d quel giocatore ke è stato, ma cercherò d farlo in poke righe. Questo uomo ha vinto 6 titoli NBA, ha + d un record sul guiness dei primati: Xesempio ha la media + alta d punti in carriera (mi pare 30.1 !!!), insieme ai Bulls, in una stagione hanno totalizzato addirittura 72 vittorie ( su 82).<br>  Anke lui giocatore universale, eccezionale in attacco...e altrettanto in difesa. La sua presenza in campo si sente,crea il gioco con i compagni , quando gli si kiede d segnare, lui segna, sempre...<br>  Famoso X i suoi Tiri allo scadere, alcuni fondamentali, e altri ancora d +. Addirittura nel 98 ha vinto un titolo contro i Jazz con un solo tiro allo scadere... AMAZING...<br>  Famoso anke X i suoi crossover, ma soprattutto X la sua elevazione: AIR JORDAN...questo nome nn è stato dato a caso:<br>  Vi consiglio d scaricare i video d MJ...nn c sono parole X descrivere...<br>  <br>  Come seconda guardia sceglierei...GEORGE GERVIN (The Iceman), che servirebbe X conferire maggiore atletismo al duo Stockton - Malone.<br>  <br>  3)  Ala piccola:<br>                                LARRY  BIRD:<br>  Mi serviva X finire il mio "Dream Team" Xsonale...hi, hi, hi...<br>  Larry Bird era... un criminale: ogni sera ''minacciava'' la tripla doppia ed era un tiratore ''illegale''. Skerzo...<br>  In realtà era un' ala piccola proveniente dal ruolo di ala forte(data la statura 2.05-2.07). Era infatti in grado d giocare vicino a canestro, catturare 10-11 rimbalzi a partita e passare la palla con l' istinto d Magic. La sua qualità + grande ovviamente il tiro da fuori...<br>  <br>  La seconda ala piccola è RICK  BARRY:<br>  Un giocatore che aiuta la seconda squadra a aumentare la Xcentuale da 3 punti.Ed è un grande passatore con una tecnica incredibile.<br>  <br>  4)  Ala forte:<br>                            DENNIS RODMAN (lo faccio giocare da ala forte)<br>  Un lavoratore incredibile !!! Rimbalzi e lavoro sporco, e con le sue stoppate accanto a Olajuwon ... pensate ke difesa !!!In + ha giocato insieme a Michael e questo aumenta la confidenza fra i giocatori ke si conoscono bene.<br>  <br>  Come seconda ala forte sicuramente KARL MALONE: il secondo realizzatore d sempre.2 titoli d MVP nella Lega, 2 (3 con l' ultima nel 98) finali Xse X colpa del signor MJ. Mi serve X fare il quintetto insieme a Stockton.<br>  <br>  5)  Centro:<br>                            AKEEM OLAJUWON<br>  Il + grande stoppatore d sempre... Insieme a Barkley crea una barriera difensiva sotto canestro insormontabile X quasi Kiunque.<br>  Non il + forte d sempre (+ forte Kareem), ma quello ke serve alla mia squadra.<br>  <br>  Come ''secondo'' centro è obbligatorio scegliere il sig. Lew Alcindor, anke detto KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR !!!<br>  Non c sono parole X questo giocatore... no, aspetta, ce ne sono miliardi !!! Basterà dire ke è il + grande realizzatore d sempre ???Non so giudicate voi...<br>  <br>  Hai dimenticato una cosa da chiedere: L' ALLENATORE !!! <br>  Sempre rimanendo fra i 70 e i 90 io dico PHIL JACKSON X il primo e PAT RILEY X il secondo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bene... ricapitolando:<br>  <br>  1)     Magic Johnson               -   John Stockton<br>  2)     Michael Jordan (cap.)     -   George Gervin<br>  3)     Larry Bird                        -  Rick Barry<br>  4)     Dennis Rodman             -  Karl Malone<br>  5)     Akeem Olajuwon            -  Kareem Abdul Jabbar (cap.)<br>  All.         Phil Jackson                     - Pat Riley                          <br>                                       <br>  <br>  Questi sono 2 quintetti molto diversi...non ho fatto il primo quintetto, + le riserve. Mancano molti grandi campioni, nomi come J.Erving, P.Ewing, M.Malone, K.McHale, S. Pippen, ma i giocatori ke ho messo nei quintetti sono quelli ke secondo me collaborerebbero meglio insieme, nn i MIGLIORI. X esempio la squadra al completo dei Chicago Bulls (quelli di MJ) nn avrebbe sfigurato X niente in mezzo a questi campioni.<br>  <br>  Comunque io ho finito... bella domanda, X niente banale...ho riflettuto molto, non ho sparato a caso come altri, penso d meritarmi i 10 punti, comunque nn mi servono Xkè mi sono divertito.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                               CIAO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|caf052a27575a048bce35cc3ecc680b2aa	Oddio sinceramente non seguo e non conosco l'NBA di quel periodo però posso provare a fare un quintetto sperando di non sbagliare troppo con le date....<br>  <br>  Michael Jordan<br>  Magic Johnson<br>  Larry Bird<br>  Moses Malone<br>  Pippen<br>  <br>  <br>  Invece il mio quintetto d'oggi sarebbe:<br>  <br>  Nowitsky<br>  Iverson<br>  Anthony<br>  Parker <br>  Ginobili|`|d3c37d2dde9eec90bdd93379145c4b36aa	E' dura far di meglio ma anche questi non sono male:<br>  magic (stockton)-(thomas)<br>  jordan (drexel)-(pippen)<br>  bird     (doctor j)-(worthy)<br>  karl malone (mc kale)-(sikma)<br>  kareem abdul jabbar (olajuwan)-(moses malone)

I do think they went in about the right rounds, so you did not overpay for what you got. Take at least one in the 3rd or 4th round.  You also are pretty weak in saves.  I like to take 1 good closer, and then pick up the scraps in the middle and late rounds.<br>  <br>  Granted this was just a mock, and you are not even likely to get half of the players in your top 10 picks.  1B is really deep, so may not merit an early pick.  Choose outfielders instead, they are usually more versatile.  3B is also pretty deep, and can be a mid round pick as well.  I would also concentrate on getting proven pitching, as maybe only 5-10+ pitchers will have break out seasons and merit picking up off the waiver wire.  An of course a lot of last years breakouts will fizzle.<br>  <br>  A few pitchers are going way lower than they should:<br>  Schmidt<br>  Zito<br>  Harden<br>  Lowe<br>  Igewa<br>  Maddux|`|t9ELC44Taa	The power positions should always be looked at first...

Reyes, Jeter, Tejada, Hanley Ramirez. I could elaborate more, but i've got more lists to show you, so bear w/ me.<br>  <br>  I also try and take one of the immediate top 1B's like Pujols, Howard, Ortiz in the first round. Only way i don't take one of those players in 1st round is if Reyes is availible at-or past 4th pick. If you can get Reyes, but still need your top 1B, you go to our 2ns-tier 1B's.. Tiex, Morneau, etc.<br>  <br>  3B is clutch as well, with 3 first round 3B's = ARod, Wright & Cabrera. Also Aramis Ramirez & Garrett Atkins being availible around picks 35-45. But you can attack a top SP and OF power at this time in a draft and postpone your 3B selection with people like Zimmerman, Rolen & C. Jones taken late in the 3B realm.<br>  <br>  Hope some of that info helped.

HFgyL7Hmaa	there's a reason why we hardly see any hardcore matches... do it too often, it gets really old, tired and very predictable... do it sparingly and it will definitely make wrestling a little bit interesting...|`|AA11252878	I agree with you on this one, man. Hardcore is one of my favorite matches on the WWE for many years. The hardcore matches are great and wild! We know this is where competitors take the action out of the ring and into the other areas of the arena. Boy, this was enjoyable.

Have someone spot you heavy to start out, supporting your back and throwing your legs over for you.  As you build strength and confidence have them spot you less and less.  Eventually you will have it on your own.  Until you do, however, it's important for you to have someone there just in case you don't make it over!

mRqE9sY6aa	As a former athletic trainer, I have to tell you that you run some serious risk for hardening your growth plates prematurely. Excess weight on the joints not only put you at high risk for injury at such a young age, but they can trigger the plates to harden. Even though you can lift the weight, everytime you lift excess weight you're putting your joints at risk. I wouldn't be shocked if you potentially blow out your knee or have severe arthritis by the time you're in your mid 20's due to the pressure you're putting on your joints. <br>  <br>  Also, when your growth plates harden you will no longer gain height. So unless you like being the height of a 13 year old for good, I'd suggest you ease up on the lifting.|`|d6e9f39f369be2d631add4b60a1aec4faa	Yes that is amazing for a thirteen year old.

b32e645ca8c826d8ee9b6a28147f89b0aa	If you are looking to build muscle and strength - go high weight low reps. like 4 sets of 4 reps. If you are just looking to tone - go more like 3 sets of 10 reps at a lower weight.<br>  <br>  I've heard that you don't want to work all different muscle groups at the same time. Instead stick with upper body one day, then do lower body a couple days later, then back to upper body. Don't mix the two. The idea is you don't want your body to try to supply blood to muscles all over your body. it will slow down the recoup time.<br>  <br>  Don't lift everyday, take a rest day in between. You can do things like sit ups everyday however. But your other muscles need time to recover. Also, lift both opposing pairs of muscle groups. Best example biceps and triceps. If you only work your biceps and not tri's, your arms won't be as strong as if both were in equal condition.<br>  <br>  I'm starting a lifting program were i do 6-7 lifts in a quick 30 minutes.

7f39c3b8d67a35627790e2534e617a1faa	Impossible to do it in a paragraph. There are a lot of rules. Just watch some games. You will pick it up.|`|AA10988631	Baseball is a very complicated and strategic sport.  I've been watching it my whole life and even I don't get all its subtleties.  But that's one reason why a lot of people think it's "boring" - they don't have any idea what's really going on.<br>  <br>  The Basics:<br>  <br>  There are nine players on each side and nine innings to a game.  Each inning has a beginning ("The Top of the Inning") where the visiting team goes "up to the plate" one at a time and "bats" (offense) and a "Bottom," where the home team bats.  You can only score when your team is "at bat."  <br>  <br>  If the two teams are tied at the end of nine innings, they go into "extra innings" (as overtime is called.)  If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth inning or any inning past that, they automatically win and the game is over.  Since the visiting team bats first though, they have to give the home team a chance to score before they can be declared the victors if they are ahead.<br>  <br>  The field is arranged with an infield (which is the diamond-shaped section encompassing home plate, the pitcher's mound, and the three bases) and an outfield (the grassy area past the bases.)  The batter's goal is to stand at home plate and hit the ball far enough to get around as many bases as possible.  He gets three "strikes" (or hittable balls thrown to an area known as "the strike zone" from the pitcher - see below) to do it.  If he doesn't attempt to hit three fair balls or if he swings and misses at three or if one of the defensive players catches his ball or is able to throw it to the base he's running for before he gets there, he is "out."  (You've heard of "three strikes and you're out" right?)  If the pitcher throws four bad pitches (or "balls") the batter "walks" to first base even though he didn't get a hit.  Batters can also get a free trip to first base if they are hit by a pitch or for several other much-rarer reasons.  Each team gets three "outs" per inning.<br>  <br>  The ultimate goal is to go around all three bases in sequence and come back to home plate to score.  (That's known as a "run."  If a batter puts the ball over the fence, it's a "home run" and he and all the batters who were "on base" ahead of him score.  The maximum number of points someone can score at a time is four.  All three bases have to be "loaded" with "runners" when someone hits a home run for that to happen and its known as a "grand slam.")<br>  <br>  When a team is playing defense, there are nine players out on the field: the first baseman (who guards first base), the second baseman, the third baseman, the shortstop (who hovers between second and third base), three "outfielders", a pitcher and a catcher.  The pitcher is the one throwing balls at the hitter.  The catcher (aptly named) squats behind home plate and catches his balls if the hitter misses them.  Through signals, the catcher tells the pitcher what "ball" to pitch.  (There are "fastballs," "curveballs," "sliders,"... any number of ways a pitcher can throw the ball.)  The catcher also can see the infield, while the pitcher is turned away from it, so he is sometimes able to "throw out" a base runner from the other team when they attempt to "steal" a base (by advancing to the next one while the pitcher is distracted by the next batter.)<br>  <br>  But, as I said, these are only the VERY basics.  Strategy comes into play in almost every situation.  Should a pitcher throw a pitch that's deliberately "out of the strike zone," but may not look like it is from the hitter's perspective, to get him to swing and strike out?  Should a runner go for an extra base or stay safe on first?  There are any number of possibilities in each and every game.|`|0525a39d91f1af8426a354d87bd840b7aa	Which rule? ...Which lingo?   more info needed.|`|3abd853b1bb9f9a43f4ff5faf6b4f431aa	The object of baseball is to score more runs than your opponent.  This is done by getting a singular runner to touch all four bases.  This is done when a player comes up to the plate, or at-bat.  he gets on base by hitting a ball thrown by a pitcher to a spot where his ball is not caught before it hits the ground, or goes over the outfield wall in fair territory, or it hits the ground and a fielder catches the ball and throws to the base the runner is trying to reach before the runner reaches that base.  Fair territory is the area between the white lines that leads to the foul poles.  A player at bat can also be reached by receiving four balls before he receives three strikes - foul balls are strikes, but a batter can not receive his third strike fouling off a ball unless it was a foul tip into the catchers mitt (a glove made exclusively for catchers).<br>  The catcher is the person that the pitcher throws to, the pitcher does the most amount of work during a baseball game and the camera is often on him.  The catcher squats just in back of where the hitter is attempting to hit the ball.<br>  There are seven other fielders on defense - one for each base besides home plate (which the catcher normally covers).  Third base has a thirdbaseman, it is located on the left side of the baseball diamond, the infield area from home, to first, to second, to third and back to homeplate again). There is the second baseman, who covers the rightside of second base, the base located in the middle of the baseball diamond opposite of home plate, the person on the left side of second base is the shortstop,  There is a first baseman who covers firstbase on the right side of the diamond.  There are three outfielders, left, center, and right, that play further away from the diamond, or infield usually aligned with the bases, left field is in back of thirdbase, right field is in back of firstbase, and center field is in back of second base.<br>  <br>  This is way too long to do.  These are the basics.|`|4ed0e2d24c3296babda70295fd45f9caaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball</a>|`|9a2af682cbe06408651ff0195e7d7ea1aa	You can find it all right here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/offici...</a>|`|c90bf621d9c7399a16084ee0fd771896aa	YOU HAVE A BATTERS BOX AT THE HOME PLATE.

Instead, EA decided to put out NCAA Baseball as a substitution to MVP Baseball. Just like NCAA Football, no collegiate player are licensed in the game because they don't get paid nor have an agent (it's illegal to have both while still attending college), which comes cheap for EA Sports than saving money to pay for MLB rights.

They will help you build powerful legs by focusing on ALL of the muscles needed for jumping, not just the calves.<br>  <br>  Some examples:<br>  <br>  >Standing with your feet together, jump up and down standing in one spot.  Each time you jump, EXPLODE as high as you can and try to jump again as soon as you land.<br>  <br>  >Standing at the bottom of a stairwell, place a foot on the 2nd step and push yourself up as if you were jumping.  Reach as high as you can (right hand+left foot, left hand+right foot) but don't actually jump.<br>  <br>  To avoid injuries, always start with a warm-up (light jog) then stretch.

s2SHisTPaa	Free running is a term the meaning of which was once identical to parkour. However, after David Belle and Sébastien Foucan went separate ways, free running evolved into an art that emphasized aesthetics, and regards the grace and beauty of the movement as more important than efficiency. While traceurs practice parkour in order to improve their ability to overcome obstacles faster and in the most natural manner, free runners practice and employ a broader array of movements that are not always necessary in order to overcome obstacles.<br>  The meaning of the different philosophical approaches to movement can be summed up by the following two quotes:<br>  Experienced free runner Jerome Ben Aoues explains in the documentary Jump London that<br>  <br>      "the most important element is the harmony between you and the obstacle; the movement has to be elegant... If you manage to pass over the fence elegantly — that's beautiful, rather than saying 'I jumped the lot.' What's the point in that?"[13]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No matter what anybody says, Free Running and Parkour are NOT THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10518031	<a href="http://www.myspace.com/pgfreerunners" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/pgfreerunners</a><br>  <br>  there are a lots of clubs on myspace.  find one in yr area.
QhZUDdcTaa	First, NO PC sucks and wouldn't know a real sport if it looked him in the eye.<br>  <br>  Ok, the best way to improve your shooting power is to imagine your shot like a golf shot.  In golf, you don't just practice the swing up to the point you hit the ball, you also spend plenty of time on your backswing.  Start working on your follow-through.  Watch great midfield shooters like Gerrard or Seedorf; they always load their shooting foot way back, then unload all the way through the shot.  Make sure you're not off balance when you start your windup.  Keep your head down and your knee over the ball when you make contact.  You'll know you're putting the power behind it when the force of your shot takes your plant foot off the ground, leaving you to land on your shooting foot.<br>  <br>  That's for power.  For aim, it's all about the practice.  Once you get used to your new shooting form, try taking the same approach on five shots from the same spot and see where they end up.  You can adjust from there.  I find that the ball goes in the direction that my hips are square to.  Of course you'll have to adjust for spin and swerve, but square your hips toward your intended target and unload on it.  Four things to remember: balance your upper body, follow-through, knee over ball, square your hips.<br>  <br>  On a personal note, I'd love to hear how your progress is going.  E-mail me to let me know how it goes.|`|19b72b291e5ec51519444e80d02fcd95aa	Practice "placing" the ball from about 5 yards out in to the goal.  As you get better move further out.  In a game always try and shoot far post|`|5mENRAvOaa	i practice drop kicking it into the net, just stand like 5 feet away from the goal and drop the ball and kick on the front of your laces up into the top of the net, it helps me aim better and stuff, thats what my coach made me do when i had to practice aiming better when i played goalie|`|AA10935053	It's always the same saying, "Practice makes Perfect" Try shooting the ball 50 times a day trying to make the ball go far and aiming straight.  Eventually you will get better.  I have faith in you. :?>)|`|PxYkFSccaa	play a real sport soccer boy|`|V9oZAGTlaa	Listen to Stephen... up there, and not the others.  He answered the best and i couldn't have put it down any better myself.<br>  And remember, the reason most people miss is that they do not look up to see where the net is while they're shooting.  It sounds dumb, but that's why people miss from really close range!|`|lepPOOnIaa	I would just work on maybe making a small goal, about the size a garbage can and practicing on that.  This will increase accuracy dramatically.  Also remember Vince Lombardi's quote, "Practice doesn't make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect."  Try to practice as much as you can and hopefully it will come.|`|c0c9a7aab942015818460de815a4de79aa	Plenty of practice, ideally with a goalkeeper friend. He will benefit from the challenge of trying to save your shots too.<br>  <br>  Play plenty of practice matches, even if they are just kickabout matches with your friends. Shooting in matches can be very different to practice shots. It is about instinctive finishing and scrappy goals as much as it is perfectly struck textbook strikes.
CQ9oxJXnaa	Cena is like big bird in seseme street live.  His fans are like little kids who don't care about wrestling they just want to see him.|`|khU8m4gxaa	It was nothing to write home about, but I've seen worse. Honestly, I don't think anyone should've expected a classic between Cena and JBL. They're not exactly brilliant in the ring. But it wasn't THAT horrible. By the way, the "fingerpoke of doom" was on Nitro, the day after the Starrcade PPV. If I had paid for that, I would've kicked Eric Bischoff's a** myself.|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	agree with rated r superstar cena isnt so great anymore he should start doing freestyles on people again and make a new chain gang then he would be better maybe even unstoppable|`|vPpiHZSSaa	Seriously dude. The royal rumble was what, freaking two weeks ago. He was wrestling JBL. Don't you know he's wrestling a man thats can barely sell any moves what so ever in JBL?Did you even see his match with hbk or last night with Jericho?? At least there giving him his moves back. Jbl is chubby and slow what would you expect? At least they're giving cena more moves again like last night on raw. It reminds me of his agressive word life days.|`|sQRWdGj5aa	No, I expected it.  JBL sucks and why he continues to be in the world title picture is beyond me.  I really enjoyed the Swagger/Hardy match, the Edge/Hardy match, and the Rumble itself.  Overall, I was happy with the rumble, I knew the Cena/JBL match would suck.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Most of Cena's fans dont know the diffrence between a good match and a bad one. No offense to Cena fans but it's true.

jkXV1HMJaa	Yes, I can swear to having seen it.  I live in Tucson, and twice in the fourth quarter the game was interrupted.  The first interruption was a credit sequence to some movie that was on screen for all of five seconds.  But that second interruption with the guy dangling his johnson was more like 30 seconds.  It was disturbing, and not funny in the least given how close the game was near end.  But I swear to you, that was absolutely real.|`|sGQbF431aa	Ha ha that's so bizarre. I haven't heard about that till just now|`|v7rDq8Ydaa	I saw it live at a friend's house. It was chaos, my friend's parents were freaking out and her brother was laughing his head off.

QMveJrziaa	No, I believe WWE's contracts are all exclusive, meaning you can not work for any other promotion.|`|6E16tR6xaa	No. It wouldn't work. They have contrasting schedules and besides the other company woulsnt offer you a contract if you had one with the other company.|`|7qeHZe9Yaa	No|`|ZfGFOgrqaa	no TNA and WWE both have clauses in them that they can't sign with another company, however TNA will let then sign with japan wrestling and they are aloud to wrestle with other company with there approval.|`|qj5ZOLr3aa	No|`|h5lOMoqBaa	No, because they are competitors. It has never happened in the history of wrestling where a wrestler was under contract to two major promotions at the same time (indy promos like ROH don't count)    It would never happen because the two feds would bicker over who gets him on what night|`|H9COS7LRaa	NO!  How could they do that.    What if WWE is at Florida on Tuesday.  And TNA is in Hawaii Thursday?  It's impossible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|DjuMbOJUaa	No because u have to be with one company or the other

They became the Devils after the "helmet" rule was put in place (put in place 79-80) but not sure if they had anyone grandfathered. I don't know... if I had to guess I'd say John Wensink... he was famous for having the big fro do.|`|1035b561c3cc75bd52fa0a1ec4ef8d3caa	To play a full game without a helmet, is Martin Brodeur, he is a player during pre-season games,    a couple of minutes would be David Clarkson, dedicated he played 6 - 7 mins after losing his helmet in a big hit.    Wow in a real game, thats dating back I think Collin White i remember he played a game without a helmet  like in 2002 - 2003

HRcgM1YXaa	Hey all we could do is hope for now, because it looks like a long shot but it could happen and I hope it does, because if we get KG and DF that would be great. I think at the end it will go down because remember the owners started this discussion and they agree on it but Mchale is the one still thinking at the end he will do what his BOSS wants...... GO LAKERS and don't hate Lakers haters just becuase your team does not have a great history of championships.....|`|wgMXtO5aaa	No team will trade for KG if he has only 1 year to go<br>  on his contract. KG I don't think will agree to an<br>  extension. Like Grant Hill, he said he wanted to go<br>  to Phoenix. I think he may think about golden state<br>  since they run too and have baron davis.<br>  Dalla ? maybe not sure. But not the lakers, kobe<br>  will blame him if they lose. <br>  I think Lakers should trade Kobe for KG straight up.|`|0c89818713abfe3684652b5cfea1408aaa	lakers suck|`|w0F3NkScaa	kg  is  staying

Iran has a president with a crazy name too, but it's entirely different.    His first name is Barack and he's the President of the United States.  You know...where Pittsburgh already plays it's home games.  So the owner of the Steelers just supports OUR President.  That's pretty American I would say.    Hope that makes you feel better!|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	I like your question, it's the other people who answered it I feel sorry for.

Also Hussein was Iraq, and the Steelers are staying in Pittsburgh.|`|wSq80V1xaa	Wow.      1) WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE THINKING OBAMA IS MUSLIM???  2) You're just jealous that the Steelers won the Super Bowl and that Obama was for us.

SJ0tzbyGaa	Braun without question. He will score more runs and have more sb's then Encarnacion for sure since he is part of a high caliber offense. His rbi opportunities are good since he bats third and he'll end the season with about 15 HR's 80 rbis, 80 runs, 15sbs, and a .290 average with a .360 obp.|`|FQBOzv4Saa	didnt edwin get optioned to AAA|`|0qyqUvyWaa	ENCARNACION|`|QiUT2K8Qaa	Braun by far.

HE also hits in a great spot in the Brewers lineup( in between Hardy and Fielder.|`|rLAOzraUaa	Ryan Braun is supposed to eventually put up Miguel Cabrera type stats and he should already be close to that. In the minors he already was hitting .350 with 10 homers and a bunch of steals. Encarnocion was struggling before getting sent down, so Braun looks that much better.<br>  <br>  Braun .290 20 HRs 50 RBIs 10 SBs .350 OBP<br>  Encarnocion: .250 15 HRs 40 RBs 6 SBs .330 OBP|`|yQM6oWeLaa	I would take Braun.  He has better HR power and steals more bases,  The Reds still don't seem happy with EE for some reason, so there's no reason to think he'll be with the team all year.

8e0e7b333f633217eadaf2018a2f403aaa	I agree with those who say that Pittsburgh has way too much history to be disguarded.  I live in Florida and I can tell you that this is not a baseball state.  Tampa Bay would be better served if they looked for a new location.  South Jersey would be a great place for a major league franchise.  Colorado is a football state just like Florida.  The Rockies would never be missed.  The Royals compete with the Cardinals and that's a losing situation.  Ever since George Brett retired there has been little if any interest in Royals baseball.  You might want to add Washington to your list.  For the umpteenth time baseball has tried to force the game down the throats of the people in DC and for the umpteenth time it's not working.  Very interesting question.|`|68nuheGzaa	So, I guess any time a team goes through a losing stretch, we just eliminate the team?<br>  <br>  That's moronic.<br>  <br>  First of all, I think it is unfair to remove ANY team that has ever won the World Series.  Royals have won, Pirates have won 5 (and also played in 2 very historic ones...their 1927 team was one of the best ever but is forgotten b/c they played against Murderer's Row, the BEST team ever, and they also played in the first one ever), and the Marlins have won 2.  Off the top of my head, I don't know about the Royals, but the Pirates also still have a winning record overall for the franchise (baseball-reference.com), so there's another reason you can't say they are unsuccessful.<br>  <br>  How about we elminate the whining owners and fans of the Dodgers, Yankees, Angels, Red Sox, Mets, who won't stop whining about people pointing out the disparity of payrolls in baseball, and how it leads to an unfair playing field?<br>  <br>  Moron.|`|aade5f2559a64939d53dbd98ea721c87aa	No, where would all the other teams get their players if those teams weren't around...  :)|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	The issue of contraction is dead.  Deal with having the mentioned teams around.  The players union will have non of contraction because less teams means less jobs for the players.  Enough said.<br>  <br>  Look at the bright side, at least your team will have guaranteed wins when they play those bottome feeders.|`|7SoLuQUIaa	I would agree with all except the Rockies.  Players without much power need a place where the can hit home runs too!!|`|LU2KDMvBaa	No way. Young players need a place to start and these teams provided that. For example if Jim Thome was still in philly then we would have not ever seen Rya Howard but if Ryan Howard was in the Royals Farm system he would have made his start much sooner|`|VOCK7MUgaa	The Royals and Pirates dominated the 70's and 80's for the most part.  So you want to start whacking two historic franchises like that?<br>  <br>  Baseball is starting to fix some things with revenue sharing, but there is still a ways to go.   Anyone who says 120-200 Mil payrolls compared to 45-60 is fair is kidding themselves.  Instead of whacking some of baseballs better historically franchises how about look at more ways to even the competitive playing field.|`|h8io8bTHaa	Pirates are too historically significant.  Rockies actually have a good young core coming up.  Devil Rays are going to eventually be good as well.  Royals, that is a tough one.  Marlins are the least attended team in MLB.|`|ipBgbzqSaa	Hey some of us actually like the Rockies.  Of course if I go to another game in which they lose in 18 innings I will throw them out of the league myself.|`|s83HcHnDaa	I would so no cuz then the other teams would be bogged down with talent.  There is definetly enough talent to field 30 teams.  Maybe a cap would help the best to equal out these teams like the other major sports.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	BOOOOOOOO.  All I have to say is that I'm a Royals fan and I don't whine about it.  We're a bad team, somebody has to be.<br>  <br>  GO ROYALS!!!!!!!|`|XKoxpzUHaa	I'd ditch the Yankees.
NlIsXIdWaa	that's just not right, don't they know how hard you've been working to get up to this point?

WTF?|`|dNn1nFhEaa	Woah i wish i could do a triple axel, and i bet they thought the exact same thing, they were in so much awe that they tried to elevate themselves and lower you by making fun of you.

Who cares what they think? You'll never see them again.|`|nGGDddyUaa	ignore them, even if you fell on your triple axel, how many ladies in competition do you see attempting a triple axel? very few. so i give you a lot of props for that. i bet they are just jealous, you should also stand up for yourself and don't let them talk down on you. you are a great skater! keep up the good work    i hope you land your triple axel soon!|`|IsQckOXraa	i would roll my eyes at them and skate off like they could ever skate like that in their dreams!  but!  not 2 be a snoop or anything but 2 weeks ago u did post a question about skates for u because you said you where a beginner in pre-alpha.  No need to lie about a triple i can't even do a double axel!   Have fun skating!  :D

Whether they are a phenomenal or less than average wrestler is a completely different story. I know any wrestlers personally, so their "rumored" personalities don't really sway my opinion on them too much. In some cases it does, but not really. Respect, however is different from admiration or favoring a certain wrestler. But perhaps you could rephrase this into what matters the most. In that case I would say wrestling skills matter to me the most. If wrestlers don't work on mastering their craft, and instead put on a not so good performance then nobody wins in the end.|`|LSFSfNCXaa	A little bit of all 3 tbh,Wrestling skills is always a plus but somebody who isnt good in the ring can make up for it on the mic such as Kennedy or JBL|`|zjeNJVy2aa	All of the above are very important|`|1MdaqyL2aa	Well the now in the wrestling industry the "top" guys are chosen because of they're mic skills. but me personally would pick wrestling skills
7domw3t5aa	Well Zabs early fights didnt go that long. I dont think floyd knew he would tire the way that he did. I thought it took floyd six rounds to figure zab out. And when he did figure him out mix that with zab running out of juice it was over.|`|7qczKTv3aa	It's very well possible.  Floyd and Judah had sparred with each other throughout their careers a total of six times before that fight.  They each knew certain things about the other fighter from previous experience.  Zab knew that Floyd's shoulder roll left him vulnerable at times from straights from southpaws (i.e. Corley and Mitchell both stunned him).  Floyd knew that Zab didn't have the ring smarts necessary to make adjustments when needed.    Zab came out with a good game plan fighting aggressive and getting off first.  Meanwhile Floyd was trying to fight off his back foot, waiting to counter Zab with quick short left hooks primarily.  Zab was too quick for this and he was able to win most of the early rounds.  In my opinion Floyd simply made an in ring adjustment and started coming forward and pressuring Judah.  Judah couldn't handle the pressure, couldn't make necessary adjustments, and was mentally out of the fight by the late rounds.    I don't think Floyd knew that Zab could only fight for 6 rounds, but he knew that Zab couldn't make any mid-fight adjustments.  Floyd knew he could figure out what Zab in the first few rounds and once he did, it was a wrap.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	Well there have been a couple of fighters like clotty who were saying that they were waiting on him to tire himeself out as usual. its not big secret that zab and oscar are notorious for lasting only for 6 to 8 rounds.

NjZ9pKyfaa	Yes, that was absolutely the right move.  That move was a good one by both Dallas and Cleveland.  Dallas didn't need a franchise QB.  Although they don't have a lot of money tied up in Romo, there's still great potential there, and they expect big things from him.  He may have muffed up that play in the playoffs, but he still played very well during the season.<br>  <br>  In addition, the Cowboys don't have any huge weaknesses, and the positions they were looking at had a lot of depth in the draft, so they didn't need the pick at the time.  You may ask why they needed to trade up for Spencer later on and not just pick him then.  They had a feeling he wouldn't be taken in the next few picks...then they traded up later for Spencer because he was the last top DE they were coveting and they suspected someone else may snatch him up before their next pick.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but they got Cleveland's #1 pick next year.  The Cowboys are probably banking on Cleveland finishing towards the bottom of the league again, which is highly likely because even if they play Quinn right away, first years are always a bit rough.  With no pressing needs this year for the Cowboys, getting an extra 1st round pick next year regardless of the spot is still a smart acquisition.<br>  <br>  Overall I think the Cowboys had an excellent draft day.  I'm not surprised though because they've always been one of the smarter draft-day teams.  They really know how to analyze and make the appropriate moves at the appropriate times.|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	Yes. Quinn may turn out to be a good NFL QB but the Cowboys already have one. They have the Browns first round pick next year that could be the #1 pick over-all so yes they did the right thing.|`|GImmKXWnaa	I love what the Boys did on draft day this year.  Tony Romo actually played pretty well last year.  He completed 65.3% of his passes for 8.3 yards per attempt (compare to 65% and 7.9 ypa for Peyton Manning) so you know that he has the skills to play.  Brady Quinn is unproven and could turn out to be a bust.  And I think the Browns will be one of the 3 worst teams in the league.  There D is horrible, O-line is mediocre, and Jamal Lewis is soft now.  Dallas should have their choice of players next year.<br>  Add to the great moves on draft day that we got the next Shawn Merriman and you have to be very pleased.  Anthony Spencer was rated by many as the second best pure pass rusher in the draft.  Under the tutelage of Wade Philips (see what he did for Merriman and Shaun Philips) this kid could be special.  DeMarcus Ware will demand double teams, Greg Ellis is back from injury, and we filled the gap at safety with ex-Seahawk Ken Hamlin.  This defense will be scary.  Look for Dallas to win the weak NFC this year.  GO BOYS!!|`|74cd317b122a7c3f20d915d1a7efa3f6aa	In answer to your question, "Dallas Fans Do you think?" the answer is no, they do not think: they are Dallas fans.|`|XJv0wTsDaa	yes good choice quinn is overated anyway|`|e0c867f798fbb83437a27258528e8626aa	yes i do, i dont think Quinn is that good anyways.. Cowboys have their QB of the future and they need to build around him and not start over with a shaky QB who cant win a big game|`|7SoLuQUIaa	Cowboys didn't need to draft a quarterback.....they needed to draft a holder!!!!!|`|Anm3hEIAaa	yes, we show confidence in romo by doing so and we also get the browns 1st rounder next year,which could definitley be a top 5 pick|`|MgyKciG9aa	Definitly Yes, Dallas already has an experienced young QB in Tony Romo, they just brought in a couple more to solidify the position, and the boys get Cleveland's most likely low first round draft pick next year. Its a win-win situation.|`|rsBtsYxwaa	I would like to take this time to inform cowboys fans on how much I enjoyed watching Tony Romo sit on the ground and cry when he dropped the feild goal hold to lose the playoff game.  Tony Romo is terrible and I'm just excited to say the Sean Peyton exposed just how bad he is.  He is the most overrated player in the league.|`|xkLLatuCaa	Yes b/c brady quinn can turn out to be loser like david carr.
Ubup5J5uaa	There is no benefit of the doubt with this rule. It's been pretty clear since they started the rule over 10 years ago. If you leave the bench during an altercation then you will be suspended. They can't start choosing who they want to suspend based on prior history.|`|YybDf1dFaa	he got up.  he and amare.  during an altercation they got up.  that's the rule.  they knew the rule.  it's not a new thing.  they knew what would happen and they did it anyway.  so that's what they get.  nice guys have to live by the rules too.|`|rLAOzraUaa	The NBA knows that by not getting a technical in 4 years Diaw was building up emotional frustration that was saving up for that very moment. Duncan and Bowen, who play dirty and take out their frustration at will, were not suspended for leaving the bench because they were much more emotionally stable due to their frequent technicals. Amare was probably suspended because of his comments that were aimed at ruining the reputation of NBA superstar Bruce "the hitman" Bowen. <br>  <br>  All of this stuff probably isn't true but it makes at least as much sense as the way the NBA is handling the situation. It just seems as if everything they do favors the Spurs.|`|IaNnZ4Daaa	no one knows what Diaw's intent was except Diaw, and since when do Duncan and Bowen get frequent technicals|`|iml14P6kaa	Man you spurs fans are dumb. I guess you guys didn't get at the point of the question. If diaw leaves the bench and no fight breaks out, we say diaw (like duncan) was just checking on a team mate with no malicious intent.  If he leaves, then a fight breaks out (not much of a fight), he can either now be going to check on a team mate, or running to join in the fight. Since both are in the same direction it might be hard to tell, but we know he left the bench before raja lunged at horry.<br>  <br>  The commissioner said he wasn't going to try to look at film and disect people's intent. Well if a guy has never been in a fight, never gotten a technical foul, then I think we know what he was going to do.  He was going to check on nash, and its unfortunate a fight broke out afterward.<br>  <br>  Seriously spurs fans learn to use some logic before responding about a rule is a rule.  Duncan broke the rule, but there was no altercation, but when he left the bench (like diaw), he didn't know there might be some altercation in the future( since we can't predict what the future will hold). Thus we conclude that he was just checking on his team mate. Which is the same conclusion we can reach for Diaw since he doesn't have a history of ever fighting or getting a technical.
RkSatClQaa	I'm not gonna lie cuz that would be a waste of your time<br>  <br>  Instead I'm going to give you an honest answer<br>  <br>  It may hurt very much at first but this is the truth<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Not good... 4-12 to at absolute best 7-9<br>  <br>  Brady Quinn is a rookie QB who isn't going to make an immediate positive impact... Especially when so far in camp he's been throwing inaccurate wobblers<br>  <br>  Joe Thomas is still a rookie and it's not like he will be dominant this year. He could be solid but it takes a few years for offensive lineman to get their technique down and be able to handle the speed rushers<br>  <br>  Jamal Lewis is a nice upgrade over Reuben Droughns and apparently he is finally a 100%. He can make the jukes he hasn't been able to make for 2 years. So I think he is very capable of a 1300+ rushing season.<br>  <br>  Eric Steinbach is another nice addition and will just be another bonus to that running game.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Positives: The offense should be atleast adequate if Kellen Winslow can come back at 100%. He is probably the 2nd best TE behind Antonio Gates when is healthy. He is that good, but due to injuries he can never claim that status.<br>  <br>  Braylon Edwards is in his 3rd year and that is the "breakout" year for WRs (if history has taught us anything)<br>  <br>  The o-line looks to be pretty good. Even though Charles Bently's career is probably over. If he can come back though that would be remarkable.<br>  <br>  Negatives:<br>  <br>  The defense is nothing special, they have a few bright spots but for the most part they are either old or ineffective.<br>  <br>  They gave way too much for Brady Quinn since they are gonna be in the bottom 10 next year again guaranteed<br>  <br>  They are in one of the tougher divisions with Baltimore - 4th best team in AFC<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh - Just won the Superbowl a year ago<br>  <br>  Cincinatti - The offense alone is good enough to get them to the playoffs<br>  ---<br>  <br>  I'm trying to be optmistic for you, but there is not much to get excited about for this team.<br>  <br>  Next year they have no draft really (cuz BQ trade) so they need to have an excellent free agency<br>  <br>  They are in rebuilding mode and it will take about 2 years for them to make some true noise<br>  <br>  Although you may see some glimpses this year from some of the younger guys... That is about all you have forward to look to<br>  <br>  Don't worry though, I'm in the same boat with the Vikings... They are also a year or 2 from making some true noise|`|R1puDyBgaa	probably not good at all...brady quinn was a cry baby...he didnt do good against good teams in his college years...only bad ones...so what would he do in the NFL? and he even cried when he wasnt getting drafted...he will never survive in the NFL...|`|rLAOzraUaa	7-9, 8-8, 9-7 They will be decent, but there year is next year when Brady Quinn has a feel for things...unless Frye has a breakout season.|`|s2gRgCZvaa	even with the new guys they will finish last in the division. it is just too tough. just like the addition of trent green to the dolphins will make them a better team but they still can't beat the pats or jets. that makes me sad.|`|8C5fLvUiaa	They're still young and have some holes to fill, but they're definitely on the upswing.  '07 will be rough, I can see them winning 6 or 7 games.  After that I think it's going to be big strides for them, though.  8+ wins in '08 for sure.|`|Hz4zKcugaa	I think it depends on how "field-ready" Brady Quinn is. If he is ready to step in and play more like Ben Rothlesberger (in his rookie season) and less like Eli Manning then they should be pretty decent.|`|VDZbQ4Smaa	they will do better 8&8 go lions|`|fhhMeZR5aa	They are going to be big favorites to win the Super Bowl.|`|nol8AyMeaa	5-11 at best go pats!|`|fw7RSjUIaa	I actually just took the Browns to the superbowl a few minutes ago...having burritos for lunch will certainly do that to ya.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, 4 wins max...which is great for the browns.|`|41a325ac3c7e9a44f30b472dfc86b4beaa	haha....JustinSane<br>  <br>  you should know that as a Browns fan, you can't be optimistic<br>  <br>  they may appear to have had a good off season....but it always ends up going to Hell.....<br>  seriously<br>  you should know by now<br>  <br>  I mean........keep rooting for them.....but don't ever assume that anything they do/did will turn out well

Todos os que gostam de futebol torcem para o Corinthians, metade contra e metade à favor!<br>  O único problema do Corinthians foi a localiza??o dos estádios onde ocorrem os jogos da segundona, mas isso foi resolvido facilmente: emprestamos o motorista do ?nibus do Palmeiras, que conhece bem esses caminhos!<br>  Até agora, só o S?o Paulo e o Santos ainda n?o caíram, quem será o próximo?|`|55910859587897fae3072fe376476a8aaa	Mas o time do Corinthians já é uma piada.rsrsrsrs.|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	Piadas pra zoar corinthiano é a melhor coisa que existe.

XqMMPSgVaa	Not sure what your asking about. Was someone identified by the program and you want more info? Not sure.
AA10068004	Why would a non-Canadian not understand this question. I know who Tim Horton was but even if one didn't how hard can it be to Google "Tim Horton Autograph". Besides, driven to Toronto more times than I can recall...stopped at a Horton's once... like I said, "once" ughhh. Good defencemen though and legendary Leaf.    As for the autograph. I have seen a 3x5 index card go for as much as $1500 down to $300 on the low end.|`|axxQzOCHaa	How do you know it's authentic? Might want to get some insight from www.psadna.com|`|tR0YwMzMaa	Hmmmmm, well, i'm  not canadian but i know who your talknig about.  well, i'd say maybe 250$ to 500$. start low and work your way up. don't go past 550$ though or you might loose out on a great deal.|`|652caabf252bd3e6f762e5b1d50f090caa	If you get it on a roll up the rim to win cup it just may be priceless!
DvBPLP4saa	These were the Penguins d-men last game    Whitney  Eaton  Gill  Orpik  Letang  Scuderi    Scratches: Boucher (Goligoski played up on wing)    Tonight's D-men are:    Orpik - Whitney  Scuderi - Letang  Eaton - Goligoski    Scratches: Gill, Boucher      .....Now to get to your question.......The obvious choice would to be 'scratch Goligoski' BUT he is the best rookie defenseman in the league today, and I'm sorry....you can't prove me wrong. He needs to work on his defensive ability but God does he have talent.     Whenever Gonchar comes back I think there will be rotated scratches like there is now. Boucher should be scratched for good if you ask me. Eaton should join him, but the Pittsburgh management has real high confidence in him. The sad thing is Goligoski will probably be the odd man out. THOUGH, I do think they'll rotate him back in occasionally. The only way to get better (and he has ALOT of talent to work with) is to keep him playing.     I do think Ray Shero will move a d-men or two at the trade deadline for a couple of forwards. Don't quote me on that, but it 'tis my gut feeling.     Sorry if I didn't really have an upfront answer, but nobody really knows for sure who'll be the odd man out.|`|YPfiWhNdaa	Two will have to go - they want Kaberle at the trade deadline!|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Mark Eaton. They went to the Cup last year when he was injured. Rob Scuderi is a better version of Eaton.|`|ULw1777caa	Good question.  I am guessing someone gets dumped.  Maybe Eaton or Whitney.
S0u3HKzhaa	Slowly,not amazing but not as bad as it was a few weeks ago.Ratings have been going up with the return of Vince and the starting of the feud.But I think they can be doing better.    Yes,he will return to confront Chris Jericho next week on Raw.|`|3icTrKLLaa	I think it is slowly getting better compared to 05-06.      Ric Flair is not returning in a wrestling roll. It is going to be Micky Rourke vs Chris Jericho at WM with Flair in Rourkes corner.|`|AA11482019	It's getting worse all the time.

sJhsBjXlaa	either back or front....on my team i play backman cause i have good aim good gun and can move alog the sanke pretty well...middle man has to many balls flyin around him and it is hard to move...frontman is ok but you are more likely to get taken out quicker|`|f61ac3263259b459324f170e93588ad7aa	MIDDLE OR FRONT you have to be a man you face them men and dominate i like to be in the front becuase you make a plan and though you may have to sacrifice yourself you will be a domineer in the end. (make sure your not in the front when the paintballs start to freeze thought it hurts a little worst!|`|sk9AOeMraa	im havent started tournaments, because im not old enough, but im a backman, i have good aim and give people cover alot.
