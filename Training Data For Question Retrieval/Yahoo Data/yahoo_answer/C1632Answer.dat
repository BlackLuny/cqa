TbiSBXclaa	Anything downtown near the Aquarium will be pricey.  That is conventioneers row and they charge the business guests a fortune. <br>  <br>  Check out the Mariott or Doubletree up I-85 near Clarimont Rd or N. Druid Hills Rd, just on the north side of downtown.  There is a Red Roof Inn near the Doubletree that should be inexpensive. Avoid anything south of town near the airport.  There are also a few budget hotels on Sidney Marcus near Buckhead.|`|AA12068233	The Courtyard Marriot and Doubletree are nice, clean hotels. <br>  <br>  Decent locations, too. Short walk or cheap taxi rides to lots of bars and restaurants.|`|Pmp88MjQaa	The Hyatt is a good choice. Last year I got a room for $99. But good luck with the Aquarium.,,,,,it sucks.

T5DbLLgQaa	Well, at least there is a catamaran connection form Venice to Umag (Croatia), I'm not sure if it is working all year round but at least you might use it in the summertime. The ship is called "Prince Of Venice" so I suggest you to check it out. Venice is extremely pricey indeed and the hotels there are very very fully booked so you have to prepare to book quite early!

You're better off getting your bras in the States because no store is going to carry that size on their shelves.<br>  <br>  Mana:<br>  I shop at Jusco and I have C cup bras, and it's difficult for me to find a nice bra.  I have never seen a bra that large at Jusco.|`|4NxXKJBjaa	34E US size would covert to a 75G japanese size, which would pretty much be near-impossible to find without special-ordering.<br>  <br>  Stock up before you leave.|`|YGSstaiEaa	We used to have only small sized for bra, but there're more variety sized sold at shops nowadays.<br>  The cup size should be 1 size bigger, compare to US size.<br>  So your size will be 75F which you can find in Japanese stores.<br>  However that size is not "common" for Japanese, so you should check out your size at department store such as Isetan, Takashima-Ya, or Mitsukoshi. Or if you want one for lower price, I believe Ito Yokado or Jasco have lingerie shop in them.<br>  My favorite brand is Trimp. They have lovely designs but still not that expensive. :)<br>  <br>  sorry sorry... i made mistake the size (first, i wrote 85 but like the other anser said, it would be 75 cm >_<)

(passport, driver's license, etc).|`|4cHP4XtHaa	You will not be able to enter Canada without a drivers license or some form of govt. issued photo ID ALONG with a Birth Certificate, if your going past June 1st then you won't be able to to enter without a Passport or other approved enhanced drivers license or NEXUS. The short answer is if you have no ID and birth certificate and you can't get them by the time you go over cancel your canadian plans because you be turned around right at the border they make no exceptions!

kgBPU4xxaa	Which airport are you arriving and departing from? If you're coming in to Pisa, I would pick up the car and go to Siena. You can easily use Siena as a base for day trips to Monteriggioni, Montepulciano, and San Gimignano - they're all within an 45 to 75 minutes of Siena. The smaller towns would be nice to stay in, but it's extra effort to book the individual hotels and to move every night and have to check-in and out each time. <br>  <br>  I would stay separately in Lucca overnight since it's a little more than a 2.5 hr dive each way from Siena. Personally, I would stay in Lucca at the end of the trip if you've got an early flight out of Pisa because it's a shorter drive to the airport. You could combine this with San Gimignano or Strada in Chianti - stop there on your way to Lucca for most of a day.<br>  <br>  You might find this site useful for driving directions: <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/tpl/hme/MaHomePage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/i...</a>|`|URZNtrxsaa	I hate to add one more city to you list, but Greve in Chianti is a wonderful place to visit,stay, tour, eat and drink.

OOasDsPSaa	You should try the Phoenix Park Hotel. If you stay here, you'll be close to most of the popular attractions in D.C. <br>  <br>  It is located one block from Union Station and half a mile from the Museum of American History.  Their location is unbeatable - only 2 blocks from the U.S. Capitol and 3 blocks from the National Mall. You can even see the Capitol building down the street in their pictures. Hope this helps - have a great time!|`|5AbCtkWFaa	There really aren't hotels in walking distance of the National Mall, but as the Museum of American History is pretty close to both the Smithsonian and Federal Triangle Metro stations (Orange and Blue lines), it's pretty easy to get around.  Metro is quite safe.<br>  <br>  Union Station (on the Red Line) is a few blocks off a rather dicey neighborhood, and it's not walking distance to the museums.  There are several hotels near Metro Center (Red, Orange, and Blue lines) and Gallery Place (Red, Yellow, and Green lines), but they are rather expensive.|`|wPM05rssaa	I'd highly recommend the Embassy Suites in Old Town Alexandria.

Drive around the 70 mile perimeter of the lake, stop in places like Donner Memorial- she'll know the story of the Donner party- walk around Truckee, right near the Memorial. Stop at Emerald Bay and many of the other small towns around the lake. You can take her on a lake cruise to Emerald Bay on either the Tahoe Queen or the MS Dixie. They both have dinner cruises as well as regular cruises. Of course, she may enjoy a little gambling, or maybe a lounge show, at the casinos- and there are plenty of nice places to eat a nice meal.

BuqCfUpgaa	Check out China Airlines and see what they charge.  Most of the flights leaving the US will stop in another country first and then continue on to Bangkok.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Every now and then some of the airlines have specials on flights to Asia.<br>  <br>  CI (China Airlines) will stop in Taiwan and then head on to Bangkok from there.  One advantage of CI is that they arrive in Bangkok during the day hours.  If you haven't been to Thailand before it is always an advantage to arrive during the daytime.<br>  <br>  The normal cycle for the US is that when the kids get out of school in June the fares for flights to Asia go up in price.  The prices usually go down after school resumes late August early September.  <br>  <br>  If you could leave a month sooner the price will probably be cheaper.  Anyway vary the departure dates a few days ahead and behind to see if the price changes any.<br>  <br>  With a US passport you will get a free 30 day permission stamp in your passport at the airport.   Count your days up unless you intend to leave Thailand for a second country and then return to BKK.<br>  <br>  Happy trails.|`|AA10254694	Your not going to find anything cheaper as Bangkok is a hub.

Or take the Greyhound bus.   <br>  <br>  As far as driving somewhere to take the GO train into 'the city'... if you are coming from the London or Woodstock areas, you need to drive no further than Milton (401) or Aldershot (403).

Ja3kXyelaa	Minimum wage... currently $8.75 per hour|`|K0HFbPxYaa	the above is correct but at the end of the month minimum wage is going up to just over $9/hour|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	Minimum wage, starting.  It increases by .25 for every certain number of hours that you have worked.  It usually works to about every 6 months or so.

Does it have an atm usage as well. I have a prepaid visa, but I can take money out of atm as well. If your are referring to the one you buy at the store, I would call Disney to make sure but I don't think there would be a problem.|`|x9RDPwIZaa	Yes, a prepaid card can be used; There is no way to tell if it is prepaid or not.  There are only a couple of carts that take cash only, but due to the dining plan, 99% of the carts do take charge cards.  If she is staying onsite, she can always charge to her room and use the prepaid card to pay the bill there.|`|tSMRYe8waa	Probably as long as it has the logo Visa.

1cJjGNOBaa	well, the answer is.... you just never know! There will be snow, but possibly not enough to ski on, or even to play in! It may just be on the peaks by then. During the many years I lived on the South Shore, it snowed, at one time or another, during every single month of the year! So, you just never know!
WkbEAvZPaa	Maybe go for a walk/run around the Back Bay fens, Charles River, or Boston Common? Or you can check out some museums?|`|fFnsJ7maaa	Wander around Beacon Hill, Back Bay, the North End. Take the tour of the new State House. Go to the Museum of Fine Arts (with one paid admission, you can go back once for free within 10 days). Walk the Freedom Trail. Take the Red Line to Quincy and tour the Adams Homestead. (I LOVE that place.)  Check out the Maparium at the Christian Science Mother Church (It's a walk-through stained glass globe). <br>  <br>  Walk the Charles River Reservation from Arlington to BU. (Wave at me walking my dog there.)<br>  <br>  Take a class at Boston Center for Adult Education (www.bcae.org). Get a copy of Improper Bostonian (free at most major street corners) and look for things that interest you.
xzwZ3lt3aa	Depending on where you go, the chance of seeing a black bear is pretty good. We usually camp in the Kootneys, the Okanagan, or the Caribou/Chilcotin. I've seen black bears in all those places. <br>  <br>  Rule one. Don't leave your garbage out. Take it to the trash every night. The trash bins are bear safe. Don't leave out any dog food etc. In some places bears have gone right into tents for food. Keep your food in your car (if you're tenting)<br>  <br>  Rule 2. Get some bear spray for if you go out hiking. We've seen black bears several times out on a hike. They have always chosen to go the other direction. If they do come at you make lots of noise. Raise your arms to make yourself look big. If a black bear does come in for an attack, use your spray. If it's a grizzly, good luck. I've never seen a grizzly, and to be honest, I would probably sh*t my pants. I'd be shaking too bad to use the spray. <br>  <br>  When you're out in the bush, make lots of noise. The bears have fair warning you're coming, and will move on most times. Don't let your dog run lose. Keep it on a leash. An angry bear will chase a dog, and lead him right back to you.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Wait a little longer still, it's kind of cold for camping unless you like winter camping and have the stuff for it. One advantage of snow on the ground, though, is that the bears are still hibernating. Of course, once they wake up they're really hungry....!  You might see one in warmer weather and you might not, depends where you are, but they're around just about everywhere. Yes, food will attract them, your food and natural food like berries. Why don't you do a little reading on the net about bears and how to avoid trouble with them? It's kind of a long subject to discuss here. If you kill a bear in self-defence, no problem, it's understood you had to do it. Yes, it's true, don't try and run away from a bear. They can outrun you every time unless you run 3 feet to your car, and they can rip cars open if they get really mad.|`|L6u8Tgq7aa	invite the bears to the party. we like beer and bbq too

ENsdS2N6aa	Definitely not. Although there may be some extremists who see the west as the source of "evil" but this exists in many countries. Turkey is a very secularized country with strong ties to the United States in terms of military operations. It is also in negotiations to join the European Union. <br>  <br>  Plus, more and more people are influenced by the Western culture, whether it be in terms of music (rap), starbucks or clothes... <br>  <br>  The influences and close links are debatable, but Turkey definitely does not hold hatred to Western society as their eastern and southern neighbours, if at all.|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	My father's friend, who served in the military, once had to go to Turkey.<br>  <br>  He said it's a dump. He didn't trust a single person there, whom "act like they like the west, but they really don't." I'm assuming that he went to the eastern part of Turkey - that's where it shares borders with Middle Eastern countries (Iraq, Iran).<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say the Turkish hate the Americans quite as much as Iraq or Iran do, but I would say that they aren't as favourable towards the Americans as Canada or the U.K. are.|`|a59579ec8aee8902f555d4fccd5299e6aa	I don't think so.  They are much more multicultural than Arab countries, and the people are genuinely fond of the US people.  The women are MUCH more free than in most Islamic nations, including Iran and Iraq.  Remember, they represent the remains of the Ottoman empire, and that was very unpopular in the Arab world.|`|5m4yaEJyaa	ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!!!!!! Remeber the Young Turks in the early 20th Century engineered and killed 2 million Christian Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians because they were considered infidels...on the other hand the Turks did suffer as well with over 1 million troops killed in WWI and many Turks did suffer and die during independence from 1919-1923 against the Greeks...regardless the Turks are hated throughout the Middle East and Europe because they are Barbarians to the civilized world, they believe in death and destruction, this is why they have no real allies in the region, and trust me not 1 American (Christian) will die for Turkey, I know I'm American|`|OJWApbmbaa	Yes and no but for the most part no Turkey is moderate towrds the West and take a lot from western culture as they don't want to be ascociated with the Middle East.|`|OC2X2AfXaa	We are just muslim not Arab. Our society is westernised (I believe)|`|zweNndXtaa	Historically, no.  Turkey has been more moderate. However, there is a growing fundamentalist movement and in time that may change.
Wqjaz2cgaa	The rule-of-thumb is a maximum 45 linear inches (linear inches is the sum of length, width, and depth). The overhead lockers were designed for 45" bags, so passengers trying to stow the bigger 52" bags often have trouble and have to have their bag gate-checked.  But size and weight restrictions do vary slightly airline by airline.  See the link below for a good list of links to airline rules. <br>  Happy traveling!|`|FpT7x2VVaa	only your airline will be able to tell you. experience shows me, small is better, just in case you get on last and all overhead is full. then you sit with it under your feet.<br>  typical measurements are 45 linear inches. check also the link below.

AA10662056	>I want to try studying there for 1-2 years, then finish college her in USA.<br>  <br>  Japanese colleges do not allow you to have this kind of transfer. They require you to finish study once you joined.<br>  <br>  So it's not possible.

But the thing you want to consider is if any of the credits from your classes would transfer back to a US university. What do you want to get your degree in?<br>  Another idea is to attend a USA university and study Japanese (either as your major, or as a double major--many students have a second major in history or business or English), then go to Japan. For example, the University of Alaska (which has tuition at a reasonable price) has a Japanese major. Students study Japanese and other subjects for two years, then go to Japan for their third year. After they graduate from college, many go back to Japan and work for the JET program teaching English (where the English major comes in handy) or work in business (that handy business major). Some take an extra year at college and get a teaching degree, which is also a master's degree in teaching. (a master's degree usually also means a higher salary) This, added to the history degree and Japanese major enables them to teach high school Japanese in the USA.<br>  <br>  It is really great that you are thinking big and wanting to follow your dream. Since you are a year or so away from college, why not begin to study Japanese now? If you can't find any classes this summer in your town, or anyone (University student or person from Japan) to teach you, you can teach yourself to read and write hiragana and katakana. There are many workbooks available, and lots of information online. Your local library may have language CD's you can listen to.<br>  If you have a Barnes and Noble in your town, take a look at the Japanese section to see what kinds of books, etc. are available. If money is tight, then you can borrow what you want from your local library or buy used copies from half.com or ebay or a used book store. You can also put up "books wanted" signs at a University or post a request on craigslist.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|m5fuOGAiaa	If you DREAM of going there, learn some Japanese damn it.  And if you think its going to be some kind of heaven, or your coming here because you like anime, you are going to be extremely dissapointed.<br>  <br>  Come here with no expectations and ready to adapt and you will probably have a great experience.

There are also plenty of scholarships available for foreign students who wish to attend college/university as well; the people who mentioned to you that study in Japan is impossible do not know what they are talking about. <br>  <br>  What I recommend you do is get in touch with an adviser at school, and see if there are any short term exchange programs available for you in junior high or high school. You might even want to get in touch with someone in the international or financial aid departments at your local college/university and see if they can offer any help. This way, you'll be able to get a taste of Japan for a couple of weeks pretty soon, and you'll find out if you really want to study at a higher level in Japan. <br>  <br>  If you want to study in English in Japan, there are a few international universities that offer degree programs, but to be honest, they are expensive and they aren't that well regarded. It's better to come to Japan on an exchange program during your university days. If you decide to pursue a Master's degree, this is where Japan shines: you can do that in English in Japan, and get paid for it.. or at least, before the global economy started tanking, you could. There's plenty of scholarship money for grad students.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to study, well, why not come to Japan to work for awhile after you graduate? You could teach English. If you have a degree in finance or computer science, you could possibly find related work in Tokyo or possible Osaka. If you have studied hard, you may even find work as a translator. However, other jobs are difficult to find for foreigners. If you're a foreigner and you're not an English teacher, you're a translator, an engineer, a code monkey, a consultant, a financial-type, or recruiter for translators, engineers, code monkeys, consultants, or financial types. :)<br>  <br>  ANYWAY. Don't give up on your dream. Start studying Japanese, find out what's out there, and then go for it.|`|yIJnm2Ueaa	Depends on what you want.<br>  In general, Japanese universities has less prestige and worse education than that you can get in the US. If you have to choose between Harvard and Tokyo University, it is a no-brainier in terms of education you can get there. 90% of the students automatically passes the classes, because being there is about the only requirement.  Also, Japanese universities are really not flexible about credit transfers and such. It is hard to just come back to the US, after.<br>  There are two advantages i can think off:<br>  - language study<br>  - networking<br>  <br>  I agree with others, that doing an American university, and joining an exchange program to visit Keio, Todai etc is a good alternative option, and you may profit much more from it.|`|AA11896169	The economy is better over there so you might save in expenses and make more money if you get a job while going to college.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, well its definitely depends on your dating principle.  If you are serous with a girl, you can bring her with different places in Manila, if you're in Manila but not in a place where she would feel hesitated(you know what I mean).  Unless she's your girlfriend for a long time and you already have understandings.  The women in provinces, generally are not much of party goers.  More prefer to just eat in a not so fancy restaurant or watch movies, going to the malls.  On the other hand,  City girls more often preferred to go to a club or comedy bars.  But you know, no matter  where the woman raised from, whether its from a city or a province, it is certainly your approach that makes the difference, just do what sanctioned under the right manners and proper conducts and everything will be alright.|`|AA10690200	depending where you go, they are more traditional (old fashioned) than in the US.

It all depends on how you execute your approach. It depends on how well you present yourself.  Confidence is absolutely the key (but not too much) as well as a being a great conversationalist.  Gone are the days when Filipinas are conservative.  You would easily notice if a Filipina is interested in you.  However, you are in luck if you find someone who is willing to go to bed with you on the first night.  Most filipinas would likely get to know the guy first.|`|IeJ9I4Braa	just chilll out haha.

I think going to clubs or bars is the place to go.<br>  If you are looking for a serious girlfriend you will have no problem finding a good girl if you take your time and just be yourself. Take time to meet her family and listen to them and her. Family in Philippines is much more important than in the States. This is a GOOD thing!  Expect the gal to have a friend or family member along for a first date. Again that is the kind of woman you want to be with. Old fashioned? Perhaps but IMO you will find a much better woman in the Philippines than in the States I know as I am also an American too.<br>  If you have any other questions feel free to email me.

In fact, men are more worried about being thin than women in Japan.  But even though I am 152 cm and weigh about 47kg, a man would tell me I need to lose weight.  Japanese men do like thin women, but women aren't as worried.
AA10740352	We did the Alaska cruise on Princess a few years ago.    While you are on the ship you will see lots of beautiful scenery with mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, and snow.  So my suggestion is not to do tours that take you to glaciers, unless you want to do a dog sled ride.  WE did the Totem Poles tour in Ketchkan and that was a nice tour.  If/when we do Alaska again I think we'll do the lumberjack show because it looked interesting on the travel channel.  We also did a tour that went to a fish hatchery but I would skip that one as it was  not very exciting to me.  In Juneau we did the White's Pass and Yukon tour (you can go by train or tour bus) by bus and that was more beautiful scenery.  In a couple port stops we just got off the ship and wandered around the towns.  The only other tour that I would consider is the dog sled ride with an opportunity to see the puppies.   <br>  <br>  In my opinion the best Alaska cruise for you would be a cruise-tour. The cruise-tour allows you to see more of Alaska by land (bus and/or train) either before or after the cruise. They typically afford an opportunity to stay a night or two in/at Denali National Park, Anchorage, Talkeetna, or Fairbanks, Alaska. Princess is one of the cruise lines that use the train to transport you from/to the cruise point to/from the park and Fairbanks. That's what we did and the train ride is magnificent and when you do the cruise tour you will have the best opportunity to see wildlife like bears, caribou, moose, fox, wolf, and a few others. These cruise-tours can be from 12 to 15 days or more while normal cruises are 7 days.<br>  <br>  There are several ways to have a cruise to Alaska. You can cruise north from San Francisco, Seattle, or Vancouver Canada or cruise south from Anchorage (Whittier or Seward).   You need to pay attention to which itinerary (port stops) the cruises will have.<br>  <br>  It will be pleasant on ship while you are in inside area but breezy and chilly on open decks. When you get near the icebergs and glaciers it will be cold. And I mean like hat, coat and gloves cold. But the way to dress is layer your clothes so you will be warm enough when its cold but not too hot when you are in warmer areas. Instead of a ski jacket, take a lighter one that you can wear comfortably over a sweater or hoodie. Take some long sleeved shirts and slacks. Take a cap or hat and even gloves. Think underclothes, shirt, sweater, jacket for your dress each day.<br>  <br>  The ship will have areas where you can see things without being outside.   It will also likely  have a solarium, a glass covered pool and hot tub area.  And of course the ship will have a gym. So you can take things to enjoy these activities on ship.|`|TthDWtPTaa	Definitely do the White Pass & Yukon railroad one.<br>  It's incredible scenery, the train is awesome, and you enter Canada as well.<br>  The horse carriage tour of Ketchikan is very good too.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Did you book a cruise or a cruise tour? We haven't been to Alaska yet, but we have been on 5 cruises so far. I've seen Great Cruises with Samantha Brown on The Travel Channel and one episode profiles an Alaskan Cruise Tour. There is a glass domed train that goes to the interior. There is an old time saloon in either Skagway  or Ketchikan. They play the Scott Joplin music on the piano. This bar also has it's own micro pub. Any time is good for an Alaskan cruise, but I'm told that the best time is a 30 day window between July 15 and Aug 15. I'll give you one word of warning about going on a cruise. Cruises are habit forming. You'll be hooked and will want to go on one every year!!! In my opinion, cruises are the Holy Grail of vacations.<br>  Bon Voyage!!!

PSiNv7gUaa	If adults that aren't parents/legal guardians of kids can't drive them across state lines without facing jail time, then I highly doubt they can check them in on an airline going to another country.  If it were that easy, I'm sure we'd being hearing about all the teenagers running away using the airlines.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if you are unhappy, I know change isn't easy, but try to give your mom a chance.  I don't know your or her whole situation, but if you haven't lived with her your whole life, then I'm sure this is a major adjustment for her as well.  She probably doesn't really know how to relate to you and be your mother if she's not the one that mothered you growing up, and now she's smack in the middle of the teenage years, the hardest part of raising kids (no offense).  Try to cut her some slack, she's your mother and it will be good for you to spend time with her before you're all grown up.  I'm sure there are problems, but I'm willing to bet you guys can find a way to overcome them and have a real mother/daughter relationship.  And if you can't, at least you tried instead of running away from your problems, and you can go wherever you want when you turn 18 in three years, and not need consent from anyone.|`|zpQnda9Eaa	depends on the airline...but i wouldnt do it because your mom would be worried sick...if she says no and you REALLY want to go ...just warn her that ur going no matter what she says|`|InIhFMLsaa	yes all you need is a id, and money, and papers saying that you are allowed out of the country, and your mom had to sign them, just trick her and say its for something else|`|12zRozB7aa	You will probably be reported as a runaway and end up having the police looking for you.

AA11198414	The South Dakota and North Dakota Badlands are different mostly in size.  The South Dakota Badlands (Badlands National Park) are stunning.  They have the appearance of a moonscape.  The eroded landforms are quite large in size.  The North Dakota Badlands (Theodore Roosevelt National Park) are not as large and blend in to the surroundings more.

fNwgiSFYaa	You are worrying far too much about this.  All the beaches are nice in Cancun.  Since hurricane Wilma hit in 2005 the Mexican Government and Tourism board have spent millions of dollars rebuilding the beaches.  What are you talking about.. black spots?  There are other things you should consider on where you stay... not just the beach.  If you want a great place to stay with a nice beach you should try the Riu Caribe.  A great hotel that offers a lot and their beach is very nice.  One of the best sections of beach is owned by Sun Palace.  Just a little tip the beaches in Cancun are wider and better at the southern end of Cancun.  There is less wave activity that strikes the beach head on therefore making them wider.  Beaches on the North part of Cancun (the top of the 7) have less waves striking the beach because the waves are blocked by the Island of Mujeres.  <br>  The problem is that you are looking at photos that are old and outdated.  You need to not focus so much on what you see from the photos.  All of the beaches in Cancun offer white sand and turquoise blue water so I don't know what you are looking for.  I'll provide you some pictures of some of the resort's beaches.  Trust me though in saying you are worrying far too much about this.  I know you want a nice beach, but I assure you that anywhere you stay in Cancun you won't be disappointed.|`|gOyLBe1laa	Any of them will be great and all are beach front if i remember right, also the hilton and Marriott are pretty sick too so any of them will be a great choice. beaches are all white sand and all these hotels are on a main avenue, it's just like a big long strip of beautiful hotels where the next one looks 10x better than the previous one.|`|FPGpYzNJaa	Maroma Beach has won awards as the best beach in Cancun and Mexico.

fNwgiSFYaa	Hi darling!  Glad to see you are thinking of getting married in Cancun. It can be one of the most gorgeous weddings if planned right.  Crown Paradise is a very nice place to stay and a very kid friendly place for a family with children.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a place to get married at.  Some resorts in Cancun specialize in weddings and one of the best is Dreams Resort.  They have done countless weddings and have a backdrop that is breathtaking.  They offer a gazebo where the ceremony is done and the gorgeous turquoise, blue Caribbean is in the background.  They also have an iconic lighthouse that is a very popular backdrop for some of your after wedding photos. Not only that, but it's also a great place to relax afterward and enjoy your honeymoon if you choose to stay in Cancun for that.  <br>  I'm not sure if you are on a budget, but since it's your wedding I'm sure you want everything perfect and money should be no option.  <br>  I'm not saying it's pricey... I'm just saying you may have to shell out a little more money if you want it done right and perfect. <br>  I'll provide you with links to pictures and other things so you can see how gorgeous it is.  If you have any questions about anything feel free to message me and I'll be glad to help you.|`|vITZgKthaa	hi i haven't gotten married yet but i know one of my cousins work there and they always say that is great and beautiful <br>  so im assuming that it will be great for your weeding <br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun|`|rwKZIMBUaa	yeah, i went to crown paradise, it's great. It's fabulous because it's right on the beach. Every night at 10:30 they take you to a different club. also every evening there is a show, they are so fun. Another thing is the efficiency of the staff. You order a drink from one of the many bars and they get it for you immediately. It's all inclusive so you could drink as much as you like. There is also an adult pool with a swim up bar, if you prefer not to hang out by the family pool. and the food, don't get me started. so awesome. only down fall? all the channel stations are in spanish. but i'm not sure how much tv watching you'll be doing. I think you should book there.<br>  if you do don't forget sunscreen! You'll need it!|`|DOVhPN03aa	I've been to Cancun with my family and it is extremely beautiful. the weather could not have been more enjoyable and warm. also the water has bee some of the best I have been to.

TskZHzZyaa	That's a great question.  Lower Wacker is a great secret among the locals.  The streets under Michigan that you don't see much from Michigan I find interesting too.  <br>  <br>  Check out some building interiors such as the Rookery Building.  The Chase Bank Plaza is kinda neat too.  Just south of McCormick Place is a gift to Chicago from Benito Mussolini - a Roman Column from the ancient Rome port city of Ostia that is the only remnant of the 1933 World's Fair.  The south side of the Museum of Science and Industry is fascinating if you've studied the 1893 world's fair, to think the place was surrounded by a huge fair and many buildings, some much larger than the museum.  Okay not crazy but often overlooked.<br>  <br>  If you're a fan of the Blues Brothers consider looking at some of the landmarks around the city featured in the movie.  See the link below for locations real to the city and history of this great city.|`|voqq2lU7aa	Boytown lol<br>  let me know when you go, would love to know your reaction c:

Again, there are several buildings used by the various cruise lines at the port. Times will vary with traffic at the port. The last 1/4 mile is the slowest, but things move right along. Just tell your driver which ship you are taking and he will get you to the right building.<br>  <br>  Have a good trip.<br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|1bTYCUDkaa	It is 5.5 miles, so it is a 13 minute drive.

Things to look for is if they use the GSM system, at dual band or higher, (I think 900 or 1800) & if they are not locked-although having it unlocked is not really that hard nowadays. In the US, I think T-Mobile uses Sidekicks or at least the US Version of it & they use sim-cards & GSM, same as in the Philippines.|`|DnnHqgwGaa	I'm not really sure if there are sidekicks here. I just saw my friend use one and I'm not sure if she bought it here or just buy on ebay. So you can check just in case. :)

l9c2Uw5baa	Take the Go train and get off at Eglinton - from there cross the street and take any bus going westbound (should say Kennedy station) or you can ask the driver.  That's about a 5 minute bus ride.  Once you get to Kennedy, go upstairs to the SRT platform and take the SRT to Scarborough Town Centre Station (about 10 minutes or less).  That's the quickest way...

If you could find an apartment in the woodlands than I'd recommend it because the Woodlands is very nice and fast to get to the campus.

A plus side of going to Montgomery is that The University Center is located in the same area.<br>  <br>  North Harris is the biggest campus and is very close to the airport (IAH).

It's as safe as London, probably safer. (Recall, though, that that's not saying it's entirely safe: there have been numerous terrorist plots in England recently, and a few of them like the Underground bombing have actually been successful, which is scary!) Basically, I'd say, India is as safe as most developed countries (though not as well-developed, obviously, and not as nice in some ways as a consequence, and more interesting in other ways). If you would travel anywhere other than Canada, then you could travel to India, too, and be just as safe!|`|IuPO44eraa	yes, it is preety safe...<br>   if not the entire country, then some parts are definitely!!!<br>  <br>  You could go to Goa....

Nudity is not permitted and no funny business is tolerated, so it's nice and relaxing and actually has been pretty empty the couple times I have visited.  Drift Spa also has couples treatment rooms for massages together before or after enjoying a steam together.<br>  <br>  Note that this is NOT in the spa at the Palms, this is in the luxury condotel tower connected to the Palms.|`|sCOWjA8qaa	You have to read this book, more info about tips in las vegas you will find in this site <a href="http://trycheapvegas.blogspot.com/2009/03/las-vegas-vacation-for-less.html" rel="nofollow">http://trycheapvegas.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>

fFnsJ7maaa	Not a lot of beaches in Boston, but we have much waterfront. Both the Waterfront and Seaport districts have great hotels with views. The new Westin Waterfront (near the convention center), The Boston Harbor Hotel, Renaissance Boston Waterfront, Intercontinental, Marriott Long Wharf, Fairmont Battery Wharf, Seaport Hotel. The ones nearer Long Wharf are easier to get around on the T. Anything with a view will be spendy.
J9Tbun7naa	I am on Hamilton Island. It's windy and rainy but not extreme...we have been told to stay indoors though. I have stuck my head out a few times and it's yucky weather but not definitely not extreme
0ZfZulnzaa	None, I book my own trips via the hotel websites or the airlines. And if I have to I go into a travel agent and  have them do it, have been burnt in the past by both expedia and travelocity, they charge you silly fees if you need to make modifications or cancellations, and the worst they sometimes "forget" to send in your request to the hotel or airline, so when you get there they have no record of  your reservation and then you have to phone and go through all kinds of hoops to get it rectified.|`|hSOYndoxaa	I book my vacations with my AAA travel agent for free. She beats all of those websites prices and can do a price match as well. When booking with her I get great non-stop flights too.
uqs1fn4kaa	basically Highschool in NZ (or Secondary school as we call it here) starts in Year 9 up until Year 13.<br>  <br>  You start Year 9 when you're around 12-13 years of age, and seeing that you're 14 years old, you will probably Year 10 here in NZ.<br>  <br>  Year 9 (Freshman)<br>  Year 10 (Soph)<br>  Year 11 (Junior)<br>  Year 12 and 13 (Senior)<br>  <br>  Basically, you really dont have to study up until Year 13. You could leave school after Year 12 but Year 13 is needed if you want to go to Universities.<br>  <br>  Choosing your subjects while in Secondary school is very important and it's should be related to what you're planning to take when you go to University. e.g. If you want to take Engineering, you should choose subjects that are related to Engr (Engineering, Calculus, Physics etc).<br>  <br>  For Years 9 and 10, you get 5 compulsory subjects (Maths, English, Science, Social Studies, Physical Ed) and two option courses, or electives, could be ranging from Wood Workshop, Food Technology, IT, Accounting, Engineering etc. Then in Year 11 there are 3 compulsary (English, Maths, Science) then the rest are options. For Year 12, (English). For Year 13, you get to choose whatever subjects you want to take, provided you passed them the year before.<br>  <br>  To pass in this education system:<br>  <br>  Year 9's and 10's - there are end of the year exams each year, this determines your placement, whether you're in a smart class or an average class.<br>  <br>  Year 11's - You need to get a total of 80 credits out of a possible 120. Credits could be obtained all year round, through practical exams and written exams. You could also get around 40 credits through the end of the year exams.<br>  <br>  Year 12's - You need 60 credits.<br>  <br>  Year 13's - it doesn't really matter, you just have to pass what's required for your uni entrance|`|14UfFR3qaa	First up, there is no such thing as elementary school, middle school, grades etc.<br>  <br>  The schools are<br>  Primary<br>  Intermediate<br>  High school/Collage<br>  <br>  High School and Collage is the same thing.<br>  <br>  some schools are Primary and Intermediate joined.<br>  <br>  you start school at age 5, with your first year being year 1<br>  <br>  your second year of school is year 2<br>  <br>  third year is year 3<br>  <br>  etc<br>  <br>  Standards start at year 3.<br>  <br>  year 3- standard 1<br>  <br>  year 4 - standard 2<br>  etc<br>  years 1 to 6, standard 1 to 4 go to Primary School<br>  <br>  Forms start at yr 7<br>  <br>  yr 7 is form 1,<br>  <br>  yr 8 is form 2.<br>  etc<br>  <br>  years 7 and 8, forms 1 and 2 go to Intermediate<br>  <br>  some primarys and Intermediates are joinded.<br>  <br>  From year 9, form 3 they go to High School or Collage.<br>  <br>  High School and Collage are the same thing.<br>  <br>  the minimum leaving age of high/collage is 16, which is three years at high/collage.<br>  <br>  The maximum amount of years someone can stay at high/collage is 5<br>  <br>  The BIG exams start in years 11, 12 and 13, and they are called NCEA.<br>  <br>  NCEA level 1 for yr 11<br>  NCEA lvl 2 for yr 12<br>  NCEA lvl 3 for yr 13<br>  <br>  You MUST pass lvl 1 if you want to drop out early.<br>  <br>  Any education passed these years are universities.<br>  <br>  hope that helped!

KdFXk0ajaa	Illinois is so flat due to lack of mountainous topography. Seriously though from my own personal experience I can give you three varied but interesting possibilities. Upstate New York: try the Catskill Mountains area. I visited several times in the town of Catskill and it was absolutely gorgeous. Plus it is a short jaunt to NYC among other places. I was stationed in Rome, NY in the U. S. Air Force and the Adirondacks along with the Mohawk Valley are absolutely breathtaking. About 3 hours from NYC with lots of lakes and if you like winter tons of things to do. About 3 hours from Montreal, and about 5 hours from Niagara Falls. New Hampshire- the White Mountains are gorgeous and you are a 3 hour ride at most from Boston the Atlantic Ocean and New England is a very pretty part of the country. I saved the best for last- Colorado Springs, CO. Smack dab in the Rockies. A good friend of mine lives in an area known as Black Forest and has a ranch with horses. Denver is about 40 miles north and Colorado Springs has the U.S. Air Force Academy, an absolutely beautiful place known as The Garden of the Gods, a natural ampitheatre for live concerts known as Red Rocks. If I tolerated cold weather I would leave the Tampa Bay Florida area (Florida's highest point is I believe 120 feet above sea level) and move to Colorado Springs. Why not look into going to college in one of those places and travel to other states on Spring Breaks and other time off from college? Just a thought but it would be a way to get an idea of where you might like to live. Plus once you leave Illinois you might think it wasn't too bad of a place Hope this helps you a bit. Best of luck..|`|2DLqsVFcaa	the glaciers flattened it out just like indiana.|`|RadRfHfLaa	Well, I live in California and it has a lot of mountain ranges and hilly areas.

KdFXk0ajaa	Florida is a very big state so if you were leaving from Miami instead of from Pensacola That could be two tanks of gas right there. Below are links to a couple of websites to calculate gas costs. I used both websites on my 2800 mile roundtrips from St. Petersburg to Rhode Island. Good luck and watch the force you exert on the accelerator pedal.

Today is March 9 so if you travel on March 19, you purchased your ticket with less than 14 days before your departure date.  Therefore the price is higher.  If you change your departure date to say March 23 or 24, then the price should be different.|`|ZlwFsAu5aa	I would check out other city closer to you.

In the south of China, people eat a lot of rice and seafood. Chinese food is good in color, flavor and taste.<br>  <br>  Chinese agriculture dates back 5000 years, they've literally "invented" it.

But don't expect to live in one of the nicer neighborhoods on those type of wages.  You could find something in the $600 range if you aren't that picky about the neighborhood.

7Y2jmO7Taa	If you mean NYC, you first have to know that NYC is comprised of 5 boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. All of those boroughs are islands, or a part of a larger island, except for the Bronx.<br>  <br>  So, Manhattan and Staten Island are both islands. To the west of Staten Island is New Jersey, and to the east is Brooklyn. To the west of Manhattan is New Jersey (with the Hudson River in between) and to the east is Queens (with the East River in between.) <br>  <br>  Brooklyn and Queens are both a part of Long Island. People usually use the term "Long Island" to mean the suburbs outside NYC, but that really refers to Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. The western parts of Long Island are actually part of NYC (Brooklyn and Queens.) <br>  <br>  To the east of Brooklyn is Queens. To the west of Brooklyn is Staten Island (with the Verazanno Narrows in between) and to the east of Brooklyn is Queens. <br>  <br>  To the west of Queens is Brooklyn and to the east of Queens is Nassau County, Long Island.<br>  <br>  The Bronx is the only part of NYC that is a part of the mainland. To the north of the Bronx is Westchester County (NY). To the southwest of the Bronx is New Jersey. To the southeast of the Bronx is Manhattan. <br>  <br>  I hope that explains it a bit. But it's hard to explain, because it is so broken into pieces.

RwRxrjLdaa	well my older sister and mom visited France Before. So bring essentials what you need to get yourself prepared like a toothbrush, shampoo, a comb, clothing. Exchange your Canadian dollars for euro and about 400 Dollars is good to eat and rent a hotel for 3 days. <br>  They left from the Us but maybe if the plane is available Lufthansa I think|`|yULnOJUwaa	That is impossible to answer.  It really depends upon where you are staying, plan to eat, and activities you want to participate in.  Do take some Euro with you from home - banks can order them for you.  There are ATMs everywhere.  Be careful using your credit card because most slap on an extra charge for international use.  You should know how to say hello and thank you (in French) to say as you enter and exit shops and restaurants.  Consult message boards that give information about Paris.<br>  You should take your passport!  Be sure to take a xeroxed copy of your passport, credit cards, important telephone numbers to put in the hotel safe in case you lose the originals.  Actually I didn't carry my original passport around Paris - just the xeroxed one.  You must have something on you in case to produce it by the local authorities.<br>  The cost of a plane ticket could be determined by you picking up a telephone and calling different airlines or checking online.  Fares change all the time.

During the 12 months, if you do 3 months of 'specified work' in a regional area (see 'Second Working Holiday Visa Eligibility' on the next link) , you become eligible to apply for a second 12 month WH visa. If you've done the 3 months of qualifying work, you can get the second visa to tack onto the end of your first 12 months or can get it at any other time before you turn 31.<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/417/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...</a><br>  I think the above will achieve what you're aiming for, but if not, student info follows.<br>  <br>  You can always get a student visa to study here, but you must attend the university as a full time student.

PSiNv7gUaa	I took my 10-month old on rides and she was able to ride in my lap.

I'm from the UK as well and let me tell you that Colombia was pretty much the highlight of South America I thought it was going to be dangerous and chaotic but ended up becoming my second home. In Colombia I advice you to go to Bogota Cartagena and Medellin (hottest girls in the world) Brazil is great Rio, Sao Paulo, and all the southern cities are very friendly. Argentina is beautiful as well. my rank on where you should go.<br>  <br>  1) Colombia, specially Medellin<br>  2) Argentina, Buenos Aires<br>  3) Brazil, liked it all<br>  4) Chile, Santiago and it's surroundings<br>  5) Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia are countries with a strong indigenous population, if you like adventure and explore foreign cultures then these 3 should be your top pick they are very safe as well.<br>   ( the first 4 countries have unique cultures but overall are very western and nothing shocking as they are very similar to Europeans)|`|RyMVfRxmaa	I went 2 colombia and it was sooo awsome!!! people dont care wat u have!!! but just dont be mean to them!!!|`|r1ArUiaGaa	seriously... stop watching so many u.s. stereotiped news about colombia... the country was EXTREMELY dangerous in the 80s and start of the 90s ... now its safe as any other country in the big towns and roads.. but do stay away from really small towns or from specific  areas which might still have some danger<br>  big cities are even safer than houston or washington in u.s.<br>  if you dont beileve me investigate and youll see its true<br>  <br>  venezuela i dont advise that you visit... nothing really important to seee and dangerous.. brazil is nice but a little unsafe and unstable right now just as ecuador too

VYCLwKwNaa	You are right. The last thing you want to do is get turned away at customs. You have two customs to go through, Canada, and then the US Customs when you return to the USA. Things are changing all the time, and my best recommendation is that you not listen to anyone's opinion but call both customs and ask them directly. They will also tell you if you need passports, etc. In the past, they wanted various papers for your car (proof of registration and insurance), your pets (health certificate), your kids (birth certificates, passports, permission to travel from birth parents if there was a divorce) and proof that you had enough money to get all the way through Canada. There are also things that you cannot bring across the border, such as certain weapons and items made of ivory and other endangered species.<br>  It's best to check on all this before you pack.<br>  Thank you for your service to our country, and have a great ride down the highway. It's a beautiful trip.<br>  <br>  Canadian Customs, Beaver Creek YT, <br>  Phone #: 867-862-7230<br>  Fax #: 867-862-7613<br>  <br>  US Customs<br>  Skagway, AK 99840-0437<br>  General Phone: (907) 983-2325<br>  General Fax: (907) 983-3626<br>  <br>  You might also try asking the Alaska State Troopers.|`|V8Ybetq4aa	no, the border patrol will not deny you. It happen over tens years ago and as long as you or your family do not say any thing about it.|`|4INE794zaa	Yes, he very well can be denied entry. Sure, you can be sneaky and not tell them when they ask if you have anything to declare, but if they decide to run a check, then you are in trouble. Do what Dead Day suggested. Get the pardon.<br>  <br>  <br>  ^the border control does not need to consider that you are American military. That won't matter one iota. Nor do they care about your monetary issues. They follow the rules set forth, as their job requires. If they make exceptions for you, they must make exceptions for everyone. As for your husband, he did the crime, now he must reap the consequences. Get him the pardon, and its a non issue. Thats how you will solve it, on a case by case issue. Is the Canadian border control just supposed to take your word that you are just driving through? You must have no idea how many Americans are here, living illegally, after a claim of 'just on vacation.' Take up the issue of your husband's felony record with your own country, its really none of our concern. I don't see why you think you deserve special treatment. Why would Canadians want American felons in our country? Even if just passing through......... The US does not allow Canadian felons in either.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	He could easily be refused entry to Canada, and in these days of instant access to all kinds of records, I'd never want to assume that they won't run a check on someone. If you're refused entry, then they can see that the next time you try to cross and it doesn't look good. If he can get a pardon in time, then that's what I'd do.<br>  <br>  No country has to let you in if you don't meet the criteria, and border guards don't care what you say your reason is for travelling into that country. I had an enormous amount of trouble once at a US crossing, for no reason except they thought I had too much stuff in my van. I had camping stuff and my work tools which I hadn't bothered to remove before I left. They let me through, but it took over an hour.<br>  <br>  I searched "crossing canada border with felony" and found a site called clearyourrecord.com, a law firm, which says it can do that for you. You might want to check that out. Your husband has an excellent chance of clearing this up once and for all.<br>  <br>  If worst comes to worst, maybe hubby can fly to the lower 48 and meet you there. Makes a lot of driving for you on your own but it's one solution.|`|6igXDkkJaa	are you sure you don't need passports? I am almost positive you do.<br>  <br>  plus unless your husband was a minor when he committed that felony he can't come into canada.<br>  <br>  unfortunately your out of luck. Maybe buy a webcam and encourage your family to buy one too and you can see each other, or go without your husband.|`|Twzg9s0caa	Seeing as it is a minor offence and it was a long time ago you should spend a few hundred bucks and go see a lawyer and apply for a pardon and have it removed from his record.<br>  It can be done fairly quickly and then he doesn't have to worry about it anymore.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	How do you think the US Border Patrol would feel about admitting a Canadian with a felony criminal record?<br>  <br>  Even if I was just going through the Untied States to some other country, and couldn't "fly because we need a vehicle at at home and we can't take the ferry because of timing and money", do you think any of them would give a fried fig?<br>  <br>  Snowballs in hell come to mind ....|`|wdxTxXHOaa	thank goodness at least one person expressed some gratitude to her for her service (I 2nd that)<br>  <br>  i was beginning to wonder if we were worthy of it, given some of the mean spirited and petty anwers to her<br>  <br>  And to hell with Canada for showing such ingratitude towards our service personell

You will be coming from a fast city.  We are accustom to the slow pace of Jamaica.  Therefore, what we might call exciting, might be boring to you.  In any case, if you're spending as much as two months, why not visit several places in Jamaica including Old Harbour.  I think that would be more interesting and would give you less time to be bored.

uKWcgLLoaa	Best to just wait until you're old enough to leave home and go there yourself. You can't really convince your dad to do anything he doesn't want to do.<br>  <br>  By the way, Seattle is not particularly "cold"--at least not compared to cities like Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Boston, New York, etc. Temperatures are very moderate in Seattle. winter temperatures rarely get below freezing, and it is pleasant most of the year round. Of course, if your father is used to the warmth of southern California (which I personally find to be UNpleasant!) then he might have an issue with the weather of the Pacific Northwest. But I'd take Seattle's weather ANY DAY OF THE YEAR over Los Angeles'!|`|5yPw4TDfaa	It isnt really cold, it just rains alot.<br>  Here is our average weather:<br>  <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/monthly/98058?from=36hr_topnav_undeclared" rel="nofollow">http://www.weather.com/weather/monthly/9...</a><br>  It is a bit cold, but spring is good, And summer is actually really hot. My aunt came from texas and she couldn't stand it.|`|UBEzZuCDaa	You don't.  Your father is responsible for taking care of your whole family and unless he receives a trust fund and doesn't have to work to support you all then he needs to stay where his job is.  And you'll just have to dream and start saving your allowance so you can move there when you turn 18.  Preferably older though.

Traditional hideaway pubs sit side-by-side with modern swanky bars such as Bar Ha!Ha! at Trinity Street, and always attract a real mixture of clientele.<br>  <br>  While you're there you could treat yourself to an intellectual performance by heading to the ADC Theatre, Park Street, where talented university students showcase their work so you’re sure to catch a thought-provoking piece of drama or satire.<br>  <br>  Students are also to thank for the large number of value for money eateries in the area and many a lazy day can be spent sitting in one of the tea rooms enjoying a traditional English cream tea whilst watching the world go by. For peace of mind head to the particularly popular The Little Tea Room, All Saints Passage, where you’ll be able to peruse the library of world faith documents whilst enjoying an impressive array of dairy cream cakes.<br>  <br>  Even during the long summer holidays, when the students are no longer fluttering around the city (although some do work in the bars and cafes during their vacation) you’ll still find plenty of events taking place in Cambridge.<br>  <br>  May sees the Cambridge CAMRA Beer Festival serve up a selection of over 120 real ales to tempt even the most selective beer drinker, whilst July is when film makers from across the globe descend on the city for the Cambridge Film Festival. Towards the end of July the BBC Two Cambridge Folk Festival also arrives in town with internationally respected musicians of all genres delighting thousands of visitors.<br>  <br>  August brings the charm and tradition of Cambridge to life when the Cambridge Shakespeare Festival presents new interpretations of the great man’s work at the six most famous colleges in Cambridge. Tourists have the opportunity to watch some of Britain’s best actors take on performances such as Othello and King Lear in really beautiful settings. <br>  <br>  ?|`|qNHM4OH9aa	cant help sorry

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	I hope you have your money saved, because renting an apartment in New York City, specially in Manhattan, will cost you a pretty penny a month. There are, however, some very good places outside of Manhattan where rent is a little cheaper. You could still commute into and out of Manhattan.<br>  <br>  Other than the rent, New York City is a good city to live in.

8Initt1aaa	I live in between Tampa and Orlando. I live in a one bedroom apt. $700.00 a month. There are nice areas and poorer areas with cheaper rent. Either place should have something to meet your budget. Check out Lakeland, fairly big town 30 miles east of Tampa. In Lakeland I had a one bedroom for $460 a month. Food, I don't know because I don't know TX prices.|`|L9Cx70gtaa	I was thinking of going to Dallas myself from the Orlando area.  The draws are the well-priced beautiful brick houses and currently better economy.  There is a lot more industry in Dallas.<br>  However, my boyfriend's family has aging and disability issues and I noticed some house price drops in areas away from Orlando, so I'm mostly staying for my boyfriend's sake.<br>  I don't know what draws Texans here, though it happens.  Afraid of a little snow shower I guess.<br>  Orlando is #18 in dangerous cities. Dallas doesn't even make the list.  Florida unemployment is higher than the national average.  Texas is lower.<br>  Rent savings if there are any, becomes moot once you see the element here.<br>  You want rent savings and a nice area, try Raleigh, NC.. where the unemployment is however even higher than Florida.

But it also has a great New Year's festival (Hogmanay). These are also by far the most expensive times to travel there, and you have to book accommodation well in advance.

And they think they are victims to the slave-trade because the colour of their skin,I seriously dont know how they get it in their heads...They dress, act & try to talk like African Americans, and its not just a few its majority of their culture.You get pretty tired of it after being around them for so many years, not racist, just gets annoying.|`|7RbootLlaa	Usually these people who pretend to be something they are not.

I am not one of these people but seriously, the people at my school..... gosh.<br>  <br>  yeahh they are here though but they arent as hard-out as the americans.<br>  <br>  One of these NZ gangstas pinned my brother to a wall by his neck.<br>  <br>  Another reason is to 'be cool'. the thing is, so many people are taking this style that you stand out and are noticed alot more if you are a nice person rather than threatening.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
9LTWa08Laa	It begins on the first day of spring, March 20 of each year. Nowruz ceremonies are symbolic representations of two ancient concepts- the End and Rebirth. Norwruz was officially acknowledged and named "Nowruz" by a mythical Persian emperor, Shah Jamshid, from the Achaemenid Dynasty (500 BC) Nowruz in farsi means "New Day" and brings hope, peace, and prosperity to the world. It has been celebrated by any groups of people regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. A few days prior to the New Year, a special cover is spread on to the Persian Carpet or table in your household, called the Sofreh Haft-Seen or cloth of seven dishes, each one beginning with the Persian letter "Seen." The number 7 has been sacred in Iran since the ancient times, and the 7 dishes stand for the 7 angelic heralds of life: rebirth, health, happiness, prosperity, joy, patience, and beauty. Some of the other activities during Nowruz are Spring cleaning, buying new clothes, painting eggs, family reunion's, giving gifts, visiting neighbors and friends celebrating by having a picnic on the 13th day of spring<br>  <br>  only 11 more days till Nowruz- Hope it goes well (:|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The oldest of Iranian traditions, Nowruz (also referred to as eyd-i sar-i sal and eyd-i sal-i now) recalls the cosmological and mythological times of Iran. Its founder is a deputy of Ahura Mazda on earth, a position that imparts to him and the celebration a spiritual dimension and a particular sense of secular authority. The celebration is organized according to the dynamics of love between the Creator and his creation, the material world. The annual return of the spirits of the departed to their homes is celebrated by their offsprings according to primordial rites of which only a faint trace remains among the Persians and the Parsees of today. But that in no way diminishes the importance of the bond which is refreshed at every Nowruz. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.farsinet.com/noruz/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.farsinet.com/noruz/history.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ,|`|wnbiRwSKaa	Check these links out especially the 1st link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://irane-man.tripod.com/norooz.html" rel="nofollow">http://irane-man.tripod.com/norooz.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norouz" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norouz</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://middle-eastern-customs-holidays.suite101.com/article.cfm/norooz" rel="nofollow">http://middle-eastern-customs-holidays.s...</a>

In East Turkestan, school instruction is in Chinese and very few pieces of literature are published in Uyghur or other Turkic languages. <br>  <br>  The Chinese government gives economic incentives for Han Chinese to move to East Turkestan. In 1949, 75% of East Turkestan was Uyghur. By 2008, this percentage dropped to 29%.<br>  <br>  We are being forced to become second class citizens in our own homeland.<br>  <br>  We Uyghurs face religious persecution and discrimination at the hands of the Chinese authorities. <br>  <br>  Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can only use a state-approved version of the Koran; <br>  <br>  Men who work in the state sector cannot wear beards and women cannot wear headscarves.<br>  <br>  The Chinese state controls the management of all mosques, which  stifles religious traditions that have formed a crucial part of the Uyghur identity for centuries. <br>  <br>  Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend mosque. <br>  <br>  Religious figures may not hold high-level state positions or be school teachers. Some parts of Xinjiang has been used for nuclear testing, which as a result have killed many turks. <br>  <br>  A large number of individuals have been arrested by the government as political dissidents and that a large number have been executed.<br>  <br>  Chinese are robbing us of all natural resources and we have been forced to become a second class citizen on our own homeland.<br>  <br>  Ever since 9/11 they have conveniently branded us as Muslim terrorists to the world body and continued their repression.<br>  <br>  I request freedom minded people to support our cause<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/UyghurResearch.asp?mid=-1723487515&mid2=1892514197&mid3=824585852" rel="nofollow">http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/UyghurR...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uyghuramerican.org/forum/showthread.php?t=9848" rel="nofollow">http://www.uyghuramerican.org/forum/show...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjHXz2Vm5Yg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjHXz2Vm5...</a>|`|GbGP60jsaa	Why do you ask this question so many times?

JGrpDLKcaa	Age does play a factor in building muscle, as you will grow into any body you have when you're young. That being said, it's never a bad time to get fit, and look good. To get 'six-pack abs' you need to do two things: lose weight and build muscle. If you're already skinny, then there really isn't much fat burning to do. That being said, if you are underweight, you might try eating more. A healthy diet, with plenty of protein will do wonders. Be sure to even that out with a good cardio workout (running, biking, or even walking). Any muscle you attain won't be visible though a layer of fat.<br>  <br>  As for the muscle itself, situps and crunches are good. You wont see change in a matter of days, but change always comes with time. Start out small and work your way up. In no time you'll be able to rock a few hundred every day. If you want to step it up, remember that anything that decreases stability will increase how hard the muscles work. An exercise ball is a great way to do this. Also, as with working out any muscle, stepping up the weight will step up the process.<br>  <br>  Situps, crunches, abdominal twists, standing side bends are some good ones. Don't rush, and hold the exercise for a few seconds each time. If you're looking to do something while stuck somewhere, just tense the muscle. Hold it for a few and release.
17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	My best advice is DON'T move to Los Angeles.  California is no longer the land of "Milk and Honey" like it was years ago. The recession has hit California harder than other states. Jobs are presently almost non existent. There are some communities in the area where the  unemployment rate is close to 20% with the average being 10%. You will find it EXTREMELY difficult finding a job (especially if you think you're an actress). You will pay roughly $1200 a month for a tiny studio apartment, and you will be living in the heaviest taxed area in the country.  Moving here before the economy recovers would be the biggest mistake of your life. Living in californias nothing like what you see portrayed on television.<br>  <br>  Remember that before you can rent an apartment you must be 18. Minors can not sign a ciontract, and a rental agreement is a contract, and once you sign a rental contract you are LEGALLY bound to pay it. But if you aren't going to listen and come here any way at least save enough money to get you back to Texas is things don't go the way you planned.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Texas has more jobs than LA so I somehow doubt that.<br>  <br>  As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City, it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult. Just recently the unemployment rate went from 9.4% to 10.1%!!<br>  <br>  You will also need about $10,000 to start off.<br>  <br>  Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Look elsewhere. In 3 months, you'll be back in Texas with no improvement whatsoever.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	I live about 2 hrs north of Los Angeles and have been in the Los Angeles area often.  My rent is still in the $1500-$2000 range.  That only includes trash and no other utilities.  Rent will vary a lot depending on the neighborhood you want to live in and what you think "decent" is.  If you move here you HAVE to have a car, there is basically little or no public transportation.  Honestly, living in Southern California my entire life I think LA is the worst example of what California has to offer.  Crowded, expensive, dirty.  <br>  <br>  Be prepared for high living expenses.|`|wmk4mgkGaa	BRING A FAN! it gets really hot near here.

The Norwegian city I live in has TGIF, 7-11, Burger King and McDonald's, but I can't think of any others. Walmart doesn't really exist here (except as Asda in the UK), but there are always many local or European chains in major cities. <br>  <br>  All of these countries have regional chains of grocery stores/cooperatives, restaurants, clothing, etc (UK has the most) so it's difficult to answer your question. Out of the countries I've lived in, UK and Sweden had the most, and Norway probably the least. You'll find that larger cities tend to have more chains, but also more choice of independent stores.

You will find McDonald's, Starbucks, and Hard Rock Cafe in most places, but very rarely others.<br>  <br>  European countries have some of their own chains.  There are a few Starbucks clones in England for example, like Caffe Nero.<br>  <br>  However, independent stores and restaurants vastly outnumber chains in every European city, and it's very easy to find local places.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Places like San Marino, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and Iceland.

6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	If you are traveling in the day time then Tr-Rail/Metro-Rail (approx $6 - $7 each way) is by far your best option.  First of all Supershuttle does NOT service FLL.  The company that does doesn't serve Coral Gables so you'll have to make transfers anyway.  A cab will run  between $80 & $100 depending on where in the Gables & how lost the driver gets.<br>  <br>  The Tri-rail/Metro-rail option:<br>  At FLL take the free tri-rail shuttle (go to the County bus stop to the left outside arrivals) Wait for the white Tri-rail mini-bus shuttle. Take it to Tri-rail station. (about 10 min) Buy ticket & board to "Metro-Rail Transfer station" (about $3.00 weekdays, $4.00 weekends). When you get to the transfer station (only about 30 minutes), get off & pay $2.00 for Metro-Rail (another train) (8 quarters or buy them at vending machine). Take Metro-Rail south direct to Coral Gables (about 30 min).  Now the question is WHERE in Coral Gables.  Coral Gables is BIG. There are TWO Gables stations:  the first ("Coral Gables" will take you to a Trolley Bus stop which bus will take you (I believe it's free)  into "downtown Coral Gables" & Miracle Mile where most -- but not all -- of the hotels are.  From here you can bus or be picked up or take a cab. The second C. Gables stop is "University of Miami," which is right across from the main entrance to the University & is in the south part of Coral Gables.  If you're staying at Holiday-Inn University, its' also across the street.<br>   <br>  Metro-Rail runs every 10-30 min. depending on time of day, but Tri-Rail is a commuter line that runs every half hour at rush hours; every hour during mid-day; every two hours on weekends and not at all from about 9:30 PM to 5:00 am. So if your timing is right this works. Go to www.Tri-rail.com<br>  <br>  If you post your hotel we can give you better info.|`|A7cWzCmpaa	i would get a car if i were you public transport in miami is not great.|`|60b2a2e456bb4fd7ccdb247a79ff9c92aa	supershuttle ( is a blue van) ask in the airport.<br>  it only goes from terminal to terminal ,so, Your detination will be (MIA) Miami International Airport<br>  once in MIA take the metro bus "J" south and You Will be in Gables in a blink of an eye(the cheapest and fastest way)<br>  <br>  places to check.<br>  supershuttle .com(get the phone number and call them)<br>  mamidade.gov (transit map)<br>  <br>  <br>  second choice;(I don't like it) the tri-rail to metro rail untill <br>  Douglas road station in coral gables|`|9743eaede0d1aef42bf2a1654796ba9daa	for johns answer, the metro doesn't go all the way to ft. lauderdale|`|X5plg4eVaa	walk.....

LfAYsTd1aa	There are low class apartments around for your budget but my experience with apartments is that everyone wants a long term lease.<br>  <br>  The McSherry Pensione House on Pelaez Street in downtown Cebu City was about P8000 per month for a hotel room with aircon, private bathroom and cable TV.<br>  <br>  Not sure if you are interested but you can arrange a boarding house room to fit your budget.<br>  <br>  I know of a boarding house 10 minutes walk to Ayala Mall. They used to have a very large room, I would guess about 20 square metres, with private bathroom and shared kitchen facilities for about P5000 per month. It was on the corner of Tojong Street and C. Rosal Street, next to a couple of small shops.<br>  <br>  There are many other boarding houses for you to check out around the city. All will have shared kitchen and bathroom. The better rooms will have private bathrooms.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  Regards; Jim Sibbick

But I would not recommend eating in Universal, the food is terrible, eat at the western looking restaurant right outside, and also you are in city walk and there are much better restaurants. You pay so much money for food and you don't even get to enjoy it. Just eat a few snacks, and have a big nice dinner.|`|d823KyUsaa	No.  General admission is simply $67.

AA11549595	I only had 8 hours in Helsinki so you are lucky! I took a bus tour - go to the tourist info office in the city centre - and you will see the buses parked outside. When I was there they had big maps painted on the outsides of them. You'll get to see all the main sights within a few hours. You should check out the main website <a href="http://www.visithelsinki.fi/In_English/Visitor.iw3" rel="nofollow">http://www.visithelsinki.fi/In_English/V...</a> and request their excellent brochures.|`|T5DbLLgQaa	First of all, the Helsinki-Vantaa airport is not in Helsinki but in the neighbouring city Vantaa, so it means that you have to take a metro, bus or a local train to Helsinki first. There are some malls like Stockmann, Forum and the like in central Helsinki, as well as some art/general museums (National Museum, Kiasma the modern art museum, Ateneum art museum), Linnanm?ki Amusement Park, theatres and music venues to visit, of course compared to New York the city centre is smallish but I'm sure you will find at least something to do and see there! Take a look at the given website for example! Welcome to my home country Finland!

As for the jobs still available, good luck finding that needle (job) in the haystack (city).<br>  <br>  As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City, it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult. Just recently the unemployment rate went from 9.4% to 10.1%!!<br>  <br>  You will also need about $10,000 to start off.<br>  <br>  Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Look elsewhere. In 3 months, you'll be back in New York with no improvement whatsoever.
f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola.  I take it you are a dual citizen?  Where do you consider yourself a permanent resident.  If its the USA then bring your US ID.|`|8ebYteQsaa	Take both.  Try not to travel by september-november because of the hurricanes... or plan in advanced so you won't get surprised
iN27E3WCaa	A lot of extended-stay places (Homewood Suites, Residence Inn, etc) offer 2 bedroom suites.|`|H0MFNydyaa	many hotel/motels offer adjoining rooms

But you must have a prescription from a doctor.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	For more information about drug contact: <br>  <br>  Email: info@planetizen.com<br>  Website: www.planetizen.com<br>  <br>  Probably you may not get it without doctor's prescription.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|8cc98e2cb46c2658bbe3bb50f1182822aa	From your doctor.<br>  Or, any gym. just find the big roid monkey and ask questions.
c844e94379547d7dc8e712d6f28b9e05aa	If you get a good school, a good house with good family.<br>  It'll be nice.<br>  Salvador and Florianópolis, in my opinion, are good cities for student foreigners.|`|IZbOJwDIaa	Public school is waste of time<br>  Private school there are several very good, but very expensive.|`|GQTaKHCvaa	DO!<br>  <br>  I am going on one next year, and I am really excitied about it (you can email me if you have questions).<br>  <br>  The thing is, the point of a foreign exchange isn't really to go to school. I can't say I think Brazilian schools will be the best (even though lots of them are private school), but you get other sorts of cultural learning through an exchange!|`|dj00wdjKaa	Private schools in Brazil are good. I had a very good experience in my school days here. Not only because of all that I learned but also because of all the friends I made.|`|4NfAOlGaaa	Yes, but u MUST be in a privet school :)

urHPuzMsaa	You should place your question in the correct category. This category is for travel to Las Vegas not San Jose. You will get a better answer when you place it in the correct category.|`|XvBPAFqOaa	My son lives there and I fly up every other month. Not a whole lot but will be happening soon. Children's Museum is really good and take a drive to Monetary Bay. Cool things to do their like the huge Aquarium.
f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	If by carry you mean physically have it at all times, no.  In fact, depending on the type of visa you have you may not even need one.  If you are traveling on the Visa Waiver Program the CPB agents will make certain you have it before you get in to the US.
WinDlsjWaa	Chicago, IL would be the next biggest city close to Detroit. Another would be Cleveland, a major city, but not like Chicago, or Detroit for that matter. Other ones would include Columbus and Cincinatti, OH or even Pittsburgh, PA. But Chicago is the 3rd largest American city, so Chicago.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO IGNORANT AND ARROGANT THEY YELL THEIR QUESTION AT ME.. I CAN'T HEAR THEM.<br>  <br>  Didn't anyone ever tell you that TYPING ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS is considered IGNORANT and RUDE?|`|2cc75788c0a85d7434cad7a54afd37ecaa	Warren Michigan borders Detroit to the north and has a tad under 400,000 people living there. That puts it on par with the population of Pittsburgh.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	TOLEDO, Ohio!  <br>  <br>  Sure, you have to cross the State Line, but it is the biggest city closest to Detroit as the crow flies.|`|7IVEMAg8aa	You got Chicago about 5 hours to the west. Toronto is about 5 hours east. Cleveland is about 2 hours away. Windsor is just across the river.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	flint, ann arbor, lansing|`|9ByGtWiuaa	It depends on how you define "big?"  Grand Rapids is the next largest city in Michigan (I'd say half mill. population in metro area) it is located about 2-2.5 hours northwest of Detroit.  There is also Ann Arbor which is close to Detroit and Lansing is 1/2 way between Grand Rapids and Detroit.|`|z0khlFBlaa	Cross the river into Windsor, Ontario, Canada.|`|NgDSykSVaa	Flint
AA10042296	Some older buildings may not have the 3-prong receptacles. So check the plug and if it has 3-prongs, go to the hardware store and buy a cheap adapter.|`|iufvf8Jaaa	Yes it will work over in Guadalajara.|`|c571b2ca20c4d7a914a67a96a3cd39d3aa	yes the power is all the same in North America, Canada, Mexico, USA.<br>  110 volts, the plugs are the same as well.|`|AA11300203	SI
9oiZ6Rmbaa	Aside from the Byward Market area, you can check out Elgin Street.  A fair selection of bars and restaurants to choose from, and take-out for the stumble home.|`|7QERhhRJaa	Rideau Street is where you click. It brings you close to the ByWard Market, Elgin Street and Bank Street. So Rideau is the place to be.|`|il3kWyF5aa	Definitely the Market By which is downtown. There's also a great night life on the other side of the river, Gatineau (M Lounge, St-Ex, Boite a Chansons,etc). Have Fun!|`|W2GwQRPLaa	The market is the best, but there is also Bank St - a bunch of pubs and clubs are scattered along the street- The area of Bank and Maclaren's is roughly the area (just google mapped it).|`|K0HFbPxYaa	its not a street but there are a lot of bars/pubs in the byward market and its right downtown so you can get to anything. i totally recommend a place called Pub 101 in the market|`|2OfGuVKAaa	Definitely the market (cornerstone bar and grill is awesome) but for a street, yeah, elgin is fun.
43bb1de059cf4886a340467b97276fecaa	Take the Q17 bus to Hillside Avenue/187 street. Cross the street and transfer to either the N22 or N24 bus. Both go straight to the mall.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Take the number 7 train from Flushing to Woodside and get the LIRR to Carle Place. The Roosevelt Field Mall is walking distance from the station. The train, one way, will cost 7 dollars off peak and weekends but it’s the fastest way to get there.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Take the number 7 to the 74th Street/Roosevelt Avenue station and go downstairs and get the Jamaica bound F train to the last stop, 179th Street. Go to the street and take the N22 or N24 right to Roosevelt Avenue. The bus will take about an hour.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it’s worth the time you save to take the LIRR. Take the Long Island Railroad to the Mineola station.
mFf8CqAraa	The brown recluse spider is NOT naturally found in Oregon. However, the hobo spider does occur in Oregon and the Northwest states. It is commonly mistaken for brown recluse, and can cause the same effects (skin lesions). <br>  <br>  The brown recluse are found primarily in the Midwest and are native to the United States from the southern Midwest south to the Gulf of Mexico. The native range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, it is native from central Texas to western Georgia. They are generally not found west of the Rocky Mountains.|`|vnJ8mC81aa	Brown recluse live in places in washington state so I dont know what they are talking about.
