20090307000232AAwGm7q	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	Tulsa, OK - Best Restaurants?	I'm going to Tulsa in a couple of months for a concert with some friends. We're staying for a weekend and none of us have ever been to the area before, so we have no idea which restaurants are good.      We're not looking for anything expensive, nothing 5 star, we can't afford to spend too much. Anything Italian, Mexican, Chinese... and good burger joints or pizza places and maybe some places that specialize in desserts?      We'd rather avoid chain restaurants. We're not opposed to them or anything if there's nothing better, but we'd rather try locally owned places while we're in town. We can go the P.F. Chang's or Olive Garden in our own towns. lol      Thanks!
