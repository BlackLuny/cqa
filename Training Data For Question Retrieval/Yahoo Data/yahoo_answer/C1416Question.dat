20090226101455AAVWS7X	Social Science;Psychology	Should i even associate myself with a her? please read?	There's this girl in my class who is really getting on my nerves. First of all, she has really big boobs, so she flaunts it like if it's an award. Secondly, she cheats on her tests and anything that involves thinking, yet she gets all a's. Third, he's a slut. Every guy she meets, she lingers around them and flirts like a horny person. so today when she had to grade my  work, she put down that it was sloppy. But yet when I graded her game it was a cheap candyland rip off that had no original qualities. oh yeah, she strives for damn attention everywhere she goes and thinks she can get by life on the easy way and that's not necessary. every person thinks she's this nice innocent girl. Should i even associate myself with a person like her? or should I just shake it off?      P.S. i'm working with her on an upcoming project

20090226101536AAKRuZn	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies, how important is it to YOU, to be in a "relationship"  with a MAN who believes in GOD ?	Is it everything to you.  If not,  then it should.   I come across people   here daily,  who do not believe in God.  I have been raised in the   church all my life.  And I would never marry,  or be in a serious   relationship with somebody who is an Athiest.  I think that would truly   compromise my integrity as a man, and a human being.  But I am open   to being a witness and telling them about The Lord.  So it would be   wrong for one to ignore,  when that could be your chance to draw someone in.  But on a serious note ladies,  or gents.  How important is it to you,  to be in a serious relationship with a person who does   believe in God.  Does it matter to you....................

Since it's such a bad thing for a man to take fake testerone to tell his body to make more muscle, shouldn't it be illegal for a woman to take synthetic versions of her sex hormones recreationally for something she doesn't medically need?

I am not asking you permission, never, but it is your comments what I want. Tell me, what do you think about a girl who cries for every failure she makes, but makes up for it and never quits, but she has been failing for about 6 months, but even though it may be hard, she still moves on and makes up for her failures, each and every one of them. It could be anything, such as relationships breakdowns, struggling to lose weight, failing a class subject, losing a best friend, winning a contest, becoming popular, getting rewards for great achievements, whatever. tell me, what do you think about this girl? After you answer that, tell me what you think about the same question, except it is not a girl, but a boy. The point is, should there be only one gender to cry more than the other, or do you feel uncomfortable to see your own gender fail tell me, what do you want them to do?

This study used magnetoencephalography imaging to discover, loosely speaking, that men were right-brained when contemplating beautiful objects, while women engaged more of their entire brains.      So, is this because men and women are hardwired differently when it comes to processing the idea of beauty?  Or is this the general effect of social conditioning to think differently about it (literally)?
20090226105617AAsNIlO	Social Science;Sociology	Why are we responsible for protecting people that cannot or will  not protect themselves?	Let's start with the fact that I have a huge amount of respect for anyone that is willing to put their life on the line in defense of another.      My question is this, why shouldn't people be responsible for protecting themselves?      I am neither a thug nor a convicted felon. I work extremely hard to get everything that my family and I have, so I am in no way looking to victimize anyone whatsoever, and still I am no respecter of the law. I respect God, but not the law due to the fact that it is so corrupt.      I would also like to point out that the police cannot help you until you are already a victim.      I have never called for police assistance and I never will. I know what it is to put my life on the line at work and have survived more than most here would believe...that is why I ask, why is it my responsibility to spend my tax dollars protecting people that cannot or will not protect themselves?      It is my responsibility and my responsibility alone, to protect myself and my family, not someone else's. When I meet my end, I will be a man about it and not "cry" for assistance.       Why can't everyone be this way?      Actually, I have studied martial arts since I was a child, and have competed professionally in MMA. Does that make me tough? More importantly it doesn't matter if it does or not, the point remains the same...people should be responsible for themselves.      It isn't "vigilantism" to protect one's self, family and property. I think that the police are woefully incapable of doing that when it comes down to it, which is my point. If they were capable of it, they would be there before you dialed 911, but they can't be. They are nothing more than a clean up crew, but that's not their fault.      Why do we need them?.

It's not that I dislike American girls, it's just I get tired off the whole "What car do you drive?"  "How old are you?" "I want this, I want that!"   It seems like any highly attractive American girl under 21 seems to think that she's God's gift to men and can dictate terms.  I have two degrees (B.A, B.F.A) and I'm working on my Master's, I put myself through school and I pay my bills, and I'll be damned if I let some little b**ch who practically just graduated high school talk to me like she can actually tell me what to do.      I've just found that girls from South America are so sweet, and they actually seem to care about you, not your car or what part of town you live in.  They're not demanding.  Similar to Eastern European girls.  I know a guy in his early 30s who goes to South America and attractive teenage girls are all over him (I've seen pics), and he's a $12 an hour-making junior college drop-out.

20090226110946AA84lSt	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible for a person to have an effect on another person without that person being aware?	In my situation, I'm sure I'm having an effect on a guy and he doesn't even realize it. I notice him picking up my mannerisms and doing and saying things that I've done or said recently that normally he would never say or do. If I turn my head or make a certain face and we're standing in a group of people talking he'll end up a split second later doing the same thing. Or when we talked about a bar/ restaurant we attended with friends the other day I describe it to him as an intimate place as it was smaller from other places we all had went and he laughed at me because of how proper I speak and how he didn't understand. Then two days later I heard him describe the spot in a similar fashion. We have two very distinct signatures when we sign forms, he signs by drawing a picture and I sign by just putting my 3 initials, after he saw that one day he started signing his name by his 3 initials as well. All of this is really cute but I'm just wondering if I'm truly having an effect on him and he just doesn't know it, if I'm looking at this too much, or what?      **If it helps, a month ago I did tell him that i was attracted to him but he said that he didn't really see a future with us so we agreed to just be friends but every one in a while we may flirt with one another ( he's a big flirt). The thing is I enjoy being his friend but I still really like him and knowing that I'm having an effect on him is frustrating, and I'm wondering if I'm very slowly starting to attract him.

20090226140116AAwR93z	Social Science;Psychology	How do you get over  extremely intense feelings of anger toward someone?	I have been with my hubby for 10 years. For most of them, my mil has been a bully towards me. I felt my hubby didn't defend me the way i wanted to be defended, and he felt he was defending me and always said he knows how to handle his mom better than i do. This caused alot of problems in my marriage because i always felt as if his mom was very hurtful wiht her comments, and he would either be in the next room or just tell me to let it go. I wound up building up lots of anger and one day i confronted her at a family party (it wasn't even that bad, i just put her in her place and i never did before), well it backfired and became this whole big drama scene. My hubby didn't defend me and really took more of a neutral stance. Which of course caused a big problem with us and we argued alot over this (many extended family members saw how he had split loyalties and i found it extremely hurtful and embaressing). We decided we needed marriage counseling and after completing counseling, we have been doing soo much better as a couple. We have learned techniques on how to deal with her as a married couple and to always stay a team and supportive of eachother at all times.Which has been amazing and i love him for this change. We just got back from our 2nd honeymooon, and i couldn't love my husband more right now, but I have this black cloud of anger hanging over me. I don't know how to get over my feelings of anger and hatred towards my mil. I think about her at night, going over and over in my head the hurtful, rude, manipulative things she has done, how she turned my sil against me and has talked about me where other family members look at me like i am crazy and i just can't get over it. I went to therapy to try to get some help getting over my angry feelings, and the therapist told me after listening to my stories about my mil, that my mil has borderline personality disorder and she is narcissistic. Which my mil probably is those things, but i need help getting over my anger towards her. Has anyone ever felt intense anger towards someone and was able to get over it? And if so, how did you get over it?

20090226153649AA7RLn1	Social Science;Psychology	Sexual attraction to adults who look like children ... is something wrong with that?	There's a girl I go to college with who is 18, but she still looks like a child. She's very small (maybe 4 foot 10) and has a thin undeveloped body with a cute round "little girl" face. She has to wear children's clothes, so she wears little skirts and dresses like a kid would wear. She has a cute little high voice as well.      I was wondering how an adult male could be sexually attracted to her and NOT have something a bit wrong with him. But a guy I spoke to said that's ridiculous because she's an adult, and it would actually be discrimination NOT to date her because of her appearance (which she can't help).      The thing is, she is less developed physically than I was at 9, so to me that sounds like he's saying it would have been okay and natural for adult men to be attracted to me at the age of 9.      I know legally it's absolutely fine, and I know it's not illegal to be attracted to 9 year olds either (only if you act on that attraction).      I was just wondering about the psychology of it - sort of wrong, or perfectly healthy and normal?

20090225115204AAHee12	Social Science;Psychology	What can I do to stop being so miserable?	I am a college student. Surprisingly I have no friends. I eat by myself every day. I don't have enough money to pay for my tuition. I tried to take out student loans, but I was rejected even with a cosigner. My GPA is falling rapidly, even though I study constantly. I study every night, then when the weekend comes, I stay in my room by myself because I don't wanna be that kid to go to a party by himself and not know anybody. I see people party all the time and do just as good, if not better in school than me. The only family I have is my father, who I do not talk to. I was recently rejected for a paid internship which was basically my way of ending my financial crisis. I don't have a job or any money. Everything is going wrong and I don't know what to do. Can someone give me some advice, because I am starting to completely lose it?

20090226163351AA1QBuI	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Was this woman being sexist & racist?	I remember I was in a parking lot of a supermarket. I had just got my groceries, and was sitting in the car ready to drive off. I turned my head back to back up, and had to wait for some cars to pass.      Some woman was in a car sitting there, and blocking the guy behind her. The guy honks his horn. The woman was white, and the guy was black.      The woman gets out of her car, and her face is bright red. And she began screaming at the guy. I don't remember all the details of what she said, but it was basically cursing, calling him names, and ranting.      The black guy was in the car, and he was raising his hands in a gesture of "I don't want any trouble..." and trying to get her to calm down.      After she got done name-calling, she screamed... "HEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPP!!!! HEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLPPPPP!!!!!"      Over & over, trying to get someone to come. This kind of made me angry because it made me think about how there was once a time when white women would falsely accuse a black man of something heinous, like assault or rape. Or scream "help" and a lynch mob would then lynch the fellow. But it made me angry, because what if some cop is near by and apprehends him when he's done nothing wrong? Or a group of guys come by and attack him?      Anyway, after she got done screaming help, thankfully no one heard her (or came), because we were far from the entrance of the market. The guy drives around her and she's nodding her head like she was victorious. Then I guess she notices I was watching because she glances at me all angrily, and I turn my head away, back out, and head home.      Do you think she screamed help because he was a man, and was black? Do you think she would've screamed "HELP" if it had been a white woman that honked her horn at her?

20090226161443AASA3Wy	Social Science;Psychology	Feelings when listening to music.?	It was late.    I lay only slightly tired thinking about the various events that had occurred that day. As I turned my body over, I noticed a small gleam of light reflect off the back of my iPod. I stared at it for several seconds, before deciding it was appropriate to listen too my iPod until I was tired enough to fall asleep.   I skipped through, pressing play on various albums as I passed. I think I listened to John Mayer's 'Continuum' from beginning to end until deciding to listen to Jeff Buckley's Grace.   It was an album I had heard many times, so I wasn't expecting any surprises. I listened to the first track which i liked, but when it ended I was happy to hear the beginning of probably my favorite song on the album and also the title track, 'Grace'. I was enjoying the song as I usually would but then it got to like the breakdown after the second verse where it starts to get more powerful. I got some shivers down my spine as his voice got higher and higher (which is pretty common when I listen to music that has properties i really like) when all of a sudden, I felt like I had been taken away by the angels. My whole face went numb and I remember feeling as if my nostrils had closed. My hands opened causing my iPod to tumble to the floor, and my whole body had a feeling one could only compare to a glorious orgasm.   It was at around 3:30 mins into the song. It seriously was the weirdest feeling ever, when i got back to normal, i couldn't understand what had went on, but I knew it was caused by the music.   I wanna know if this is a normal occurrence or what. The line earlier in which i compared it to an orgasm was what worried me the most. I mean, should a heterosexual male really be feeling pleasures beyond the common orgasm whilst a mans voice invades his ears?   It freaked me out in a way. But it was ******* amazing at the same time.
