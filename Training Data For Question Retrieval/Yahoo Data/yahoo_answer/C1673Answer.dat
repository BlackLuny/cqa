3onAxcR0aa	Well i went to Kardamena in '06 which is in kos and i went in october  and i got burnt!!    We went to the town and most shops were still open at 9 at night.  Obviously i didn't go to the bars as i was only 13 ha!    Have a nice time it is a nice island and im sure you will enjoy it.|`|1lOMaIFxaa	i went to kos in 2004 for all summer. and yes october is when the places shut down...plus it wasnt very lively!|`|xztT6WYDaa	I stayed in Kos Town in October a couple of years ago and the weather was lovely.  We came back with a tan.  Its a comfortable heat.  We only had one downpour of rain one evening !.    We got lots of little extras such as Free Sunbeds and Parasols.  Bargain shopping, and free drinks or desert after a meal.    We found plenty open.  Kos Old Town is lovely.   Kos New Town Harbour area is quite lively.    By the way you dont need it to be very hot to get a tan - you will only burn !    Tingaki is a bit on the quiet side if I can remember.
aps4PbnLaa	No, not in my opinion.  Here are some facts about that.  There is an underlying threat from terrorism in Cambodia. Attacks, although unlikely, could be indiscriminate, including places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. On 29 July 2007 two small explosive devices were found (a third exploded) at the Cambodian/Vietnamese Friendship Monument (off Sothearos Boulevard) in Phnom Penh.   There have been incidents of politically motivated violence.   You should avoid crowds and political gatherings.    You are advised to keep away from large gatherings, demonstrations and political meetings. You should also avoid expressing forcible opinions on Cambodian politics or culture.  You should never get involved with drugs; penalties for drug offences including those involving Class C drugs are severe. Prison sentences can be long and served in grim conditions.  You should not take photographs in or near airports or military bases. You should ask permission before taking pictures of members of the public especially monks and other religious figures. When entering religious sites it is a courtesy to dress in appropriate clothing, avoiding shorts and torn clothing. You are expected to remove your shoes when entering temples and private accommodation.    Now on to the crim!  You should be aware of the risk of robbery and other crime (including sexual offences) especially in Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville and Siem Reap, particularly after dark. You should take sensible precautions and be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers especially when travelling around the cities.     There is no public transport system. Travel is by privately owned Tuk-Tuks or motorcycle taxi (moto) for which you have to negotiate the fare. Travel between the larger cities is by coach, minibus or taxi. You are advised to remain vigilant against petty theft should when using transportation.  Since June 2008, there is an increase in reports of foreign nationals who have been mugged when walking in downtown Phnom Penh by thieves brandishing knives and guns. Foreigners have also been victims of random street crime in other cities in Cambodia and have had bags, cameras and mobile phones snatched or have been mugged both after dark and increasingly during daylight hours.    ATMs have been installed in Phnom Penh and other cities, and you are urged to take care when withdrawing cash and to be aware of your surroundings. Travel by car will reduce the risk as will limiting night time travel around Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville and Siem Reap to well-lit public areas.     You are urged to avoid isolated areas after dark, including beaches in the Sihanoukville area, where there have been an increasing number of violent incidents. There are high levels of firearm ownership in Cambodia and guns are sometimes used to resolve disputes. However, these disputes rarely involve foreigners.    Sexual offences have taken place against foreigners in various locations.     Banditry and extortion, including cases involving poorly disciplined military and police personnel, continue in some rural areas, particularly at night in areas between Snoul, Kratie and Stung Treng in the north eastern provinces.    There have been a small number of grenade / bomb attacks, although most have been linked to business or personal disputes. There is no evidence to suggest that Western interests have been the targets of these attacks. However, there is a danger foreigners might get caught up in any further attacks.    Some foreigners have reported local officials at land border entry points imposing unofficial fees or inflating visa prices. You are advised to use caution.  |`|MbtTBd8Taa	the people are nice in cambodia esp in the countryside, phnom penh can be dangerous in the late evening if wondering alone, my girlfriend felt slightly intimidated as it got dark, but this was mostly fuelled by the horrible past of the country.    bag snatching is common (as everywhere though), sometimes with knives i was told but i never had problems taking tuk tuks at night after drinking in bars on the otherside of town to where i was staying.    theres obviously a lot of poverty and with that comes beggars and child sellers.    not sure if i could cope living there but for a short time as a tourist its an amazing and interesting and i would say safe place, as long as you;re sensible!!    check my website link below|`|s6BidMYTaa	The countryside is safer than the cities, Cambodian people are very hospitable.|`|AA11099449	Not for foreigners
4c40359dda352a142bef0d9ff9cf44e1aa	It's common in many urban cities and countries to have more than one international airport like the case of Tokyo and London. The Al Maktoum International Airport will complement and expand the operations of the Dubai International.This means that both airports will have specific regional flights to serve. A high speed railway is also planned to connect the two airports. Oh, and note that the expected turnover of the new airport is in 2017, not really a "few year's time". |`|ZRG18vnQaa	probably turn into a 5 star hotel|`|KhckzHN9aa	I can't find a source that specifically sites what they will do with the previous international airport. But from reading about Al-Maktoum international airport, it's going to be one-of-a-kind.  That being said, it is highly probable that the other airport will be demolished and the land sold to a wide variety of developers.
xsSGEbiPaa	What was once rolling farmland became a nuclear research lab, then purchased as a potential site for a second Atlanta airport. Now Dawson Forest is a demonstration forest and wildlife management area.     In 1956 what had been 10,000 acres of rolling farm-land, became a research facility for the military. Lockheed operated the Georgia Nuclear Aircraft Laboratory (GNAL), which among other things, tried to develop a nuclear powered aircraft. A small 10 megawatt reactor was used in radioactive material research for about 12 years. The area has been continuously monitored for radiation and no health or safety threat has been found. Out of the 10,000 acres, 3 acres continue to be restricted from public use as a precaution. In 1971 Lockheed decommissioned the site and sold the land to the City of Atlanta, ostensibly for a second metropolitan airport.    If you want to go check it out, here is the link to the forrest info.  http://www.gfc.state.ga.us/ForestManagem...
JBwzip4eaa	yes it's possible, you should not have any probleme at work, but your difficulty's will start when you will go to mak shoping and visiting contry sid.    |`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You might get away with it for a couple of months, but if you were staying longer, you really would have to learn French. And learning a language is much easier if it's a full immersion thing, like when you're in the country and hear it spoken all the time, and have plenty of opportunities to practise. |`|AA11304025	You will need to speak French to work|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Not really. Why not make the attempt? If you are surrounded by the language, you cannot help but pick it up a bit. It's a bit rude to not try.    This is an excellent opportunity that you should embrace. Take part in where you are.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Many English people visit France on holiday for a month without being able to speak French, it's the working which will cause a problem.  On holiday, you can shop in supermarkets and recognise food items, but being able to say "please" and "thank-you" anywhere in the World is appreciated.  Without any language skills at all life can be quite tricky - how do you explain what you want in a pharmacy for example?  French people do expect you to make an effort, I'm afraid (and I have relatively near French ancestors) and can be very helpful if you do.  If you cant be bothered, neither can they!  Get yourself a dictionary and phrase book and learn the basics before you go.|`|20226e6187d57d2742c7b865538fa529aa	It is certainly possible, although I would highly recommend learning at least enough French to be polite. You will be a social outcast if you don't say "Bonjour", "Pardon" etc at the appropriate times.    Whether it is "normal" to speak English at work depends entirely on the job. If you work for a foreign company it's entirely possible that there will be other non-French people and that therefore speaking English will be acceptable. However French would be the norm in the vast majority of workplaces.     For a couple of months I wouldn't let it put you off, but use it as an opportunity to try and learn a little French!|`|uqb7dkBbaa	I work for a British company in France and speak English at work so I'll say yes, you can find that kind of work. But I also am French and can go buy a bottle of something to drink without fearing to have bought paraffin oil because I cannot read the name. You can probably go by for a couple of months, I wouldn't recommend it for more than a week or two. It is bad for the moral to walk around and not be able to understand a single word day after day after day..|`|n3LLORmWaa	Not really.  The French have a strong affinity for their language, and expect people in France to speak French.  In France, it is better to try to speak French even if you're not so good at it than to speak a foreign language.  Not speaking French at all, particularly if you are staying there for a while (not just a few days as a tourist), will be viewed as an insult.|`|Q6XYkUUNaa	Yes. Sort of.  The only job you would be able to take is working helping someone who is English to restore a property. I have seen this type of work advertised 3 times in the last 18 months. In each case the pay has been restricted to board and lodging plus, in only 2 cases, 100 per week pocket money.  I know of one lady who speaks no French at all and has been living here for 5 years,but, she employs a full time interpreter!  I would have like to answer 'no', because it would be impossible to get a full time living wage over here without speaking fluent French, but the above shows it is possible, but highly unsatisfactory|`|2b27c4496c4784176510cc9ec0ab88abaa	No, also when you will get your visa to stay and renew it you will be asked to learn French, if not this one wont be renewed.    At the same time I will find this silly...why dont you want to learn French if you want to live there? why dont you go to England? like this you wont have any language problem.|`|l6zeZaNIaa	It will be hard, as the sad reality is not that people here don't "want" to speak English, it's that they "can't", very few people speak English here, and I've never seen someone who speak only English at work. It's true that there are many English people who don't speak a word of French, but they are either retired, self employed, craftmen, they hold bed and breakfast for English speaking people...|`|AA10218593	Why would anybody WANT to do that? French is the world's most beautiful language. Thousands and thousands of people slogging away at French lessons miles from France would jump at the opportunity to live in France for a while to learn a bit of the language. |`|cCvA9kMiaa	It is possible, if you are loaded. Look at Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, they all live in South of France from time to time and they all don't speak French. They all have interpreters and bodyguards to do the hard work of communicating and safeguarding.  You may work in an English speaking firm with English speaking persons, but what about daily life necessities ? You can't keep looking for shops, supermarkets, pharmacy, government departments, post offices, utility providers, hospitals which run by English speaking persons.|`|iMhowL5oaa	French people are bad in English, so it'll be difficult in your daily life.. also at work.. no really you need to speak un petit peu fran?ais!|`|9DauUbpiaa	The French definitely don't appreciate people not even making an effort to learn the language. However with that being said, it would be difficult, but possible, but only in the large cities, such as Paris or Lyon. Even there though, not everyone speaks english.|`|14H2SFj7aa	Basically, it is possible in any french speaking country, except france.
uqb7dkBbaa	There's more people coming in than going out.   Francois, we must not leave in the same France. I have no desire to live abroad again (did it for years and enjoyed it) and most immigrants I have met work hard. There are free loaders and criminals, but not to the point you describe. The country is not filled with road blocks and you can walk down a street without being asked for your ID papers.   |`|kJM65nXJaa	Net-in.|`|cCvA9kMiaa	Net-in is always more than net-out. Everybody knows France has a lot of residents who are originally from North African Arabic countries such as Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. This is something got to do with the colonization of these countries by France once. During 1997, the terrorism in Algeria and the brutal killings of many French there resulting at many Algerian fled to France and seeking asylum. Over the last 10 years, more and more North African Arabs arrived France and settled down here in a residency state. The recent years joining of the EEC by Turkey and Romania bought a different type of immigrants into France, and more crimes and benefit claimers as well. The country is now a big bin of benefit cheaters, lazy no- good layabouts and criminals, all of them are legal, not to mention the illegal ones living in France for years and years.  Sarkozy's government has been trying to clear them up. Thus why there are so many police patrol road blocks, police requires for ID to anyone walking in the street. From time to time they even have a plane ready, to catch the enough amount of illegal people and deport them straight away. But there are just too many of them you will never get rid of all.  For the ' net-out' , the ones being caught and deported are always less than those still stay in France illegally. As for the French themselves, most of them want to leave the country and go somewhere to seek a new life except the riches. They are fed up of illegal immigrants problems, economic crisis and all other social and political problems. But then it's hard for them as they need to learn a different language and to be able to earn a living abroad with some skills or professions. Most of them stay in France and sulk and moan all the time.

But since you are also a resident of the UAE, you can also apply for a 30 day visa from the Omani Consulate in Dubai for about RO3. You only need to present a valid residence visa from the UAE    In both cases, you won't need a sponsor.

Both the communities have their share of drinkers.Hindu's being the majority community, the number of drinkers from this community is higher than that of Muslims.In other words,religion has nothing to do with addiction to alchohol.What we have to worry about is the religious addiction of extreme fringe in both the communities.|`|CU32WjHdaa	There are many religious people in India.Why you indicate only Hindus & Muslims.Everywhere,Every religious mans are drink.But there are many festival in Hindu religious than other religious.They used drinks in many kind of festival.

It is particularly bad in Korea, worse in the North obviously. It would more depend on where they choose to live, for example, if your Japanese man and his American wife lived in Japan, they would most likely be rejected by Japanese society, they are a very proud people. As Westerner, it is very hard for us to understand this, but its just normal for them.|`|d8e910bd2f52d29ee45c171c594f47a9aa	Like anything relationship it depend on the people.  Typically Japanese who date foreigner are unique onto themselves, much like American who date Foreigners.  Both see the world and people in a different way.      I have for a long time dated outside of my own ethnicity (I am white and of Eastern European background); in doing so I took a lot of heat from my friends and family.  After a time my family and friend excepted I was not going to marry a blond hair/ blue eyes women (not that I would have anything against that, it just seem like buy the same book you already read several time and you have memorized).      As for problems with a Japanese Wife or in general an international marriage there are a few (these apply to both the husband and the wife);    1) Where are you going to live?  I knew I loved Japan, but I did not want my child to go to school in Japan (Japan Education System teaches child to memorizes and except everything as it is taught, where as in the U.S. were taught to learn, debate. and draw our own opinion).      2)  How the families feel about the marriage?  (My in-law are great, but they and my family were a bit shock about our marriage at first, over the years they both have grown to like it).   When you are dating the parent think it is cool or cute that their child is dating a foreign, but marriage is a different thing.  In Japan especial, being pure Japanese is very important and to married a foreigner make you something like being openly gay.  That is to say most people say they except you, but in the back of their mind they feel a bit uncomfortable about it.      3) The language is a hug thing.  Even though my wife speaks English very well, I have a hard time speaking to my in-laws and from time to time I need to translate for my wife.    4) I think a big thing is that people see you as a bit of an odd ball.  First when people find that you have a Japanese wife, it like "WOW THAT COOL".     Next people think your wife was looking to get into the U.S. and marring an American was the easiest way (after she get her U.S. Citizenship then she will divorce you).  My wife is very proud of being Japanese and does not want to be a U.S. Citizen.      Finally, they think well he is a washed up guy who could not get a girl in the U.S so he had to go abroad or he want a women who would be his slave girl.  Both of the are far from the truth,  I dated a lot of U.S Women.  Japanese Women are just as if not more independent than U.S. Women.  The Hollywood stereotype of Japanese Women is long gone.      All and all being married to a Japanese Women has been great and I would not trade it for anything.

aSxl6l0Gaa	I really think you should take a train into the city. The bus would be cheaper, but the weather is supposed to be crappy this weekend, and that's rush-hour traffic you have to get through on a Monday morning? The first day of the week and the day on which everyone decides to be good and show up at work on time? I'd be afraid of hitting traffic on the way up.    Where in Philly are you going to be? If possible, you can take SEPTA to Trenton from the 30th Street station in Philly, and from Philly, take the Northeast Corridor Line (that's my train; the initials are NEC on the train board) into Penn Station. Here's the link to NJTransit and look under the train schedules (don't do the Itinerary thingy; it's annoying) for a schedule. It's a little pricier than the bus and can get crowded, but since you're leaving so early, I don't think you'll have any problems getting a seat. Oh, and before you commit to the train, take a look at the schedule for the Northeast Corridor, to see if the train you'd need to take is an express or a local. The local can tack on an extra fifteen minutes to your ride.    http://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.s...|`|g8LLIeXKaa	BoltBus, a service operated by Greyhound and Peter Pan, is one of the cheapest way (as low as $1) to travel from (NYC) New York City to (Philly) Philadelphia.  http://411newyork.org/guide/2007/04/20/c...    Any bus can be late if there is traffic so you can't blame the driver or the bus company for traffic or weather delays that they have no control of. In my humble opinion it is best if a bus arrives a little late than crash on the way injuring all the passengers. Many times on the news I've seen buses flipped on the highway for speeding or not taking it easy in bad weather.    Whichever bus you take, I wish you arrive early and safe. If possible, take a previous bus so if it does arrive after schedule, you will still be on time.    Snow is predicted for the weekend so keep that in mind.|`|SC6YCYOvaa	Hey!    I have used Mega Bus before. I didn't really have any problems and it was cheap. I also often use the Chinatown Bus, which is even cheaper. They are pretty reliable.

There is also BoltBus which is simular to MegaBus but costs a bit more and has internet access/wi-fi.    You may also want to try Amtrak. The train is the most reliable but also the most expensive.    There is a site which has an article about transportation to and from NYC. The article is called something like "Cheap transportation to NYC" or something like that. You may want to check it out.

jLTDqVHsaa	Without traffic (and I stress, WITHOUT TRAFFIC), you're looking at about 25-45 minutes.    But as soon as there's any volume, it can be well over an hour, maybe up near two.  A crash or flooding on the Belt can do that.  Incidents on the Gowanus/BQE or the Van Wyck could cause some overflow volume.  When that Belt backs up, it REALLY backs up.|`|AA11414068	This is a span of 33 miles so should take you roughly 45 minutes to an hour to get to with mild traffic.|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Assuming there isn't a crash on the Belt Parkway, it shouldn't take more than 20-25 minutes.|`|AA11620976	Assuming the Belt isn't flooded , about 20 minutes  Bailing  out to S.Conduit when you reach the Cross Bay Blvd exit will save you some time|`|wxXguyK3aa	Not long, at most 30 minutes.  But that's without traffic.
6egxGam6aa	Hawaii is one of the United States of America. As long as you're a US citizen, you do not need a passport to travel there.|`|Lgue20G2aa	umm no u only need a pass port if ur leaving the country and hawaii is in the us so unless u leave the us u dont need a passport      hope it helped|`|S0uCKptBaa	No Hawaii is a state and would be considered domestic travel. A state issued ID is all you would need.|`|atPuxNiFaa	i wouldnt think so.... because it is part of the US so therefore you dont need a passport and also those are only for other countries  but just a guess.....|`|10f326a8d361451c48ca6d61e9c457e0aa	No, indeed!

4e8RU3eIaa	There are lots of different tribes of black people in Southern Africa. There are Zulu and Xhosa and San and Tswana and so on and so forth. We are all different but they are all black. All black. There is no white man's blood in us. I am Shona from Zimbabwe, which is next to South Africa. Here there are also Matabele, who are dogs and not to be trusted. Some tribes are good, and others are not. But all tribes are pure black African. We do not have whiteys in our tribes, and if somebody has a child with a whitey, they must leave and go to the city where nobody will know them.     In America, there are no black people. They are all mixed up with all sorts of other races. It is bad for a man not to know what tribe he is from, but it is worse not to know what race he is from. Americans are not from any race; they are all mixed up together, and do not know what they are. This man says he is Irish, but he has only one great-grandparent who was Irish, and he has never even been to Ireland. it is stupid to say he is Irish like that. It is the same with tribes and races.     Look at Mr Obama; you Americans say he is black, but he has more white blood than black in his body. Is it not strange to say he is black when he is more white than black? This is what the racists say, that if he is not all white, then he must be black. But I am black, and I say that if he is not all black, then he is not black, and not African.|`|hfigZbx5aa	Erm.... South Africa has a LOT of tribes. I have friends from about 3 of them. Xhosa and Zulu being two of them. Not to mention you have different tribes in different countries and migrations and variations in different tribes with the same name... One Zulu tribe may be different from another in some way. It's very highly individual based on region. I mean, American whites are different from European whites. As a matter of fact, the way we've inter-married American whites are different from other American whites! How an you expect that it wouldn't be true of African Americans and African-Africans? Lol. The Africans vary from place to place, as do we all.    I'll give you one similarity though, we're all born knowing nothing and die knowing less. :-)|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	why do we african americans get the so called "*******" label as if we do not have a nationality or an origin??? have you ever heard of the tribes Yorba Igbo Wolof Senegal Ghana Cameroon Etc???     IGNORANCE IS BLISS|`|5b65f879f0c7128f9d7069f75d66aedcaa	"black" people in American are also from the Carribean.  Im sure they're super offended when they are being referred to as African American.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	They are very different in background and culture. you probably are thinking about the Xhosa's.|`|zEoRcL91aa	What A. Americans need to realise is that DIVERSITY in Africa is huge. There are Asians, Europeans, Indians, Indonesians etc living in Africa, not black Africans only. In South Africa alone there are about 40 different mother-tongues spoken.    What 'race ' are A. American anyway? Most don't even know where they come from:)!    Khoisan were people driven out of nice areas and now live in the drier regions on the South African/Botswana border. As groups they speak around 16 different languages. Khoisan are not 'black' as in from east/North Africa. They tend to be more asian/mongolian looking, but with short hair.    Hope this helps.|`|ZaQ8CYxyaa	Partly true.    The khoisan are a seperate group of people from the Bantu (who make up most of South Africa's black population, and who most African Americans come from.    The khoisan (often called bushmen) are a group of hunetr gatherers found in Namibia, Botswana and some Northern and Western areas of South Africa. However there are only 10 thousand of them in South Africa.     Most South African blacks (about 35 million) are of Bantu origin, and I think (not 100% sure) the same race that make up most african americans.    Most african americans had ancestors bought over as slaves during the 16th and 17th centuries from modern day west Africa (the countries today of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and very few slaves were bought to America from modern day South Africa. I know many people in Cameroon and Nigeria are of bantu origin but not sure about the rest of west africa, but even if not, are a very closely related group.    I know the bantu and people of west africa are both *******, so of the same race, but I'm not sure about the Khoisan.    So yes, the black people of south africa are of the same race as african americans, but the khoisan are a small minority of a different race.|`|T64puKbUaa	The Khoikhoi and San people, collectively called Khoisan, are not black and is a separate race in Africa. They are indigenous to Southern Africa.     The black people in South Africa are mainly of Bantu origin with some inter-mixing with the Khoisan. The click sounds in the Bantu languages comes from the Bantu people's inter-mixing with the Khoisan. African-Americans are mainly of Ne****d or West-African origin.
4BoteYDwaa	I used to live in Colorado and I drove around a 4x4 Jeep Liberty, I never had any troubles. It's efficient and functional. Avoid PT cruisers, they are terrible in the snow and don't respond well to altitude change. Use your transmission to slow down, shift from drive...then second...then eventually first. Whatever you do, don't hit the breaks, feather the brakes  (slow, extremely light pressure) if you have to use them. When your going down the mountain, keep it in low gear and try not to use your breaks too much, they will get extremely hot then fail. I usually stay in second gear, or 4x4 low (if it's slick). The liberty handles really well and is actually fairly comfortable. When your ready to turn off the 4x4, come to a complete stop, dis-engage 4x4 then back up a few feet. This is necessary, it may remain locked in, until this is done. Always give the engine ample time to warm up before driving off, mine usaully took about 2 minutes if it was really coId (about the same amount of time it takes for the heater to fully warm up).  I recommend going through Hertz rent-a-car (they don't charge for additional mileage), avoid enterprise. Always get the insurance and make sure the tank is completely full when you return it to the lot (they will charge you for every gallon they have to put back in, and they're charging $2 more than the gas station.) If you have time, you should visit Monarch Pass, it's truly beautiful and there's a store at the top that has some really cool stuff. If possible, bring a small gas can, at least a 3 to 5 gallon and keep it full. There are many places in Colorado where it may be a few hundred miles until the next gas station. A couple quarts of oil, anti-freeze, power steering fluid, and brake fluid are also highly recommended, also make sure the spare tire is in good condition and that you have the key to unlock it. Your likely going to be driving through places that are very desolate, and a few that are quite dangerous. Keep your doors locked and don't leave your belongings in view, especially if you go through Denver (purchase some pepper spray as soon as possible).  Having said all that, I love Colorado, it's the most beautiful place I've ever been, I know ya'll will enjoy your trip.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	Well, you'll definitely see snow. I saw some in Breckinridge in June a couple of years ago.    I don't think you'll need emergency equipment. If you aren't experienced, stay on decent roads (don't be foolish here). It might not be a bad idea to get a good-sized car for the hills.     The site below has some information on Colorado tourist stops. We took the railroad out of Durango (one way was enough), and Silverton is a fun little place to visit.|`|20e07a3496debbebebb5ce629eb663fcaa	i live in colorado so i am here to help too. i lived here all my life and was born here... i would suggest for a car is like 4x4.. SUvs can work..You can probably ask the rental car place about it too. so far this year we havent gottne much snow that u would need something like that. we have been having good weather w/ very little snow.. right now for visits in colorado springs are garden of the gods park. its really pretty. and the air force academy. (ive even been on base) if you want to do something that involves excersice. skii or snowboarding. idk which resort you would go to because i never been skiiing or snowboarding before|`|0d811LEXaa	Actually any car should be fine, Colorado does keep its roads well maintained in the winter, I would just stay home at night so you dont have to worry about black ice and slick roads.  Not to bad to drive in, just take it easy and stay with the flow of the traffic and if it is snowing, since you are inexperienced with the snow, you shouldn't drive when it is snowing a lot out.  But since you are going to be driving up near the mountains, I agree with another person about getting an SUV.  Dont know anyone that carries around kitty littler.    As for driving in the winter, keep a good distance from other cars, pump your brakes if you start to slide when you try to stop, when you try to take off and start to skid, take your foot off the gas and gently tap it until your tires get a grip.  if it is really cold out be VERY careful on bridges since they tend to ice over really easy and fast.  Be careful going up to the mountains also since those roads are not as maintained as well as highways and city streets.    But like I said, roads are well maintained here so I dont think you will have a lot of trouble, just if is cold you might want to be driving during the day before the sun goes down and not to early in the morning when it is still cold because of the evening.  Try to stick to your driving in the afternoons when it is warm and the streets are warmed up.    Good luck and hope you have a safe and enjoyable vacation to Colorado.|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	I would say get an SUV preferably with 4 wheel drive lol, and just start slowing down alot earlier than normal, cause snow makes it pretty easy to slide into an intersection, other than that you should be fine, snow is pretty cold too BTW, gloves, warm hats and coats help alot lol  hope that helped|`|3P9w01Y7aa	I LOVE Colorado, then again im I also live here. stop by Colorado Springs, and vist Garden of the Gods and the Air Force Acdemy, go skiing while your here too. Colorado is like the greatest place ever. also, there are no guarentees that there will be snow in Febuary or March, but come prepared anyways because the weather is totally random.|`|XqesXcp6aa	I used to live there. its beautiful.    Grand lake is wonderfull...  if you plan to go skiing/ snowboarding winter park is very close to grand lake and is great!!    as for driving.. take it slow if your uncomfortable. low gears. get an SUV. Dont ride your breaks down the mountain they will go out.. thats what low gears are for. its really not that bad|`|93fEyStOaa	If you want to see the snow but don't want to have to drive through it, go in May or June and drive up to the highest peaks. There will still be plenty of snow up there for you to play in. Try Mt. Evans; it's not a terribly far drive from Denver, but you'll feel that you're way up there. Or go to St. Mary's glacier; it's also not a long drive and you can walk up to the glacier and throw snowballs at each other if you want. It's the best of both worlds because the weather won't be bad but you'll still get to have fun in the snow. In Feb. or March there can be some nasty snowstorms that not even experienced drivers would want to deal with. Rent a 4 wheel drive SUV if you have to go in Feb. or March. You might as well go on  ski trip in Feb., so pick out a ski resort and learn to ski. It's fun! Have a great time!|`|i9gjwPM6aa	I live in Colorado as well... Go sking if that is too much money rent some show shoes and go  on a Hike ( Rent a Pair for 10 bucks) at REI... Just enjoy the land and the laid back attitude for sure get a car to drift in!!!!! Best past time if board in colorado!!|`|FaUNLyUraa	haha. i am from colorado and its amazing  go to aspen if u want to skii cause its the best in the country and one of the best in the world..  i live in brazil but im from colorado. and a lot of my friend here go traveling there. its really popular.. and for a car i would get a BMW because there is moutains etc..   hiking there is soo beautiful.. and dont forget to bring a snow coat..  i hope u have fun, i only get to go to colorado in june.. oh well  oh and boulder is beautiful. its where i am from 
MT24Jz4Eaa	Australia day is when the first fleet from England came to Australia. But Australia day people just celebrate Australia. Everybody i know had a barbie with friends (barbecue) swim in the pool if you have one or go to the beach. I love australia day it is the best holiday of the year.    I think aussie guys are much funnier, layed back and sporty and hotter :p i think they're also nicer usually. They don't care about appearances as much, more with personality, but of course they still like hot girls but it doesn't matter about fashion and stuff i think.|`|iHT3N9n5aa	same as wht ruby said except different cultures, for instance if someone from Australia said: lets go up to the foot oval and kick a ball. they wouldnt know what a footy is. same again Americans have things that Australia knows little or nothin about.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Australia day is a public holiday .

I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

Also, for transportation, there are maps in subway cars and on subway trains, and there are also maps in buses. The maps at bus stops are usually just for the bus route.

lAWrMhP1aa	The lifestyle in Dallas is extremely easy compared to other parts of the country, shopping is cheap, jobs are reliable, and it isn't as hard hit by the recession than other areas. It has all types of entertainment including numerous nationally known museums, competitive sports teams, and thousands of famous amazing restaurants. There are a ton more reasons also    but then again, your living in Dallas,Texas|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	There aren't any that I'm aware of.    It's hot, humid, and landlocked.  It has nothing unique of interest, and zero culture.   What would a tourist do in Dallas?  I really can't thing of anything.    Don't get me wrong, the people are nice and it's pleasant enough.  I've got nothing against it.    But in Texas San Antonio and Austin have way more character.  Dallas doesn't hold a candle to the other us metropolises - NYC, Chicago, SF, Miami, LA are all far more interesting.|`|luwBPdE8aa	The first answer is all wrong.  Dallas is variety.  The best shopping malls in the world are near Dallas.  There is every type of restaurant you can imagine.  There is plenty of night life.  The area north of Dallas is booming.

zy8mKJxeaa	Fatah is preferable to Hamas. Better the frying pan than the fire.|`|7zZZEUxqaa	Fatah are bunch of corrupted individuals|`|vHQsz8HHaa	Hamas because Israelis prefer Fatah.|`|MHkx2kRTaa	If Hamas and Fatah were the only two to choose from then Fatah would win hands down.    Fatah has been instrumental in making the West Bank a relatively peaceful place to live in for the Palestinians.    Hamas is a terrorist organisation and is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.    Who would you choose? An organisation that wants to live peacefully or a terrorist organisation?|`|wj3JUPr3aa	Hmm. Well neither to be quite honest.  Fatah is pretty much the definition of corrupt, and Hamas is pretty much the definition of censorship and lies.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	Fatah.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Here are some reasons, but they may not convince you.    Hamas "Member of Parliament" Fathi Hammad, brags about the Hamas use of human shields.    Fathi Hammad: "[The enemies of Allah] do not know that the Palestinian people has developed its [methods] of death and death-seeking. For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, and so do the mujaheddin and the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujaheddin, in order to challenge the Zionist bombing machine. It is as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death like you desire life.'"    This may indeed be sick, but it is the Palestinian ideology.      .|`|1gmsCb4Maa	Neither; Fatah is too corrupt and Hamas is too radical. They need a new party.|`|aI3WsnnEaa	Fatah is.. although they are losing support and not spending the money the world and the US give them on worthwhile items.    They could be improving their infrastructure, but they are arming to fight Hamas.    And people say Israel is bad.. these two groups kill eachother and their own people.    Hamas will go to a wedding and kill the groom and guests because they were singing.|`|TunN8xOFaa	Hamas. Hamas cares for the Palestinian people. Fatah is corrupt and does not care about the Palestinian people.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	I will just join the majority.  Neither .  It is time for change.  Yes we can.  A new reality.

They seem to deal with Israeli Palestinian conflict in a more responsible and realistic manner and have a much more dovish character.|`|TA4rdQM3aa	I agree with Cool Breeze. They are never going to get anywhere with the two status quo parties; they're wasting their time talking about a unity government using those two relics. It's time not just for one but two or three new parties. Democracies create new parties all the time,this is no different. I don't know why they keep clinging to these ones. Both belong to a very different era than ours. Think of Arafat,think of Sheik Yassin. They need new people with new ideas,new concepts.|`|rY9qQJIFaa	Neither. From any perspective  - Jewish,Arab,American,whatever - they need to develop new parties.|`|27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	Definitely Fatah if that's all they are stuck with. But both rob from the Palestinian people to support their own agenda.    Hamas & Fatah were always terrorists group. But with AraRAT dead Fatah is making an effort to change. At least they aren't using the Palestinians as human shields or hiding weapons in schools, churches, etc.    I always look at it this way if Hamas believes they are in the right then why don't they have the courage to take off the mask and make it clear who they are. Hiding behind masks & innocents are nothing but cowards with weapons. No honor but there should be plenty of shame.|`|zw1chGmHaa	As a non-Palestinian, I don't believe this is a matter of judgment on my part.  The Palestinians selected both to hold office in various locations - so I would imagine it's best to ask them - and not fall prey to what Israeli propaganda is trying to tell the world.|`|mE4SbWIuaa	The main goal of both organizations is to gain power over the masses. So while one is guilty of corruption the other promises another 60 years of war.     Although Fatah claims it is willing to acknowledge Israel's right to exist, if Hamas was destroyed, Fatah would welcome its radicals into its organization and what the people of the West Bank and Gaza would be left with is a corrupt government that promises another 60 years of war. Because of that, and because they will never be rid of Israel as a neighbor neither organization is good for the people of Gaza and the West Bank.    In my opinion, the best solution for them was when Egypt had control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was under the conrol of Jordan. But, they blew those options long ago.    What they need is an entirely new government(s) that rejects anyone who is more concerned about destroying Israel than they are about building their own country and has a mechanism for oversight.     I have serious doubts they'll ever get that though because Iran and Syria are making all the calls and anyone who attempts to really fix the problem is quickly assissinated.

I don't know why you (lol), that's very disrespectful.  The international community has recognized the Palestinians as a unique and singular people, deserved of their own state.  It doesn't matter whether I agree or not, I can't be a hypocrite.

It won't happen, of course, but I do believe that's their plan. In the meantime they're living off the compassion of the world powers, who are growing weary of their continued warmongering and still raising one generation after another to throw at a war they can never win.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	They do not need an excuse.    As long as Israel and Jews exist, they will continue.    And the western world should remember that not only Jews are threatened: 9/11, the London Tube, Glasgow airport, conspiracy to blow up planes etc etc|`|lvWqfnfpaa	Killing Israelis or anyone else is a sin. Lets just jail the Zionists who are 'active' in killing Palestinians i.e. President, soldiers|`|mM8HUQMzaa	Ceasefire: Since the Qur'an is a timeless war declaration to the rest of the world, in its entirety, any break in hostility is temporary and part of a global warring strategy. Read Q.9.1.     Freedom: The right of Moslems to carry any means for their faith propagation, from taqqiya to terror (tv beheading shows, killing apostates and critics). In the Muslims eyes, assassination, raiding, looting, raping and even genocide are not evil and immoral acts when the victims are non-Muslims. However, freedom of thought is an evil thing that has to be eradicated (Ali Sina).|`|4D7cuMZ0aa	ok   let Israel give back everything they took from the Palestine and then I'm sure nobody will touch the Israelis.|`|0fW76gB8aa	There are many possible excuses that the Palestinians may or may not use for killing Israelis, regardless of whether a Palestinian State is established. Here is a choice selection:    Excuse  1: The Islamic religion commands them to kill Jews, and it is racist and discriminatory to prevent Muslims from carrying out this religious duty.    Excuse  2: Israel (like any sovereign nation) controls access in and out of the country, and refuses to allow Palestinians to enter whenever they please without security checks.    Excuse  3: They have run out of money because they spent it on weapons, and are attacking Israel to get attention, in the hope that the EU and UN will give them more money.    Excuse  4: Hamas spent the budget for power and water infrastructure on weapons, and now the Palestinians want Israel to supply them with free water and power.    Excuse  5: The Palestinians object to the existence of Israel and demand that all Jews leave the region.    Excuse  6: It is the duty of every Arab to fight the Jewish state. Not allowing Arabs to kill Jews is racist.     Excuse  7: Palestinians are jealous that Israelis have a better quality of life, because the Israeli Government invests in the country, while the PA does not.    Excuse  8: Its ok to fire rockets because Hamas and Islamic Jihad cannot control where the rockets will land.    Excuse  9: The weather is bad, its Israel's fault.    Excuse  10: The Palestinians were bored and had nothing else to do.|`|DtlQawvgaa	Palestine has never existed . . . as an autonomous entity. There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc.     The word itself derives from "Peleshet", a name that appears frequently in the Bible and has come into English as "Philistine". Philistines was migrant people from the Aegean Sea and the Greek Islands who settled on the southern coast of the land of Canaan. There they established five independent city-states (including Gaza) on a narrow strip of land known as Philistia. The Greeks and Romans called it "Palastina".     The Philistines were not Arabs, they were not Semites. They had no connection, ethnic, linguistic or historical with Arabia or Arabs. The name "Falastin" that Arabs today use for "Palestine" is not an Arabic name. It is the Arab pronunciation of the Greco-Roman "Palastina" derived from the Peleshet.     In the First Century CE, the Romans crushed the independent kingdom of Judea. After the failed rebellion of Bar Kokhba in the Second Century CE, the Roman Emperor Hadrian determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea. Therefore, he took the name Palastina and imposed it on all the Land of Israel. At the same time, he changed the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina.    After the Roman conquest of Judea, "Palastina" became a province of the pagan Roman Empire and then of the Christian Byzantine Empire, and very briefly of the Zoroastrian Persian Empire. In 638 CE, an Arab-Muslim Caliph took Palastina away from the Byzantine Empire and made it part of an Arab-Muslim Empire. The Arabs, who had no name of their own for this region, adopted the Greco-Roman name Palastina, that they pronounced "Falastin".     During the First World War, the British took Palestine from the Ottoman Turks. At the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and among its subject provinces "Palestine" was assigned to the British, to govern temporarily as a mandate from the League of Nations.    The Balfour Declaration of 1917, confirmed by the League of Nations Mandate, commited the British Government to the principle that "His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a Jewish National Home, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. . . . " It was specified both that this area be open to "close Jewish settlement" and that the rights of all inhabitants already in the country be preserved and protected.     During the period of the Mandate, it was the Jewish population that was known as "Palestinians" including those who served in the British Army in World War II.     The current myth is that these Arabs were long established in Palestine, until the Jews came and "displaced" them. The fact is, that recent Arab immigration into Palestine "displaced" the Jews. That the massive increase in Arab population was very recent is attested by the ruling of the United Nations: That any Arab who had lived in Palestine for two years and then left in 1948 qualifies as a "Palestinian refugees".     God Bless!
6ypXRuIEaa	I saw it on a news updates & couldn't believe it. I didn't watch the news after that. I doubt anybody will ever understand. I do wonder how her 2 brothers are coping seeings as they were there. Of course our thoughts are with her mother too, & the officers who worked so hard with her at the scene.  We need to realise that this sort of behaviour isn't the first, just the latest. How many children have died at the hands of their parents?|`|iy1mXC0Saa	oh the poor girl, i hate stories like this :(|`|DUpZhTwQaa	this is so horrible.    the thing i dont understand is y only the daughter?? he didnt kill the others|`|MT24Jz4Eaa	oh god it makes me cry. I mean a 4 year old child thrown off the bridge. And she was still alive when she hit the water so she would be falling and... oh its just so horrible.  I have no idea why the dad would do that, i know he is suicidal but why throw your daughter off. I think he must be insane.  R.I.P Darcy.|`|OQu1JikAaa	My deepest sympathy and condolences go out for Darcey's family for their loss. The incidents like this force us to evaluate the human values. Still, it is hard to believe for me and my family members.|`|0c23df02aa982b654d80dcf290df51dbaa	They should have thrown him over too. However, I wonder how many more kids will die before our divorce system recognises the fathers right to begin a new life.|`|BBOR7Vwmaa	Poor girl    Everyone I know on MSN (the instant messaging service) has put love hearts in front of their display names in her rememberance  We're thirteen and we all think its so sad  I just got this email from a friend    hey people, you remember that little girl that was thrown off the Westgate bridge the other day?     well if you do, put a (L) heart in front of your name in remembrance of her!     and please people forward this to all you contacts    --  I can't wait to know what the 4 year old actually did to deserve this or what caused the Hawthorn man to get so mad    Really bad  RIP Darcey    EDIT: My theory is that the child was doing the whole I hate you crying thing to her father, because it was her first day at school, yet the child was thrown off the bridge at 9am. School starts at 9am and the girl was probably worried that they were gonna be up to an hour late    Still no excuse  Alex|`|CLjiev9Xaa	Bring back capital punishment!|`|D89m7pwfaa	The father should receive a lethal injection, and his body thrown away, regardless of the apparent mental illness he has. He doesn't deserve to die with dignity, he doesn't deserve a tombstone, or any form of remembrance. Execution is the only answer.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	People over here (in NZ in a chat room I was just reading) are saying things like, the poor guy, he must have been so stressed to have resorted to that.  What bollocks!  No one is that stressed that they would go that far, unless they're a psycho or intending on killing their kid.  He's on suicide watch now but I've no sympathy for him.  If he was angry he could have just yelled or punched his steering wheel or something, there's no excuse for lashing out at the child & it's premeditated to actually go through the motions of picking the kid up & tossing it.  Most people would think, oh my god what am I doing & stop before actually committing that act, so there is no excuse.  Maybe he was intentionally doing it to affect the mother as revenge as men often harm kids to hurt the mother.    Feel sorry for the other kids witnessing that & the mother, particularly as this guy was just granted more custody time with them before this happened.    Be careful who you choose as your partner, that's all I can say!  After you break up you're still not rid of them if you have kids.|`|CwrayzxBaa	The whole incident is just horrifying.   Even more so when the news reported that had one lady onlooker not shouted out after he dropped his daughter over the side that the other two boys could have been next.       I can't imagine what could lead him to think that what he did was in any way a sane or reasonable way to deal with his problems.   I feel sympathy because he has single handledly destroyed 5 lives in one fowl swoop.  His own because he will never see those kids again and likely his freedom too.    His two boys will never see their sister again and will live with the fear of ever trusting adults again.   His wife will never let those two boys out of sight and has to live over and over again the what if's.   Lastly the little girl herself, first day of school, a whole future unrealised, and gone in a split second.    The only consolation here is that had she survived the fall, her life would have been one of endless pain and misery from her injuries.       I sincerely hope the authorities do find the funds to barricade the Westgate bridge so this never happens there again.       Tears in Heaven.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Oh so sad .

I can't imagine the terror that poor little girl suffered. I don't care about his mental illness bullshit, there is NO EXCUSE that can justify what he did to his little girl.|`|dUpVqoB6aa	I think that it is horrible that something like this can happen.What drives a parent to throw down his own child from a bridge?My heart is aching for the entire family.I think this incident shows that there are flaws in our society and our system.I assume that he must have had some sort of a mental break down.No sane person would do something like this    I read an article that they were planning on putting barriers up on that bridge and now they might fast track it.Why does something so terrible need to happen in order for someone to act.    The sad truth might be that he will most likely get away with this crime because he will most likely plead insanity.

98963ee5e28cb31619811d370d48a04daa	Domanda difficile  :D  Io negli USA mi trovo bene ma se in Italia le cose fossero diverse... non parlo solo di lavoro per tutti e pi soldi ma parlo anche di altri problemi quali l' immigrazione, forse ritornerei. Perch? Perch  in Italia sono cresciuta, perch ho famiglia e amici, perch in Italia c' storia e la cultura e' decisamente diversa e infine per il cibo  :D e si ogni tanto mi manca pure quello.  Ciao  :D  P.S  l' altro giorno ti ho inviato una email, l'hai ricevuta?    Non ho ricevuto nessuna risposta, a questo punto penso  (tu non sei l' unico) di avere problemi con la email di yahoo.  Facciamo cosi, ti mando un' altra email, dato che tu ricevi e ti scrivo il mio indirizzo email   :D  Grazie    ********************************  Qui a San Antonio di cibo Italiano nei supermercati  trovi  poco rispetto ad altri Stati degli USA e costa come comprare l' oro.    :D   Comunque a me manca il cibo dei ristoranti non quello che uno si cucina  a casa  :D e il Buon Vino|`|n9R7QqgFaa	Sicuro.  Cui si lavora troppo e non si sa come sar il futuro, non ce niente per il tuo ritiro.    L a famiglia non esiste, nostri valori non sonno rispettati.  Sonno italiano nato a sud america e seria un sogno vivere nella bella Italia|`|ts3AhQuZaa	Si,  l'ho fatto io.  Ero in USA, ma ho avuto l'opportunit di tornare in italia (nel 2002) per continuare lo stesso lavoro che stavo facendo negli stati uniti.    Paga: un quarto di quanto guadagnavo in usa.  Ma non ci ho pensato due volte! Lo stile di vita americano proprio non mi si addice... ero teso e stressato tutti i giorni, ci sono differenze incolmabili, e per chi  nato e vissuto libero tutta la vita,  proprio impossibile "aggiustarsi" alla vita americana.  Non vedevo proprio l'ora di tornarmene in Italia, e l'ho fatto subito! :)    Chiaramente son tornato in USA altre volte successivamente, ma sempre per periodi brevissimi e mai con l'intento di rimanere.    Tuttavia ci sto ancora pagando un mutuo.... :) appena finisco, non mi resta che vendere la casa: neanche alla mia ragazza piacerebbe vivere li.    ----------------    Volevo aggiungere una cosa:  per il cibo NON E' un problema, come molti pensano!  (classica leggenda degli spaghetti col ketchup che gira in Italia dai tempi della 2a guerra mondiale.)  Di ristoranti italiani (veri) ce ne sono quanti ne volete. A uno decente e non costoso, si mangia con 20$.  Il punto  che si pu tranquillamente cucinare A CASA tutto ci che si vuole!  Ogni grande supermercato ben fornito, anche in angoli remoti del North Dakota, ha Latte PARMALAT uht, NUTELLA, caff italiano, e roba varia. Ultimamente si inizia a trovare il pane all'italiana, non quello a cassetta che mangiano gli americani.    Ma la vera fortuna  abitare nella zona dove opera un importatore/deli italiano: io ne ho uno quasi sotto casa (angolo Lincoln & Santa Monica Blvd a Santa Monica): pane fresco appena sfornato...tonno rio mare... biscotti del mulino bianco...gocciole extra dark... Esta The... caff Lavazza, perfino insaccati, prosciutto e mortadella (che non capisco come faccia ad averli se in usa l'importazione ne  vietata: forse sono importati legalmente , o prodotti in USA... certo  che sono uguali agli originali.)  Insomma... per quanto riguarda il cibo,  vero che costa tutto il doppio che in italia, ma ci si pu organizzare!|`|Ypl4Rrryaa	bella domanda...  Per esser sincero l'unica cosa che mi rattrista e' l'essere distante dai miei genitori.  Ho avuto una bimba ad ottobre e so quanto dura e' per i miei di non poterla vedere come vorrebbero...    Sara' che vivo in una citta' come New York e quindi non la considererei America...ma no...non penso tornerei mai in Italia per viverci definitivamente...  Ci sarebbe troppa differenza....    Qui ho tutto di cui ho bisogno e mi piace la mentalita' americana piu di quella italiana materialista..  Qui tutti mi accettano per quello che sono e non mi giudicano, in italia invece me la vedo gia la gente a criticarmi solo perche' ho 23 ed ho una bambina in passeggino...    Sto bene qui...sto bene a New York e sto bene col mio lavoro...sogno un pensionamento in Texas, ma per quello se ne riparlera tra una 50ina d'anni..: )|`|142vkTeyaa	non vivo negli stati uniti ma mi piacerebbe... e sono curioso di questa domanda.... tu f 18 torneresti????|`|Gdu30e0Eaa	Difficilissima domanda per chi vive in questo Paese ormai da anni. Perche' a un certo punto devi ammettere con te stesso di vivere in Usa, il che significa che la tua scelta non e' piu' temporanea. Cominci a lavora, compri una casa, ti sposi, hai un bimbo e tutto a un tratto capisci che sei piu' americano che italiano. E' triste ma e' la pura verita'. Amo l'Italia, e' il mio Paese e restero' italiana per sempre, ma ogni giorno che passa sento che per me il ritorno diventa sempre piu' difficile.|`|IH2WzL4haa	Io adoro vivere qui negli Stati uniti....  Cmq, in Italia tornerei semplicemente x amici,famiglia e cibo....  Mi mancano tutti e 3 un casinoooooooooo

Euphemisms may be used to hide unpleasant or disturbing ideas, even when the literal term for them is not necessarily offensive. This type of euphemism is used in public relations and politics, where it is sometimes called doublespeak. Sometimes, using euphemisms is equated to politeness.|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	Euphemisms are largely only a requirement for repressed individuals or societies, or any group that dwells in explicit and implicit denial. It plays hand in hand with societal taboos.     In true modern societies, the use of euphemisms is always discouraged in favor of openness and directness. Euphemisms introduce miscommunication and misunderstanding and is a terrible tool for use in professional situations.      The only real use for euphemisms is when you speak with children regarding heavy matters such as death.|`|9vvEOHVXaa	Hon Hon Hon.

Jm3vMKx3aa	If you are a Canadian or U.S. citizen you do not need a passport to embark a cruise ship at a U.S. part and disembark the ship again at a U.S. port.  You may travel on your driver's license as ID and the original or a certified copy of your birth certificate as proof of citizenship.    After June 1, 2009 this provisions will only remain in effect for U.S. citizens if the ship returns for disembarkation to the U.S. port of departure (closed-loop cruise).    In other cases you will need a passport, a passport-card, or an enhanced driver's license for land or sea travel to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean after June 1, 2009.    To fly to and from any non-U.S. destination you will need a passport in any case. It is therefore strongly recommended to hold a passport on a cruise-ship travel, too. You could not be flown home in case of a severe illness or an accident and who would want to spent several months in a Caribbean hospital?    Citizens of all other countries need passports.

If your cruise is after June 2009, then you will be required to have a passport.|`|03rOCajTaa	yes|`|lcj1AKt1aa	It is best if you travel with your passport since it will eliminate any embarrassments.You will definitely need it after June 1, 2009. Are you catching the ship from your home port or do you have to catch a plane to get to the departure port? All these things are important.    Read this!    Required Travel Documents and Other Important Documentation   Passport Requirements & How to Apply for a Passport    A passport is an internationally recognized travel document that verifies the identity and nationality of the bearer. Only the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Embassies and Consulates have the authority to grant, issue or verify U.S. passports.  For travel overseas and to facilitate reentry into the U.S., a valid U.S. passport is the best documentation available.     A valid passport is required to enter and leave most foreign countries.  Some countries may allow you to enter with only a birth certificate, or with a birth certificate and a drivers license.  Note, however, that rules established under the U.S. Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, require that all persons, including U.S. citizens, traveling by air, must present a valid passport to reenter the United States.  (Until September 30, 2007, U.S. citizens who have applied for but not yet received passports can enter and depart the United States by air to Western Hemisphere countries with a government-issued photo identification and official proof of application for a passport.  The proof may be obtained at http://travel.state.gov.  This accommodation does not affect entry requirements of other countries, and U.S. citizens who are traveling to a country that requires a visitor to have a passport must still obtain one.)    If you are traveling by land or sea, make certain that you can return to the United States with the proof of citizenship that you take with you.  U.S. regulations require that you document both your U.S. citizenship and your identity when you reenter the United States.  For more information about U.S. passport requirements, see http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cbpmc...       Some countries require that a travelers U.S. passport be valid at least six months or longer beyond the dates of the trip.  In addition, with the number of international child custody cases on the rise, several countries have instituted passport requirements to help prevent child abductions. (Mexican law, for example, requires a child traveling alone, or with only one parent, or in someone else's custody, to carry written, notarized consent from the absent parent or parents if the child is not in possession of a U.S. passport.)  Contact the embassy of the foreign destination for more information.  A listing of foreign embassies and consulates in the U.S. is available on the Department of States website at  http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122...   Foreign embassy and consulate contact information can also be found on the Country Specific Information for each country.

47369398a39775c2731197d1207055b0aa	san diego can be pricey. What is your budget? are all 5 of you trying to live together? San Diego housing (at least in apartments) mandate legally that for 5 people you must rent at least a 2 bedroom apartment. (2 per bedroom+1 in living room)  I would recommend at least a 3 bedroom. If you want a (city feel) in san diego, there is only a few areas, such as down town. parts of ocean beach. The problem with "city living" is that rooms tend to be smaller.  Chula Vista has some 3 bedroom apartments for around $1300. 2 of the rooms are pretty big. While not exactly "suburbia" its not exactly urban living either.   I think if you are looking for "affordable" you have to be willing to give up a little of the "beach" area or "city" area.   You can find inexpensive in Imperial Beach, but its far from colleges.  First, pick a school or school you are all going to, then find housing.   San Diego is good, because you can drive to the beach from most parts of san diego within 30 minutes. (unless there's traffic) Unlike places like Los angeles where traffic lasts a lot longer, in san diego traffic is like 2 hours in the morning and like 3 hours in the afternoon.  I recommend places that are 10 minutes from the beach. You'll go more often, than places 30 min from the beach.   So my list of recommendations go as follows.  Downtown san diego.  Bankers hill  Pacific Beach  Ocean Beach  old town  hillcrest  Normal heights  Chula Vista  Clairmont mesa  Imperial beach    They are kind of close to the beach. some are more urban than others.  All pretty safe.  only problem with normal heights, its very cool, but close to the ghetto, its very different block to block, but pretty cool. But really, san diego is pretty safe for a big city. I'd recommend any of these places to my little sister, just be careful at night ANYWHERE you live.  If you have any other questions about san diego, feel free to e mail me.|`|16RxO7mnaa	Fresno!

RMDN0e46aa	it was free because of the inconvenience that was caused during the hot weather which caused major disruptions to the system over that period of time|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Yes the reason it is free is because Conex are a bunch of wankers who love to cancel and suspenbd train services in 45 degree heat..    They had to cancel over 100 train services so they are trying to suck up to the Victorians by giving them free travel..Whats the use in that because all the bloody rail system was out last night anyway..    They have had train tracks buckle in the heat,trains loosing power and air condidtioning,they ended up bringing in bus services all over Victoria.Conex are stuffed as far as i am concerned and they are going to cop a nice big fat fine when this is all finished.|`|23vKOyBraa	We have had a week of major train cancellations (in fact late Friday afternoon ALL trains were cancelled), which obvioiusly affects many people.    The government decided to make the day free in a small attempt to acknowledge that they know we are suffering.    As for Connex being wankers (the first answer here)... keep in mind there are THREE parties to that argument, with each blaming the other: the government, the union, and Connex (the train company). It is NOT clear who is to blame, in reality it's probably a combination of all three.    The MAIN reason for the train cancellations has been the air conditioning units in the older trains have failed - and you cannot put 1000 people on a crowded peak hour trains without A/C in 40+ degree heat with WINDOWS THAT DON'T OPEN. That is why the trains are being cancelled. You'd be killing passengers otherwise.|`|iR1pZ5VTaa	becuase connex were so bad they didnt deserve to get paid lol|`|NuUMDTrTaa	Yes they were free as part of the Governments apology for their stuff ups in not supplying a viable rail system.   The faults were mostly NOT with Connex, they were with Government rail engineers who don't know the correct way to lay rail lines, and the poor Electrical system which broke down so the trains couldn't run any way.  It wouldn't have made much difference to revenue though, because the majority who used it had weekly or monthly tickets, or were the 40% to 50% freeloaders who seldom buy a ticket anyway.|`|112WeIU3aa	all of the below answers sum your question up plus on our free day of transport all train services were cancelled at one point there was no where near as many connex customer service reps around, friday was the worst day out......    if you ask me they did it just to compensate 4 the crappy service we recieved on friday, and no it didnt make it ok I would rather pay money and be able to get home out of the sweltering heat............ the whole week was bad enough but friday just topped it all....................................
OMvFplRTaa	try this links|`|ue70ylH6aa	Hi! It seems great your concern about the Iberian Lynx, but here (in Portugal) or in Spain to be a volunteer you have to speak either portuguese or spanish and of course it helps to know something about the lynx.  I can tell you that this here its impossible to be a volunteer in Portugal but I post a web page where you can fill out a volunteer form for a spanish organization, this organization works with many nature parks and occasionally with Do?ana, a nature reserve in Andaluzia that you may know from reading about at WWF, in fact at Do?ana is one of two places where they are doing reproduction in captivity.  You can fill your volunteer form in here:  http://www.lynxexsitu.es/voluntarios.htm...  I dont know if you are already a WWF member but if not please join us next March 28 at 8.30 pm (your local time) and switch off the lights for one hour it will make a difference, for more info please check:  http://www.earthhour.org/  Take care!!!|`|fBti22TAaa	I know absolutely nothing about the Iberian Lynx.

TcgUVcYwaa	No, I already told you that in my other answer. If you apply for German citizenship you have to give up your old one(s).     The exception to this rule are EU citizenships, EU citizens who apply for German citizenship do not have to give up their other EU citizenship.    Thanks for the easy 2 points.|`|94b8KImYaa	t_maia is correct.     Besides, if you have French citizenship - why would you want a German one as well ?

CgO5Yq6Gaa	If you love to travel, France is the perfect place to live. You have such a diversity of destinations within France, from rural mountain villages to big cities and beaches. France also borders several other great European countries, making trips to Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. all within reach. If you are a wine aficionado, France is an ideal place to live. Buy table wines that would cost $10 or more for pocket change at your local market.you will always be affected by the slower pace of the French lifestyle.|`|coQKyWxPaa	France. Everything about it is great, you will have a really fun time.|`|grwLFw2Faa	France is better for a young adult to live in because young adults like to shop and France is like the shopping paradise, and they will not get bored. Also, young adults like to eat delicious food and France is the best place for that... I think.

However it rains like 200 days out of the year here and its nice sometimes but its a pain when trying to drive or playing outdoor sports.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I live an hour south of San Francisco. I love being a 2 minute walk from the beach, living in an environmentally conscious area, having good schools, and fresh local produce. I don't like the tourists. Sorry if that sounds bad, but all these beach condos are down the street from me and none of the tourists ever know how to drive around here. And they invade the streets and take over the beaches.
i47AGNpJaa	Being afraid of air flight is perfectly natural.  As a pilot, I experience paralyzing fear every time I must fly, and I've been doing it for almost 24 years!  I've had to fight through cold sweats, Air Horror (an actual clinical condition) and Night Terrors (on the nights before I fly).      I usually pray before flights.  I suggest you pray too.  Bring a Bible!|`|54tW840Oaa	chew gum while your on the plane, maybe before the plane ride take airborne or something to relax you. Trust me its not that scary it feels scary but try not to think about it, listen to your iPod while its taking off and get lost in the music so all of sudden you'll look out the window and you'll be in the air.|`|km9cQNAXaa	Whatever you do don't let either of your parents drive to the airport,  that's far more dangerous than the flight  !!!    Ian M|`|ALQuQaLGaa	Captain Art Griego, you are absolutely right.    If you believe in God, then you believe that someone in in control of everything.    I'm jealous of you, Cap.  I love flying and as a little girl I always wanted to be a commercial pilot (but then I started losing my eyesight :( ).  I have to wear contact lenses or glasses or I can't see.      In spite of all this, I can understand why people are afraid of flying.      My two cents' worth... I think it would help you to talk to a counselor.  They can help you see your fears in a new light.    I'm jealous because I LOVE Mexico and can't wait to go back.    If my advice helps you... will you thank me by finding me a boyfriend when you're down in Mexico?  Mexican guys are so sweet and handsome.  It may be several months before I get to go back down there again myself.  :)|`|VlhmbHGGaa	You shouldn't take anything, best is to have a clear mind.    Be well rested and bring a fun easy reading book. Millions of people travel by air every day, no need to worry. Well, easier said than done but it's a fact.     Have a great time in Mexico, I do envy you, sitting here in cold Scandinavia.|`|4RsCjHxXaa	Remember, the only times planes crash are on takeoff, in flight, and when landing.  Unless of course you hit another plane when taxiing.  Or if a terrorist blows the plane up.  Or the brakes fail.  Or a bird hits the engine.  Or You.....wait, Mexico?  Oh, whoa!  Your flying on like third world style old rickety planes, man!  Hope you've lead a clean life.  Well, have fun!!
B1mEwSXWaa	Well John....  there's NOT much you can do in...6 hrs. (not counted the time to & from the airport).. but you could drive to the Altstadt (the oldest part of the city) to have a decent meal or so...(try a beer, but no more than 2...) if you're not used to the german beer... - well... it's not like all the american brands...it's quite potent John...!!!    I wish you a good flight & a pleasant stay at DSSD(Dsseldorf)... grettings from Germany from...**Destiny**|`|AA11535448	Take a train into the city, go to the Altstadt and have a meal and a few beers.  (or a taxi if you prefer....about 20 euros)    There aren't really too many "sights" in Dusseldorf, but the Altstadt (old town) has great restaurants and pubs, and good for people watching.    From the Altstadt, you can easily get onto the path beside the Rhine, which is nice to walk on a sunny day.

Also, consider one or all of the nine Muses. They were the daughters of Zeus in Greek mythology. In New Orleans several uptown streets bear their names: Calliope (music), Melpomene (tragedy) and so forth. (Link follows.)    Good luck! Have fun!
tQsxsuNPaa	You know, you are a smart young person...I like your drive.  Sucks to start thinking in terms of "credit" at your age, but since the trip is all paid for, and your mom isn't struggling too much, what do you think of the idea of just not worrying too much about the money right now...do what you can, but after you get back, and maybe after track season, start looking for a different job, one that you can work more like 20 hours a week (if you work one 8 hour shift on the weekends, that's not unreasonable), and then paying your mom back a chunk of your check every week...sort of works like a credit card, but you're actually helping her out.  Chances are, she won't truly accept the money, anyways...if she takes it, she may put it away for your future.      But your heart's in the right place!   You're so lucky that she's able to do this for you...Mine wouldn't...I had to save up and go for a whole year (sigh...the horror!) while in College...the only true sad part was that I had to wait...it was the best experience!  If there's any possibility, you should try for that, too.  But that's a few years off.|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Its only pointless if you're selling candy to the same persons, so go out and sell some candy!!!!

wa5wOaqtaa	Since you are a parent, one thing to consider is the schools. Plano and Lewisville have the best schools in the Dallas area.

It is in the perfect location, anywhere in the metroplex is very easy to get to with the Dallas North Tollway, the 121 tollway, I-35, and I-635 very close.

YH3ijHncaa	very bad recession in sg u know ??why u wan go sg??|`|ke7wLRdJaa	the outcome of your epec does not necessarily determine whether or not you will get a job here in spore. If you get your epec, you just have a bit of an advantage over those who didnt because you can stay here longer, and you will have more time to look for a job. also, having an epec makes the application for employment passes a bit quicker and easier, so employers tend to lean towards those with epec, since it acts as a gauge of what MOM will do to the employment pass application. what country are you from, may i ask? i had my epec  rejected not just once, but TWICE in early 2008, but it didnt stop me from coming here to try my luck. within a week i got a job, (in may 2008). though, it is true that things have slowed down here, and firms are freezing hiring, it really is a matter of fate, and faith. just give it a shot. you have nothing to lose but (a bit) of time and money. and since you call yourself "hoping", it might do you good, if you live up to your name, and just keep on hoping. Good luck!|`|K01NU24saa	When You EPEC Rejected, is mean you will not getting EP or  S-Pass even you get a jobs.

E5gaKzCsaa	If it's just you and luggage, try IslandLink Express. Goes from the airport to the ferry, then you get on another little bus to CR. Schedule is a bit limited but the price is good. You can also get an airport shuttle bus into downtown Vancouver, Hotel Vancouver is good as you then step across the street and get a city bus straight to Horseshoe Bay to the ferry. From the ferry terminal in Nanaimo(Departure Bay) you can get a taxi to the bus station, it's not far, and take a Greyhound, though that schedule is kind of limited too. IslandLink will pick up passengers at Departure Bay too. You can fly from Vancouver airport on Harbour Air to Nanaimo and then pick up a bus from there, the plane lands pretty close to the ferry terminal and the bus terminal. Slightly more expensive but faster than bus and ferry.    Central Mountain Air can be cheap, too, depending what day and time you fly, and it's a very quick flight. Sometimes I just say the hell with it and pay for that flight because it's so simple and fast.|`|64IEjXOBaa	Probably on a Greyhound bus.|`|uHs6VSmjaa	You would have to take a  translink bus from the airport to Tswassen ferry terminal ( probably more than one bus) and then a  ferry to Nanaimo. From Nanaino, you can get a bus to Campbell river. Its gonna take you all day with connections. The other option is flying from the Vancouver airport south terminal on one of the regional airlines like Pacific Coast Airlines for about $115 one way. Its a 45 minute flight, as opposed to a whole day of buses and ferries to save about $50 or so.
HmZm1gbraa	Edgartown is the possibly the largest harbor and the town is very scenic.  It's more expensive than other towns on the Vineyard and offers upscale restaurants and stores.  It is easy to travel around from there.    Oak Bluffs could be a better spot if you prefer the north shore.   It has a lively harbor area with some great waterfront restaurants and bars and it's slightly less expensive than Edgartown.  It's also easy to travel from Oak Bluffs.    Vineyard Haven is on the north shore but is my least recommended simply because Oak Bluffs is almost in the same location and is a livelier, more happening port.    A final consideration is Menemsha which is on the north shore but is definitely more remote than the others.  It's a very quaint fishing village near the western part of the island.  It's much smaller than the other ports and traveling from Menesha is more difficult.    I have a website/blog about Martha's Vineyard, feel free to contact me with other questions (website listed in source)|`|ncojw5ttaa	My family and I used to take our boat to Martha's Vineyard every summer. We always docked at Oaks Bluff along with everyone else from our yaught club. We loved it there. Most things are in walking distance and it was very lively. It's the largest marina on Martha's Vineyard and has the most slips. It's also right near the gingerbread cottages. I highly recommend it.    This website has a lot of info about Oaks Bluff as well as events that will be taking place when you are there. Check it out: http://www.oakbluffsharbor.com/Home.html    Enjoy your trip!!!

Tours are the same pretty much every where you go. Hawwaii, Cancun, Cayman Islandsa, etc. cheapones from $40.00 to expensiveones running into a few hundreds.    One thing I would recomend is to catch a ride to Boca de Tomatlan, get a "panga" (boat ride) to ....

vdW2CaBpaa	Here's an article I wrote  http://honolulu.hawaiihome.biz/?p=117    Food, gas, etc. is a little more here than California, except LA and San Francisco. Those are pretty close.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	i live in LA now,,,,the rents in Hawaii over the last 4 years were about 1100.00 for a studio in okay part of town, down to a 2 br  for 1200.00 in the crappy part of town.  jobs are super tough to get, unless you know someone.  my idea of paradise is NOT working 2 jobs just to pay rent!   the licensing and registration in CA goes down yearly because the value of the cars drops, not so in HI.  they either stay the same or constantly goes up.   tons of homeless in Oahu too,  gas is a bit higher than Ca, food super high, in Ca they dont tax food, in HI they do.  electric is high, because many people run AC all the time.   we got it good in CA in comparison!   stay where you are, we'll dig out of this economy eventually.|`|YhECDSKRaa	If you type "cost of living comparison" into your search engine, you will find web sites that will compare most any cities of substantial size in the US.

B0ypUuHXaa	I'd be surprised if they didn't have an ice rink. It will probably be like a normal ice rink, so they should have skates. You probably can't bring your own because of Health and Safety. I'd wear jeans, because if you fall over they are quite thick. I'd say that you should act like it was a normal ice rink, and just wear what you would normally wear when you go skating. Have a nice time!|`|Sbo3IqLlaa	Yes it has a rink and u can bring ur skates if u want but they do provide them for u.

Imqb5ueqaa	A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to investors out of the money paid by subsequent investors rather than from profit.     No matter who pushes me to invest in this scheme, I will flatly say NO. Let the VP and the speaker suffer the wrath of people for leading them, wittingly or unwittingly, into this fraud which will certainly blow over.     In the past, relatives have talked to me about fantastic results from their investments. I told them "if it is too good to be true, it can not be true". A year later, I found out they lost handsomely. All I can say was "i told you so".|`|oVRGVNIUaa	juan is street wise but money is money and he cud fall for sales talk. pyrramid scheme yan. too good to be true so theres no money.
ZSAbJEv6aa	I was fortunate I was able to utilize the CAP educational fund for my son when he was in college because a year after he graduated, CAP went bankrupt.      It is not advisable to invest in such schemes, not after the fiasco created by CAP and PEP.      I was also lucky I didn't invest in Legacy.  A neighbor tried to sell me what seemed to be an attractive offer some few years back.  My being a pessimist/doubtful helped in this case.  Whew!|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	yes|`|AA11441260	i never made it a practice to invest in get rich quick scheme....allurements that the money would multiply as years go by as it is invested somewhere else.   I rather go with the profit and loss sharing business, you serve as a partner not in one who makes us look somewhat like a loan shark.|`|Imqb5ueqaa	I have an plan with PhilamLife enough to send my daughter to college. I find it comforting that Their CEO, Joey Cuisia maintains that they have more than enough funds to cover all the pre-need plans they sold.     But hearing all the stories about CAP, PEP and Legacy, I would not invest now if I was just going to do it. Not even with PhilamLife because I would worry about the domino effect of all these bankruptcies especially in the light of the global economic crisis. No, not at this time.     The bset advice I can give is to hold off any planned investments in the pre-need sector. Until the whole thing stabilizes, which could take some time.|`|9vvEOHVXaa	Pre needs are a good investment with the right company.  Mostly based on life insurance.  Which should come after the savings to manage these things.  The only pre need I would buy is burial.  I don't need it.  I could be buried at Arlington if there were room .  It's full.  There are still some old reliable companies that are worth investing in.  You have to search for the history yourself and not listen to people that don't understand it any better than you do.

VlhmbHGGaa	If it's a small change then probably not. But if the change is several hours, then yes.    Legally they are violating the contract (ticket). If the delay or change of time makes your journey meaningless, you are certainly in your right to cancel the contract and have a refund.    Just be polite but firm when pointing this out for customer service. Tell them that the change made your journey lose its purpose. If they can't take you to the destination at the agreed time, you have the right to cancel the "contract" (ticket).    And no, vouchers are not acceptable unless you accept this.|`|AA11245447	Depends on the airline; I'd say that generally not, since it's often out of their control (airport issues, mechanical issues, 'Acts of G-d', etc.    Call the airline and find out!

Other friends have emigrated to New Zealand and Australia and will never come back - you could probably get a job with hairdresing skills in several parts of the World and certainly once you have your teaching qualifications you will be welcomed with open arms.  Spend some of the next summer checking out various Countries and entry requirements, finding ones which suit you.  There is no bar to you moving to Europe - you'll probably find that more hours of sunlight will lift your spirits anyway; Ireland is lovely, but you have to like rain!

F4mgVTgzaa	I really wish I could help you on this question.

I saw his bill and it was roughly 200 Zloty. bout 100 CAD or USD for ur currency.   Now I was there for a month in December - I know 100% shopping for cloths is pricey and eating out for dinner is also a little pricey. BUT grocery food prices are reasonably cheap. gotta learn how to cook on your own i guess.    Poznan in an amazing city. I love it n I cant wait to go back.    Hope this helped somewhat. xoxo|`|4lm0oj2caa	Well, I've been following your research into studying in Poland. I told you once that public universities are free of charge in Poland but Wy?sza Szko?a J?zykw Obcych im. S.B. Lindego is a private institution and you will have to pay for studying there. Look: http://www.wsjo.poznan.pl/rekrutacja/  You might be aware of that and simply don't mind it but I'm mentioning it just for the record ...  If you want to study English in Pozna, you could try Uniwersytet Adama Mickiewicza which is a public institution and studia dzienne there are free so it'll save you some money. Moreover it's said to have one of the best English departments in Poland.  http://ifa.amu.edu.pl/fa/Prospective_stu...  It's just a suggestion, but you can try it out.   As for renting a room or a flat this site will be helpful http://dom.gratka.pl/tresc/30-24088597-w... - it starts with rooms to rent but if you continue looking, you'll find flats too.

sZFA4XXZaa	Yes. I am Australian.    The gift of being born here makes me an Australian but that is just the foundation. We celebrate Australia Day - going to the beach and throwing a barbie with friends and family and having a few beers.    Like everyone else,we also celebrate Christmas and New Years. Some also choose to celebrate events from other cultures such as Chinese New Year, which is popular here in Australia.    My family is barely religious. We are Roman Catholic but we don't go to Church.    Our culture is unique as we Australians enjoy being outdoors more than other countries. The beach, sporting events, etc. has become icons of our country.|`|PlDUV89paa	yes i am 5th generation Australian, and i love it!!    there is nothing about me that makes me particularly 'Australian', the only reason being that i was born here....all Australians are different....i think that people from other countries would think that most of us are ''bogan'' which is like another term for ''redneck''.....but we're not....    i personally celebrate Australia Day..i just love sitting back at the beach and having a beer and a BBQ, watching the sunset and fireworks..Im personally not religious, im agnostic so i dont really know what i believe in, i just know somethings out there.|`|hT7BhNamaa	I am Canadian, love it down there and would love to become a citizen.

Chris|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	I'm an Aussie.    a)I was born here!  b)Australia Day  c)Nowhere  d)No Religion for me  e)What does that even mean?|`|3jxBWMVeaa	What makes us Australian is our humour and sense of mateship, the larrakin trait many of us have. We're a bunch of jokers, but underneath it all, we're there for each other.     We celebrate Australia Day, January 26, the day Captain Cook arrived here with the first European settlers. Christmas, Easter, Rememberence Day, Nov 11, there's a minute silence at 11.00am to remember all the soldiers who died in battles. We have no Halloween here, some people will try and do it with the begging for lollies but everyone else is just like you're being stupid, we don't do that here.    Australia is not a very religious country (not counting all the migrants, we're full of Asians and Greeks who have their religions), majority of people don't really follow any religion. Or they are kind of religious but don't actually do anything religious if you know what I mean. They might say they're a religion but never go to church or anything, because that's not the norm here. Like we all celebrate Christmas and Easter, but more just as a day with family  and the commercial aspect of it, not the whole jesus story or whatever it is.    They're not religious but values most Australians have are those of mateship, doing the right thing, still having a beer and a laugh, but getting the work done as well.    There aren't really 'places or spiritual/culture significance'. I mean there's Ayers Rock, but majority of people have never seen it (I have!) and only the Aboriginal people of the area have any spiritual connection to it. I guess you could say the footy oval is a place of cultural significance, almost everybody here follows the AFL (Australian Football League, 1000 times better than any other football game). Or the barbeque, I'm yet to meet an Australian who doesn't have a barbie out the back.    There also aren't really any myths or legends. We're only a young country. Of course, there are the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories about the creation of the world and everything, which we learn a little bit about in Primary school, however noone whose not Aboriginal really knows them.    The sense of mateship is a big one in Aus. You always stick up for a mate and never leave one behind. The diggers we all know about, the terrible conditions they fought in, the people back home helping, that Christmas truce.    I'm not sure where you're going with the beach and the outback bit, so I'll just say some stuff about them. I think it's 90+% of Australians live on the coast, all our cities hug the beaches, it's a huge part of life here. Many people have a beach house to go to in the summer (which of course is Dec-Feb here). It's not unusual to spend a whole month wearing nothing but a bikini. The outback is somewhere not that many people actually go, despite the majority of our country being made up of it, but it's so incredible. Those that do 'go bush' (go into the outback) remember it forever. Last year my school took all 100 or so of us year 11 students on a bus right up the middle of the country, to Uluru and Alice Springs right up to Darwin and back down again, it was awesome. Sleeping under the stars in just a sleeping bag on the side of the highway with your best friends is something everyone should do. There's such a vast sense of space out there. You can drive a whole day without passing a town.    Anyway, I hope that helps!|`|23vKOyBraa	How many pages of answers should I write for you?

Any true Australian sees these places everywhere in this wide beautiful country, whether it be gazing at the splendour of Ayers Rock, the sunset over brigalow desert, sunrise over the ocean, sounds of the rainforest.

Imqb5ueqaa	Yes, you are right that the ingredients seem to be complete. But it is not.     The nutrients in noodles are lacking in RDA (recommended daily allowance), and especially seems to be wanting in Calcium.    Fact is that the push by the instant noodles category as inexpensive "ulam" for the family has resulted in nutrition deficiencies. Can't blame these poor families though, because their priority is to put something in the stomach.

They pedestrianised it since then.     In 1998 it was surrounded on all sides by roads and traffic.    There was a road with bus stops, for example, between the National Gallery and Nelson's Column. Now that whole part is pedestrianised.    There is no grass, all paved apart from the fountains and some modern art stuff too. Also, for certain events, there's a big screen up in front of Nelson's column.    Basically, if you want to paint the 1998 square you can't base it on the 2009 square. It's changed.    But there wasn't any grass there, no.

If you get an apartment they all have the same lease schedule. The leases all end July 31st and new leases start August first so it's impossible to get a uhaul and often end up homeless for one night. There are tons of homeless people especially around the S 5th st area that go and sleep in the apartment laundry rooms around there. It's really hard to get away from the partying college kids and impossible to get into a restuarant on the weekends and holidays Also check the sex offender registry, seems like there are more in Ames than many other towns in the area.

It's a typical college town.  One benefit is you get alot of concerts, cultural events, sports, etc. because of the university. As a kid I liked all the snow and cold temps, but since I haven't lived there for about 20 some years now, I would never go back there to live and don't miss it at all. It's gone somewhat downhill from what I've heard.    It's close to Des Moines (state capitol) and better shopping, etc. and airport.    My opinion: head south (Texas), it's better down here.|`|5gm4u5qVaa	It's a college town, so there's lots of interesting venues.  Concerts, shows, and the sort.  They have some really nice restaurants.  Some of the neighborhoods on the northwest side of town are fairly nice.  It's near Des Moines, the capital, which has a lot of cool things to do.      Also, Ames has pretty good schools.  High quality for the most part.  Statistics say the crime rate is below the US average.  Overall, it's a nice city and fairly quiet for a college town.

23vKOyBraa	Is it feasible to sue? Depends what you are hoping to get out of it.    I have Celiac Disease, so can empathise with you, however if you order a day or so before the flight, they WILL make you a special meal, with your name on it and all.    And I wonder once you were on the plane, with no meal, did you attempt to ask nicely about what they could do for you? I wonder, given your straight out SUE SUE SUE attitude.    I have been stuck a few times: I ask, they will always find me fresh fruit, check what's in business class, heck one lady on a Japan Airlines flight even had the business class galley (kitchen) make me up a special omelette. Again, it all depends on your attitude I'm afraid - they don't HAVE to accomodate you.    And I never travel without gluten free health bars in my bag for emergencies. No quarantine or bag inspection has ever stopped this. They ask, I say I have special dietary requirements, and everyone is happy.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	It's certainly feasible for the lawyer willing to charge you the billable hours for it.

Just like they don't have to provide a special meal for diabetics and a special meal for vegetarians and a special meal for people with peanut allergies.  Your dietary needs are your own responsibility, not the airlines.  So you would've needed to bring your own snacks or meals on flight with you if you had special dietary requirements.     If they were to, say not allow you to bring your own meal or snacks to allow for your special dietary needs, then you'd have a claim.   But they don't need to provide it for you.|`|AA11620976	We should all hope that a judge would throw such a frivolous lawsuit out.If you wanted  or needed a gluten -free  meal then you could have asked the airline for it or just carried one with you .|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	How many different special meals would they have to have on hand to meet the special needs of all the people who have special dietary needs?  That would be impossible.  IF you informed them ahead of time and requested a gluten free meal, perhaps they could have provided one.    Otherwise, you should be responsible to meet your own special needs.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	I'm glad you asked "feasible" rather than "possible." Because it is possible to sue just about anyone for just about anything. But feasible is a different story.    You want (or "need") a gluten-free meal. I want a vegetarian meal, with protein, low-salt, tasty. He wants high-protein, low-carbs. She wants low-fat and high-fibre... It IS possible to bring your own, you know.    Not all discrimination is illegal, immoral, politically incorrect, or unjustified.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Nothing obligates the airline to accommodate individual dietary restrictions.  In fact, nothing obligates the airline to provide or sell any food at all.  It's not discrimination.    You can sue anyone for anything these days, but that doesn't mean you'll win.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	Did you advise the airline at the time of booking that you had special dietary needs? If not, it's doubtful they are liable in any case. There's limited space in an aircraft and they can't stock food suitable for every special diet just on the off chance.    If you did make this plain at the time of booking, and you were advised that you would be provided with suitable food, then you may possibly have a case. But I would take legal advice before pursuing this further.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	I seriously doubt if you can sue, You would have to prove malice.|`|b0e41a0938c16904213d76c5d126edffaa	Did you order a special meal when you booked?|`|QNuW7ivyaa	Umm... They can not accomidate the needs of EVERYONE.  Gluten Allergies, although common, are still a relatively small amount of the population.  They JUST got rid of peanuts - and that allergy afflcits so many more people.  You have to give them time to adjust.  Im sure in time, they will make gluten free meals (if it is cost effective) As for discrimination.... i dont think so.   There are items on the plate that a person with a gluten allergy can eat. Just like a person who is allergic to grass, keeps their shoes on at the picnic. Most people with food allergies would bring their own food on a flight.    Hey... wait a minute.  Do they even have meals on 4 hr. flights anymore?!? I dont think they do!|`|VlhmbHGGaa	Not enough for a legal case. Discrimination is per definition: sex, religion and race. Maybe: age and handicap. Diet requirement is not discrimination.    However, you can bring this to customer service. If you have pre ordered the meal and didn't get it, this is ground for compensation. Either upgrade vouchers or miles into your account.|`|541b478967f8de1e9dea3a24f681ef62aa	sure, anybody can sue anybody for anything!  Lawyers will be glad to take your retainer up front.      If you have any $ left over, you can send it to me.|`|6egxGam6aa	No, it is not feasible to sue the airline in question for not offering you a special meal. You must request such a meal beforehand (usually airlines will accept these requests up to a day before your flight). If the airline did not offer a gluten-free meal as a choice for a special meal, you could possibly sue. Check the airline's website for details.    Just a note: sometimes it is necessary to do a little research before you travel. I highly recommend travel agents for this reason.

AA10250756	I live in Tampa, FL and there are lots of little communities within the city. There are tall buildings in the downtown and Channelside areas, but there are other sections within the city limits that are like suburbs anywhere else. Hyde Park is a lovely area where you can walk to the movies and stores and it has good schools. Lots of lovely, restored older homes and some brand new condos. Carrollwood has a lot of activities for kids-soccer and softball teams and its own cultural center with activities for families. It is like a typical upper middle class suburb. When you get into the hinterlands like Zephyrhills, Wesley Chapel, etc, you are getting into areas where the real estate may take another hit because it is far from the jobs, airport, cultural centers, etc.  When the price of gas goes up again, those places will be undesirable. Now if you are retired and want a senior citizen type of place to live, then those areas and Brooksville and Spring Hill will have what you want. To the south Sun City is a nice senior citizen development.  I agree with the person who told you to stay away from the USF area, but New Tampa is a lovely area with good schools, newer homes and young families.|`|83vhCGW1aa	Tampa is great.  They have a night club district with over 50 clubs.  As for small towns nearby, I'd want to live in either St. Pete's or Clearwater.  They're both smaller than Tampa and both have great beaches.  Of course this means they get a big beach crowd, but I'd say its worth it to be close to the beach if you're gonna live that far south in Florida.

Comfortable shoes are very important just incase you get lost in the airport or are stuck standing up waiting for your plane to arrive. Jeans are very ideal, adidas' black sweatpants, maybe hollister sweatpants that bunch at the end. If you are traveling alone and going to meet someone at the end of the flight, you should probably wear a t-shirt from your home town so you will be identified easily by the person pickign you up. It would be smart to wear tennis shoes, but sometimes they just dont look right with youroutfit so maybe birkenstocks or uggs to wear on the plane even flipflops will do if flying to a warm place. Putting your hair back would be smart too b/c youll probably end up sleeping on the plane considering its a 6 hour flight and get it all tangly and messy anyway so youll end up putting it back.
AA11496012	See if Southwest has any promotions.  Sometimes they have those $49 one-way ticket promotions.  Also check out http://www.airfarewatchdog.com.  It will be difficult to find a ticket price that low since usually you have to purchase a ticket at least 14 days before departure date and it is almost February.

761bbe5abfd76ba3361f64ca38023cfeaa	Its simply a reference to someone who is from or lives in Chalmette which is located in St. Bernard Parish just east of New Orleans|`|aj5IBTuXaa	It is a humorous (to some) or derogatory (to others) term for residents of the city of Chalmette on the eastern side of New Orleans.    It is said that the difference between West Bank bikers and Chalmations is that the West Bankers are more likely to have spelled their tattoos correctly.    Chalmations are a very kind people, very friendly for the most part, and prone to calling everyone "Sweetie" or "Dawlin" (Darling).  When we talk about New Orleans, the subject of YATs comes up.  Yats are those people who ask "Where y'at" when greeting others.  It is the Chalmation equivalent of "Whassup?" or "How are you?"|`|zgDQrI2uaa	Years ago Howie Mandel did a routine at the Sanger Theater and he talked about a nightmare.  A heckler in the audience told him that he went to Chalmette and the entire audience killed themselves laughing.  After that Howie continued to reference to Chalmette because it was getting him big laughs.  What was so funny is that he had no idea what on Earth Chalmette was.  Chalmette, is the brunt of every NOLA joke, dawlin'.  Now, Down da Road, is the brunt of every Chalmation's jokes.  How bad is dat?    AJ grad.

The cities are beautiful and, depending where you are, there is alot to do. You should pack for the very hot and the very cold weather because Italy gets it all.  Unless you are going to Sicily the weather can get very cold in the winter - right now it is snowing for example.  Last week it was quite warm!!!  Italy has 220v and so you will need an adapter but they are sold all over the place.  Try to study a bit of italian before you leave so that you will be able to talk to people.  Italian has a 'formal' and 'informal' way of talking and so you should become familiar with that.  Having said that, though, the italians do realize that foreigners confuse this and its no big deal really.  Italian teenagers like to go out alot just like all teenagers, I guess.  I have a teenage boy (16) and he likes to hang out downtown with his friends, go to the disco and shop for clothes.  clothes are very expensive here, especially name brand stuff, so bring plenty with you.  You will have fun - enjoy|`|iWOjZcbLaa	dude i'll tell u if u want to learn italian, italy is not the right place lol, there r so many differences... in some little town, they speak each other not even in italian :D (obviously they do with others), in big city they have kind of a slang, that is totally different from city to city, in Italy we joke a lot about this, anyway u will be an excange studend so they will talk with u with the "right italian" lol  things u should know... let's c, kids say hi each others kissing each other cheeks (not really kissing, just touching, especially between girls), enjoy our food, when u c alchool don't abuse of it, trust me is always avaiable (i don't even know if we have legal age for drinking), so if u want to get wasted, just hang out with your friends the night (especially saturday), don't get wasted in public or by your friends during the week and during the day, they will think u r stupid... bout what to pack depends where u go, but i suggest u to pack as much as possible, cause clothes in Italy r more expensive than U.S.   can i ask u where u will go? so i can help u even more...|`|fZSJfirlaa	italy is much like and old style elegant country for many people because there's alot of history ,...i think you should take some friends with you :) and American candy because there  is no American candy in Italy ..but the candy is goooood  too over there > anyways you should buy the adapters in Best Buy my sister go them there when  she went to  Spain Good luck !|`|TfyYx7A5aa	Ok i live in Italy and if you listen to me i'll explain you the situation!!!    1)Northern italians are different from the southerns so   you have to tell me which city are you going to!!!!    2)Don't think too much about your behavior: if we understand that you aren't italian we don't get disappointed.    3)Don't get scared if you hear people screaming while talking...it's common.    4)Don't get scared by the traffic...streets are quite small and many drivers drive like animals    5)Food is great: IS ITALY!!!!you won't find any KFC any Starbucks(but you'll taste the real coffee and espresso) and just few McDonald's.    6)Not all the cities have the underground and someone has just a couple of line of busses.    7)Talking about money: Milan and Rome are quite expensive...more than many cities of USA also because of the Euro, but however are less expensive than Paris and London.    8)You' ll find museums in every city.    9)If you don't know where t go to eat and you want to go top a top class restaurant ask taxi drivers!!!!    10)For further information ask me soon!!!!    And don't forget to tell me which city are you going to: IT'S VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!|`|bKYhBGcHaa	italy is a beautiful country filled with amazing architecture and blissful scenery. the food is excellent. teenagers are the same as americans but have better taste in almost everything. italians are respectful and adventurous. they like taking small trips during the year but are still focused on school and work.|`|1Vih78dZaa	Ignore the "." guy above. He's an idiot. Although he may well be an Italian, since very few Italians are actually brave enough to ever leave their country to study or go on holiday.    The other responders above have made some good points.    On language, it is true that there are dozens of local dialects and that is what most Italians speak most of the time. The language the world knows as Italian is actually based on the Tuscan dialect. However, virtually all Italians under 60 years old or so do speak standard Italian.    It is possible for tourists to get by here with very little Italian, since Italians are generally very kind and patient and most people seem to have the attitude that there's no reason why foreigners should be expected to know Italian.    The other responders are also right to say that it matters a lot where exactly you will be during your time in Italy.    Since you will be in Italy on an exchange program, I would be very surprised if the organisers did not provide you with detailed advice on what to bring and what to leave behind. Maybe you could come back here and ask for opinions on that advice when you've got it?|`|YUuAFk7Zaa	not much different of any other european country|`|ZFnPSSqAaa	Good luck!=) You will have a lot of fun, italians are very friendly but there are some things you need to know for your safety and to avoid embarassing situations.  First, the basic manners: you won't find so much differences with the manners you are used to, just remember that "adult" italians usually don't start talking with someone they don't know , so if you want to make a conversation with somebody maybe you need to do the first step.  If you need to ask directions or something, tell it clearly  or people could  think you are asking for money and they won't stop to answer; don't ask old people if you don't speak a very good Italian because they absolutely don't understand English.  For you safety: don't walk alone at night, be careful with people you don't know and ABSOLUTELY don't trust young boys from East Europe or Africa, I'm not racist but there are a lot of cases of young woman raped and sometimes killed by them, be careful!  Carry always your money in a safe place but never bring with you all the money you have got, expecially at night; credit card are widely accepted.  What should you pack? It depends from where in Italy you will go! Give more details...  Plug adapters are not hard to find here, unless you stay in a very small town.  Enjoy Italy!=)    --------------------------------------...  Don't bother about the "dot" guy. Maybe you don't speak Italian, and so what? It seems like you are coming here to learn it, and nobody wants to study what he already knows.  You will speak a good Italian after you had the opportunity to practise it in everyday life for months.

IVSqQQzlaa	I'm pretty sure when I stayed at the Met I had to pay extra for parking.  All hotels I've stayed at in the downtown area have charged extra - around $25 a day I think.  And I can't imagine there is any free parking in the area of that hotel and parking in downtown is definitely not cheap unfortunately.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I seriously doubt it.  Parking in downtown Toronto is outrageously expensive and even hotels charge for parking even if you have a room there.  Your best bet is to call the hotel and ask if parking is free with the room.  If not, then you will just have to pay.  you are better off parking at the hotel rather than drive all over the place looking for a spot then having to walk back to the hotel.  If you are spending the money on a luxury weekend then why worry about the cost of parking.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Depends on what you call downtown. There are lots of small streets in Chinatown and other areas where you can park for free.

a6JNx1tgaa	The thing with the weather here is it's a bit random. For instance; It's been freezing for ages but last Tuesday was mild enough that you could go out without a coat and be alright. Then on Thursday there was torrential rain and going out (even with rain gear on and an umbrella) was pretty hazardous.  March will be milder than it is now, but it's still kind of unpredictable.

jLTDqVHsaa	If I may ask, why do you not want to have her go his year?  I will base my answer on the assumption that, well, it may feel a bit embarrassing to keep bringing mom along on trips.  I know, I used to feel the same way.  But if there's another reason why you feel that way, go ahead and say so if you feel like it.    My suggestion - think things over, tell mom you've thought things over, and tell her that you'd sincerely love to have her along.    If my assumption is correct...please try to understand where your mother is coming from on this one.  She is willing to volunteer her time to help out with your class.  She actually WANTS to be there with you.  Do you realize how many children would do just about anything to have a parent actually WANT to spend time with them?    All too often, a parent is very quick to just want to get the children away from home - the longer, the better (get those pesky kids away from me for a few days!).  But from her perspective, she actually wants to be there with you and help out, and from her view, it seems as if you don't want her to be there to share one of the best out-of-classroom experiences her child will ever have in school.    I've been in your spot; I have parents who came on a high percentage of my school trips over the years.  At the time, yeah, I'll admit it felt a bit silly to keep bringing mom or dad along on trips.  But, looking back, those were some of the best days I ever had in school.    Over the years, you'll have plenty of time to be on your own, to be independent.  That will happen, certainly.  But for now, please just appreciate the fact that your mom wants to be with you at a time when you'll really be enjoying yourself, so welcome her along with open arms.  You'll have plenty of time to be on your own down the road, please don't rush it.  This, however, is time that you can't get back later on.  Appreciate it while you still have it.    Good luck.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	tell her that she can go  i mean she has to go with you u cant go byyourself just deal with it    how old are you?|`|u1t12bsAaa	Clean your room, set the table, watch your little brother so she can take a shower.

Let her know you understand that and appreciate her!|`|880d6d2649478e2f18b8c1386f1c18adaa	Don't nag, she's gonna think you're not ready for it.  I tried this with my mother and it worked =].  well first.  this is KIND of like a silent treatment but you ARE talking to your mom , but not as much as usual.  DON'T talk to her, unless she asks you something.  See, this way, she can see that how much of a big deal this means for you, and how this is affecting the relationship between you and her.  She'll understand.  OR  you can have her walk into a room while you are talking to a friend on the phone saying something like " nah, i can't go, i'm really sad. oh well, mother said so."  something like that.  =]  good luck  and  I live in New York!|`|ciV5wEnhaa	Get your dad to take you.

iR1pZ5VTaa	hi i live in melbourne and i go horseriding at a great place called balmoral equestrian centre, its a bit of a way out, maybe 45 mins from the CBD in a suburb called narre warren north.  i dont know the website you might want to google the name.  if youre looking for somewhere closer in blinkbonnie is good thats about a half hour from the CBD but i really depends where you are living.  and as for wesley its a good school but for rich people-they went on a drama excurtion overseas|`|6tIthLwGaa	Hey,    Melbourne is a great place to live! definitely recommended!    Wesley is also a good, private school. I know many people who go there, although they can seem a bit 'up themselves' to other schools, they have people like that but also really nice, friendly people, like everywhere you go!    Here is a great link to all the horse riding places in Melbourne.  http://www.yellowpages.com.au/search/pos...      hope that helps! feel free to mail me with any more questions!|`|hT7BhNamaa	Hi Samantha, Let me say from the outset I am not from Aussie, but been down under numerous times. Melbourne is great I enjoyed my time there. I am afraid to say this, but for horse riding I found it better in Sydney, that is my opinion.As for schools basically pretty much the same, my friends kids go to the Independent Schools or the Catholic schools rather than the Government ones, but they can afford the fees.    I visited some friends in the South Western Suburbs of Sydney, Cecil Hills, Horsley Park, near the Olympic Equestrian Center. I saw a few big horse riding spreads out that way, on massive acreage.

h6NqNzHAaa	A lot of hotels have "residence inn" type housing you can rent by the week or month. Google could help you out, search the location and residential hotels.,
qkWmI8W9aa	depends...here in miami things are a bit more expensive than for example tampa...so I can help you in apartments in miami. we're currentl looking for houses for rent and we have found one-room (efficiencies, thats what they call them here) for $800/month to 900....or you may find even cheaper than  that. every single house/apartment or efficiency has A/C here in Miami and u get assigned a parking space.  Now if you are looking for 2 bedroom or 3 bedroom, then they start from 1,000 to 1500 a month...it just depends on size and type of house. Right now it is 59 degrees abit cold but i wish it was colder...next week will be the same, but then the weather will warm up in no time, because for some reason today it was very hot.   need more help? email me|`|g05wGcPhaa	For those type of services I always resort to Craigslist    http://miami.craigslist.org/    Just click the Sublets & Temporary link under the Housing section.    Those ads are from people in the local area who rent out homes or rooms for a short period of time.    Some range from $900 a month to $2000 a month. If it cost less than $800 or $700 most likely it wont be anything fancy and or the place is in some dump.    If you want a place near the Beach expect to pay a handfull which can be at least $1500 or more.    If you plan to stay in Miami while your here avoid staying in these areas, Liberty City, Overtown, North Miami, Opa Locka, Atlantic City, Carol City, Little Haiti, or anything around Opa Locka Airport.    Also when your driving please watch where you are going and please drive accordingly to the traffic flow. If we see that you are a out of towner driving like a 80+ year old woman we will drive aggressively around you and give you the finger. People in Miami are the worst set of drivers and I'm telling you this from experience and from a Floridans perspective.

CyP7VMHHaa	All airlines place information on baggage rules (checked and carry-on) on their websites. Just go to www.nwa.com. The information is too long to re-type here.    V class is a restricted economy class fare. Airlines sell many different fares on each flight, each with its own price and restrictions. They also limit the number of discount seats on each flight. A letter is assigned to each fare type to easily identify it.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	http://www.nwa.com/travel/luggage/carryo...
zBWefnYHaa	Most do not, but some will.  Of those who would be willing to move to the USA for a marriage, some really want to make the best of it.  But many will only want a green card and will leave you as soon as they can without loosing their rights to stay in the USA.    And there are many scams where you think you will get a bride, but the people in the Ukraine will just get your money and the girl will never show up. 'She' might be nothing but a photo the scammers use while a man is doing all the contact.    And on the other side, the USA is not too pleased to get more people in, so they will try to get proof you are really a couple in love before allowing her to get the needed visa.    I think you chances are much better if you search for a bride in your own country, and the risks much lower. You can also go to Ukraine, but the chances of meeting the right girl on a short stay are not high.    And you will have to live with different cultures after marriage, which is not as easy as you might think.
Jm3vMKx3aa	Not for Dubai but for Australia if you should not be Aussies or Kiwis.    The United Arab Emirates do not require an Airport Transit Visa for a stopover at Dubai provided passengers continuing their journey to a third country by the same or the first connecting aircraft within 24 hours, holding tickets with confirmed seats, holding documents required for their next destination, and do not leave the transit area.    Citizens of Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong (SAR), Iceland, Ireland. Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vatican City could also get a visa free of charge to leave the airport during a longer stopover.

Z6tqdAoGaa	I've made this journey myself recently.I hired a car which was very cheap through Avis,and the mileage was 85 miles.Its an easy drive,freeway all the way.|`|83vhCGW1aa	If you're going to the superbowl, you're going to want to make the whole trip one great memory.  I used to spring break in Tampa, and we made lots of use of the car while we were there, so I'd rent a car and drive to the airport. (gotta call a rental company soon tho).  There are 2 good beaches within driving distance. (Clearwater & St. Petes) Also, there is a night club district with over 50 clubs.  If you fall in love with Tampa while you're there and decide you want to buy a house, check out Taylor Morrison.

Its about 90miles.  (Amtrak doesnt go between those two locations, if i remember correctly)  With the amount of people making a similar trip, you might be able to find a charter bus that's going from airport to Raymond James Stadium.|`|yVF3KA1Vaa	If you don't drive, best bet is to get Greyhound to go from Orlando to Tampa at a cost of $24.50 per person each way. The trip is between 1 hour 40 minutes and 2 hours 15 minutes with a direct connection to Tampa meaning no stops in between and no buses to transfer.    For today Saturday January 31st and Super Bowl Sunday February 1st, Greyhound buses depart Orlando at 5:15am, 8:05am, 1:15pm, 4:45pm and 8:40pm.    The Orlando Greyhound Bus Station is located at 555 N JOHN YOUNG PKWY Orlando, FL 32805 which is about 15 miles from Orlando International Airport located in Downtown Orlando.    The Tampa Greyhound Bus Station is located at 610 POLK ST  Tampa, FL 33602 which is about 3 miles from Raymond James Stadium.     It is actually weird that Raymond James Stadium is right across the street from Tampa International Airport along US-92. Just thought I bring that up in case if you chose an airline which you can switch cities without paying a fee like Southwest.|`|cwz10Ubsaa	The best way to Tampa Fl call OTC or visit local Orlando transportation there web is OrlandoTransportationService.com.

E5gaKzCsaa	Seattle and Vancouver city are about 150 miles apart. Driving usually takes about 3 hours or a bit more, allowing for the fact that there may be traffic, and that you may have to wait a bit in a border line-up. There is no ferry between those two cities. There is a ferry from Victoria to Seattle, and that was probably what you heard of. People often get the two cities mixed up because Victoria is on Vancouver Island, though Vancouver city isn't. I haven't taken that trip so I'm not sure how long it takes. If you search "Victoria-Seattle Ferry" it will come up.     If you're a US or Canadian citizen, you don't need a passport yet to cross the border or to get home again if you're driving or travelling by sea. You will need one after June 1, 2009, and you need one now if you're flying. You will need proof of citizenship and a government issued photo ID like a driver's licence.|`|wXIZ7FTkaa	It is about 60 miles and don't forget to take your passport and yes you can get on a ferry at the waterfront  in downtown Seattle.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	You can drive from one to the other in under 2 hours if the border crossing goes well....or you could spend a few hours sitting there.|`|d077c7oMaa	I'd say around 2 hours depending on the lineup.. you should go earlier in the morning to avoid long border lineup waits.|`|AA12095483	By car it's about 3-1/2 hrs. The ferry takes slightly longer because it travels slower, but it doesn't go to Vancouver, it goes to Victoria and you have to take another ferry from Victoria to Vancouver, and going that route will take you the better part of a day.   All you need is a passport and some money.   Have fun!
AA12225622	It's that guy gave you a great answer.    I would only add the State Capitol Building.    It is amazing and it is in Sacramento.|`|AA10241450	How about the ferry building in San Francisco considered the Gateway of the Pacific - also the Golden Gate and Bay bridge since you used to have to take a ferry to San Francisco or going all the way around the peninsula.  Other areas would be Silicon Valley 60 miles south from San Francisco.  Can consider the multiple universities - San Francisco University - State; UC Berkeley, Sanford, etc.    Other well known historic areas would be Kaiser - the hospitals and shipyards.  A battleship a day was creating during WWII.  The trolley cars in San Francisco also BAR for transportation along with the airports. Emily Airheart flew from their on her last historic run to the Pacific.   Embarcadero shopping districts would be vital to the city along with all the shopping on Market Street.      There is much history - California is the  1 state in terms of helping the economy in the U.S. so you can also look at the significance of the banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Charles Schwab, along with the tech companies Cisco, Yahoo, Google, Ebay, Intel, HP, etc.  Favorite companies you may want to look that are non-tech would include GAP, sourdough bread, etc or look in Wikipedia for other suggestions.     In my opinion Silicon Valley would be the most important areas in the past thirty years - the number of companies with head quarters is amazing and Venture Capital has made California lead the nation.    The Spanish missions were very vital in the 1700's - helped create the many cities around the coast.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I was going to say Sutter's Mill, but that's not in Sacramento or the Bay Area.  But Sutter's Fort is in Sacramento.  In San Francisco there is the Presidio, there's Mission Dolores and Fort Point, all places that have been there longer than the city itself.  Portsmouth Square in Chinatown was the original town square of San Francisco.  There are many buildings, in fact whole neighborhoods, that escaped the 1906 earthquake and fire.    Ever been to the top of Mount Diablo?  The entire state of California was laid out using the peak of Mount Diablo as a reference.  There were coal mines there during the Gold Rush, in fact the state tried to rename it 'Coal Hill'  (I like Mount Diablo better, don't you?)    Benicia used to be the state capital, and the old capitol building is preserved, with desks and everything.  Very interesting to see.  And of course the current state capitol in Sacramento, which was restored only a few years ago.    The Palace of Fine Arts is a building left over from a world's fair held in San Francisco in 1912 to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal.  The Music Concourse and Japanese Tea Gardens in Golden Gate Park are left over from another big fair in 1901.|`|AS8V9rAFaa	spanish missions? san rafael/petaluma (marin)|`|CBZQqCRlaa	anything to do with sutter's mill|`|83vhCGW1aa	Its gotta be the San Francisco Mint.

2e96c2bf9b535782c649bef95596bcd4aa	Contests that involve prizes are void in Alaska and Hawaii because there is no UPS ground service to ship the prizes to the recipients.  For example it would cost about a hundred dollars to ship a dvd player to Alaska via UPS air, which would make the shipping cost more than the value of the prize.  Some prizes, like a plasma television, are literally impossible to ship to Alaska or Hawaii through any common carrier.    Prizes that are just monetary are void in Alaska and Hawaii because rather than hiring another team of lawyers to write another set of rules for a few hundred thousand people they just re-use the same language as the DVD example.  However, almost contests that has a large cash grand prize usually has a third or fourth place prize that is an item that can't be shipped through a common carrier to the 49th and 50th states.    Prizes that involve transporting the winner anywhere (ie, to be on a game show or pick up a "big check" or send a team of people to photograph the winner with their "big check") are void because the airfare to get to Alaska and Hawaii is 3-4x the amount of anywhere in the lower 48.  Travel agencies treat Alaska and Hawaii as "international travel" even though it is state-to-state.|`|eulMjLtPaa	I did a little bit of research, and found no reasoning behind contests being limited to the continental US.

chlGzFQlaa	India is such a marvellous place with such a rich cultural heritage, it's a pity that travellers will only get to see a few.     bathing in the river ganges might be interesting (it's said to wash away all sins, and the river itself is said to have descended from the heavens)    there are a variety of monasteries and temples that you could go to if only to admire the architecture.     Oh, and I must warn you to never use your credit card in small shops in India, they scam tourists big, BIG time. I know, I've been going there for the summers for the past eleven years, but my skin colour is brown, so I'm pretty desi as they get.     It's a great country, and it all depends on where in india you will be landing, there's a little bit of history in every corner of India, i suggest you do some hardcore research and shortlist the most spiritually enlightening places that you would like to visit.    Kudos to Sa for mentioning bugspray. I must warn you, the mosquiotes come at tourists by the hundreds, I swear to god they f8cking eat you up if you forget to use your commercial product.   The beggars are a foul sight, forgot to mention that. They steal if you take out a purse stuffed with cash, so just keep 100 ruppee bills in your pocket, that's about 6 dollars right?

oqiw8Ruuaa	those remarks were completely uncalled for.        who said he's our hero?    he didn't save us from anything anyway.        furthermore,    why should we be proud of his achievements?    it's obvious that his wins are just his and not ours.    i mean, should we be happy that he kicks butt    through winning violent games? if you ask me,    boxing is just the reincarnation    of an ancient game in Rome.    you know, the gladiator thing.    well, i would have been proud if he used his brain    to win a quiz bee or something.        also, what's with his silly    "para sa sambayanang pilipino" punch line?    gee! it gives me the creeps.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	my wife is a filipina.

Not only am I agreeing with you....I MAJORLY concur to that!    Call me gritty, but honestly...he is an arrogant bloke! But then again..having a president that only sees gold in an instant worldwide hype...Pacquiao could be a great candidate to boost the Philippines.     But man......he is just a two-faced cheap trick!    Argh...he just disgusts me!=c|`|Imqb5ueqaa	I am not sure that the premise is correct. I am a great fan of Pacquiao, but I do not see us NEEDING him to be a hero.    He is a sports hero, acclaimed not just in the Philippines, but worldwide. Even retired boxing greats are eager to get a fight with him, because he has accomplished what very very few have ever done.     As proof that we Filipinos know the nuances between a HERO (in the same old as Jose Rizal, Bonifacio, Ninoy) and a SPORTS HERO (Elorde, Pacquiao, Efren Bata, Paeng Nepomuceno), Pacquiao was not elected by the very people in his neighborhood who adore him as their Sports Hero.    Other than his accomplishments as a boxer, he is also seen to be religious. Whether or not this is real is beside the point to some people. Seeing him do the sign of the cross, kneeling, in prayer, etc at least influences people to pray to their gods.|`|9vvEOHVXaa	Anyone that gives a dime to charity is a bigger hero than he who has much and gives nothing.  Show me where he has shared once and then I'll call him a hero.  Never a diplomat though.|`|wqP8ACpBaa	Everyone needs a hero.   And every nation need one too.   More than one would be even better.    Here is my take though. Pacquiao is well known to every real boxing fan all over the world, regardless of age, gender or race.     I admit I do not care for him all that much although I did came to admire him within the last year or so. I have come to know many other Filipino boxing greats of the past & where are they now, all but forgotten--and that goes for most athletes of long ago, except for the really exceptional ones. And you either love him or hate him, one thing though--he has really become a world class boxer.    And Pacquiao now, is probably the most widely known Filipino athlete of all time, living or dead, yes including Bata Reyes, Paeng Nepomecuno & all the Filipino Olympic medalists. And he is still active. He is made as an example not because he is in a brutal sport. I believe he is being made one because most people can identify with him. Much like the African Americans or the other Immigrants in America can identify with Barack. That we can dream & that we can achieve it--with God and with sacrifice, dedication & hard work.    And there are indeed many other examples, I have even made blog posts about them, see below if you are interested.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	He is a hero to those who can use his popularity amongst the masses for their personal gain. That's what kind of a hero he is. But boy! he sure can fight.|`|eDjiOWKtaa	the guy was a yosi-boy vendor in the streets with not much of an education. now Pacquiao has got millions of dollars in prize fight earnings, pay-per-view shares, and endorsements because he is currently the world's best pound-for-pound boxer. i don't know how many sports fans you know abroad, but everyone who agrees that boxing is a sweet science more than it is a brutal sport knows who Manny Pacquiao is and what country he represents.    that's a rags-to-riches story any way you look at it and it merits the adulation of people who want to be successful someday. i'm not saying every poverty-stricken young boy should learn how to box, but they ought to have a dream and use their talents because that's the best way to succeed in life.    i'm sure there are a lot of "heroes" this country has produced but none had the same kind of recognition that Pacquiao has achieved so far.
AA12095483	Some hotels will let you have a party in the party/meeting room, but the rates and the number of people you can have vary from one hotel to the next. Why not phone  couple of the hotels and get some accurate information?

This is a 4 star, so the better chance you will have at partying.|`|a7bfe052a2f29eb67432ef60384d97a7aa	Hi You know me ,    Your best strategy is to get yourselves a bunch of discounted rooms on a site like http://www.cheaperthanhotels.com/Canada/...  or something similar. However , first identify the hotel - don't book it until you have the party place sorted,    After all you have to sleep somewhere.    Then contact the hotel and tell them you need a place to party. Be honest - if it's going to be a wild party it'll get spoiled in a hotel as the guests may complain. But the hotel should be able to organise it in a sound proof area or elsewhere.    Hope this works for you

wMxJDXcRaa	Whilst it's something worth considering, Mugabe is not as stupid as he looks. He brought out a law that forbids non-Zimbabweans purchasing / owning property in the country. You could consult an estate agent like Pam Golding Properties, SA. They deal with properties in Zimbabwe, and it's always best to get the information from the horse's mouth, so to speak. Good luck.|`|ifFYd0TGaa	ur right it is a brill idea, but sucks too.many of us have thought about it.  if you look further north you will see what happens , even after a real sh-t head goes away.  africa never recovers after turmoil as the next bozo can never get the place right.  lets face it, if there wernt so many whites holding the fort in s.a. then it too would have already sunk into the abyss.wait till after the elections and then decide, like 4years after them.  how ever! having said that, i must say that botswana and namibia r doing well and besideds a few kinks are much better bets.|`|4e8RU3eIaa	This is not a very good idea. Are you white? If you are white, we can relax the law and allow you exceptionally to buy a farm. Let me tell you that land prices are quite high, but we will find a way to let you buy if you borrow money from outside Zimbabwe and pay for your farm inside Zimbabwe with either American dollars or Rand. You will then own a farm in Zimbabwe.    For a little while. Then we will take your farm, just like we have taken the farms of all the other whiteys. You do not think we are going to let more whiteys come in before we have got rid of those already living here? We are not stupid.|`|rrEONPYWaa	Why buy a mere property, if u can afford to buy the whole country.   Oh! wait, the  finishes include Mugabe.|`|LAEIHGBoaa	I will not touch anything in Zimbabwe right now. Give it still a few years.

However here is an honest attempt.  Photography Kerala- Jaipur, Orissa, UP, Kashmir, Banares, Maduri, Kumbakkonam, Goa etc.   If you like beaches then Marina, Kovalam, Goa and Mangalore.  But if you want to go to hills/mountains resorts etc then it will be Ootty, Kodikkanal, UP and others.  Temples and Tanks - Kumbakkonam Tamilnadu  Wild life- Kerala, Mysore.  The list is endless.

London is a grand international city, yet just an hour's drive away you can find small fishing villages with gossip, fear of outsiders and even their own language. Try going by train from London to Norwich. There is no direct good road and the train does a circuitous drive for 3 hours!  The ladies will be wearing haircuts from 15 years ago and will speak in a version of English radically different from London!  As for the black population of Britain they tend to remain in enclaves, just as the many different British. For example Leceister is a very Indian city and part of South London very former Jamaican. So this adds to the great diversity. Go here and find an old Celtic tribe, go there and it's Chinese, go there and they're all Romantized Celts, over there Frenchified. It's a great experience, and only when you get well away from the diversification in Wales or Scotland do you get ill-informed intolerance. Just ignorance really.
