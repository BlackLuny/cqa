9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I share oranges with my dogs all the time. Too much could cause an upset stomach so you shouldn't over do it, but they certainly aren't going to die.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	No oranges are not bad for dogs to eat and no they will not kill them. However the seeds might    If they ate too much they would most likely throw up.|`|OB4fmosJaa	Oranges aren't bad for dogs, that's some sort of myth. Never even heard that one before. Grapes and Raisins are bad, oranges are fine.|`|44kEtDvIaa	The fruit is fine for them, in moderation.
k3AmV6waaa	Yes, bring her to the vet just to be sure.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	I'd get her checked. Sounds like she's in pain. She may have an injury you can't see.|`|yGteqZoCaa	A friend of mine had a cat like this years ago.  The cat was over weight and didn't like people, it just felt depressed and scared and because she was a fat cat they just ignored her and didn't give her much attention.  When I use to go over and visit with my friend, I noticed the cat and bent down to pet her and she just growled deeply too, and scared me a little bit, but then I just got the nerve and picked her up and petted her gently all the while this cat is still growling at me.  This cat must have weighed 20 lbs over weight 'cause she was heavy, but I just kept petting her and talking to her and about one month went by and the cat soon realised that I cared for her and then when she heard my voice she would come running from the bushes that she would always hide in and my friend couldn't believe her eyes.  The cat slowly lost the weight on her own and became a real friendly cat after all that attention I gave her. It was a trust thing and the cat never trusted people before, but she noticed that I went out of my way to give her some extra attention when no one else would and the cat began to trust me and never growled again, ever...........  So my advise to you would be just to have patients and a soft hand when petting them and show them that they are special and they will come around.  Good luck.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Tastey's right. She's just got trust concerns.  Now is the time to 'kill her with kindness' so to speak.  Just speak softly and calmly to her and pet her gently and often.  She'll simmer down. Just be patient both with her and yourself. It'll be worth it.
CzWvNQxMaa	They both are great dogs No i have never had a rott but they seem great I have a pit don't listen to the other person above who cares if he or she doesn't like the looks  of a pit if you do they great my baby pup is adorable. Its really what you want. Pits aren't what everyone thinks my pup is such a lap dog she loves to sleep with me she gets so excited when i come home  she is a great dog as long as you don't make them bad they are amazing same with rotts. So don't listen to someone not liking the way one looks if you like both the looks then look into the problems and info about them. Good Luck.|`|0w1kwVFYaa	Wow, pretty pathetic to send one of your dogs away just to have another breed of dog? APBT's are loyal and have a heart unlike you.|`|sNDQCpZsaa	Whichever you want, because they are both great dogs. Whatever you do, though, DON'T ABUSE THEM OR TRAIN THEM TO BE GUARD DOGS! They will just end up causing drama and getting sent to te pound to be killed!|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	i had a rotty and he was the biggest lap dog, he had his favorite recliner, so who ever sat there got a lap full of rotty. I have a friend who has 2 pit bulls both of them are very nice dogs, both have bad reputations due to bad breeding and training, but if you raise one the right way he can be a very good dog, so i would say which ever you are drawn to more is the one you should pick. rotts eat much more than pits|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	depends what you want from your dog. How much you know about them, how much you understand there needs.  These 2 breeds are very different in extremes. Its unfair to compare them|`|hoeN5xP0aa	No dog breed is "better" than another. It's all upon preference. Research before getting a dog to make sure that it is the right breed for you.    *Edit; Why in the world would you want to get a new dog, and in return get rid of one that you have now? There are already so many dogs in shelters and with bad owners, why do it to another?|`|5rvjjaVlaa	i had a rottweiler for 15 years but she passed away a couple months ago.she was the greatest dog and i miss her soooo much,but it depends on you and what you want.look around for both and when you find that special dog,you'll know it.rotts are very smart and loyal dogs.|`|lmSffrNuaa	The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog. Originally bred to "bait" bulls, the breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become "nanny dogs" because they were so gentle around children. Their tenacity, gameness, and courage make them popular competitors in the sports of weight pulling, agility, and obedience competition.    Rottweilers were originally bred to drive cattle to market. Later they were used to pull carts for butchers. They were among the earliest police dogs and serve with honor in the military. Most important, they are popular family guardians and friends.    Check these links to know more information about this breed.    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s63.html  http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxv.html|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I have a Pitbull and had a Rottweiler. Both are great dogs and were good at being a guard dog.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	It depends on what you are trying to do. Both the APBT and the Rottweiler are excellent dogs for weight pull and other strength-dependent sports.  I have owned both breeds, and have found them both to be delightful companions. Both, however, share the "dangerous/vicious dog" rap, so they are not accepted in all communities. The Rottweiler is more suited for being a guard dog, however, since APBTs were bred to NOT be aggressive towards humans. Also, the Rottweiler is a dog that typically gets along with other dogs better than the APBT, although this, again, varies greatly with socialization and training.|`|OB4fmosJaa	I would choose the Rottweiler.. They are a nice sweet breed, and they are a good looking dog. I don't like the looks of the pit bull. Plus you rarely see one that is well bred and correct, they always have those crappy wide fronts.|`|nI8G21y8aa	y not both!?!?    they are both great dogs.   pitweilers are out there, plenty of them at shelters  ADOPT!
87Zhgwmcaa	Hon, I strongly suggest you do not declaw your older cat. Hear me on this. Your younger still can adapt to her new body, but older cats take longer, much longer to heal, and don't you think of doing all four paws.     My cats are declawed, but I'd never declaw an older cat because it can traumatize them and, as you know, this procedure is irreversible. Your two cats will do just fine. When they play, they mostly use their back claws while laying on their back. So, if the kitten still has her back claws they will be fine just like this. Please, do not declaw your 3 year old. They will both be ok the way it is right now, trust me.|`|49IbcrLaaa	It's so bad to get older cats declawed because it's stressful for them & it causes more pain then in kittens.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	By declawing a cat, you are effectively cutting off a piece of their toe. There is absolutely no reason to do this, especially to your older cat because it can traumatize them. The procedure is very painful and not something you should do lightly. While the cat is not that old, he/she is old enough to know the difference.     Cats play all the time and refrain from killing each other. When they are just playing, they swat, claws in, so there's no need to worry that the older one will scratch up the younger one.     If it really worries you that much you can get a product like Pedipaws and file his/her nails down.    I really, really don't recommend declawing your cat, or any future pets.    Additionally, I would think about finding another vet. If it was your mom, dad, or child and the doctor accidentally cut off their fingers during an appendectomy, you'd be pretty upset. Oops and a refund isn't really compensation for making such a major mistake. Mistakes such as that can carry over to more important issues; you should be 100% sure that your vet knows what they are doing. Declawing your cat by accident is unacceptable.    Sam|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	You need to go back to the vet and tell them you need your money back for everything but the spay since that's all you guys wanted, right? If they dont wanna do that then yes by all means tell them to make this go away they can declaw your other cat 'on the house' for their incompetency. I would even go so far as to find another vet but thats just me.  Good luck to you    P.S you neednt get your elder cat declawed if you dont want to. Cats have thick coats of fur, remember not only to keep them warm but to protect them from sharp claws :-)  Neither cat will intentionally hurt the other. They know how to pull their punches and as long as your elder cat isn't using your furniture as her own personal scratching post, there's really no need.|`|rhs6xr98aa	This is horrible. You should seriously sue the vet for declawing your cat. Did you know that almost 95% of all cats experience personality changes after getting declawed? They usually become meaner and more likely to bite since they can't defend themselves naturally or release stress by scratching.     Don't declaw your old cat, you are going to be really upset when seh comes back and becomes different from the cat that you've loved for so long.       Overall, it's just really cruel and it is completely ridiculous that your vet did this. I would sue just because it's not moral and the vet probably just wanted more money, especially with this economy.|`|zguucR8yaa	I don't see any logic in declawing your other cat.  Not only would they have refunded the charge for the declaw, I would not have paid for anything in light of the huge mistake they made. Don't ever go to them again.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	No,I would not..  I would get a wet towel/cloth on the kitten
mvgfatSNaa	Cuckoo, Cowbird, Whyda, Honeyguide and Black-headed Duck  These birds, called brood parasites, lay their eggs in another bird's nest and let the other bird parents feed and raise their chicks. The "egg abandoner" is then free to mate again and lay more eggs in another nest. The cuckoo is the best known brood parasite and an expert in the art of cruel deception. Its strategy involves stealth, surprise and speed. The mother removes one egg laid by the host mother, lays her own and flies off with the host egg in her bill. The whole process takes barely ten seconds. Cuckoos parasitize the nests of a large variety of bird species and carefully mimic the colour and pattern of their own eggs to match that of their hosts. Each female cuckoo specializes on one particular host species. How the cuckoo manages to lay eggs to imitate each host's eggs so accurately is one of nature's main mysteries.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	Cuckoos are the most notorious birds to lay eggs in a neighboring species' nests.  They'll actually kick out the eggs of another specie and lay their own so that cuckoo chicks will be raised.    Blue jays are also known to do this, as are Crows and any members of the Corvus family|`|8noe8TWkaa	a jail bird ;)|`|SYJhGXu4aa	that would be weird.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Cowbirds are the most prevalent.

qgeI6Chxaa	2-3 pellets per day is fine. A fish's stomach is only about the size of its eye, so they don't need a lot of food. And I hope you have those bettas in separate tanks.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	2-3 pellets is about right, a bettas stomach is the size of one of it's eye. Males typically eat more, up to 4 and females only need like 2.    Hopes this helps!|`|8T6HrTiTaa	2-3 pellets a day is what you should feed them. So yes its fine.|`|mK7L5A7paa	They say official guideline is amount that fish can eat within one minute.

Rx7wv4JLaa	Never...unless they are a herding or hunting dog where they live with other animals    Dogs are social animals that need to stay with their family and live indoors.    Its ok to allow a dog to play around outdoors buts it not a good idea to allow them to live out their permanently.    Dogs who live outdoors are more likely to develop aggression problems due to frustration.|`|76nTvO4iaa	IF you mean during the day, she's old enough now to be left out in the morning or the afternoon (choose one) - provided the weather isn't too cold where you are.     If you haven't, talk to your vet about when he wants to spay her.  If you're planning on leaving your dog outside during the day she needs to be fixed unless you want "fence climber" puppies.    I put my dogs out during the day when the weather is nice.  When it's nasty, they stay inside and play couch potato.    At night, your dog needs to be in the house with her people.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Yeah you can leave he rout now. but bring her in at night. Make sure she has some stuff to do and plenty of fresh water. I would feed her before bring her outside. I always think the birds and squirrels come get the food.      Why do people on here have a fit when others ask about leaving their dogs outside. They are dogs they should get outside. No body fusses about cows or chickens being outside.     Its a beagle she will probably love it. Oh yeah make sure your fence is ready for her. Her sense of smell will overpower and thing else. If she gets out chasing after a scent she will wander right into the street or anywhere the smell is taking her.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Never! Why would you keep her inside and then suddenly banish her to the backyard? Beagles are such sweet little dogs,and they are pack animals - they suffer when left outside alone.Also,it is cold out and beagles do not have the coat to live outdoors.If the pup is not spayed,she will get pregnant as soon as she comes into heat.Please let her stay indoors.Get her a crate to keep her in at night and when you are not at home until she is housebroken and over the teething stage if this is what is bothering you. get her spayed and she will settle down as she matures.Would you throw your toddler out for misbehaving? Imagine living outside,all alone.
9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Well, I hate to say this but you guys messed up. New pets need no less than a week to acclimate themselves to their new surroundings. That includes existing pets and ppl.  That means no touch no talk (to the cat I mean and no eye contact)  He's on edge to start with just because he has no idea how the other cat intends to treat him.  Throw in a loud unexpected noise and pow!! One freaked out cat. But not to worry. You can start your week now.  I know I said no talking to him but you can actually say something short and soft every time you pass him or if he approaches you like Hi (his name here) so he can at least learn his name.

BYoVsKY4aa	1. Royal Canin is a great bagged dog food and is one of the only brands that I would feed my own dogs. It was developed by the royal dog caretakers of the Queen's dogs, so you know it's got to be good!  2. Tear stains are common in Shih Tzus and is perfectly normal. There is a cleansing wipe for tear stains that you can find at your local pet supply store that is etremely useful for these.  3. I, personally, have never used Wellness. So I cannot comment on the quality besides what I have heard, which is that it is very good.  4. Petsmart carries both Wellness brand and Royal Canin brand dog/puppy food.  5.

I have a pure bred German Shepherd Dog and I feed her German Shepherd Blend Eukanuba. Its formulated for her breed and she loves it. I also give her a dog vitamin once a day (breeder uses the same vitamins) to help in the growth of bones and joints... it also makes her fur look fantastic.    Once a week or so I will make her a home-cooked dinner like chicken and rice or i'll throw an unseasoned steak on the grill.    the chicken and rice is fantastic when a dog is sick. my dog got really sick a few months ago and wouldnt eat so I made a chicken/rice mixture and once it cooled I gave small amounts to her throughout the day and she loved it and was back to her usual energetic self in just a couple of days. :)

Don't buy any dog food that you can get at the grocery store or Walmart. Check out your local pet food store and buy something that doesn't include ethoxyquin, bha/bht, dyes, corn, wheat etc.. You want your main ingredient to be something like Beef Meal, or Chicken Meal. Not a whole meat, as it is posted in it's wet form.. When dried to be made into food it loses it's value and is actually way down on the list. The Beef / Chicken Meals are added in a dry form and you are actually getting that meat.. Stay away from any food that has by products !|`|70K9rb5Iaa	I feed all my animals Natural Choice Nutro.  I think it is a wonderful food. And not super expensive.  As for wet food, I really really only recommend feeding it in very small amounts. Its a seldom treat for my dogs, not part of there diets. The reason being, wet food sticks to dogs teeth very easily and even more so in a small mouthed dog and unless you brush your dogs teeth, that food is just going to hang around and grow bacterial. I mean, think about never brushing your teeth and not being able to lick it off/pick it off your back molars. EW. This ends up causing dental disease, which travels into the blood stream and cause a slew of problems long term.   Think about all the pups (cats too)  who have super bad breath, this is why. Dry food tends to stick less. Although I do recommend brushing (If your pet wont let you, just get some of the doggie/kitty toothpaste and put some in the food, the enzymes in the toothpaste will still be somewhat affective in this way and its better then nothing)  Also dental treats are awesome, Greenies is my top choice.  Stay away from any foods that are at walmart and such.  The cheaper the product, the cheaper the food quality.  Good luck, its good to know that you care enough about your pup to find out what best!

And how old is your dog? Many dogs develop spots like that as they age. You can have a vet check it out if you are worried, but my guess is that it's harmless age spots.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	I used to work at an animal hospital for a few years and I've only seen one dog that may have what you are describing...    I have questions, first, though: are these block splotches flaky or oily?  Is there a certain odor to your dog that seems unusual?  Most important:  Does any hair grow where the black spots are?    If you answered yes to any of these questions --->    The dog I mentioned before had a skin fungus-like ailment.  I'm not a vet, so I really cannot say what your dog has, but if these spots are not washing off or seem inflamed or raw, PLEASE take your pup to a vet if you can.  Skin diseases in dogs are mostly non-life threatening, but they can be extremely uncomfortable.|`|zO7Wy2qSaa	I think is just stubborn body dirt and i normally try to clean it off if not it will be there.    For the ear, pls smell if there is an odour, if yes, might be an infection that just started occurring.    If no smell, just ear wax of the dog.|`|8iIPjbtNaa	I too noticed this in my oldest dog. When I took her to the vet to ask about it I was told it was age spots. They are nothing to worry about. Dogs get them as they age, they are only more visible on some dogs rather then others.

NnYB9eXiaa	Here's a great list of snacks (do's and don'ts) I'm leaving the note in about dwarf hamsters even though yours is a Syrian (teddy bear) because dwarf hamster owners will probably read this too :)    Anytime you introduce a new food to your pet, do it in very small amounts, only feed it once and see how their little tummy handles it.  Some hamsters do better than others with certain foods, but with a little time you'll come up with a snack list that your hamster will love - and that will give them the extra nutrients they may not get from their daily food mix or lab blocks!    Some suggested fruits and vegetables:    *** apples (no seeds!)  *** bananas  *** blueberries  *** cherries (fresh, no pits)  * broccoli  * carrots  * cauliflower  * cucumber  * dandelions greens  *** grapes  * kale  *** peas  * potato (cooked)  * romaine lettuce - not iceberg  * spinach  *** strawberries  *** sweet potato  * squash  * zucchini    Other treats:    * hay   * whole grain bread or toast  * whole wheat pasta (cooked)  * brown rice (cooked)  * whole grain cereal (no sugary cereal)  * meal worms  * crickets or  * small pieces of cooked chicken  * bit of hard boiled eggs  * nuts (no almonds; unsalted) - in moderation  * unsalted peanuts - in moderation  * pumpkin seeds  * lentils (cooked)  * sunflower seeds - in moderation  * plain air popped popcorn (no butter or salt!)  * plain dog biscuits    What to Avoid    * celery (the fiber strings can choke them and high sodium content)  *** Watermelon (high water content)  * High amounts of lettuce (high water content)  * Pork  * raw beans (kidney beans, black beans, lentils)  * raw potatoes  * almonds  * citrus fruit  * garlic  * onions  * rhubarb leaves or raw rhubarb  * chocolate  * any sugary or salty foods  * any junk food|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Porridge is fantastic.  My lot get some every saturday morning and they all love it!  Make it with milk, and a teenie bit of natural sugar, and you can add bits of chopped nuts, fruit etc etc.  Pop a teaspoons worth in the hamsters cage (preferably on an area with no sawdust, but no worries if not-my robo sits in it as he eats it!).  Make sure it is cooled first though!  And you can eat the rest!  Make sure you take any remainder out of the cage at the end of the day though, so it doesnt go bad, but to be honest, i rarely find any left!    Scrambled eggs are also a good one.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Avoid the sugar junk food like yogurt drops many people will tell you are good.    A much healthior treat would be crickets or meal worms - better to get them from the pet store than your yard. Many folks don't realise that insects are part of a hamsters natural diet. Ours love the occasional cricket treat - it's probably the only thing they like more than sunflower seeds.

IPlvWyDFaa	I'm assuming you mean GSD - I have 4 and when they were puppies, they never slept a lot and they were very active. I strongly suggest you take the puppy to the vet.|`|76nTvO4iaa	That's plenty to walk a puppy that age.  Puppies tend to sleep a lot - they're still babies and need their rest.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Puppies that young need short but frequent exercise. 20 minutes may be too much at once for such a young pup....I'd do 10 minutes each time until the puppy gets a little older.  If your pup is healthy otherwise and free of parasites, I wouldn't worry about it.    Edit: I truly wonder how many puppies people have had who think that 5 month old puppies don't sleep a lot. Puppies that young play hard but in SHORT bursts....then they rest. 20 minute walks, three times a day is A LOT for a 5 month old pup....no wonder it's tired.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	I don't know what a GSD is but I have 2 pit bulls and a min pin/ shitz tu mix, and we all sleep all day. They are lazy inside but active outside. But I trained them to be calm in the house and walk and run and have a great time at the park or on our runs. I have a small apartment so sleeping or playing with their toys is all there is to do inside.    Oh yeah, you have a puppy. He is gonna sleep alot.|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do--any job.

Check out this link and learn everything about your dog.  http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/german-she...|`|L22hVXTIaa	When a dog's brain is not being stimulated, they rest/sleep.  In the wild, animals learn to conserve energy for important things like huntin, patroling boundaries and fending off rival males for territory and females, etc.  So, when there's nothing interesting to do, dogs sleep.    ADD:  Didn't notice that you said your dog was only 5 months old.  That's pretty young and 3 times a day may be a bit much.  He's still a baby and needs his rest.|`|11aoH0O5aa	What is a G.D.S ?|`|5kDQLFhraa	How long have you been walking him? He may just need to get used to being exercised. Its like us.. if we haven't been out for a walk in awhile we are going to be tired afterwards. He will come around and start to really enjoy his walks. I have 4 GSD who LOVE their walks. I have a 4  mo old pup who I take once in the morning and once at night for about 30 minutes each time and she does great. They also get lots of exercise playing outside all day.
6HC0rRTsaa	I have five cats. One solid black, one tortishell tabby, 3 solid white ones, and if you don't think the white ones shed, oh boy ! However, I bought a kinda brush/comb to use on them and it has been a Godsend. I wear alot of black so their hair usually winds up all over me. I also have to vaccum my fabric couches and chairs. If you bathe it also that will help. If you can't bathe it yourself, the vet will and sometimes that really helps. One of my white kitties is deaf, and she and I have such a special relationship, it's really unbelievable. However, even with having five of them I would never get rid of them, and believe me they can get into more than you can imagine. Just be patient and try some of the above. I got the brush/comb thing from Fosters and Smith. You can buy over the internet or order their catalogs specifically for cats. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|ArtZzDU8aa	Oh I just eat mine, but you could always brush her more.|`|gKMQeSHSaa	You should of thought it through more before you got a cat!!

Wx2Fl0xQaa	I often clean the nest of our beloved cockatiels. Our birds trust me fully and it doesn't bother them at all. Depending on how many babies they are raising it's hard for the parents to keep up. I don't go into the nest when they are in there. With one exception, Tubby, doesn't mind me in her nest when she is in there. Matter fact she will put her head down for me to rub her neck. All of our birds are spoiled. My all means clean the nest. The babies are walking in it and they do learn to clean themselves. That being said it can't be good for them to chew on their droppings, let alone the bacteria that is growing on it can cause problems.|`|ZAljSeERaa	yes yes yes do so asap!!! they could die from the feces and the bad things getting into their tiny lungs! do you know what to clean it with?? best thing is grapefruit seed extract it disinfects and its not going to hurt the baby's also just for the future use paper towels that way you can change them out daily!!! you want it as clean as possible in there! and remember to was your hands with some mild disinfecting soap so you dont harm the birds skin|`|gatbKvmSaa	yes yes yes.

GOOD LUCK and take care of those babies.  Kristie
op3t8OtVaa	If they look like grains of rice as you say then there is a high probability that he has flea tapeworm. You will need to get some decent worming tablets from your vet and perhaps a check up. It should only cost around $10-20 for the worming tablets but the vet appointment may cost more. You will also need to start applying frontline plus (or any other type of flea preventative) so that there is less of a chance that he can get tapeworm again.    There is not a high chance that he can pass the worms onto you as flea tapeworm are not a zoo noses, but if you have children make sure they wash their hands before eating, after playing with the pup, etc, to make the chance of them ingesting an egg less probable, especially if they are playing outside where the dog goes to the bathroom if the faeces hasn't been immediately picked up. I highly doubt that any of you can get infected with the worms if you have decent hygiene.|`|zguucR8yaa	If you were to eat a flea infected with tapeworms, or a small rodent infected with tapeworms, that's how you would get them.  I think a vet is the only place you can get dewormer for this type of worm.|`|ArtZzDU8aa	Go get him de-wormed now! It can only get worse (Dogs can die from a bad worm infestation)! Don't wait until he is showing outward signs of suffering, that's cruel. You need to take him to the vet to get the type of de-worming you need. There is a slim chance you could get the worms as well, the chances are increasing the longer you wait. Go asap, take in a sample of his stool with the worms in it for the vet.|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	Just about every dog on the planet is infested with worms to some degree. If they stay at low levels, your dog can build up immunity to them. But if the infestation reaches a certain point, worms can cause anemia, lethargy and poor appetite which may lead to even worse situations.    Check out this link and learn about worms in dogs.  http://dogtime.com/worms.html|`|70K9rb5Iaa	There are many types of intestinal parasites that puppies can have, and alot of the time they will have more then just one type, thats why its always recommend to go have a fecal test at the vet. Tapeworms, Roundworms, Hookworms and Whipworms. These are the worms that puppies can be born with (if the mother was infected) or get from, fleas, other dogs or cats, communal animal play areas, eating poo that is infected, etc. These can be taken care of by OTC meds usually, unless they just have too many. Tapeworms are the "rice" like segments that you are seeing, the worm itself it quite large, however sheds and thats the part that comes out in the stool. OTC treatment for tapeworms just recently became available, some make sure the one you are using treats tapeworms as well. Also make sure you are repeating the proper dosage every 2-3 wks 3-4 times.  Even though your pet may seem to be feeling fine or gets better after a dose or 2,  you still need to have proper treatment..  the worm population will continue to grow...      However there are other intestinal infections that are common in puppies (vets also refer to these as intestinal parasites, even though they arent actually worms) you can not see these in the stool.  These are, Giardia and Coccidia, which have to be found in fecal exam and have to be treated with prescribed meds.  The biggest prevention of tapeworms is to always have proper flea control. Even one flea bite can infect a dog or cat. One flea bite can also make your pet itch for up to 2 weeks (just like if we get bitten, it itches for a while)  But I'd say go ahead and try the stuff from petsmart.  I hope your pup gets better soon.  Good luck!

They need a lot of attention and care.|`|44kEtDvIaa	If your apartment allows dogs, the problem I can see will be with potential barking.  Unfortunately small dogs will eventually start barking, particularly when left alone for long periods.  It's just they way they are.  And large dogs in an aparmtment environment isn't really a good idea.  Perhaps you should look at something like a ferret who will be caged, sleep a lot, and may very well keep the same hours as you ... and they do make great pets .. and don't bark.  Site below has info, plus links to other ferret sites in you need info.|`|W0buucLsaa	Okay, trying to get this straight... you work a normal 8 hour workday, but at night? It's fine to have a dog - they adjust to your sleep schedule and can easily adapt to a nocturnal lifestyle if they live indoors. Dogs generally like to hang with you while you're awake, and sleep while you sleep.     (However, it is not fine to get a puppy if you work 8 hour days. Puppies can't be alone for more than 4 hours. You need to get an adult.)    The one issue you have to deal with is barking - you don't want a dog that barks at much if you live in an apartment and keep odd hours. Your neighbors will complain.    I don't think that a Jack Russell or a rat terrier is a good idea, however. They're not suitable for apartments and they bark A LOT. Remember that the best dog for you is not necessarily the one you think you like the most, but rather the one that fits your lifestyle the best. It'll make your life a whole lot easier.    I cross-referenced a list of the breeds best suited for apartment life with dogs that bark the least and this is what I came up with:    Basenji  Bullmastiff  Chinook  Chinese Shar-Pei  Coton de Tulear  French Bulldog  Pekingese  Shiba Inu    I think that you would like a basenji or coton de tulear the best based on how similar they are in size and appearance to the dogs you suggested, especially the basenji. Shiba inus are really cool and about 20 pounds.     Good luck!

You really don't want a puppy because house breaking will take time where you cannot leave it along for long periods of time.    You might want to consider going to your local Humane Society and specify you conditions and what you need; a small house broken dog.    A Jack Russel is a very energetic dogs, some might say hyper; and a rat terrier isn't a breed, just a nick name for a Jack Russel.|`|H4UxIqe2aa	you might be better of getting more than one, like two maltese's or jack russells. you would however be much better off with a pet more like a cat or.. fish? birds? pets deserve love, and attention. and they will become lonely and bored - naughty, if left alone for mass amounts of time
6HC0rRTsaa	My deaf kitty has the same problem, and our vet said even if she got one flea one her this could happen, however someone else told me that it could be any kind of allergies. Out of my five cats two of mine do the same thing. They scratch until the meat is raw and bleeding. We have bought everything known to man to put on them and nothing seems to work. I don't know if allergy shots will help or not. As far as her being kinda skiddish, Fosters and Smith offer a calming spray that really does work. You can spray a small amount on their food and it does work.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	My grandfather just took his kitty to the vet yesterday she had pulled out fur on the back and front of her neck.

Check for flea dirt. If there is none. She may either have an ear infection or a skin infection. Either way, she needs to see a vet because both are highly contagious and before you know it all your cats will look like she does now.  Don't worry. It's not going to kill her or anything but you need to have it taken care of asap.  Hope this helps.|`|4590e950a6c42e358a581a8b8d9b845eaa	Ticks, mites, fleas -  those are the most common culprits.

Also make sure to clean the box EVERYDAY)  -food and water bowl (change water everyday)  -high quality cat food (I always get grain free)  -toys (scratching post)  -bed (Unless she/he is going to share yours ^_^)  - LOVE    Initial cost might be a bit high but it's worth it.    EDIT: http://www.petcurean.com/index.php?page_... This is the type of food I buy. You usually cannot find it at walmart or grocery stores, you need to go to a pet store to buy it. One ten pound bag costs me $40. This might seem like a lot for that little bag of food, but since switching I actually spend less on food because my cat does not need to eat as much to get the nutrition he needs. It's like the difference between eating chinese and getting hungry right away and eating a good hearty meal. My cat also poops less and it doesn't smell as bad as with the crap food.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	1. A kill shelter is great. That way you are actually saving a kittens life. :)    2. Litter   Get dry clumping litter    Litter Box  Don't get a mechanical one, because this can frighten cats. Don't get a plastic cheap one because when it gets scratched then the urine's odor is in the scratch marks. Then the cat doesn't want to go to the bathroom in its litter box.    Food  Royal Canin is expensive, but it is very good. Another food you could get is Pedigree cats.     Food Bowls  Ones with wide or rubber bottoms are better so that they don't slide or tip over.    Scratch Pad  Ones with wide bottoms, and are very tall so your kitten can stretch as tall as it's body. Remember your kitten will be a cat someday.    Collar  A collar is fine, you don't need a tag unless you want to be sure. If your cat is outside (you won't need a litter box) then get a tag.    Toys  Feathers, Mice, Strings, Catnip, and Laser pointers.    Treats  Meats, Cat milk, Fish, Fruits, Peanuts (unsalted), and Cereals (no sugar.)    Vets  Get a vet that treats cats, and knows what they are doing. Look up vets in your area. Or if you have a dog you can use their vet for your cat.        3. Well, vets will be about $200 a year probably. If you have any emergencies then the amount will expand.    Litter is about $10.00 - $20.00 a month. I doubt 20. So 12 times 15 is $360. So 360 dollars a year, but I don't think that it will be that much money.    Food is probably going to be $10.00 a month, so $120 a year.    Treats not much money. They don't need treats that often.    Total:    $680 - $700. I really doubt it will be that much. I tried to make my prices higher than they really are so I wasn't extremely low. :)      LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF LOVE! :D ??    I hope I helped! Congratulations on the new kitten! :)|`|feUxjBbnaa	Cats are awesome!  Yes I think it's admirable to rescue from a kill shelter.  You'll need a litter box, dishes(metal or ceramic), canned food, filtered tap water(or bottled or buy a Drinkwell Fountain) , cat toys(mice and balls), cat tree( at least 5 ft. high), comfy cat bed if you want, and $ for it's first vet checkup($100-150).    Food-buy healthy brands like Wellness, EVO, and Natural Balance.  avoid-corn, grain, by-products, fillers, etc. at ALL costs!  Canned food is best!  Dry food is not healthy.  Only exceptions are Wellness Core and EVO.  I still would just use canned though.  Cats are made for eating meat!  You can get Wellness and Natural Balance at Petco.  EVO - look up their website and find a store near you.  Good luck!  *I would highly suggest searching around Y/A for info on healthy cat food.   AVOID brands like Iams, Purina, Friskies, Science Diet, Wiskas, etc.  Remember-your vet does not recieve much training in nutrition. Do your own research with your mom on this subject. :)    *Don't declaw kitty!  Research this also, it's cruel and barbaric.  It's illegal in most countries!  Please don't do it .......!!!!!!    *Oh, I forgot, if you are feeding the right healthy food, your kittens poop will smell WAY less, it will be smaller, and it will eat less food. FYI : )|`|GSkA8wh9aa	I do feel kill shelters are the best way to save an animal. Even tho I am a cat rescuer, my adoptees are safe from harm and are well cared for in my home until they are adopted. If you can't find a kind you like at a kill shelter, the best please to check in on petfinders.com. Just don't buy from a breeder!|`|DQlZIzAFaa	You will need a litter box (plastic tub), litter, a litter scoop, food (food that is high in protein and low in grains is better for cats, dry or wet food doesn't matter), food bowl, water bowl, a scratching post, and some toys (toys need not be expensive: my cat LOVES empty paper towel rolls to play with). For discipline purposes, it's also good to get a water gun (spray kitty with water any time he does a behaviour you want him to stop).     You will also need a lot of time, love, and patience, and a good vet.    EDIT: Don't declaw your kitty, and make sure to buy a collar and tags too. Shelter cats are cheaper (and healthier) than cats you buy that are a specific "breed."|`|HX1O5BLsaa	Congrats!!!! The people at the shelter are very very helpful with any questions you might have. First off when you take it home you should already have it a litter box food water and bed out. Try putting all these items in one quiet room temporarily for when it first gets home and shut it in there some cats are afraid and become disoriented easily give it plenty of time to become comfortable in its surroundings before introducing more family children or other pets slowly as it gets comfortable with the house put its items in a more desirable place.  For food it depends on what age of cat you're getting and what its living situation is. If its long haired get it fur ball contolling food if its an indoor cat get it in door food if its a kitten get a kitten food. Any place that sells cat food will have all these options and more just give it a good look over or go to a petco or a petsmart and they can help. For a litter if its going to be an indoor cat don't go with one that's strongly scented ur cat may not like it they have sensitive noses and don't know that a smell good for your house is a good smell so try for a baking soda kind or if u need to save money buy a clumping litter and add your own baking soda. clean the litter at least once a day to keep the smell down. And if the litter box gets too full of waste the cat may resort to your house. For feeding make sure u know about how old your cat is and how much it weighs so you know how much food to ration it. If it gets overweight it leads to health problems if the cat is already overweight there is food for heavy cats. Importantly to note you should get a good sturdy scratching post to encourage the feline to sctrath it and not your furnature. Its nessesary for cats claws to sheath so they need to scratch its not just a behavior. And as a final note for behavior correction don't ever hit a kitty. I doubt you would but they have veryvery delicate bones. Try a spray bottle or a tap with one finger on the head and a loud clear no. Have fun! Buy some toys!|`|JPabJXFMaa	food, litter box|`|jzLwaOxIaa	you get a bed    1.you get food    2.you get it a bowl.    3. you jump aroud and party|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	It's always best to start with a shelter, no matter what kind it is.  She's gonna need a bowls for both food and water, a litter box and litter and toys.  She's gonna need a collar, ID tags, and vaccinations too. It would also be a good idea to provide her with either a scratching post and a scratching toy ( I have one hanging on my front door) so she doesnt decide your furniture is the perfect place to sharpen her claws when the urge hits LOL Enjoy|`|evVAOzvvaa	I'm glad you are going to a shelter to get your cat!  good for you.    now here are some things you should get:    2 Bowls   -one for food  -one for Water (always keep fresh water out!)    A bed  Cat box and Litter  For cat litter i like the scoop away better.    Get a scratching post or something where you new cat   can "destress" his claws on.    And of course some toys.      As for cost of keeping one cat,  It shouldn't cost you more than 40 bucks a month. this includes litter box, wet and dry food, toys ect...   And if you are getting it from a shelter it should already have vaccinations and be spayed or neutered.      Hope this helps.
AA11457471	If you are taking her to the vet first thing you should withold both the food AND water. I know several answerers have been concerned about dehydration but the truth is putting anything in her belly when she's sick will cause vomiting which will dehydrate her worse than not having water overnight.  Don't give her anything, just let her empty out what's in there.  Sometimes the best thing you can do is nothing at all!  Best wishes!  >^..^|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I wouldn't do the rice. It's not recommended to give a dog that is vomiting more food as that can actually cause more vomiting. It's best to withhold food until she stops vomiting as a dog can do fine without food....it's dehydration you need to be worried about, so no food for 24 hours. I would give her water in the next little bit but only very small amounts at a time. Let her get a few laps then put the water up for a few minutes then give her a bit more if she keeps it down. If you can get some pedialyte, that can help keep the dog hydrated until you can get to the vet in the morning.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	let her oustide to eat some grass. i dont know whats in grass that soothes their tummies but thats what my dogs have done when they had upset tummies. i understand your frustration and you want whats best for your pet. u can try to put some peppermint im her water and let it disolve.|`|SFoMSEpgaa	You can give her cooked rice and water till she goes in if shes hungry. therwise i would love on her alot and keep an eye on her for the night, as long as there is no blood in the vomit|`|zWBYxMvWaa	You can give her some pepto bismol, about 1 teaspoon for every 15ish lbs.       Good Luck!|`|lmSffrNuaa	Just like people, some dogs have a sensitive stomach or will even vomit on an empty stomach. As long as the dog is eating, drinking, acting normally, exhibiting no other signs of illness, and showing no increase in frequency of the vomiting, there is typically no reason to worry.    Consult your vet if your dog's vomiting is chronic, continues for more than a day, or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, decreased appetite, diarrhea, or excessive water intake.    Hope these links helps!    http://xrl.us/bechdd  http://xrl.us/beb5e7|`|4HXAsvLnaa	What did you feed the dog? that may be the problem. What would you do if you were vomiting|`|BYoVsKY4aa	I recommend boiling some rice and chicken breast, since this is a very bland diet and good for upset tummies. Good luck on the vet appt tomorrow, and hopefully it is just an upset stomach!|`|nI8G21y8aa	keep her hydrated with water. make sure that she get PLENTY of water. vomiting dehydrates. make sure that she is not stressed. is she doent like the cat keep kitty away! i think she knows ur helping and thanks ya for it! haha!  be ready for a long night!  good luck    waterwaterwater for ur puppy!!!!!!!|`|jzLwaOxIaa	you take it 2 the vet or you give it some sprite.|`|9b33175b4c16a8acabbbc43774a2f649aa	Give your dog Pepito bizmal make sure the dog get s it all down this will coat the stomach|`|61aac4f5048106f1ce66f7f66b50b228aa	Tip 75 - Pumpkin for cats - pumpkin for dogs - Pumpkin for diarrhea or constipation    If your dog or cat is having the occasional case of constipation or diarrhea, one of the things that might help is canned pumpkin. Yes canned pumpkin in its pureed form (NOT pumpkin pie filling) is a fantastic stool softener which makes it a good natural remedy for constipation. It often helps with upset stomach or indigestion for both cats and dogs. It is very rich in fibre and adding just one or two teaspoonfuls to your pet's food often gets the system moving in no time. Dogs will occasionally want to eat it directly and that's fine too. Sometimes though, finicky cats and dogs won't touch it no matter what you do.    On the opposite end of things is diarrhea. Since the dietary fibre in canned pumpkin absorbs water, it can be a great help to a cat or dog that has diarrhea. Some pet owners report that it firms up their pet's loose stools or diarrhea within a few hours. Again one to two teaspoonfuls is all that is needed.    N.B. It should be noted that both diarrhea and constipation can both be very serious and require immediate veterinary care depending on the cause. Whatever the cause, diarrhea or constipation lasting more than 24-36 hours requires vet care. Click the following links for more general information on

6W4ZWOetaa	A lot of good answers have been posted already... the rat probably has what we call in the rat world "Myco" it's a bacterial infection that honestly occurs in probably 90% of pet rats... some get more affected than others.       I think you're very smart to be using the bedding that's not pine or cedar.  I usually recommend aspen or carefresh; or even bedding called "yesterday's news" that's made from old newspapers and phone books.    The stuff around her nose is called "Porphyrin" and it's a stress reaction.  Rats who are ill or stressed will get it around their nose or eyes.      I agree, yes take her to the vet.  You'll probably get an antibiotic called Baytril... it actually really helps!  I've had to give several rats this stuff over the years.  But yes, take her!! Rats can die from severe myco infections.    Another thing that might help is to go into the bathroom with her and shut the door and turn the shower on so it gets steamy in there... kind of like a humidifier.  That will help her feel a little better.  That was a trick recommended to me by some rat breeder friends... dunno if it works for sure, but when my rats are sick I try to do whatever I can for them.      Good luck!  I hope your dear little rattie gets better!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Rats will sneeze as a reaction to the stress, included the stress of being moved or change of diet. Rats will also sneeze because of dust, cold, illness and allergies. Perfumes, air fresheners and cigarette smoke can also cause your pet to sneeze and become congested. If the bedding hasn't been changed in months, then maybe it's that.  If the breathing sounds okay, doesn't seem like a problem as long as all other signs, activities, eating etc are the same.  If it last too long after changing bedding, see a vet.  Also check site below for symptoms plus links to other rat sites with health articles to compare symptoms.|`|eS8wuYRfaa	Yes, you NEED to call a vet.  The same thing happened with my daughter's rat and I have to have her put down tomorrow.  We had her on antibiotics, but she is 2 and just not strong enough to fight it. :(     If you leave it, it will only get worse.  All rats have a respiratory infection in their systems, but it doesn't usually present symptoms until it needs treatment.   Good Luck!|`|Oxaaqm1maa	my rats do that all the time   its pretty common and there is no need to take them to the vet  some times some blood can show but in fact it isnt even blood..  if you want more info go to this site  http://maritimerattery.canadianwebs.com/...|`|a7vxbnBZaa	yyyy|`|ZCBotgcIaa	Try changing the floor coverings. If it's shavings, your rat can be breathing it in, and it can cause respiratory systems and make the rat unable to breathe correctly. Try using newspaper. It's easy to clean, and it's nontoxic if they chew on it.
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	I think your vet shouldn't have spayed her in the middle of a heat cycle. Most reputable vets will tell you to wait until the heat is completely over.    Most veterinarians prefer not to spay a dog in estrus because the uterine tissue can be swollen, fragile, and more prone to damage. Dogs also have a tendency to bleed more when they're in heat. Because of this, estrus makes surgery more risky for dogs, as well as for cats.    I'd go to a different vet in all honesty. Like someone else mentioned, spaying is a hysterectomy... she can't get pregnant after she is spayed. the sexual organs have been removed.    As for the thumbs downs... Do you guys work in veterinary medicine? As a former emergency technician, the ONLY reason we'd spay a dog in the middle of a heat cycle is in the case of an emergency... for the reasons stated above.    anyone who claims they work in vet care that disagrees needs to go back and do some research.    **Edit to add details...**    I never encountered an actual ectopic pregnancy personally so it's not my area of experties... but when a dog is spayed, the overies and uterus are removed... so an etopic pregnancy is impossible.    An etopic pregnancy basically means a fertalized egg has implanted outside of the uterus, this is a VERY RARE, but dangerous occurance that can happen to animals and human women. The fetus grows outside of the uterus.    however, again, in a spaying... The ovaries, oviducts, uterine horns, and the uterus are removed    if the uterus and overies are gone, there is no where for the egg to come from, and there is no uterus to implant itself outside of.    I'd personally, again, get a new vet to discuss this situation. I don't think I'd be comfortable with this particular vet if it were me. go to the E.R. if possible.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I believe they meant she is still in heat & any male trying  to mate her with her would be painful & cause infection.   Being spayed involves removing the uterus & no way she could become pregnant.  Call vet about the bleeding asap.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	The blood is just leftover blood from her vaginal canal.If it continues,call your vet,as she could be bleeding inside from the surgery,but there is NO way that the dog can get pregnant with no uterus! The entire uterus and ovaries are removed during a spay.Your vet is nuts!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I don't see how on earth she could get pregnant with no uterus!  Your vet doesn't sound very competent - please get a second opinion.|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	This dog needs an emergency vet. The dog should NOT be bleeding. The spay removes the uterus AND the ovaries. There is NO chance that an ectopic pregnancy could take place because the fallopian tubes are GONE.   Find an emergency vet that is NOT associated with the vet that did the spay and get the dog examined. Nothing you are saying about the procedure is correct. I am very skeptical about the things you say the vet told you.|`|91CX5jHaaa	Just to reiterate what you have been told, this is a vet emergency.  Your dog should NOT be bleeding anywhere at this time.  Your dog cannot get pregnant, but if a male tried to breed her this close after surgery, the resultant damage internally could kill her, which is probably what the vet was trying to convey.  If spayed during heat, the pheromones that attract males to breed her would still be there, so you have to be extra cautious around said males, even neutered ones.|`|RBGtYwCmaa	have you called the vet that did it?|`|BYoVsKY4aa	If your veterinarian is telling you that your dog can get pregnant after being fixed, I would find a new vet! A spay on a female dog is a hysterectomy, where the ovaries and uterine horns are removed, therefore no chance of getting pregnant. Spaying a dog while in heat gives an increased chance of bleeding while the spay is going on, however she should not be bleeding afterwards. Get her to a NEW vet immediately!|`|pyqgEbmsaa	Your dog cannot get pregnant..     You should call your vet.. And get more information .. or call another vet who maybe knows more.. a spayed female cannot get pregnant. She should not be bleeding. They removed the uterus, ... The reason they don't like to spay them when they are in heat is because they bleed more and they are swollen.|`|bmzMFHGraa	i had something similar happen to my chihuahua mix. She just started to bleed randomly. we took her to the vet and found nothing wrong with her. within a couple of days it just went away, it was strange. maybe thats what your dog is going through. hope she gets better|`|qBHi2b0faa	My dog had an irregular heat cycle too. when I went to get her spayed hoping it would solve the issue, I was hard up to find ANY vet that would do it during the heat cycle. The vet explained to me that because tissues are swollen, they're more prone to damage, plus there is a greater chance for blood loss. I had 3 vets tell me the same thing. So I waited till after her heat was over, and they spayed her. They like to wait a month, but they waited 2 weeks just in case she started going into heat again since it was irregular. They told me they would only spay during a heat if she was in distress or if there was a serious issue that could cause her health harm. So I'd be totally scared of your vet... for not only waiting till she was at least done with the heat she was in and THEN doing it... and for telling you a dog who has absolutely NO sexual organs can still get pregnant. Even an Ectopic pregnancy. for an ectopic pregnancy you still need a uteres and eggs. but there are no eggs, uteres or anything else that can cause a pregnancy.

8NSh1D4Maa	It's not so much the breed as the individual horse.  I would actually not recommend the Arabian breed for a novice in general, though there will be individual horses within the breed that would be suitable.  They tend to be spirited and headstrong.  Look for a horse suitable for the discipline you are interested in that is well-trained, 'bomb proof' and in their teens or older for a novice.  Make sure you have a vet of your choosing thoroughly check the horse you're interested in before the purchase, and if you are very much a novice, I would also recommend having a knowledgeable horse person ride the horse as well and give you their opinion.|`|ArtZzDU8aa	Try a Fjord, they are nice and calm and very cute.|`|7LtbetTFaa	You can't go wrong with a Morgan.|`|mv7h2Wjbaa	typically arab mares have the best disposition, also connemaras are great ponys and quarter horses have really nice temperments.|`|gWdKNkouaa	An Arabian or Quarter horse.

Vaultige (vaulting) around a 15.2 hand Warmblood or Draft with a good personality, even gate and broad back. Since you are new, get a horse who is laid back, easy to mount and handle in the saddle and on the ground who is dead broke.

I have euthanized a cat (and a dog too) and it is not the most pleasant experience BUT you know that you are saving your beloved pet some suffering and that makes you feel better.     I am really sorry about your kitty but please consider what I have said.|`|87Zhgwmcaa	Please, give her peace, and let her go. Keeping her in such conditions isn't fair to her. God bless her soul. Let her go. Don't allow any more suffering to that poor thing.|`|jzLwaOxIaa	let it die its time has come|`|GSkA8wh9aa	Did the vet say what is wrong with your cat?  Sounds like poisoning.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Sounds like she got into something poisonous. The vet shouldve been able to tell you when you were there.|`|oXG1GOPcaa	if the vet was wrong or right [i am a stray and lost cat keeper]right good ,wrong boohoo|`|t1OIcAG3aa	what the hell????????????  TAKE HER TO A VET RIGHT AWAY ARE YOU INSANE??????????  if you dont, its just as bad as if you killed her yourself|`|AA11193773	sorry. Just remember that your cat is right now in cat heaven with all the other cats enjoying tuna and has plenty of new friends and toys to play with.|`|4590e950a6c42e358a581a8b8d9b845eaa	I can't imagine a vet who would have said that after examining your cat and then send you home. I would definitely go to another vet. If your cat is in pain and struggling for breath and nothing can be done, the vet should euthanize her. I know it's hard, but it must be even harder to watch your cat going through what she is now. Find out from a different vet, please.
Oxaaqm1maa	here is a way -  put your puppy in the chicken pen and leave him for 10 seconds, when that is over say ah-ah, NO and send him out,pet him and say good boy, repeat this and he should learn not to be in there  or you could try this-  if you see your puppy in the pen then say NO and quickly get him out and tie him up for no longer then 5 minutes  in time if you do this he should think every time he is in the pen he gets tied up  or if they dont work try this-  sucure the chicken pen or secure the area where they roam so he cant get to them and if its unfixable then place a small sprinkler in the road and have it go off when he approaches  if this  didnt help sorry but i hope it did!! good luck!!|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	My best bet is socialization. Your dogs may not be used with the chickens being around so they find them 'different' being around.     Hope this link can give you at least an idea on how to go about socializing your dog with dogs alike and other pets in the house. goodluck!  http://dogtime.com/socialization.html|`|BYoVsKY4aa	You need to take your dog out (on a leash) and teach him that being near the chickens is a bad thing, and there are much more interesting things to chase, such as a ball or a furry toy.  Consult a trainer with these kinds of problems. Your puppy is different than any other dog, so an experienced trainer can not offer quality advice online because of that very fact!
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You shouldn't be giving her milk in the first place.  No bread - just be sure to let her out.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Give her some normal dog food and some pepto bismol.    About a teaspoon per 15ish pounds|`|XM0xiZhXaa	cats and dogs are lactose intolerant.. no more milk.. n definitely don't give it bread . animals don't eat bread..  just like humans don't eat pet food|`|Uy7XEqcpaa	arent dogs lactose in tolerant?|`|tOLrUh0Caa	If it was full cream and your dog is not use to it I would give her something to make them solid otherwise there could be a mess. However if your dog is older and has had milk before I would not be too concerned. Also milk is high in calcium and dogs can have it in small amounts. She will be fine health wise.:)|`|pyqgEbmsaa	Bread isn't going to stop the diarrhea.. It will probably add to the problem. Just be prepared to get up and let her out when she starts to get an upset stomach.
qp7ssYJcaa	GET THEM TO A VET IMMEDIATELY. THEY ARE PROBABLY EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED AND/OR IN PAIN!!!  The who died probably died from fright because of a predator and the other probably hurt its back/legs.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Your rabbit needs a vet.    Screaming is a sign of intense fear/pain.  It could be that there was a predator around and the the rabbit hurt him/herself in an attempt to 'escape' it (would also explain the dead rabbit).  That means that the rabbit has a spinal/leg injury that *cannot* be treated at home.  Only a professional can help (by either treating the injury or providing euthanasia).    Hope this helps.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the temp is perfect for rabbits, so perhaps they ingested something.|`|6QIpltVyaa	are you sure the rabbit is screaming? or making a huff type of noise? It may have been the amount of heat or not enough shading. the bunny maybe going through gestational period where they do not eat or drink and they dont hop...he maybe sick you need to see a vet right away... did the rabbit eat or drink before u took it outside? did it have any bowel movments? if not he may have not been eating right for the past few days...|`|oXG1GOPcaa	if your rabbit is doing that it means it probably means it will not live.|`|2dcf8b2c66d21ecc1cfc248cf6ee5962aa	Rabbits can become hyperthermic very easily, and your rabbits may be suffering from heat stroke which could potentially lead to tissue death of the heart.    I would suggest taking your other rabbits to a vet asap, building a large enough shaded area with plenty of water and a cool mat, and keeping your rabbits indoor on very hot days

BYoVsKY4aa	Wash all the pets and treat the carpets with borax, leave down for a few hours and vaccuum up. Repeat this a few days later to kill the eggs that have hatched. The puppies can be spongebathed with warm water, but NO SOAP! I have used baby shampoo for really dirty puppies (crawl in poo/pee). Wash all bedding, and apply flea medication to all pets except mom and the puppies.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	It's going to take some work on your part.  Please talk to your vet especially with very young pups in the house.  Fleas can cause tapeworms.  DO NOT use OTC flea treatments as they have been known to kill dogs.|`|AA11436385	go to the vet  and get the drops that you put on their back, it's safe for puppies, then after you apply to the dogs and cat, after a couple days, wash all your bed linens in very hot water, and vacuum sofas, chairs, floors, rugs very good, and dispose of the vacuum cleaner bag in a plastic bag, tie it up and take it out to the trash immediately! you may want to be sure to have another dose of the drops on hands to reapply in a couple months.|`|5rvjjaVlaa	Put garlic in their food,it helps but it does take some time|`|lmSffrNuaa	You may want to check this link for more information on how to get rid of fleas.    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s1f.html|`|H4UxIqe2aa	easily controlled with a wide variety of flea treatments found at your local pet store or recommended by your vet.
0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	she will remember you just fine and she will be so excited to see you when you come back. dogs are very forgiving to their owners. She is lucky you care enough to put her in good professional doggy day care.  when you come back from your trip, you know you have someone to come home for. she will be fine, I am thinking you are more scared than her....it's ok :)|`|44kEtDvIaa	Had the same problem when we had to leave ours.  Felt guilty, but made sure they went to a good boarder and were going to get the care we expected them to get.  Thought of them while we were away, but you bet they were excited when we got back home.  Nope, didn't forget us one bit and had the biggest kisses ever!|`|N19mmDELaa	she wont forget you! she'll be anxious for u to come back. and when u do get back she'll be very excited to see you and go home. just make sure she is up to date on all her shots. you don't want her getting kennel cough. good luck and have a safe trip!!|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	You sound like a very caring owner, so I know you checked out the facility, so as long as it is a good place then yes, she will be fine.  She will not have any concept of time actually, so you being gone a week will not be much different than leaving her for a day or two.  And when we leave, all they know is we went out the door, we are still there behind the door as far as they know.  I do understand how you feel however, I did not go on a weekend trip because my Pugs back started bothering him again and I had to take him to get some pain meds, and I refused to leave him for the weekend, my neighbor comes over and cares for him, but I couldnt do it.  But we go every year away for a week and he is perfectly fine and very very happy to see us when we get back.  She will remember you :)|`|t2M1kXY4aa	She'll be fine ... and of COURSE she'll remember you!    As long as you're taking her to a kennel where she'll get good care (not just a bowl of food thrown at her and a potty break), AND it's a place she's been before and is at least a little familiar with, she should be OK.    Lots of boarding facilities these days pamper their "clients" ... playtime, treats, all kinds of special treatment.      She'll miss you, sure ... and she will be THRILLED to see you when you get back.  But don't obsess over it.  Most dogs do just fine (it's the owners who suffer)!|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I've worked at multiple kennels and all owners are just like you when they drop their dogs off! I have experienced some dogs that wouldn't eat their first couple of days, but for the most part, your dog will do just fine. The ones I have work at had playtime for all of the dogs (the non-aggressive) to interact with one another and generally by the end of the day they are completely warn out.  I have had owners call to check up so I'm sure you could always do that while you are gone. And of course she will remember you and will be so excited to see you!|`|5bWYjqO9aa	if the dog really likes you now then most likely wen you get bak to pick her up shell be very excited to see you!!  :)|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	Take her there a few times before you leave so she can check it out and get familiar with it, that way, when you drop her off it'll feel a little less like you're abandoning her. She will be stressed for a little while but she will be fine, and no, she won't forget you. When you come in to pick her up all she'll care about is her best friend is back!!|`|H4UxIqe2aa	omg i had the same problem when i went away for nearly a month. until our neighbour told me that him and his wife went around the world for nearly a year, and his dog, Brock, hadn't forgotten his voice, or smell. one of the reason's dog's are so highly liked is because of their ability to bond with their owner. they are, although it sometimes does not seem liek it, highly intelligent, well intelligent enough to remember someone that important to them. a week will be fine :) take photo's and make sure you say goodbye :) you wouldn't forget your bestfriend would you? neither will you dog :)|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	I think that your dog will be just fine and he will remember you especially if the trip will just really be for a week. Take note, though of separation anxiety that your dog might develop.    Separation anxiety has little to do with training or discipline; the behaviors are a result of the severe panic your dog feels when you're not there. Left untreated, it causes damage to your house and belongings--and serious psychological suffering for your dog.     Check out this link for some early information about it.  http://dogtime.com/separation-anxiety.ht...|`|BYoVsKY4aa	Yes, she will remember you! Make sure it is a high-quality boarding facility that has enough staff to make sure your dog gets enough attention. Some facilities offer additional playtimes and treats, at additional costs. If she is a small dog, request her being put near other small dogs. The same with a medium, or a large sized dog. Most dogs will stress for the first few days, however if the staff is knowledgable and experienced enough, they will be able to soothe her.|`|3Cw2JT0yaa	i think she will dogs strangely seems to me is the only domestic animal that loves humans so much they will 'fight' for their owners.it does not matter who u are a bum or a rich man.dogs imprints their masters,and love them so very very much for them its like heaven.your dog will never forget u.when u return home and fetch her she will be so happy to see u like u wouldn't believe,i have seen this and experienced it myself and she will never be angry at you its like they understand your position.she will Always love u.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	She will certainly remember you when you come pick her up!  My dogs stay at a 'doggy daycare' when I am out of town, and they have a great time, though they are also pretty happy to see me when I pick them up as well.  It's nice for me to see that they are excited to see the kennel owner and go back to the play area each time I drop them off.  Whether your dog has a good experience or not will depend on how well-socialized your dog is with other dogs and people in that environment.  If your dog is the sort that doesn't particularly enjoy a lot of other dogs, is stressed by barking dogs, and doesn't like to be away from you at all, your dog may well be upset and scared during her stay.  If that is the case, I would recommend looking at a pet sitter who will come to your home, or a kennel situation where she would not be interacting with a lot of other dogs instead of a 'doggy daycare'.  I would also advise that you tour the facility first, ask lots of questions, and schedule a day visit for her to see how she does.  If she's quite happy there for a day, she'll be fine for a week.  Ask as well if you can bring things from home for her, such as her own dog bed, chews, toys, etc. that are familiar.  Also wear a T-shirt to bed every night for a week and bring the (unwashed) shirt with for her to sleep with- your smell will be familiar.|`|xVgYZpQkaa	Of course she will,as long as u have been treating your dog like human baby.
feUxjBbnaa	THROW IT OUT!  : )|`|gKMQeSHSaa	Throw the can away, and buy some new cat food! Good grief!|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Toss it,Or look in side THEN toss it.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	It does, but generally any unopened, undented canned good (human food or otherwise) will last at least two or three years (even longer, depending on the food) after you buy it. Example: I bought a flat of canned food today for my kitty and the expiration dates are all October 2011.     That said, if you're unsure and don't want vomit or litterbox accidents, throw it out.|`|3fe98c748faa886e7189e6b29877cc3eaa	Yes it expire... I don't think its a good Idea to fed your kitties with it. According to the low there must be a date of expiration on all products!  Maybe it has been erased or something like that. Take care...|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Well, as long as the can isn't dented or otherwise damaged and it doesnt smell rotten, it should be fine However, my family has a saying that we all stick to religiously. When it doubt, throw it out LOL|`|6HC0rRTsaa	Yes canned cat food does expire. There should be an expiration date on it somewhere, if not toss it out.
8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	Of course Groomer are always the ones to blame for issues that may arise out of a very torturous session. It's not the animal's fault but he'll struggle and often gets defensive aggressive and he behaves badly because it's painful. Such cat is often a groomer's nightmare and often even a very patient groomer is challenged and it's unfair to blame the Groomer for nicks here and there. To apologise we ask kitty to ask his/her owner mummy: "How would you like to have your hair pulled for an hour?" There is a popular poster in Grooming Shops and it goes like this: A Groomer is a Pet Beautician - Not a Magician.|`|v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,     No, groomers should always take extra care and precaution when grooming any animal. They are smart enough to know when an animal is fearful, nervous, scared, going to move a lot and or try to get away.    Smart groomers and one who care usually will give a small sedative to help with the grooming.     I would not take my cat back there if I were you, at least to be groomed. There are better ways to handle tough matted fur. I have cats, and I have had some that have gotten really bad mats, like the kind to wear they are so close to the cats skin that they look impossible to get out, and I've taken them in to my groomer, and NOT ONCE did my cats come home with nicks of any kind.     It also sounds like you paid a lot. I would ask for my money back and tell them you are not happy with their service. I would tell them exactly how you feel, and no it's not your cats fault to why he/she has nicks, it's theirs due to lack of care and lack of professional grooming services.     That irritates me what happened with your kitty and I am sorry. Don't go back, but don't just not say anything because if it happened to your kitty it will happen to another.     What happened to your kitty is absolutely a sign of carelessness and lack of services!|`|KLMo9jbzaa	I don't think so if a pet is hard to groom then it should be a 2 person job, You should complaint to the groomer.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	No. Thats a rookie mistake. Groomers that are worth their salt should know better.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	If she was badly matted the skin might have been pulled up into the mats and got cut.  Still I would say if you paid for a professional grooming job maybe you should ask for your money back.    $200 +25  I think you got scammed.  Maybe report them to the better business bureau if they have that where you live.|`|4590e950a6c42e358a581a8b8d9b845eaa	I once had a long haired cat, and we had to have him groomed all the time or he would get mats that I just couldn't get out. My groomer used a sedative on my cat so he slept. I don't remember what we paid, but for what you paid, you should be able to have your cat sleeping.  Also, this cat ended up being shaved several times. Only once did the groomer nick him and when we picked him up, the groomer was right there to apologize.  I don't think there is any excuse for what happened to your cat.|`|T3lEhfdSaa	no, they should have been more gentle with her for sure. i mean thats like bringing a child to the barber, getting his hair trimmed and seeing scabs on his scalp and ears. lol not too good. if she was squirming then they should have calmed her down and tried again, not forced her.
qOiv8d3Laa	Sometimes you can, but many times newborns and those still needing their mothers are "fostered" by people until they are old enough to be adopted.  Call your local shelter and ask, but I am sure that they will NOT allow you to adopt any newborns until they are weaned from their mothers (or the bottle, if they is no mother around).      Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Yes - shelters often have newborn kittens but they're with their MOTHER or being hand fed by volunteers.  Kittens need to stay with their mothers or at least be on substitute mother's milk until they're at LEAST eight weeks old - ten even better.    Why on earth would you want a newborn kitten?  Please EDUCATE yourself before getting ANY pet.  A bit disturbing you'd ask this question.|`|FC5BxnoPaa	It's possible a shelter would have them, but they wouldn't be up for adoption until they were older.|`|qp7ssYJcaa	Depends on the shelter. Check their website. Usually you can.|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	Yes, and some shelters will allow you to become a foster parent if they're orphan kittens- if you fit the right criteria. However, of course, most newborn kittens have a mum, and may be at the shelter- but won't be able to be adopted until they're at least twelve weeks, though some shelters may allow people to reserve them.|`|qm4Mbhwwaa	yes but it wont be newborn it will be six weeks old and up but also consider adopting a cat they need a home to and the tend to be easier to take care of and expect to pay ten dollars and up and youll have to sign a contract good luck|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	You can if you time it right. The only thing is most shelters won't release them for adoption until theyve been weaned at 8 weeks so obviously they wouldnt be new born anymore LOL Call around and see what you can find out.|`|4NhPaIkTaa	yes but they may not always have kittens most shelters let you adopt at 12 wks.  I would call and ask if they have any at your local shelter if not wait a few weeks and call again.  they dont always have kittens available.
ozMywuTaaa	Just a tip for any one who has a dog or a cat, look at the ingredients! You don't want any corn, wheat, soy, or by-products of any kind. Name brand has nothing to do with it. Science Diet has a lot of junk in it. Pedigree is god awful and so is Iams. There are no animals that can digest corn. Not even birds do. I'm pretty sure Royal Canin still has corn in it. AvoDerm is a real decent food and so is Canidae.   As for the best food you can get, go with the raw diet. There are many different companies for it now. Or you can do it yourself . Raw chicken breast with out the bones and boiled brown rice and a few different kinds of veggies and you have dog food.|`|yWXKa9mXaa	Dog food with the 1st ingredient being some sort of meat is considered great quality. This is because the more popular, cheaper grocery brands (Pedigree, Beniful..) have the 1st ingredient as a filler like corn or corn meal. These things are harder for your dog to digest and aren't particularly helpful. Where you buy high quality foods depends on what you have available. You can find them at regular pet stores (just make sure you look at the 1st ingredients on the label) or if you have feed stores they usually offer several organic foods that are also very good (and pricey).|`|1XLZdOcQaa	the brand of dogfood that you give your dog for as long as it meets the dietary requirement of your puppy. pups diet is 4-6 times higher than of an adult dog.    you can visit these links and find out some helpful tips on puppy nutrition. goodluck!  http://elfurl.com/mxeje  http://elfurl.com/gus0m|`|MURxMnLtaa	I've personally fed:    Canine Caviar (currently feed this)  Innova EVO  Wellness  Solid Gold    I really like the Canine Caviar lamb or chicken.  My Mastiff has eaten this or raw all her life and she is almost 11(and still going strong), and has outlived all of her litter mates.    P.S. I have to say it, but Science Diet used to be a good food but now it's CRAP!!! pure crap, it's full of fillers and all manner of nasty stuff.  Get a good holistic dog food that the vets don't sell and get a profit from.|`|5x2DTMKYaa	I get my food from a local independent pet food supply store.    Wellness Core  Innova EVO|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	Science Diet.  Available through most veterinarians, but pricey.  Also carry it at Petsmart.  However, I think Royal Canin is above par and good enough.  As long as your not feeding them Ol' Roy or something.    On a side note, my vet advised me, that if your dog has large stool, then that means his probably not digesting and absorbing all the nutrients in his food.  You may then want to change his brand.  The smaller the stool the better the food in other words.|`|f11db1dc0d60bed9e40620ccd7d8bc0eaa	Royal Canin isn't the greatest food.  It's full of unhealthy fillers.  Better foods are:  Merrick Puppy Plate, Innova Puppy Food, Solid Gold's Hundchen Flocken Puppy, and Chicken Soup  For the Puppy Lover's Soul.       For information about where to buy these foods nearest you, google the products and use the store locator on the websites.|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Royal Canin.    Not only is it FANTASTIC for your pets, but they also love the taste.

9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Yes, love. Animals in general even domestic ones have a strong sense of survival. They know what they have to do to get themselves through nasty situations. Try not to worry. Just have some fliers made up and staple em to trees and hang em up in stores or wherever you think they'd be best seen.  Remember to put your phone number on there.  I think you need to know that cats are especially good for following their owners clear across country when need be to get back home. Dogs will do it too.  You could also try calling her you know. She may or may not know her name but she certainly knows her human's voice :-)Try not to worry.|`|ecHi6sxFaa	yes they find shelter so she'd be ok as long as it can find food cats are very smart we've brought in a stray she was healthy and warm.|`|kILkOc6saa	Cats are pretty interesting creatures. Chances are it found some sort of dry shelter, and as long as it's shielded from the weather it should be okay. They are agile, smart, quick little creatures. I'm sure it survived. As for it coming back, I'd say the chances are good, but not 100%. Good luck :)|`|FC5BxnoPaa	Yes, they know how to find shelter.  My cat goes outside as he pleases and I'm sure he's been caught in storms, he's always eventually come home.  Unless something else happened to the cat it is probably ok.|`|r9wrDGm2aa	She will probably seek a warm dry place until the weather is better.   Try to alert the neighbors so they call you instead of the people from animal control if they spot her. If spotted go there and call her. She will respond to your voice if she was not a new kitty when she escaped. Your voice will be a comfort to her. If she is still reluctant to come to you then try some tuna outside or food, etc.      Usually a cat will stay out not more than 24 hours. Hunger alone will bring it home. but, add cold and snow and there will be a problem, Snow and rain will wash away a scent trial that the cat need to get back home. If cats get wet they will die of hypothermia just as we would. Their fur, when wet, has not insulation value. One reason why they do not like to be wet. Put out as much information as possible to alert the neighborhood and ask for every set of eyes you can. if its been more than 4 or 5 days the chances are slim...|`|8KbcQGL0aa	Yes, cats are survivors. That's where the idea came from that they have nine lives. I'm sure she will return soon. If she is gone for any more than a week then you might worry. I had a beautiful black tomcat when I was a child. He even slept with me. He was missing for five days and I got really worried. He did come back though and looked just as healthy as when he left. Some people moved into the neighborhood a few days before and I found out they had two female cats.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Cat are survivors, it is likely that the cat found shelter or a family pick him up.  My neighbor's cat took off for days before she came back home.  Sometimes they are in heat, so it will be a while before it gets back.|`|ib6BKyCuaa	ur cat will probably be fine. My cat gets out a lot adn we haev a ton of snow here. Just wait a day, the cat will prob come back soon|`|RAtgv9GHaa	50/50,only time will tell,good luck finding kitty!|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Cats are smart and will find shelter, most likely someone found her and is in doors being taken care of I would just be patient and wait she'll go back home soon.
Y8ssQvCKaa	Not a good idea- studies have shown that rats can actually catch the human cold, and that's not great- unlike with the human cold, rats normally need to go to the vet and take medication in order to be cured, due to their delicate respiratory system.|`|qp7ssYJcaa	Only if you really have to pick them up. Try not to touch them until you get better.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Take some care as rats could catch your virus.
4NhPaIkTaa	Yes i would suggest getting your cat a playmate,  Itll keep him entertained and he wont bother you so much when your doing homework.  Its easier to do it now when hes young than later when you have to separate them until they get used to eachother and hope they dont fight.    Definitely do it soon, and preferably another kitten (makes the transition easier)|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Yes, they will play, but they will still want your attention.  A baby is a baby.:>)   (a little hint about kitties...buy whatever cheap litter you want to be buying for his lifetime, they don't really like change when they get older)|`|RAtgv9GHaa	IDK,ask your husband.  other than that ?your kitty!!  xxxx ???????? ~~labsrule24~~|`|QxMsReIHaa	If you live in a quite a big apartment, and your cat needs a lot of play time, then you should consider on getting another cat, try this website if you want to know witch cat is most compatible with your kitten:-  http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...  Good LUCK!
4Sf8hgy3aa	Benedryl or similar itch cream will work fine, but I would vigorously wash the clothes you were wearing, and if they sat in your laundry bin for any longer than a few hours, I would consider washing the whole bin, bombing your room or even your whole house if you notice new bites.|`|eDySIDPQaa	You need to get some Benadryl cream, put on your finger tip and it so works fast...get the extra strength....    It will stop the itch so long.....and keeps it from getting red from you scratching it so much...dont scratch, use the Benadryl cream, or you can get the Benadryl stick, and just tap the bites and it stays on longer, and will really help you    so sorry, your itching so bad...have you told the kids parents, and let them know, apparently the bed is infested with the fleas, so they can get rid of the mattress...and so their kid wont get sick from all the flea bites    and untill they take care of the problem, i would not babysit there any longer...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Fleas don't bite me(guess I don't taste good) but I usually soak in a bath with Epsom salts from mosquitoes bites.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	I feel for you. I had bites awhile ago from fleas that had been sprayed with insecticide. I used Caladryl lotion|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Hydrocortisone. You can get wherever you get neosporin. :] It does wonders on the itchy skin.    Add: Also, you may want to watch it in case you were allergic to some sort of debris in their house. It could be an allergic breakout, as the two look very similar. The suggestion with the epsom salt bath was great!|`|N19mmDELaa	don't itch them, it'll only inflame the bite and the skin around them. any type of anti-itch cream should help. id also wash the clothes you were wearing just in case you brought any home to your place.
ArtZzDU8aa	My advice is not not get a cat if you can barely afford to buy the cat itself and are not sure how you will feed it!    "How do I save up,I have 2.78 cents!!"  You need to be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars on a pet.
a2cjwMKcaa	Ummm.. you have all those fish in a 1.5 gal tank???    I actually doubt it's ick that killed them, most likely just poor water quality from the tank being WAY too small and uncycled.    Ian|`|DT71taKcaa	Yeah they can get ich...I guess you just have to look really close to see any specs...    I hope he gets better..
IMPvzBk1aa	I've been riding for long enough to have seen many of these changes happening. More and more concerns for ground water quality has led to many laws changing regarding manure disposal and animal burial.  No till farming has eliminated manure being used as fertilizer, so nobody wants it anymore.  Our open lands bought by the forest preserve district have stopped allowing horses on any of the land not designated as riding trails, and those are far and few between.  And future trails will all be shared with dog walkers and bicyclers, with the horses on a path set to the side of the bike path.  I know of nowhere near water that any horses are allowed around here.......and they are not allowed in any recreational areas designated for people to use.  I don't know where you are, or how things work.  But here, you'd be wasting your time to try to change it.  I've been involved with large groups trying to get more riding trails put into our forest preserves, and it is truly not the priority in any community.  We horse people don't represent a large enough portion of the population to convince government bodies to let our interests prevail over the interests and rights of the majority.  and nobody wants to go to a beach that is littered with horse manure, or even dog poop, for that matter.  Horses also erode the ground surface with their hooves, and nobody wants that either.   Someone has to pay to rectify that erosion, and clean up after the horses, and most government budgets just don't allow for that.  I'm afraid you may have to think of your beach as a fond memory and just accept this as the inevitable.  At least you got to enjoy it before the laws were enforced.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I REALLY sympathize with you!  I grew up in Half Moon Bay, CA and we had that issue happen back in the late 1960's when MOST of the beaches from Dunes Beach south to Francis Beach all of a sudden became "State" beaches and henceforth no longer allowed horses.     Sadly there are fewer horse owners than the general population and unless you can swing a majority of voters in your favor you aren't going to change the law.    I did manage to get my old mare out onto the beach though, I gave her to the superintendent of beaches daughter!  HeHeHeHe  I remember 12 yr old Vicki Wiley chasing some idiot who decided that "her" beach was suited for nude sunbathing back up the path to the parking lot and watched him scramble around the bushes as this little bitty gal and this huge old mare went huntin' him!  ROFLOL   I was off sittin' on a cliff on my AQHA mare watchin' the whole thing go down laughing so hard that I thought my sides would split.|`|1oOGAY8caa	Nothing like that has ever happened to me, but if you can get enough people to fight the law- go for it!
CyIxcsz0aa	Society finches LOVE... you guessed it... society... company. Most parent take good care of the young. Is it done formula feeding (make sure the mom is getting a good egg-fortified diet by the way!!!    If they cared for the child it should grow up to be quite content with the parents.    MAKE SURE IT IS GETTING FED! If not, make sure some one who has been TAUGHT how to breed birds is caring for it. Formula feeding it without experience can kill it.     But if the baby is old enough, it should get along fine. Society finches normally have no issues!

VKLyDiQ7aa	I honestly think your rat will be fine as long as she gives birth soon.  Her actions seem normal.    Don't worry too much about your rat unless something goes really long.  A few years ago, I purchased two "male" rats from a local PetCo, and about a month later ended up with a little surprise!  (Well, 12 of them!)  She even gave birth with the scared daddy in the cage, everything worked out fine and the babies were so cute!  So don't worry too much, she knows what she's doing!|`|AnIgXRcJaa	http://www.evergreenrattery.com/careguid...  Very good site.|`|AA11371251	ya she is preparing for it usually like a week before they start to "nest" pile things in a spot and they take their food over there and get ready for when the babies are born. Just make sure not to mess with her spot she's picked because if she doesn't feel she's prepared or doesn't have enough food then she will kill the babies. Have fun they are so cute when they are born|`|9c639ceb426ad704bf33bb925821b5acaa	if little rats come out it is giving birth but if aliens or elephants come out then something is definitely wrong|`|GTNnHgSPaa	Typically they will not eat before giving birth.      Have you had a vet check her out?  Closed pyometra is where the uterus fills with pus, and cannot leave the body via the cervix.  They can look pregnant as the puss fills up the uterus and expands it.  One of the symptoms of that is drinking a lot of water.    Just give her some space, but keep an eye on her and rush her to the vet if she seems distressed at all.  Hopefully she has an easy delivery!  Hairless rats can sometimes have trouble making enough milk for their babies, so it may not be a bad idea to try and find someone else in your area with a nursing mother, in case she rejects or cannot feed them all.    Good luck!|`|AA11565057	Giving birth - that's the normal gestation period for rats.|`|uL4m5jZCaa	Your description sounds like she'll be giving birth within a day or so. Most cease eating and drinking once in labor and nesting may be done weeks in advance or the day of birth, depending on the individual. I would give her as much quiet time, but do check in periodically. Watch for any signs of distress and always be ready to call your vet.     Best wishes from SnS Rattery for a safe and successful birth!
tc5A0vKDaa	Get to a vet.  I know it's hard with the current income but it is very important.  I lost one of my piggies to pneumonia on the 22nd and I spent $200 I didn't even have to make sure my other piggy survived.  It was worth every penny.      What Kind of antibiotics are you giving your piggy  If you haven't take her to a vet, I'm worried you might be giving her "people-antibiotics", many of which are toxic to a guinea pig.     Also, while she is recovering change her bedding EVERYDAY and the babies as well (just in case)    Give your ppiggyExtra Vit C (IE FRESH red peppers, parsley, oranges, etc) to help her fight the illness.  Parsley has a lot of vit c in it (3x as much as oranges!) but you have to be careful of Oxalic Acid.  Also, just as an after thought, you guinea pig should ALWAYS have access to Timothy hay.    Also, because your little girl piggie was sick, you should have made sure the mom was healthy before you introduced another little pig.    when (because you should) you take your piggie to the vet, explain to her that you have another little pig at home who might also be sick and ask for another medicine dropper.  Explain that you had to gather scraps just to pay this vet bill and there is no way you can afford to bring the other as well.  Sometimes, they will give you a little extra medicine and another dropper and tell you to give a low dosage to the other piggie "just in case".  No vet is completly heartless, and most will do their best to help you out.  My piggie died in my arms before I left the vet's office, and when I explained to her that I had another piggie at home, she told me to bring him in the following day and she would list him under my first piggies name, so I would only be charged for one visit.  I also had 2 x-rays taken of my first guinea pig (VERY EXPENSIVE) and she was only going to charge me for one.  When MooMoo died, she said not to worry about it and knocked off the charges.  Vet's are very helpful and they usually love animals and will want to see them get better.  She even gave him oxygen the second we came in the door and never charged me for it.    Edit:  Guinea pigs do not get wet tail (they don't have tails!) but they do get diseases similar to wet-tail.  Call your vet and ask if it is safe to give your guinea pig the wet-tail tablets.  They can't charge you for calling.  They could make some suggestions on what else you should do and maybe even work on a payment plan if they feel you guinea needs to come in.    Edit:Good! I'm so glad you got your piggie to the vet!  Also as an added note, if you use CareFresh (Like I do) it is always a good idea to freeze the bedding. They are known to have little parasites in the bedding because of the materials it is made out of, but freezing it will kill them!  I wish you and your piggies lots of luck!    Edit:  I know.  It's the same with my two babies. Doodle is recovering from pneumonia now, but the way I see it, it if hadn't been for MooMoo getting so sick, I would have never known to take Doodle to the vet, and I would have lost him too.  It my eyes, MooMoo was a hero, just as in your case, the little girl was the hero!|`|GTNnHgSPaa	Wet-tail is something only hamsters get.  Those tablets will not help a guinea pig.  You need to get her to the vet.  Maybe you can apply for CareCredit, or maybe your vet will work with you if you explain the situation.  To give her the best odds of surviving, she needs to see a vet.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	You have no choice but to take it to a vet or you will lose this one also, it clearly is something other just something that can be taken care of by way of diet as she got it from her daughter whom died from the illness. I have been in your spot but I quickly had a yard sale and was able to raise enough money to care for the guinea pig. I raised $700 in one day by selling my antique furniture. When we have pets it our responsibility to find a way to care for them just as if it were out child. I never truly missed the things i had to sell as i had my guinea pig who was much more important.|`|RjyNInW6aa	you are going to have to take her to a vet. try asking your mom for some money and then pay her back when you get a new job. it is what i did when my piggie got sick. my mom didn't mind loaning me money.
a2cjwMKcaa	The betta is actually one of the hardiest fish when it comes to cycling tanks.  If you just put him in the 10gal on his own for a while, he will be fine, and the tank will cycle.     Remember that betta can live in totally un-cycled bowls and unfiltered tanks. A larger tank thats 1/2 way through a cycle is no worse than an uncycled bowl.    After a few weeks the tank will be cycled and you can get a few more tankmates. Cory catfish are a good combo with a betta, and maybe some small schooling fish like Neons.    As for the tank theme.. Ummm..  What do you like? A ceramic ornament of your choice would set the theme for the tank. Personally I like natural looking logs and rocks as if I had a small piece of natural river in the tank, but thats just my preference.    Ian|`|e9gXZsKxaa	You must cycle your tank before adding any fish, including your betta. Once it's cycled, add your betta first. Tankmates for bettas are mollies, platies, shrimp, cory catfish, and the african dwarf frog.    Good Luck!|`|174pexgPaa	my cousin has a pirranha! it's so sick because he can feed it whatever|`|DT71taKcaa	A few options are:  Coryodras catfish (3)  Mystery Snails (1)  Glass shrimp (3-4)  African Dwarf Frog (1)  White Cloud Mountain Minnows (7-8)    If your betta is a sweet lil thing that wouldnt hurt anything you could try these:  Zebra Danios (6)  Feeder/Wild Type Guppies (not fancy!!!) (5-6)  Neon Tetras (5-6)      Just do a bit of research to find what they eat and how to care for them properly....      As with the theme, I'm getting a new tank for my betta and its going to be oriental to match my room lol..    You could have something that matches the place where you keep you tank, like the colours, or the ornaments around it
pyqgEbmsaa	If you have the paperwork and someone scans they dog, they won't be able to contact you if you didn't send in the paperwork..    However if you are standing there with your paperwork while the vet scans the dog, you can show the paperwork and prove that it's your dog.   Unlikely that the chip is going to help you find your dog.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	I believe the microchips are passive tags with no internal power source.  In other words if it's already been implanted it should be able to be used to help find your dog.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	The chip is activated but your name isn't listed.  What happens is when they scan the dog, no name will come up so they will trace the chip number to the vet who implanted it.  The vets can check their paperwork & it will show it was implanted in your dog.  Even if it was done at a shelter, their name will come up & they can trace the number to whomever adopted the dog.|`|Mo5N3rqoaa	i dont know you need to call the vet asap and find him i will pray that you do!!|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	I believe the microchip is or should be activated as soon as it's implanted. maybe you can check this with the vet who got this on your dog.    Read on this link and find out how the microchip works.goodluck! hope you find your yorkie soon.  http://dogtime.com/microchips.html|`|384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	no you cant find him unless the chip is activated.|`|36c7247679a853a5f8f5039bbfa74097aa	I'm not sure about the chip but the best thing to do is to go to all the pounds in your area and actually look for him. Put signs up as you've done, it's always a good idea. Go to the vet and speak with them and all the other vets too incase someone brings him in. Also call your local council, they may be able to help. Good luck.
zakbXGK6aa	Plenty of people have reported problems with Chick Bator.  Some people say that it's poorly made, and that maintaining constant humidity and temperature levels is difficult.  Hovabator might be a better option (just to name one).
y7H1V39Jaa	It totally depends on whether you were training your horse and had no intentions of placing, then do what you want.  But, it is not allowed to to train or reinforce our training in a class, especially in front of the girth,  but you can in the line up.  Often you see people, on the way into the line up, reach back and pat their horse's but...nothing wrong with that... I don't care what anyone says, that is the way it is.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	I was an equestrian judge for a short time and though it is o.k. to praise your horse during a show, there are times when you should not- i.e. when you are being judged.  After you have performed and are out of the spotlight would be the appropriate time.|`|RloOJ43haa	Is it 'proper' to pet your horse in a class?  - probably not.    Was it good horsemanship to praise your horse when he did something right? Yes.     I probably would have done the same thing.|`|OjeL1if4aa	It isn't proper etiquette. You aren't supposed to praise/reward your horse during a class. It's perfectly acceptable after you've been judged and are in line-up, but during the class it's frowned upon. Most judges, at least the ones here, will warn you and if you continue, will actually dock you for it.    IMO if you were patting him you would have been better off doing so when he picked up the canter, not after bringing him back.     I'm not sure what "level" IEAs are, but at a schooling show I'll pat/praise/reward my horses if they're doing the right thing.... that's what a schooling show is for... to teach them and work with them in a show setting. A judge can warn/dock me all they want at a schooling show... I'm there to school my horse and I'd much rather he learn to do what's right and be rewarded for it.    I'm also thinking that those types of shows (IEA) are judge mostly on the rider rather than the horse.... at least that's what I've always been told. So, that definatly makes it a bad thing to touch/pat your horse during the class.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	You got some really good answers.  In your situation, I think your pat was very appropriate, and little miss busy body needs to mind her own business.  That said, however, in quite a few show rules, touching the horse in front of the withers or girth can be cause for disqualification.  That is usually directed at cueing or punishing the horse infront of the girth, but I suppose a really anal judge could extend it to patting.  Most people do try to wait until the line up, or as they are exiting to pat the horse, either on the neck, or barrel/butt pats.|`|5TCewPYRaa	No, it doesnt matter what show level you are riding, you NEVER pat your horse in the middle of the class---your trainer was correct in saying that, if you feel your horse deserves a pat then after the line-up in the centre of the ring, once the judge has asked you to back your horse up then that is a more appropriate time---the most appropriate is after the ribbon placings have been announced.       NEVER in the middle of the class--that is disrespectful and makes it look like you're simply schooling your horse in the judges show ring---not appropriate behaviour at all.       Next time, save your praise until after the ride--you can always utter at sorry if you feel compelled to do something--even though your horse wont understand! lol      Good Luck!  BB|`|qp7ssYJcaa	That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I don't see anything wrong with patting your horse!|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	I ride western, at local shows, and I have never heard that it was unacceptable to praise your horse.|`|Sh0IBwClaa	I think that it may not be "proper" but you were doing it for your horse. It sounds like just a small show, so it shouldn't have made a big deal in the judging. I agree with another poster, that you should wait until the line up to praise your horse, but maybe the next time a good boy would have been more appropriate for the show. I would keep in mind that the higher showing that you do, everything is judged. Once I got knocked out of a class because my horse swished her tail. So be careful with judging. I think it would be silly to lose points over a pat.|`|aAjHLfPwaa	that's crazy of course your allowed to pat yor horse  the girl who told you that is crazy|`|NfMasWZzaa	Judges don't like it.  You could have said good boy or something.  I'm sure it was fine in a show like that, but if you ever start competing at higher levels you may be penalized or disqualified for it.  Just say good boy and pat him/ give him a treat when you are out of the ring.|`|8rVodF9vaa	Its true that generally you should not pet your horse while he is working in the show ring. It would be ok to pet the horse after you had finished a course, or while standing in line up after a flat.     But I think you did the right thing. Why? Because it was good horsemanship, and good horsemanship (rewarding the horse for finally getting it) is much more important than etiquette any day.     And being realistic here - I'm sure the judge had already marked you down for not cantering anyway, I doubt that anything you did after that would matter much at all.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I would say whoever told you not to pat your horse after competing for you obviously had no compation, In any major riding events you often see the rider pat her horse. I pat my horse, it's kindof like letting them know they did a good job even if they didn't win a ribbon.|`|d2Obe0aJaa	You're not supposed to touch your horse during the class. Some judges will let it go and some won't depends on the type of show you go to. Usually when we're in the lineup and the judge does their final judging, and they hand off the show card then I'll pat. Also if we win that class or place high then I'll pat. It just depends. I wouldn't let it bother you, at all just if your going to do that then I'd pat softly and make sure that the judge doesn't see it.|`|aca45d3fb8549e44c317f21a5de3ca3aaa	While your reasoning behind patting the horse you rode was sound, the timing was off.  While its perfectly acceptable to pat your horse in the lineup, doing so during the class or before the judges have turned in their cards is not.  Patting your horse is considered a positive reinforcement, and is part of training.  While in the ring, even during an IEA show, you are there to "show" not train, and that's probably why the girl from your barn said something to you.     I can understand why you'd want to pat your horse for doing something correctly, but save it for the end of the class when you're lined up in the center waiting for the placings to be read.      Good luck in the future! :)|`|cq7TfyEHaa	If they do great no its perfectly ok to do so. You have to let them know they are doing ok. Some horses get super nervous and if you dont pat them they will freak. You do what you feel is right. You wont get kicked out or anything. And if you do AT LEAST YOU LOVE UR HORSE RIGHT?
pyqgEbmsaa	You'll have to talk to the vet that worked on your dog. He knows the extent of the problem, and he has your answers. You'll need to pay your bill, which you should have done before taking your dog home. You got the work done you should pay your bills.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	You asked this a few days ago.

Read on this material and learn ahead about it. good luck! and hope you can get the money to give your dog some proper treatment.   http://elfurl.com/b0n5w|`|BYoVsKY4aa	A puppy's bones are extremely fragile, however a fracture is a crack in the bone, not a complete break. If the fracture was in a growth plate, it can hurt the growth of the dog and cause a permanent limp. Slow, short walks are ok until the dog is about 2 years old, when the bones are fully set and at their adult strength. I would recommend you take the dog in to a vet as soon as you are able to for x-ray confirmation of correct healing.|`|9b33175b4c16a8acabbbc43774a2f649aa	My friend i know the feeling of not having the money. first  if you live in a state where it is warm take him to a lake and make him swim they do this for horses with injured legs and it works not to long the first time work your way to about 2 0 minutes|`|ozMywuTaaa	My puppy broke his back leg at six months old. I did the surgery though. What my vet told me to do to help with the strengthening is letting them swim. If they swim they aren't going to be putting weight on the leg only building up the muscle mass. I also gave him a lot of cottage cheese. The calcium helps make the bones stronger while they are trying to heal.   When you are doing the swimming thing with your dog do it for short periods so he can rest, you don't want to over do it. Keep in mind that he hasn't been playing as much as he use to and may get tired. You also don't want to fracture the  again by over doing it.  He's a year old now and he will still limp if he over does it and we just make him rest for a little while and he does just fine.  Good luck I hope this helps.
MURxMnLtaa	no it's not normal.  you obviously have no idea what you're doing and shouldn't be breeding your dog in the first place!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,it isn't "normal",but it is more likely to happen in large litters.You need to get that dog and her pups to a vet to be checked.The pups may have a bacterial infection or something.Also the mother will need checking to make sure there are no retained placentas,and she will need a dog vitamin and puppy food to eat at all times during lactation so she can keep up her strength.I hope you will have her spayed after this.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	ummm no, not at all normal. You should be rushing the puppies to the vet in order to save their lives.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	The larger the litter, typically, the smaller the puppies. These smaller puppies will not have correct access to the mother's milk, so they do eventually die. With almost half of the litter dying, however, I would take the pups to a vet (as well as mom) for a check up to make sure everything is ok. Sometimes puppies die, and all breeders know and understand that there is just sometimes nothing you can do.  Also, check your female to make sure she does not have any teats that are swollen and hot. This may indicate mastitis, which is an infection of the milk ducts and can pass the infection on to the puppies. If she seems to have signs of mastitis, you have your work cut out because you will need to bottle feed the young.  If you are a responsible breeder, you should already have heating pads, a weight scale, plenty of puppy bottles/nipples, and puppy milk. If not, get these things, and have your female spayed as soon as she is able.|`|pyqgEbmsaa	Absolutely not normal at all. You should have taken your dog to the vet after she whelped her litter, had her and the puppies checked over. you might end up losing the entire litter if you don't get this taken care of.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	you obviously studied and researched breeding practices extensively before subjecting your dog to this.  so what did your mentor or vet tell you?|`|TLmhpJyUaa	Completley    My Nieghbor has a Pitt that had 15 pups  and 5 died    its sad but it happens|`|KJZojiHJaa	Quit being selfish, get off of YahooAnswers and TAKE YOUR DOG AND PUPPIES TO THE VET!!!

NUIrBHXgaa	Its hard to say without knowing what kind of plant it is. It could be that your plant is light sensitive some plants burn when they get too much light. If thats the case u just need somthing like a bigger plant/rock or driftwood to block some of the light. If it were a water imbalance i think other plants and the fish would be feeling the effects too.It could be that the other plant/fish are good with how the water is now but that one plant just isn't.
e9gXZsKxaa	It's called "flaring", he's trying to intimidate the frog. Most bettas get along with african dwarf frogs but then again, every betta is different.    EDIT: If it's his stomach bulging out, then he's constipated. Fast him for 2-3 days and see if the swelling goes down. If not, give him the inside of a blanched pea, it'lll help aid in digestion of the foods consumed during the week.|`|UT9Wlu5Faa	It could also be a bacterial infection. Check for water quality issues. and if all else false bring him back to the petstore and see if they can help u|`|twZI4VkHaa	I don't know what may be wrong with it but I remember my aunt's betta fish got like that too after I fed it, and like a week later it died.|`|qdruw9gYaa	If it's not flaring, it's most likely constipation, which is the leading cause of death in bettas.

qp7ssYJcaa	You shouldn't use cedar. It can be bad for your piggy if eaten. Also use non-clumping cat litter. Use Timothy Hay.    "Not giving guinea pigs unlimited Timothy Hay around the clock is a big mistake. Many people don't seem to know that guinea pigs NEED hay. Many people buy the hay they find at the pet store, the most commonly found packaged hay is Alfalfa hay. Many people buy Alfalfa hay because that is what the pet store people told them to buy. Alfalfa hay should only be given to pregnant mothers and growing babies. Alfalfa hay has too much calcium and other nutrients which can cause bladder stones in guinea pigs. Timothy hay helps their digestive system and is the best way to help keep their molars ground down and healthy."    See the sites below!|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	You should not use kitty litter for gp's.  And stay away from cedars and pine (can cause bumble-foot).  I've read that only aspen bedding is actually approved for gp's and it's what I used for mine.    Hope this helps!|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	I'm sorry to tell you that both the beddings you use could be fatal to your pig!    Normal cat litter can be fatal if ingested (eaten) as it causes internal blockages.    Softwoods (pine and cedar) contain high levels of phenols, known to cause respiratory and liver disease, which often cause reduced lifespan. They may also cause allergic skin reactions.    Please switch your pigs onto a safe bedding immediately. You can use hardwood bedding (eg aspen), Aubiose (hemp), or a paper based bedding such as carefresh or megazorb.|`|vxc0NwMSaa	I would not use cat litter. It's very irritating to their airway and eyes.  The cedar bedding and even alfalfa or straw work great.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Cedar can cause liver failure over the long term in small mammals, as can pine.  Clay-based cat litters, if ingested, can cause digestive blockages.  These are both bad ideas.  Look for aspen shavings or a recycled paper bedding like CareFresh instead.
f11db1dc0d60bed9e40620ccd7d8bc0eaa	She's dreaming. Let her sleep.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	Nope.  It is a perfectly normal occurrence when dogs make movements or vocalize during sleep.

o9dMd2rBaa	Ammonia=Very poisonous to fish  Nitrate/Nitrate=poisonous to fish in large amounts    Tank cycle begins with a spike in Ammonia followed by a speak of one of those nitrogen ones, I forget which one. Then it's safe for the fish.     So if your neons die, it is because the tank is not cycled yet. Cycling takes about 1 month for freshwater tanks.     Ways to speed up cycling:  *Buy live bacteria from fish store, this stuff should be refrigerated, otherwise don't buy it  *Get a filter that is presently in an old tank and put that one the new tank, this is the fastest way to a cycle a tank|`|AA11708471	Take a look at this link    http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...    Also why would you want algae?    EDIT:   gemyston adding the fish and turning on the filter is still cycling! It is just not a humane way of doing it|`|dw32oKIoaa	based from my experience, you dont need cycling.. just put your fish in the tank and turn on the fliter. and thats all|`|DT71taKcaa	Neons (according to what i've read) can't handle the cycle process so maybe you could try a few hardy fish untill its done...    This might help you with the cycling process    http://www.firsttankguide.net/cycle.php    to clean it do a patial (30%) water change every week or so and do a full change every 3-4 weeks...    if you need any help about anything else just ask|`|WFxVuM1Laa	high ph can cause cloudy water and over feeding them will cause an ammonia spike killing the fish. and on cycling your tank you don't need fish but you do need some source of ammonia to keep the bacteria alive.
qOiv8d3Laa	Your "baby" will be just fine.    The oil can actually be good for them, as it is (like vaseline/petroleum jelly) an "inert" oil which can lubricate their digestive systems allowing any hairballs to move along and OUT more easily.  The oil is not digested by the system.  Some vets will even recommend you smearing small amounts of vaseline on the cat's coat where they can lick it off, so that they will clean it off, get it into their system, and allow the hairball to move through.    Only if he becomes lethargic should you become worried.      Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Baby oil is non toxic and should not affect your pet.  Getting the oil completely out of the fur could be more difficult though, but it will eventually come out.|`|QmRYgGnDaa	He will probably just get the runs and be okay. It might help with hairballs. I wouldn't worry too much unless he really has the runs alot and then he might dehydrate. Make sure he has plenty of solid food and water.|`|R3E8DkTfaa	Absolutely no reason to be worried.  Baby Oil is just mineral oil, and is perfectly safe to ingest.  In fact mineral oil is used on wooden cutting boards and bowls all the time.  It is the recommended oil for this because it is nontoxic and doesn't get rancid like vegetable oils can.  Your cat will be just fine.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	He should be fine but to be on the safe side call your vet. They should have an ER number. As long as hes eating and drinking he should be fine. If he starts vomiting I would take him to ER Vet ASAP.|`|aF1IXKjTaa	You could call poison control or the vet just to double check and see what they say. Or google it, i'm sure this has happened to somebody else's cat before.

8NSh1D4Maa	Probably not, it will likely always be different looking.  When scar tissue forms, it can result in hair growing back differently or not at all, since the hair follicles are damaged.  My puppy mill rescue has a large bald scar down one of her legs, people often ask about it and I use it as an opportunity to educate them about puppy mills and why not to purchase dogs from pet stores.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Probably not.  It's kinda like a scar but with hair.  Plenty of white/cream poodles can have the same injury & it will grow back in darker.  Dark poodles hair will grow back lighter.  Red poos will grow back a different shade too. It's just the way it is.  If you have any growths or warts removed, the same thing will happen. I have seen it on literally a thousand+ dogs.|`|AA10076207	omg, how awful!! bless you for taking it in!! you might go for a trip to the groomers,get a full shave,and let the hair grow back. poodles require alot of attn w/their coats,and if it's not seen to, it causes problems. good luck w/ur fur baby!!|`|5x2DTMKYaa	Well, for my dog it took a few years, and the spots are still there.

T3lEhfdSaa	Zoologists- they study animals in their habitats ect    Veterinarian assistant- they assist vets but dont have to perform surgeries.    Animal cop- they save animals from neglectful owners, stray animals ect.     Do NOT go into animal breeding because almost every animal you breed will eventually end up in a shelter, and then become euthenized if not adopted within a certain time, mostly somewhere between 72hrs to a week T.T  You will never really know what will happen to the animals you breed, plus. it just adds to the already HUGE population.    Work at a No-Kill shelter, save animals, keep them happy while they are in a scary place.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	You could work at a pet store.

Its like the intellectual ability of an Animal for example.... a chimpanzee (how eva you spell it) is the only know animal to acknowledge itself in the Mirrow. you do experiments such us painting its head yellow then putting a Mirrow in front of it just when is wakes up. The chimp should and will rub it off. emil Denzel study ed interesting things recently about them if you want to research. there are plenty of examples like searching the Fields for a "snake" with weapons  a well if your int rested just research along the basic lines of animal intelligences.

vow5ULxTaa	the drafts.  THey are built do have short stamina in able to pull alot of weight.  Now granted they can do endurance (  i bought a 18.3Hh Belgian Draft who use to do 25 mile Endurance rides)  but endurance rides are not only based on time but how quickly the horses heart rate comes down to normal and that's why arabs and gaited horses are so good at endurance because there heart rates come down quickly.  Because Drafts are so big the energy the exert is greater so there heart rate takes longer to come down.  Certain Pony types are similar to Drafts but most ponies are pretty hardy but uncommon on the endurance ccircuit        IF you are getting into endurance then get a heart rate sstethoscopeand before you go on rides get your horses resting heart rate then when you return from your ride( before you arm down) take the heart rate again.  Then warm down for 10 minutes and take the heart rate again and see the results.    My arab gelding was in training for endurance and went on a ride with two savvy endurance mounts,  when we returned from a 20 mile ride my arab had a better heart rate than both there horses.|`|3gFUq6P7aa	I would think it would be a horse that is heavily muscled, maybe some of the halter bred stock horse breeds or draft horses.  The different types of muscles will result in quick, strong energy, or long, drawn out energy.    And any breed that is unfit won't have much endurance.|`|ExUN7srRaa	i would probably say  an arabian|`|tc2I7k3yaa	Heavy breeds tend to have less endurance. Big boned chunky animals tend to tire more quickly.. just for the fact of the sheer amount of weight they have to carry around.   For example an arab or throughbred tend to have alot of natural stamina an endurance, simply because of the way their bodies have been made. Their legs are light and skinny, so moving each leg uses less energy, they tend to be lighter all over and quiet slim line.  Where as a big clydesdale for example has a big chunky body and heavy legs, so are carrying round a considerable amount of weight!  Never the less, its all about fitness and much work the horse is actually doing!   An 18hh clydesdale in hard work will be fitter that a 15hh arab in very light work.  hope i could help!|`|FLBCvJuDaa	First of all to the other responder... Arabians are bred specifically for endurance in- wait for it- Arabia (hence the name).  You are going to find a lesser endurance in the animals with the shorter legs- i.e. Shetlands.
tc2I7k3yaa	Theres a number of ways you can tell if a horse is happy and content!  [:  -When you are with him, he seems relaxed, comfortable and glad you are there. He enjoys your company  -Just by looking at him! Observe him, in the feild and the stable. Is he behaving normally? Is he happily grazing etc. Or is he stood in a corner alone not grazing and looking un-comfortable  -A horse who plays, either with you or his compains is happy. A playful horse is a happy horse.  -When riding or being led around, he seem glad to be out, and lively/or perky if thats in his nature. He seems glad to be out and about doing some work.  -He eats and drinks normally! If he is enjoying his meals and drinking plenty he's is a happy boy.  -A horse that is winnying and running round is paddock is happy one!  -Finally just go on your gut feeling, look into his eyes, you can get a sense of how he feels.  Hope i could be of help =D|`|nKwcGLQraa	well....he's not grumpy, likes your company, plays with the other horses, is willing to do his best during rides.   its hard to say. its just....a feeling. i guess when youve been around horses long enough its pretty natural to see.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	The horse is happiest when you are not around.   :)|`|at7LXbEfaa	Its ears are forward  and when riding if they are enjoying it they will make a pft pft pft sound|`|0kh2HEFMaa	I can tell my guys are happy because they eat and drink normal, and they roll around...then once they get up, they buck and run.

Their ears are forward and they just SEEM happy.|`|px27V5N9aa	A horse is content when  1.  There is food and water available at all times and he knows it.  2.  His eyes are full of life, sparkle if you will but not wide or a wrinkled brow.  Lids will be half closed if he's content and dozing.  3.  Ears are alert, moving, pricked  4.  Head slightly lowered so that it's just above wither level  5.  Lips are soft   6.  Neck and shoulder muscles are not tight  7.  Bucking and playing with his buddies...herding them around a playing tag.|`|ZkkawcKKaa	A horse is happy when the ears are forward. Also when a horse licks and chews it is happy.

3154e47fc8ca77b487ed564ca1cf02ccaa	CO2 is essential for plant growth. However, uncontrolled release of CO2 into your tank may cause a potentially fatal drop in pH. A change of 1.0 pH is a 10 times change in acidity. Drops in PH are poorly handled by fish and is one of several reasons why you should slowly acclimate new additions to your aquarium.<br>  <br>  An alternative to CO2 tablets is Seachem Excel. The product adds soluble carbon for plant growth without affecting pH.<br>  <br>  Plants uptake carbon and minerals from the water and their roots. The addition of potassium (K) is an excellent way to spur plant development. See the plant section of fishprofiles.com for more information.|`|4d4ad126cb9f6297171d0aa263e7d425aa	Adding CO2 to your tank is pretty dangerous. Your fish need oxygen. At night, the plants are aspirating and releasing CO2 as well. CO2 levels spike pretty high in the tank at night.<br>  You can maintain a better balance of gases in a planted tank if you don't aerate it. Aeration robs the water of the gases the plants need during the day.|`|808bfaa0f5cf67ceba0db727f1fe9d56aa	As others have indicated their usage can be problematic. I'd say it's time to stop until/unless you get new plants. The only times I use them is when adding new plants (to help with transplant shock and give a boost to initial rooting/growth) or when/unless my plants appear unhealthy (same reason as above) and I only use them at half dosage. And I disagree about not aerating the tank (although I would consider this a personal choice) as IMO aeration's primary benefit is the turbulence helps to maintain healthy gas exchange at the water surface (it's really a topic for another question<g>).

IMPvzBk1aa	It is a tissue irritant, which means it causes an inflammatory response.  If it is applied and then rubbed in too much, or bandages are applied over it, the heat produced can actually burn and blister the tissue.  It is best used as a counter irritant, with the surface inflammation it creates drawing the products of inflammation away from deeper tissues like tendons, in order to prevent a harmful degree of inflammation occuring in the tendon following exercise which might damage the tissue.  But you don't want to create so much surface inflammation that you burn the tissue, so it's a matter of balance.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	It doesn't burn the skin. It can feel tingly and almost burning, but that is because of the ingredients(probably the mint if that it present).

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	Is your turtle doing any better now?<br>  <br>  According to this website, <a href="http://www.1happyturtle.com/socializationbf.htm," rel="nofollow">http://www.1happyturtle.com/socializatio...</a> turtles do get lonely if they have lived with a partner for a long period of time. Eight years is a long time so your turtle is probably missing her friend. If you can, maybe you can get her another friend to be with and keep her company? If it isn't because of loneliness, then it wouldn't hurt to get the water tested, check your water heater, heat lamp and all of that other fun stuff. Whatever you decide to do, DON'T release her into the wild. Like any other animal, If they have been raised in captivity since they were young, they don't have the survival skills to survive out there. <br>  <br>  I don't know the area you live in, but where I live, we have a few local shelters that are willing to help out people who don't have the money for veterinary costs. You can ask someone at a shelter or a local pet store for some advice. Although I don't know how well a shelter would know a reptile.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your buddy! I hope she makes a good recovery. :)|`|le9ZROs5aa	Awww that's so sad. She misses her buddy...|`|6J8JFeNcaa	i think it is loneliness, (even if i dont have a turtle i've had a similar story) that  happened to my dog when my other dog ran away.|`|O6kb5vVcaa	Definitely loneliness, When I went to camp he didn't come out for a week and was sad until I came home a week later, try getting her a buddie|`|McnuekTBaa	Contrary to what the other posters have stated, turtles do not get lonely. They are not social animals.<br>  Do not release it- that is how pest species become established where they don't belong.<br>  The first turtle died due to improper care, and the other turtle will soon die as well, unless you can figure out what you are doing wrong. The only clue you've given is lack of appetite; this is usually the result of being kept too cold, although I'd be willing to bet there are other issues as well.<br>  You need to thoroughly research proper care of whatever species (you didn't even say!) you have. If they happen to be red ears, or similar aquatic species, this will help: <a href="http://redearslider.com/" rel="nofollow">http://redearslider.com/</a>|`|pDPSaL37aa	What kind of turtle is it? Do you have the proper heating and lighting? If they are too cold, they aren't able to digest their food and will stop eating. You are doing the right thing by not letting your parents put her in the wild. If you've had her since she was a baby, most likely she will die quicker in the wild because she's used to being fed and not having to hunt for her food. Try giving her some new foods to encourage her to eat (live guppies, minnows, crickets, worms or shrimp and krill turtle treats). Do some research on whatever species of turtle she is and make sure you have the proper equipment and environment for her. Good luck.|`|TxhYMSEAaa	It could totally be because of loneliness and DO NOT put that turtle in the wild you have had it 8 yrs. it grew up in captivity and probably wouldnt know how to function in the wild. Try switchin up the food a little bit and also make sure you have proper lighting. And if all else fails you could even attempt getting another turtle.. nobody likes to be lonely!! lol

Afecta a las personas y los peque?os mamíferos que se infectan por la ingestión de los huevos que se hallan en las heces de perros y gatos. El parásito también aparece en la carne mal cocinada o cruda, y en verduras mal lavadas, de ahí que puede haber contagio sin tener gato. Los gatos la sufren de modo apenas visible, se manifiesta en un proceso diarreico que no es grave y por las afecciones en los ojos (uveitis). <br>  En las personas causa erupciones cutáneas, fiebre, linfadenopatía y malestar. Lo más peligroso es que puede provocar alteraciones del feto o abortos si la infección se produce durante los tres primeros meses.

qOiv8d3Laa	Some will... some won't.  It's a matter of their personalities.  I have 2 "altered" males who get along enough to keep the peace, but they aren't fast/close friends and "snuggle buddies!"  The older cat may just dislike the uppitiness of the younger one.... you know, he's putting the young one into it's place... and they DO have a hierarchy!    If the fighting gets to be too much, believe it or not, there are sprays available that contain a certain "pheromone" that makes the cats "like" each other or other people or DOGS, even. Well, it's not like magic, but it's sort of like "kitty cologne" that cats react positively to. You can find these in a good pet supply store, or online. Use as directed, and it may just help the two "over the hump" in getting comfortable with others.      Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|AA11371251	you can't unless they were raised together. Male cats are territorial in Nature and no male would let another come in and take over you should seperate them before you come home to one in pieces.|`|AA10076207	yes. we have three neutered males that all get along great. they're all different ages, not raised together.my advice would be to just give it time. they'll sort out their pecking order in time. i'd only step in if it looks like they might get hurt.be well,and good luck w/ur fur babies!!|`|IcBdShB1aa	Yeah i've seen it|`|rTwsdq6kaa	get a dog. together they could both get along and tease it|`|NIYYN6tpaa	I'm having the same problem.

My hat swats him and runs off|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	yes but the kitty that is 12 is well a grumpy old man (I have one that's 10) Just give it a little time..they'll work out their differences.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	walk them together. after a month you should be good.|`|Wcib0PTYaa	If that is your picture , do you accept me as a cat to live near you ?|`|Xn9ELUeXaa	Yeah, but  usually cats wont get along if they have owned a territory for a long time. My cat is a female and doesnt get along with any cat that enters our area.    WOw, you look pretty btw.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Yes give it sometime the older male is mad right now b/c another male is in his turf but it'll get better older cat is showing his dominance which is normal I've got 4 cats 2 males 2 fem all fixed but it took longer for the males to get along I guess b/c of all that testosterone ha ha good luck|`|K7N0pkU8aa	yes! animals are very territorial and your older cat is jealous of the new kitty...just keep them together, and give your 1st cat more attention when the new one is around..the older cat is going to hiss when he sees the other cat but only for a few weeks then they'll love each other|`|LVPYnB6gaa	if you get them both neutered there should be no problem..calms them both down..but start them in different room let them sniff under the door keep it like that for about 3 days then put like a baby fence between them so they can see each other but not hurt each other..they can hiss and do whatever they want that way..next put them together (supervised) hold one let the other one walk around you..let them be around each other for about a week with you watching them until that they are getting along..then your good!! hope this helps|`|PuPQF8QIaa	It's not so much that your cat's are male that they aren't getting along, granted they will be territorial, but i think it's mostly due to the large age gap. a 12 year old cat is old, probably not very active, and well..other old things. Where as your young cat is likely to be playful and just generally annoying to your older cat.    they possibly could get a long, but i wouldn't put much hope in them being best friends.    Separate their food bowls, put one on one side of the room and the others on the opposing, slowly move them closer together by a few inches  every few days.    I had this problem with my older female cat. She still dislikes our young cats, but she tolerates them, especially during feeding time.|`|CX6Qcoamaa	no... cause they are still both PUSSYS!!!|`|tHkqV9Hbaa	umm I would say most likely not, because they aren't kittens so they won't ever grow to be friends. The best you could do is punish them if they fight but give them a treat if they are by each other and not fighting.|`|URtyXMX4aa	YES...the older one will just have to get use to it and don't bother them or force it they will do it on there own....this happens every time we get a new boy cat but they learn to get use to each other..       well i hope this helps you out|`|1P3xVXLzaa	Male like their territory so the 12 year old is still trying to defend from the 2 year old they will never get along|`|ZdK0bkztaa	They can if they were raised together as kittens.  Also, if they spend time together, they will eventually tolerate each other.|`|hDe11Xw3aa	well, i have a 12 year old cat, and then i got a little kitty (aslo a male) they were both freaked and their eyes were as big as saucers, but as a few weeks went by they got  along very well, they were just like brothers  and after the younger one died at age 4, :'(...We got a new kitty (female) exactly the same thing happened, they end up being like tight as a fat man in spandex  So your two kittys should get along just fine, just give it fine  It would be like bringing a total stranger that you have never ever met or seen into your home, you prly wouldnt get into deep conversation or anything right away, right? Give it mabey about 3 weeks at the most  if they arent getting along after like 2 months, they just plain dont like eachother|`|1CvrXvjoaa	yes it is possible it will take time. and patience. i am not sure how to encourage it but just give them time and they will get used to each other. it may take a few weeks or a few months.   hope this helps  good luck

4aAhEK9daa	Yes - take it to the vet to check out WHY it has bad breath.  Bad breath is the sign of many diseases/problems.  You don't want to mask the problem - you want to find out the source.      Considering this is a young kitten it's probably worms in the stomach - quite common for kittens.  It also could be stomach infection or, not as likely with a young kitten, a bad tooth.    It also could be something as simple as the foods you're feeding.  If you're feeding a food with fish in it this can definitely cause bad breath.    The first thing you should be doing when getting a new kitten or cat is having a vet check it out.  So set an appointment and go.    edit: dry food does NOT clean the teeth - http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...|`|ueMkd6U4aa	you can go2 a pet store and buy treats for cat tat are to make there breath smell good|`|4NhPaIkTaa	they have treats that say "freshens breath" on them.

Most people don't but it good to brush them. Like how most people brush their teeth everyday. You can buy a kit that come with cat toothpaste and toothbrushes at most pet stores.

Hv7L5CrGaa	You can teach the cockatiel to talk, step up, roll over, sing, and even play dead! These tricks can be done if you are patient and willing to spend time with your cockatiel. Teaching it to talk won't be that hard, but it really depends on what kind of cockatiel you have. Is it vocal and does it like to make sounds? Teaching it to talk: Choose easy and short phrases, like 'pretty boy' or 'hello', things like that. Keep repeating the phrase to him, soon he'll want to copy you.

qOiv8d3Laa	Thankfully, I have not had too many ticks on my kitties over the years.  Living in such a COLD climate as I do, their "warm weather" season is more limited than in more moderate climes.

o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Bottom of they cage. Say you put the nest box up high. One of the babies want to explore and fell out. That would be heartbreaking so put it on the bottom:)|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Budgies prefer a higher nestbox always. Its their natural instinct to choose a higher nestbox because in their mind its safe from predators. A higher nestbox helps to reinforce the birds feeling of a SAFE place to have babies.<br>  Babies wont fall out if it is the right kind  of nestbox and the only time they are likely to come out anyway is when they are fully feathered. At that stage they dont hurt themselves coming out of the nestbox. Baby budgies in the wild sometimes come out of nests 60 feet up a tree. They are designed not to hurt themselves when they come out of a nestbox as they can glide to the floor.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Make sure the nest box has enough light by it so the budgies can see the entry hole.  Let the light shine into the entrance of the box.  This provides security for the budgies.  Also, entry ladders will help get budgies into and out of the nest box.  Keep in mind that the male is the one who needs to be comfortable with the nest box first, or the hen won't enter the box to take care of her clutch of eggs.  It's best to experiment with the birds and see what they prefer, particularly the male.  I've seen some budgies prefer nest boxes up high, while others like their on the bottom.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Near the bottom. This way, when the babies start to explore, and they drop, they won't hurt themselves. Plus it is closer to the food and water!
T3lEhfdSaa	Its cruel. The other dog has no choice in whether it WANTS the transplant or not. it simply cannot say "I dont want the transplant, i dont want to die" It would be...just cruel. If you truly love animals then you shouldnt feel the need to sacrafice one animal for the life of another, even if you have had that animal for 14yrs, it just isnt right    the people above me have a good point thought, if it is alive it is cruel but if it is already dead, its not that bad...|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	A vet doesn't kill a dog to transplant organs into another dog. They would take the organs from an animal that had already died from other causes, such as being hit by a car. That would be totally unethical to kill one dog only to save another and I don't know a vet that would ever do it that way.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	i have read about this somewhere,it was kidney transplants for cats.

Or maybe because the bath has high sides, she considers it a safe and secure place for toileting.<br>  <br>  This link, has a check list of 18 reasons why cats stop using their litter tray, which may help you solve the problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/litter%20tray.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  If you leave a couple of inches of water in the bath this will deter her from using it as a toilet.|`|3arJsZ91aa	Mine wee'd in the bath to show me that she had a urine infection.

When it hurts to pee, they associate the pain with the litterbox and will try peeing on something soft (like laundry) or something cold (like the bathtub or a tile floor) instead. She needs to see a vet as soon as possible. If she does have an infection it is usually easily treatable with antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If she does not have an infection, it could be that something has changed in her environment that she is not happy about. You might try getting her a bigger litterbox or a second one (some cats like to pee in one and poop in another).|`|N3DSDW3Iaa	My cat started to do this when she was about 2, she is litter tray trained but never used it in the new place but once she got use to the area she went outside and did her business, might be that she is scared or it could just be its the first place she can get to|`|FfNjsqGvaa	I once caught a cat doing that. I closed the door and never let her in there again. When she did get in, I would bleach it down. At least it was easy to clean. In the meantime, I hope you find your answers so you can solve it long term|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Because cats really aren't all that smart, she needed to pee, so she did it in your bath.|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Litter tray needs cleaning? Not a bad thing though, much less hassle to rinse the bath down. I wish mine did it.|`|JLyqGD93aa	My cat always used to poo in the bath, no idea why :p
8NSh1D4Maa	If it doesn't start shrinking in the next day or two, get your hedgie in to the vet.  There are types of tumors that can look like blood blisters, unfortunately.  If it is a blister from an injury, the body will begin to absorb it and it will disappear pretty quickly.|`|r7I7FoNMaa	Do not panic.  This may have been caused by a pinch of some sort.  Give us more info - his abode, food, how often you clean his abode and where the sore is.|`|Gi7zBtJuaa	Your hedgehog could have an ingrown quill.  Where is the blister located?|`|sIqpqRHPaa	It could be anything from a growth to an injury.     A blood blister or injury would resolve itself in a few days to a week. Keep an eye on it and see if it heals/lessens in intensity. If it gets bigger/fatter or worse, then you need to see a vet immediately. Hedgehogs are not very prone to skin cancers but it never hurts to have a professional opinion.     There's a new forum with a lot of experienced hedgehog owners at www.chins-n-hedgies.com/forums/index.php You might want to post a picture there and see if anyone has seen something similar.
W0buucLsaa	Aww, good luck with this. I don't know anything about breeding really, but I do know that there are some rare breeds out there with small clubs. I'd try to contact those guys and ask their advice for how to find people with a similar passion. Surely there has to be a forum somewhere on the internet where people discuss these dogs, too?     Or perhaps any new NZ clubs for more common breeds of dogs? You could contact those folks too.    And I totally hear you on the breeding puppies for money thing. Makes me sick...|`|vPde97E2aa	Stick whatever lie you want on the mutts..they are NOT a BREED!!!    Cockapoos aren't...labradoodles aren't........sticking a LYING label on any mongrel does NOT make them a breed! WON'T make them a breed.|`|nhhCow4haa	i am born and bred in new zealand and have never ever heard of a new zealand minature terrier!! could you give me a link to some photos?    edit: i just googled new zealand miniature terriers and nothing came up except minature fox terriers
q17Zlq1Zaa	no,its not heartburn, but some type of pain.  you need to go to a vet, to find out what is the reason for yelping or growling,when picked up?  don't worry, the vets job is to find out what is wrong,you don't need to diagnose you dogs problem.  is your dog a small breed with short legs and a long body?  like a jack russell,pekingese,scottish terrier,dachshund,shih-tzu,lhasa apso?These breeds are prone to back problems:a herniated disc anywhere in the spine will cause intense pain.  No stair climbing,no jumping up or down,no sofa,bed,armchair!  see a vet ASAP.|`|mP2kdTxIaa	My dog used to be the same after she got her shot. Did your dog get a shot, too? If she did, that might be the reason she's feeling pain. If it isn't, go check the doctor just in case.|`|TEucykbZaa	Your dog could be suffering from some type of pain whether it is a shot that your puppy got, if she fell on the ground, or slipped, or if it is just that something is wrong with that body part of hers that is hurting.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Can you give more detailes is a yip or a grone?
EeJMITyCaa	He shouldn't be eating adult food. There aren't enough nutrients in them for his body because it is still developing. You need to give him no other choice but to eat the puppy food. It is not okay for your dog to eat adult food until he is at least a year old and large breeds its usually 18 months. Don't let him have access to adult food. THis is what you do. For breakfast you put out his food for 15 minutes. He probably won't eat it and so you take it up and put it back down for his lunch meal. He might not eat this either or he may just take small bites. After 15 minutes you take it up again and try again at dinner. This could go on for up to 3 days but it usually ends the same day at dinner. No healthy dog is going to starve himself and just because he wants adult food doesn't make it good for you. When kids only want hamburgers and pizza should their parents only give them pizza and hamburgers or should the give them healthier foods.|`|o93EwErKaa	Well I think a puppy that age should still be with the Mom for another 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  He couldn't have developed any long term eating habits at that age so I would give him a high quality puppy food (no corn, no soy, no wheat, no by-products and a named meat in meal form as the first ingredient).  At 5 1/2 weeks you should still be wetting to soften the kibble and warming the food.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	I have a Newfie...my breeder actually recommends me not to feed puppy food to giant breed.  He is on adult food since he came home.  He develops very well.  Currently his kibble is Orijen and I use Wysong Archetype as supplements...plus good human food.|`|GaL66jbQaa	He shouldn't even be away from his litter yet. In many places it's illegal to send a puppy to its new home until 8 weeks.  He should actually still be nursing.|`|soYU9Tk6aa	how old is he?<br>  maybe the adult food doesn't have enough nutrition or filling- ness to it<br>  the little guy is probably just developing fast and is hungry|`|JiCKFTuIaa	What kind/size of dog?<br>  Believe it or not it really does make a difference.|`|eRZMwhBoaa	Try mixing some cottage cheese or mixing some crushed boiled egg in the puppy food. It's good for them and it should help get your puppy eating it's proper food. The adult food doesn't have all the essential nutrients that the puppies need. So try mixing one or the other in and slowly take small prtions out until the puppy eats the food on its own if not try to get it so you can put as little cottage cheese or egg in there so your puppy eats most of its food. Also be sure to mix it in not just put it on top or your pup might try to be sneaky and just eat the people food. Good Luck!!|`|p1GTZ6JRaa	I am a German Shepherd breeder and my pups are naturally reared. The best diet for any dog is raw food! It takes a lot of commitment but its worth it!<br>  If you are interested in raw feeding do a lot of research and if you decide to feed raw.....add some goats milk to the meat that's what i do for my puppies.<br>  BARF is the healthy, safe and nutritious way to feed your pet. The BARF Diet mimics the way your pet used to eat before highly processed, grain-based foods entered our pet’s food chain.|`|c9df4c88b2c31adf93b7c7f6fab45fc1aa	Hopefully, U're feeding your puppy quality food & not junk dog food.  <br>  <br>  TIP:  Quality dog food first ingredient starts with meat.<br>  <br>  SUGGESTION:  Wellness dog food <br>  <br>  LOCATION:  Now @ PETCO<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/dog_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/dog_index...</a>|`|xlMuAnSJaa	puppy food has nutrients that adult food does not have, so if he is going to eat adult food try some powered nuturents, or the puppy milk they sell at stores.
GSf09ALBaa	If you just got neutered less than 24 hours ago, how would you feel?<br>  <br>  He is fine.  Just groggy from the anesthesia and a little sore.  Give him a couple of days.  You are worrying too much.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Sometimes it takes a long time for the anesthesia to wear off, and they can be cranky, plus he will be sore. If you are worried give the vet a call|`|bqbrKFeUaa	It's kinda late, but yes I would call one of those emergency 24 hour vets to see if this is normal. But yes he is definitely soar from the surgery still of course. He got things cut off, how would you feel.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Well, yeah, hes grumpy - he just had surgery!! <br>  Stop touching him - leave him alone until morning.  <br>  Most dogs are wiped out the first day and night after they get neutered.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Yes.  Akitas are a sensitive breed anyway.|`|EeJMITyCaa	No he is just in pain. Just leave leave him alone.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	My answer is not relevant to your question but since I am also a giant breed owner..just want to share with you.<br>  <br>  Giant breeds really should wait till at least 1 1/2 years to get neutered.  Testosterone is the hormone that you take away when you neuter the dog.  And testosterone actually is used by the body to build muscles and bones.  So if you take away this hormone too early, especially giant breed which takes a longer time to develop, the dog will have higher risk to develop bone problems and get injured easier in later day.<br>  <br>  I wish I can tell you this earlier.  Neutering is a personal choice but because most vets won't tell you this, some people don't even know.<br>  <br>  What I will suggest is really watch his development now..may be give him some joints supplements.
o93EwErKaa	Rachel Ray's is not a good food because it has corn and soy, but still better than a lot of them out there.  A good food will not contain by-products, corn, soy or wheat and have a named meat in meal form as the first ingredient.  A decent food for a great price is at Costco's called Kirkland Signature.  It receives a rating of 3 out of 6 at www.dogfoodanalysis.com   Walmart sells a brand called Maxximum that also rates a 3, but I don't think it is sold in large bags, but I could be wrong.  Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul is a premium food (rated 5 out of 6) and costs about $36.00 for 35 pounds.<br>  <br>  In any event, you are best to keep the dog on what it has been eating.  Dietary changes should be done slowly by adding 1/4 new with 3/4 old for a week, then 1/2 and 1/2, then 3/4 new with 1/4 old for another week to avoid diarrhea.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  As more people understand the importance of nutrition to their own health, they're starting to consider what's in their dog's food bowl as well. Food manufacturers are only too happy to oblige, and the latest products are likely to be labeled natural or organic, and include ingredients said to promote health, such as blueberries and salmon oil. That said, it can still be a challenge to sort out high-quality chow from the canine equivalent of junk food.<br>  here are some guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/food-nutrition.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/food-nutrition.html</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.
8ba614025fcbb970cec97e3f152d6d21aa	That's hilarious!  My cat was abandoned and I got him at two weeks old.  he only grew up around dogs, guinea pigs and people.    He will fetch, he also sits and begs.  He's notorious for jumping from one place to another and completely missing and falling to the floor.  He climbs up on the counter and gets into the bread.  He falls of his kitty condo often.  He likes to sleep on the edge of the bed, or couch, and he'll stretch too far and end up falling on the floor...he does all of these things very often.  When he's at my parents house they have hard wood floors, he'll walk to the end of the hall, turn around, pick up speed and run into the kitchen, about half the time, he doesn't take the turn right and slams into the cupboards.    I've just accepted he has identity problems.  Perhaps your cat has the same problem.   :)    As long as he isn't hurting himself I wouldn't worry.  You are just blessed with a cat who has a lot of personality :)  Lol make a BLOG about all the silly stuff he does    edit:    Your kitties are so cute!|`|ooiLqSpQaa	no he doesnt need any treatment. he's probably just playing around. my cat randomly runs and hides behind couches and jumps on walls. im sure ur cat is just playing. and theres no such thing as cat-tarded|`|mvgfatSNaa	How do you know.?|`|5aKUV5afaa	Cat-Tarded.  LOL!  If you enjoy each other's company and both of your needs are met, I see nothing wrong with a cross eyed cat.  My bother in law has a blind dog.  Hey it works.  I'm sorry I'm still laughing at Cat-Tarded and the vision of your cat running around.  If he/she is not suffering and everyone is happy, there are no problems. LOL|`|wcv9xgh5aa	i dunn know.|`|K87vKkA8aa	i might switch food lol  if that dont work then go to a vet|`|1fJVvRFMaa	lmaoooo!  if you are being serious, go to the vet|`|13rfC5yEaa	awww that is so cute!    Well is he getting into trouble (is he hurting himself)? If not I think he'll be fine.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	LOL he could be!|`|Ddb5821Jaa	He needs MORE love!|`|TItI8uxWaa	it's practice for catching birds and mice|`|QxMsReIHaa	He probably needs some eye check, it is best to bring him to a vet.|`|hDe11Xw3aa	Yeah, um, i would take him to see a vetrenarian..Like, I'd be making an appiontment like as soon as you can  but he could also just have the crazies  ALL cats have the crazies, even the big fat lazy ones|`|KY2MlJbWaa	hahahahahahah that is so funny hahahahahahah|`|4NhPaIkTaa	Alot of cats are actually cross eyed. Is he siamese by chance? they are more likely to be crosseyed than others. As for the chasing things, hes a cat, he'll do that.  If your really worried you can take the cat to the vet but honestly they will probably look at you weird and wonder if your joking.   Cats can be retarded (i have a cat that i swear up and down is retarded, he hit his head really hard on the bathtub, he just ran full force right into it like it wasnt there) but he just sounds like a young cat to me|`|AA10076207	lol. we have a rescue that's like that. he's one of the funniest, sweetest cats we've ever had. sounds like he's just got energy to burn. some ppl call it the 3am crazies. we can't call it that bc he does it all day and night.
3GZz5iNFaa	I feel for you.  Just pray for God to care for him/her.|`|AA10076207	i am so very sorry for your loss. yes, we have six,and i'd feel incredibly sad if i had to give one up. they're my fur babies. i pray that she finds a good,loving home. feel confident that she'll not forget the kindness you showed her.|`|VpWLICvXaa	Feel sorry for you too. My dog was too active so my mom took her away... I recommend you to get another one... if you can. Or else don't think about it. Good luck.|`|qiuUpCN4aa	yea i fill sorry for the dog must be so sad to lose a puppy.
B6zl0AJDaa	Back in the mid 1980's I'd just finished working my then 16 yr old AQHA gelding and had cooled him out when I rode him into the aisle of the barn where two of my friends were standing around chatting.  I hopped off and asked one of them to "sit" on my old horse while I stretched my legs.  I was excited because my off again, on again cowboy boyfriend was coming down and we started talking about my excitement.      I started telling them about the first time the cowboy had ever ridden my old horse.  He'd been five then and I'd hauled him the 500 miles north from LA to the Bay Area, excited to show off the fanciest horse I'd ever known and school him on the trails I'd grown up on.  Anyway, I'd worked him from about 7:30 AM until 4:00 PM pushing out rental horses to and from the barn all day when I came in after the last group went out, my then on again boyfriend had me hop off the horse and he climbed on board.      I then told my two friends, that when my boyfriend and horse came back, my boyfriend was white as a sheet and my horse was sweaty and breathing hard.  My assumption was that my horse, ran off with my boyfriend.  As soon as I said that, my old horse started shaking his head adamantly!      Clowning around, I asked the old guy, "Did you run off with Bob?"   He shook his head "NO!!!" again.      So, continuing this, I asked, "Did he open you up and did you take advantage of him?"      At that point, the old horse nodded his head "YES!!!" then did something he'd never done before or would ever do again.  He lifted his top lip up in a horse laugh and had all three of us humming the theme from "Twilight Zone"...|`|rTSwouqXaa	For me the most embarrassing (now funny as I think back) moment came when I was a freshman in high school. I am a rough stock rider(bulls and saddle bronc). I decided that all 5'6 and 160lbs of me(before my growth spurt) was going into bulldogging. I borrowed a friends horse and saddle and I was ready. 'Cuz shucks if I can ride one I can throw one, right? Well I got tips from the old timers and was in the chute. I dipped my hat and out we came. That ol' horse was perfect and put me right where I needed to be. I baled off the horse and caught the steer just right on the horns. I planted my feet and dug in. Then. That damned steer picked up its head and trotted, TROTTED, across the arena with me still trying to throw it. When he stopped at the turn out gate I had my chance. I yanked and pulled and twisted with all my might. Just before the 20 sec. time limit I got that steer down. Needless to say I decided to stick with rough stock.   Even after I sprouted to 6' and 200lbs.|`|tvlELUloaa	It wasn't really funny at the time but i laugh at it now.     My family owns a horse farm we have over 200 acers and i was riding my horse LJ and we were pretty far out there and i felt that her saddle was coming pretty loose, so i got off her to fix it, i tightened it then right when i was about to get back on her.... She took off! I was about a mile or two away from the barn and it had to be like 80 degrees out and i had to walk back to the stable which took me a pretty long time. when i got back LJ was standing the barn waiting to get untacked like nothing happened.|`|RoPLmd2daa	Haha- it's the thrill of them getting something right, so they like to show off, lol.  Here's mine:  Just the other day, I was having a sort of snowball fight with the horses - I would throw a snowball at the ground a few feet away from them in their field, and they would do a dramatic "OMG" and then they'd come back for more. When I wasn't paying attention, one of the QHs snuck behind me and grabbed the cuff of my jeans with his teeth and flipped me over! I then put a small snowball in his mouth, and he thought it was the coolest thing ever.|`|at7LXbEfaa	I was at the riding centre and i was riding one of my favourite horses  Tuscany, shes mean and the boss but shes an awesome ride.  Anyways  one of the horses got scared by a chainsaw and he went all crazy and scared EVERY one and brock away and cantered back to the paddock.  After a second i went back to grooming Tuscany and she was making a pft pft pft pft sound like she was laughing at him  she did this again when my friends bro fell off a horse..  shes 1 mean horse|`|XB0UpJsLaa	haha..thats a funny story  my first story is, I just got my 4 yr. old unbroke arabian, I am just starting on his back, and lets just say my horse does things "diffrently" lol...there r some ground poles in the arena and a big jump set up. I try to take him over the groung poles and he freaks out he starts snorting and bolts...I am trying to controll him while he is running around the arena, all of the sudden he turns really fast, trots over all the ground poles, and then goes over the jump, clearing it by a half a foot!!! everyone was laughing..I was like what the heck??? lol!! u r afraid of them, so u go over them and then jump..he's a weird horse.  Then i had a morgan pony...she was a really good pony but VERY stubborn (she had a mind of her own) one day I decide to take her outside bareback with no bridal (stupid idea!!) We were in the drive way..and all of the sudden she bolts, I didnt know if she was going to run in the woods or in the rode!! i was soo scared, she gallops up this hill, and starts to go down the other side...I jumped off her...and she stops at the bottom of the hill. As Im sitting on the ground she picks an apple from the apple tree..trots over to me and eats it..and looks at me like what the heck r u doing on the ground. All of that for an apple..I couldnt b mad at her cuz she was pretty smart for knowing she could do it since i had no bridal on or anything..lol  Horses r pretty funny :D|`|aAyXzFCHaa	ok well here's one of them.  at my first pony camp we were queuing up outside the dressage arena on foot leading our horses, well my pony is prone to running off and he decides to do a runner. onto the muck heap. not a good idea, although it was flat topped he sank up to his knees and i was the one who had to go and rescue him. then we stank. it wasn't funny at the time for me but when i look back i think its hilarious!  although him running off does have bad sides. it got us banned from pony club for a while once because we were trying to load him into the trailor and he ran all the way home meeting up with someone from our stables on the way. so they said he was dangerous and banned us.    xx XD
ak9DrBSwaa	An article you should read, and you can find hundreds of similar studies online.    Animal Cruelty Linked to Violence Against People  Animal Abusers More Likely to Harm Spouses, Children, and Strangers http://cats.suite101.com/article.cfm/ani...    The child needs some serious help. It is UNFAIR to keep the information on her violence from the school as you are putting not only any animals she may encounter at risk, but also OTHER CHILDREN. Untreated this behaviour will likely only escalate.     Do the right thing, she obviously has serious issues that need treatment. Stop trying to hide or minimise her behaviour - instead shout it from the roof tops, tell the school and everyone else in any position that may offer some glimmer of getting her help in hopes of finding the right combination of approaches and therapies that can turn this childs behaviour around and prevent a life from being wasted.    You may need to have her treated by another counselor who specialises in this type of issues or an onsite treatment facility.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	You probably should have posted this in psychology.    It sounds like she has conduct disorder.    Make sure that you're using a reputable therapist, but honestly, I'm not sure it's something that can be cured.    Conduct disorder is a precursor to antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy/sociopathy). People with antisocial personality disorder have no empathy. You cannot tell them something is immoral because they do not understand morality. They only believe in doing what is in their best interests. It may come to the point where she is a danger to the other children. At that point, you will have to "send her away."|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	a ten year old should know by now,that killing animals is wrong.  the child is either disturbed or the parents are so negligent,that they "forgot" to tech her any morals.  obviously, she is keep doing it, so she enjoys this and obviously, she is not supervised!  These animals are wild: how is she getting access to them:she goes out alone to the desert or street to search for "victims"?  How about the siblings,are any of the siblings show this type of behaviour?  The child needs a therapist/psychiatrist for sure.  nobody here can help you.|`|eS8wuYRfaa	STOP GETTING HER PETS!!!!|`|5pGfmlxcaa	eaither watch her carefully and when she goes by the pets keep her away from them or teach her to pet the cats or play ith them   or dont get any pets|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	She was an adopted child-- sounds like she has a lot of emotional baggage. Does she wet the bed? Does she have any friends her age? Do you watch how she interacts with people? All of these things can display signs of her malfunction. Cruelty to animals and bed wetting are common past tendencies of today's current child/spouse abusers/serial killers. Her mental capacity obviously doesn't allow her to understand you when you try telling her how morally wrong it is to kill animals. How do you punish her for killing the animals? Have you tried putting her in a Sunday school class filled with other children her age? She'll learn songs, read stories, and color pictures in there, and a Sunday school teacher will be able to red flag you, personally, on anything she does in there (such as drawing abnormal pictures), without involving CPS. Maybe switch your therapist to a psychologist who majored in abnormal psychology. She sounds like she needs to be closely supervised, and that you, no matter how much you love animals, should stop with the small, delicate pets. No more fish. No more cats.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Seriously, she should NOT have access to ANY animals.  If that means getting rid of all of your pets, and keeping her in the house all the time, so be it.    She desperately needs help.  Make her go back to the therapist, even if she doesn't collect the list of lies.  She needs a lot of help, and she should have gotten help much sooner.|`|Oc0jea7Yaa	Don`t get anymore pets. Put her in the nut floor in the hosp soon. before she starts killing people.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Remove all pets from the household and find another therapist.  Actually I would go with a psychologist.  People representing themselves as 'therapists' may not have proper qualifications to be addressing a problem of this magnitude, depending on the laws in your area dealing with who can call themselves a therapist.  Abusing or killing animals is an indication of some severe mental or emotional issues and is almost always a precursor to a criminal history.|`|XfP895zXaa	you obviously have a very troubled child, did she go through a big trauma when she was younger. as previously mention go to a psychologist, you need to find out why she is doing this. You need to try and explain to her how precious life is and that we only get one conscious try at it.|`|QL3prjHyaa	OH BOY........She needs intensive therapy done with a psychiatrist.It sounds like she may have one of the sever attachment disorders.Is she adopted.Do you know if her first family abused her in anyway.I hate CPS too they ignore the kids that need help and stick there faces everywhere else.Is there a children's hospital near you.they have  a lot of people that can help.She may have to go into a hospital or treatment program for a time I know how hard that is remember her actions are not your fault.I'm a nurse and it really sound like she needs a docs help.Have you told her doctor what she is doing.If the doc said don't worry he is wrong.feel free to email me at ladykailean62@yahoo.com

Check the salinity of your tank 24 hours later and make sure its between 1.024 and 1.026. If not add more salt or more water and again wait 24 hours. Temperature that's best is 26 degrees Celsius. You will need a power head/wave maker of sorts for water circulation and it also helps the salts dissolve.<br>  <br>  Next step is to add cured live rock. You will need 15lb of live rock. Its approx 10 euro per pound. Test your water after 24 hours for ammonia nitrite and nitrate. If everything is ok you should add the live sand. 1 10 pound bag at 20 euro will be loads. I would recommend a hang on back skimmer. I like deltec and TMC brands. After 1 week of your test results being good you can add the first couple of small fish.
crkGYHWfaa	it's very likely and you should separate the two because as soon as the mother has the babies she can get pregnant again. rodents breed very fast and you will end up with many litters if you keep them together forever. it sounds to me as she is pregnant if she is nesting i recommend if she does have a litter to keep one of the females (so the mom isn't lonely) and keep it with the mom and take the other babies and dad to your local pet store

There are research jobs that wouldn't require you to perform surgeries.  But most small animal vets do routine surgeries.

If you are giving a cheap feed, they can smell bad.<br>  The best food has meat as the first ingredient on the label, not corn.<br>  I would try changing his diet to a better brand.  Just make sure that you do the change slowly.  Start with 90% old food and 10% new food.  Each day change the percentages a little bit.

Just as toddlers go through a period of being afraid of strangers, this is the age when pups become aware of dangers in their surroundings. <br>  He is afraid to go outside, where the boogieman can find him by his scent, so he does it indoors, where it is covered by yours, his protector..You can't allow him out by himself, but must stay with him...If you spread down a bag of sand, to make a nice area,  he will want to use the sand..If he doesn't take to it right away, then put a tiny smear from a former poop and leave on the sand..Be certain to pick it up as soon as he has done it..<br>  Routine is the key..<br>  Feed 3 times per day at the same times daily..Put the bowl away after 10 minutes..<br>  Take him outside after every feeding. ..<br>  Never scold for mistakes, but give lavish praise every time he goes outside, like he won the spelling bee.....<br>  Use the same word every time, such as 'do the doody', or whatever..<br>  The most important thing is to watch him closely, and scoop him up and outside when he begins to act restless, turn circles, etc. soon he will whine and look at you when he needs to go.|`|AA11372747	take the poop out side in the yard and leave it he should go to it and poop in this spot. clean very very well to remove any oder where he has been going in the house.

AA11887983	Ok, you need to get your dog in the house to stay the night.  She needs to be warm, and dry.  Her incision is not meant to be dirty.  You also need to be able to monitor her for vomiting, and pain.  <br>  <br>  Chances are good that she is still sedate from the anesthesia,  and she is a bit under the weather.  The best ways to assess pain are respiratory rate, such as panting, not wanting to lay down, or being restless, or crying out.  Your dog may be sore, but if she is that sedate, the vet probably gave her at least one medication that helps with pain.  <br>  <br>  DO NOT give any medication that was not expressly prescribed or recommended by your veterinarian.  Tylenol is safe only in specific doses, and any medication that you give can react with the medications previously given.  <br>  <br>  Get your dog out from the deck, by coaxing her or bribing her with treats - not steak! - and monitor her in the house.  If you are still concerned about her,  take her to the emergency clinic in your area.   <br>  <br>  These are the exact reasons that some veterinarians will have people leave their pets overnight after surgery. They can relax, and be safe, and owners don't have to worry about what the pet is doing. <br>  <br>  Hope your dog is doing fine.|`|b95a886d1220943550325eaebe4b411caa	She's in a bit of pain from the sounds of it, but don't worry, you did the right thing by getting her spayed.  Do get her out from under the deck and bring her inside.  Make sure the wound area and sutures are clean.  Give her a day or two and she'll be back to her usual self.  She just went through major surgery.  If the vet gave you pain meds, give them as instructed.  Good luck, and thanks for saving lives by spaying!|`|46e5ba636e0a789d05c25d395bb37d84aa	i have had many pets over the years, dogs and cats and others, and had them all fixed, except the bird and fish. lol, most of the time especially the females need more anesthesia to be spayed then males for neutering. it takes them a couple of days, also she is probably in pain and doesnt understand why, at 6 months, she has never had this kind of thing happen and doesnt understand, when a dog or other animal think they are sick, they leave the pack, and you are the pack, that is natural, try to keep here dry, cover the deck with plastic so she wont get wet for sure, in case it leaks thru.<br>   she will come out in a couple of days, then 1st off, check the incision for redness, puffyness, feed her soft bland  foods for a couple of days|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Put out food and water under the deck so she can get to it.  <br>  Keep trying to entice her to come to you--if she is having any complications you need to know.  Do whatever you can to get her out and into your warm house.<br>  It is rare to have complications from routine procedures, but it can happen.  Not to scare you--but better safe than sorry.  She could be licking/chewing at her stitches, for one, which is not good.  Some vets give analgesics, some don't.  Even if they didn't, she may be uncomfortable but shouldn't be very painful.  <br>  At the least, get a bright flashlight/spotlight/whatever you have,  and get under there to look at her.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA12136244	She may be in some pain but my guess is she is still coming out of the anesthesia. Different dogs will react differently to it and she maybe still a bit hung over from it. Try to get her inside though. Use some treats to try and coax her out.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	She's probably experiencing a bit of discomfort from the surgery.  It's also possible that if you dropped her off, she may be snubbing you a bit for what she perceives as "you did to her".  Dogs can be funny like that sometimes.<br>  <br>  I would do your best to coax her at least inside your home tonite, whatever that takes as she needs to be monitored.  If she's not better in a day or two, you might take her back to the vet to have her checked out.|`|80594e86ba89e9eee5e3a7714addb3f4aa	After I got my dog fixed.

Call the vet's emergency # right away to see if anything went wrong and their recommendations. <br>  <br>  If it's safe for her to have food. Make steamed rice and boiled meat (chicken or beef, ground or shredded). Go outside with it and lead her inside. Her stomach is probably upset from being put out you may want to give her this tomorrow as well. Measure it out once it's cooked cup for cup just like her dog food. After give her one Tylenol if the vet doesn't give you anything for pain. If your dog is up to 65 pounds you can give it to her every four to five hours. You may want to give her Tylenol PM so she sleeps, there's a little benadryl in it. If under 65 cut it in half. Good luck! I hope your girl is better soon.|`|f50389a497df5a69fe4b065151efb74eaa	I hope this will help you. i rescue animal on the rez and i get animal fixed all the time animal have different reactions to stuff like that. but i am sure she is fine as long as she does not get to wet. good luck.
5x2DTMKYaa	If you adopted her, didn't the shelter have a vet look her over?  After you adopted her, the first couple of weeks, what did your vet say after he saw her for the first time?  Did your vet have an opinion on the acid reflux?    If you bought her, she came from a BYB, and no way will she help/be concerned about your dog.  You might (depending on area/laws on the books) be able to take her to small claims.  But I highly doubt it.    Lesson learned.  BYB does not a rescue make.    If this is a case of this lady taking in strays, and adopting them out.  You might need to report to someone about conditions of her rescue operation.  Some people start out with good intentions then just get overwhelmed.    If the wet food is causing problems, just don't feed it.  Put the dry kibble down, when she gets hungry she will eat.  Be patient. Or if you want continue to hand feed until you get the word from your vet.  Chicken and rice might work if her tummy is a little sensitive.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes she has been spoiled by ppl food & shouldn't have it.  She could have allergies or a yeast infection thru her body or ear infection only.  They by feeding her ppl food & not good balanced diet could be the reason for her stomach & ear problems.

You can feed dogs a raw diet but carefully balanced.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	www.caninemegaesophagus.org  go to this website,maybe this is what your dog has?  some dogs are born with a condition:megaesophagus.  im not sure, but maybe check the symptoms and see what happens to your dog?You will need a vet to treat this.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	First thing, do you already love her?  For me it was love at first site, mine is maltese/silky terrier.  If you are already sunk (per say), just take her to the vet.  Sounds like a ear infection, and as for the acid reflex, well, maltese are known for their allergies.  She probably has to be on a special science diet food and NO people food.  If all they fed her was human food, that lady needs to get a grip!
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Bettas in Thailand ARE bred in ponds. They scoop out males and jar them ready for sale/show. They may do the actual breeding away from the ponds, just in tubs, and then put the fry out into the ponds to grow.    These are some Thai concrete growing-on ponds:  http://www.betta-thailand.com/images/gro...    Remember that if the pond is large enough with dense enough cover and you live in a tropical climate, this is going to be pretty close to replicating wild populations of Betta. More than one male will fight but any dying loser is going to get eaten by passing critters and not noticed. They will stake out territories and females will visit. There is still a risk fry will also get munched but again, in a pond situation it's not going to be as noticeable as in controlled tank conditions.    It's not so easy to replicate this in tanks as the average fish tank is long, deep and narrow, nothing like a pond which long, deep and WIDE!    But like I said, this is only going to work when the water is at tropical temperatures. As soon as the water and air temp begins to drop below 75F breeding will stop and as it gets cooler both adults and fry may die.|`|AA11708471	WHY    Most people dont have an expensive pond heater for them    Wouldn't it be easier to just do it in a tank?

4aAhEK9daa	This is totally normal.  Cats are territorial and you should NEVER just toss them together.    Did the shelter not instruct you on how to SLOWLY introduce them?  I volunteer at a shelter and this is what we tell EVERYONE adopting that already has a cat (or dog):    Put the new cat in a room with its own food, water and litter box - a bedroom or bathroom would be best. Keep the new cat completely separated from the existing cat for at least a few days. Put an old tshirt with the new cat to get its scent on it, then give this shirt to the existing cat and then back again. This way they'll get used to eachother's scent.     The WORST thing to do is to just plunk a cat down in the middle of a room with access to the entire home. Being in a new home is overwhelming and can be quite scary for most cats. So let him get slowly used to your one room and THEN once he seems comfortable let him see the rest of your home and the existing cat.     Do be sure to have this new cat checked out at a vet before you allow it any interaction with a vet. If it's coming from a shelter it's most likely already going to have been tested for Feline Leukemia - a deadly and incurable disease. If this is not the case then this test is a MUST as FeLv is contagious among cats - transferable via saliva if they're sharing bowls or saliva/blood if they fight.|`|Wn4tjazIaa	Your cat's jealous! Make sure you spend some time with just him, away from your kitten, to let him know he's still loved. Eventually he'll play with her, but right now, he's annoyed that someone (namely, a cute fluffy kitten) has entered his territory and had the nerve to stay. Plus, you're probably giving lots of attention to the kitten and not as much to him. Give him a bit of a break.|`|47P7uLV6aa	This is so typical of a cat!  It is normal and to be expected.      A slow introduction is great if you can do it but if you can't, then they WILL get used to each other anyway.  They WILL learn to tolerate each other and hopefully even learn to get along and like each other.  You did the right thing, getting another cat.      It takes awhile for a new cat to be accepted.  Sometimes it takes a week or two but it can take up to a YEAR.  Believe me, I know -- we have 10 cats and I've been through this many, many times.  All of our cats get along fine (most of the time) but it sure didn't start out that way!  So just be patient with them and give them both as much attention as you can.  And think of it this way -- even if your cat seems upset by the newcomer, at least he's not BORED!      Good luck!|`|PuPQF8QIaa	We have new cats in and out of my house fairly often. And as long as they aren't fighting, let them just learn to feel each other out, and feed them in separate bowls that are semi far apart, slowly move those bowls closer together. They should slowly start to get along, -unless- there is a large age gap. My old cat still wants nothing to do with our younger ones unless it's feeding time.|`|UKpNiRf6aa	A cat's usual reaction to unwelcome changes in its living situation is to distance itself from the newcomer. Your existing cat will usually exhibit one of two kinds of behavior with the newcomer - he will hide out, even if it is for a few days refusing to acknowledge the newcomer's presence, or he may act aggressively towards the newcomer in an attempt to persuade it to retreat. It would be advisable not to try and force a relationship on either cat at the onset of an introduction.     You should allow the cats to adapt at their own speed and keep in mind that cats are extremely territorial and become strongly attached to their familiar living area. Some cats will take days to adapt and others may take weeks, and in some cases months. The newcomer needs to be given an area where he can retreat if he becomes threatened or frightened, leaving him in a spare room with the door closed for the first few days so the resident cat can adjust to the scent of the newcomer is usually a good idea. This way they can smell each other but they cannot hurt each other.     Make sure your newcomer has a litter box in his area along with food and water. By providing the newcomer with a place of his own, you are giving him familiar territory and allowing him to have security so he can rebuild his confidence to venture forth once you leave the door to his room ajar.
ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, I made this career change a few years back to become a professional dog psychologist and behavior therapist. I had been studying wild wolf and dog pack and two inner city stray dog packs for a number of years. People started asking me to work with them and their dogs and after a few months, realized I could make a good living out of it without charging the earth and could help dogs and owners at the same time a doing what I love most.    First off, I researched courses and degrees in dog psychology, behavior and training. I shy away from training as it is not my area of expertise or interest. My interest has always been in understanding dogs, communicating with them and rehabilitating them. I am now a qualified dog psychologist and behavior therapist and love my life.    For you and your husband, you have the land to be able to run a behavior rehab centre and a day care centre/training centre.  The only thing I would say with the behavior side of the business is this. It is always best to deal with negative behaviors in the dogs home environment first so that you can study carefully the triggers, routine and behaviors of the dog with its owners and get an understanding of the causes of the unwanted behavior. In most cases, this rehabilitation can be completed working with the owners in their home and local area.    For more severe issues where other dogs can help in the rehabilitation, you need to make sure you have a very balanced pack to bring the dogs into. For this reason, keep the rehabilitation pack away from the kennels/fields for the day care. You need to make sure when bringing a dog in for rehab, that you don't surround it with dogs that are unbalanced, excited, anxious etc.     I am not lucky enough to have the land you do, my pack lives in my home and so do the residential rehab cases, but rather than walk the fields with them, I have the use of a secluded field in the daytime where I know that no dogs can come in and upset the balance.     Sorry for the long answer, but there's a lot to consider on the behavior side. Saying that, if your husband has a natural talent for it, he should go for it. It's highly rewarding and I am so glad I did it. I used to earn a very generous six figure income working in head hunting, now I earn just under, but am so much happier I cannot tell you and I don't charge even half of what the other trainers/behaviorists in my area charge because I think every dog deserves the help, regardless of the owners financial situation.    Good luck and email me if you want to talk more about the experiences I had.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	That bacteria will be mostly dead and useless. They do need water flow and food to survive.    There may have been some that survived but the majority would have died over a month.|`|07YBD5mJaa	the water is stale if it is not running..same as a river. bacteria lives in non running water, i mean think about it, the water is just sitting there collecting bacteria, as running water naturally filters the bacteria. this is why campers/hikers know to drink only from the running water streams.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	no|`|kwOFstbKaa	Yes it does.  The reason being if their is no water flow the water becomes a little stale.  There will be no fresh nutrients flowing past the bacteria, no fresh oxyegnated water and the water in that area may not benefit as much as it could from the tanks heater|`|6L0tVhn7aa	Ok...aerobic bacteria require oxygenated water to oxidize ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, stagnant water is low/absent of any oxygen and so will not provide a sustainable environment for aerobic bacteria to survive so although bacteria may survive on 'wet' media for a finite amount of time it's unlikely to be of any use after a month. Bacteria in stagnant water is a whole new kettle of fish as thats where you will find anaerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria thrive in very low oxygen environments and this is the type of bacteria that form in stagnant water. The reason drinking stagnant water is bad is as anaerobic bacteria oxidize any nitrate to nitrogen gas they produce very harmful toxins as a by product, these toxins can make you very ill or in high enough quantities..kill you.  So to generalize your question, yes, good bacteria will die without oxygenated flow.|`|gHKJmygoaa	Indeed, it is a question or aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Nitrobacters are aerobic so they would need oxygen. That guy probably charged you more for it because he said that it was cycled.

He wants to please you .Training him will serve a dual purpose of occupying and stimulating his mind and keeping him steady at commands. Try a search on iq tests for yourdog. One of them is to get a towel and to lay it flat on the floor. (no need for perfection here) Show him a treat or toy. Then let him watch you put it under the towel. If he isn't interested in getting it then he is kind of slow  Good luck.and have fun. My one dog isn't "smart" but he is very loving. Kind of a Forrest Gump dog.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	teach your dog to play   high-5, the idea is that you put your hand out and the dog touches its nose to your palm, then you put your other hand out in a different position/height.  Once the dog has the hang you can do it really fast and active dogs love it.  To start you get the dog to touch his nose to your palm, give a treat.  do 5 on one hand, then swap to the other hand.  do several times a day.  Once your dog has clicked you can start going faster and treat every second time, eventually they don't want treats, they just love the game.  Spin/Turn   teach your dog to spin on the spot.  You need one word for one direction, and another word for the other.  You start by getting a large toy, rope is good and encourage the dog to chase it, hold it up a bit high and just spin it around so they chase and spin on the spot.  Say the game name the whole time.  eventually you should just say the world and they will spin.  Weave between your legs.  Teach your dog to walk between your legs on command, when mastered take a step and make him go between, then take another step, eventually you should be able to walk slowly with your dog twisting and behind your first leg.  Hide and Seek - if your dog can stay, you hide and recall him, otherwise you need 2, one to hold the dog and encourage him to find while the other is hidden.|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	It's not very aerobic, but have you tried a puzzle ball? It's the same concept as a kong toy, but on a larger scale. It can be rolled around and thrown and everything. Tug-o-war is always a good stand-by, just make sure you put the lamps and vases away ;P    Also, try to teach him some new tricks. Some good ones are hide, beg, and play dead.   How big is your house? If you had a large enough room, like your living room, you could have a make-shift agility course. I've done this with my aunt's dog (she lives in Idaho).  We took the table and turned it upside down, and taught the dog to weave through the legs. Just hold a treat right in front of his nose and he'll follow it.  We took some cushions from the couch and stacked them up and had her jump them, etc.  Obviously this is a little hazardous for furniture, but it's pretty fun on a rainy day!    Even if he isn't the smartest dog, it would be engaging him mentally and (if you do the couch cushion agility) physically, even if he doesn't master any of it!    ADD:::  I'm curious, were you present when he was born? How did he come back? That's interesting, he sounds like a trooper.|`|F4BIqnWoaa	Forgive me for being redundant, as I answered a "how to teach" question with this as well..     Have you considered teaching tricks with a clicker?  A dog doesn't have to be super-smart to learn with this method as its simple association.  You could teach him everything from simple "sit pretty" to picking up his toys or ringing a bell to go outside VERY easily and quickly.    You can check it out here.. I swear by this thing and the only thing its ever cost me is $2 for a clicker and some cheap hotdogs to cut up for treats.  www.clickertraining.com

Don't try this if the dog just ate.    1.  Stand facing the dog.  2.  Hold a treat in your closed fist.  Let the dog smell your hand.  (This is very important, if you show him the treat he might only do it when he can SEE a treat!)  3.  Hold your fist out knuckle side up just out of the dog's reach.  Slowly move it forward going past the dog's nose and over it's head.    As you do this the dog will start to look up and follow your hand.  Once your hand has gone too far to see he should sit down.  If your dog starts to back up you may need to move to a place where the dog's back is against a wall so he can't backup.  4.  When his butt hits the floor give him the treat and praise.  5.  Once he's consistently doing it with the hand gesture, you can start saying "Sit" exactly when his butt hits the floor.  Only say "sit" once.  If you start repeating it he'll think he's allowed to ignore it the first few times you give the command.    Practice this several times a day for no more than 3-5 minutes at a time.  Be sure to practice it everywhere you go, so the dog doesn't think he only has to do it at home.  Have your friends and family practice with him too, so he knows he has to mind all humans.

She can still be in your room with you, but she shouldn't be pushing the boundaries.  She is getting into a lovely habit - I'm feeling lonely... wake mum up.  Obviously I don't need to tell you she needs to know once you shut up the house for the night, that's it until YOU want to get up in the morning.  So, empty before crating.  And that's IT.

AA12347845	Cats don't have 'Death' perception or any such thing !    Cats are naturally agile,acrobatic, instinctive creatures with an excellent sense of balance.    Observe grown up cats - they are forever jumping up and down walls, leaping from one rooftop to the next, walking on walls and parapets, darting across busy roads etc;    (you also dont see many monkeys falling out of trees and hurting themselves, do you ?)    Your kitten 'knew' exactly that it was not safe to jump from that height so it just stood on the wall. Next time dont yell when you see it in a precarious situation or you will startle it and cause it to have an accident - which on it's own it would have avoided.

Cats speak by using complex combinations of sign language, vocalization, and scent cues.    The cat's tail speak volumes.  Kittens greet their mothers and confident, happy adult cats greet their owners with tails held straight up, with just the end tipped over, like a finger waving.  The end of the cat's tail may twitch or flick as an expression of the cat's frustration or irritation, and is a warning to cease and desist.  If polite tail flicks are ignored, the tail movement may escalate to lashing or even thumping the ground, which is a final warning to lay off or receive a smack.  The relaxed, content cat's tail curves down and up in a gentle U, and goes higher to show interest.  A straight tail with bristled fur indicates aggression, but a bristled tail held in an inverted U indicates fear or defensiveness.|`|796946fca86fe29d89c837bd53e5e59faa	There Tail In General is used for balancing...so back forth means that cat is using its tail to balance out...i saw this on the discovery channel once...it was pretty sweet|`|QL3prjHyaa	if they are just hanging around they are letting you know they are annoyed about something.

owi3TGSBaa	Males tend to turn their beards black more often than females, but it is not something to use to determine sex. Males and females are pretty much the same size. So that shouldn't be used as a method to determine sex either. I have noticed females with smaller heads than males, but that isn't always the case. A common difference is that a male will have a thicker tail than a female. But keep in mind that age can also play a factor in that. As far as the submissive or dominant behaviors, both sexes will show any of the beardie behavior. I have seen all behavior performed by my males and females. However, males do tend to be more dominant and females more submissive. On the underside of their tail, just above the vent, there is typically either a single bulge (or none) or two separated bulges. If you see two clearly separate bulges, you have a male. If you see only one, you probably have a female.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	There really is no difference other than usually size. Dragons average adult full size ranges from 18"-22", with the females usually being 18"-20" and the males 20"-22".  Some believe that there is a difference in behavior, tameness, and other things, but there really isn't. It mainly just depends on the individual dragon. For the most part males are known to show their black beard more, but I know people who have both males and females who state that their females show it more.   It is really hard, and almost impossible to tell what sex they are when they are juveniles. You sometimes can tell when the are between 6 months and a year old, but depending on how young it is still difficult. I adopted one last June and she is about 2-2 and 1/2, she looked like a he at the beginning and now we find out he is a she.  Here is an article with pics on sexing your beardie: http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/se...    Here is some important info for you to take a look at  a small care sheet type thing I made up:  They need at least a 40g tank - this is for each. You should never house two bearded dragons together as they can and probably will end up fighting  if not at first, they will with time as they get territorial. They get big in size, plus this size tank will properly distribute the needed temps on the hot and cool side. The hot needs to be 90-100, the cool 80-90 (add 10 to both sides for juveniles). The temp can go into the 70s at night throughout the whole tank as this is the normal temp they are used to at night. Beardies also MUST have an UVB light 10-12 hours a day, and need to be able to get within 6-8 inches of it to properly receive its rays. UVB helps some reptiles properly digest their food and receive the nutrients, especially calcium from their food. DO NOT use any type of under the tank heater or heat rock for your dragon or in the tank. Bearded dragons do not have heat sensors on their underside and many have experienced serious burns, some life threatening, due to these items.  Any type of loose substrate is bad for a bearded dragon as it can cause impaction (http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/im... The best substrates to use are repti-carpet, outside carpet, tile, non-adhesive shelf liner, paper towel, and even felt. If you have a bearded who likes to dig, you can place a towel or some paper towel, or even a small blanket loosely where he likes to sleep. This will safely give him something to bury himself into. Here are some pics of my Spike with her favorite blanky, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... and http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Beardies need both live food and salads on a DAILY basis. The salads should contain a mixture of greens, like collard greens and others plus an occasion of fruits and veggies mixed in. Visit http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co... to get a listing of the foods that are good, and foods to stay away from. For the live foods NEVER feed your bearded meal worms or mice. Meal worms have too hard of an outer shell with very little meat inside making them hard to digest. Mice, no matter what size, are very fattening and have very hard bones that are hard to digest. A bearded dragons digestive track is VERY small and at one point has like a kink in it, anything that has not been digested properly up to this point can get stuck and cause impaction. This is why the rule of thumb as far as size of food, whether it be salads or live, is it should be no bigger than the space in-between their eyes. Some better choices for live food are crickets, super worms (only when beardie is big enough), wax worms (only as a treat as they are fattening), calci-worms, silk worms, and the best are turk and dubia roaches. A lot of people freak when they first hear about the roaches, but they are not like your house roaches. I have a colony of dubia roaches. They are clean, don't smell like crickets do, easy to care for, and reproduce for themselves! Here are some pics of my dubia colony. There are more pics that you can scan through, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Always gut load all live feeders before giving them to your beardie. Gut loading is pretty much just making sure that the feeders you are getting ready to feed to your bearded are full and have recently eaten themselves. This fattens them up, puts more meat on them, and makes them nutritionally better for your beardie.  Example: Take the crickets you bought and put them into a container with cricket feed, fish food, or crushed dog/cat food over night and then feed them to your beardie.  Humidity is bad for a beardie and should only be at 30% in the viv. They normally do not drink from a bowl, but I keep a small one in my Spikes viv just in case. In the wild they drink from falling water when it rains as it falls down leaves and such. They also get it from their food, and it is good to|`|AuC4qOxeaa	Males a known for being more aggressive.

EwGUxIm6aa	Ian's right.  I would add, place medium to heavy plant cover (fake or real) and put in a medium sized log for the Shark to hide in and you will be fine.  No other Red Tail Sharks is the only fish I would stay away from.    The plant cover will give escape to any fish that are chased.  This shouldn't be a problem, however, sometimes the RT Shark will get territorial with other fish...if only for a moment and give chase.  The plant cover usually puts an end to it fast.

If dogs don't have an issue with their glands, you should NOT try and pop them. Even if they do have a problem, it's always a good idea to have a professional take care of the issue.    We take our dog to the vet and have them do it. Granted, it costs money but atleast I don't have to deal with the stink and unpredictable-ness of it all.  Well worth it to me.|`|iZEAJGK3aa	some dogs suppress their anal glads naturally while going poo, but its usually smaller dogs that tend to need a little help. that's why they usually scoot across the carpet. the anal glands are under the opening of his butt. take your thumb and fore finger and slightly pinch the area below (usually you can feel the sacks) and try to slide them up towards his anus. it can literally spray out, or shoot several feet, so watch out. don't force it if you cant do it yourself. you can take fido into petco and they do this for you as well while bathing the dogs. larger dogs don't usually need them suppressed, but they can still get infected. you should suppress them every month, more if the discharge is thick.   if there isn't anything coming out, and you have been to the vet or a groomer, and they cant get anything out, the next explanation for scooting across the carpet is worms.

Is there dry food down for him all the time? He may be trying to tell you he is hungry.     It seems to me though he is cuddling and suckling on your ear and kneeding your face, ear and chin. He is trying to wake you up because he needs love or food or to just be held. He may also want to play. I know not a good time to play but for him he is not use to the schedual yet.

The simplest way is to keep him out of your room by shutting your door. but letting him roam free unattended takes some cat proofing like removing low wires that he could chew on and so forth. So if you have a fairly safe spare room to lock him in during the night with toys, water, a litter pan and a place to sleep, that would be optimal.     other alternatives :  Clip his nails, can be done with a standard human nail clipper. just don't go too far up the nail, google the correct way to clip a cats nails if you choose that route. this will at least ease the pain of his claws.

She will be lonely for a bit but just give her lots of love for the next few weeks and she should be fine. :)   OR  to just add Tink back to the group if she is definitely female.  http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm  You probably could have even left her in the cage with mom if she is definitely female. However since mom is all ready under enough stress best to wait till the pups are older.(4 weeks)    You will also need to seperate the male babies once they are 3 weeks old as they can mate with mom and get her preggers again. This is really bad for her body.(and can kill her)    The boys can be kept together if you want to keep them or try to find them homes through your local news paper, friends, church etc.     If you do keep the boys you will want to make sure their cage has a top or they may be able to jump out and in with your girls. Male pigs are determined! That or keep their cage in a totally opposite side of the room. :)     I'll attach some info on how to care for mom and the pups:  http://www.guinealynx.info/reproduction....  how to start sexing the babies to tell if they are male or female:  http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm   Also on how to introduce Tink to one of the female babies:  Scroll down to "adding a second cavy"  http://www.cavyspirit.com/sociallife.htm  there's also info on how to tell if they are getting along, working out dominance, or fighting with intent to harm. :)   hope that helps!
U1RcZjqJaa	I worked at a kennel where two Bichons we boarded very often and their owners always brought in water with vinegar in it for us to give them instead of regular water. There was enough vinegar in it that it could be smelled, but I'm not sure the exact ration because it was already made when they gave it to us. They had the whitest and more tear free coats I had ever seen.    If you go to this website they also mention the use of vinegar.  And be sure that if you choose to use it, use apple cider vinegar, the white distilled vinegar will probably make them sick.  http://www.vinegarbook.net/Pet_Uses_for_...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No & it won't work either.  Besides keep them clean & use distilled water instead of drinking tap & not feeding food with beet pulp will help.  Just keep clipped free of hair. There is a product called Angel Eyes that works really well but does contain a natural fermented antibacterial so some ppl are cautious about giving it to their pets.  Also when at vet make sure your dog doesn't  have  any ingrown hair or eyelashes or infection causing the stains.    http://www.angelseyesonline.com/faq.htm    This is the link for Angel Eyes & this page explains how it works & what causes the stains.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Do NOT take your grandmother's advice - you'll blind your dog!!!!    There are no "home remedies" but I do know of a product that works great with tear stains.  I use it on both my Persian cat and my Exotic Shorthair.  It's called Eye Envy http://www.eyeenvy.com  A little goes a long way so it's really not that expensive.  And once you get the stains removed you only need to use it once or twice a week to keep the eye area nice and clean.    Surely you can afford a small bottle of Eye Envy if you were able to afford to buy a Bichon?|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	a friend of mine uses this,its added to the food of the dog(she has an all white dog)  www.angelseyesonline.ca  im in Canada,i did not see it in the pet store,so my friend ordered it online.maybe in the states its available in stores?
W02kTOqmaa	You have major dominance issues going on here. But you also have to remember the Bichon is still young, and very puppy like. She HASN'T completely learned proper manners yet, and she is still new to the family.    Scuffles are to be expected. If your older dog is showing any kind of protection over her stuff, then she feels she should be dominant, and you need to follow this. Pet her first, feed her first. Reinforce that your older dog is the alpha. this will help some of the bickering.     Also, LET them get in to little scuffles or fight. Dogs need to establish hierarchies. Small fights now stop bigger fights in the future from happening. Let your mutt put the bichon in her place. She needs it.    The bichon, it sounds like, is also just trying to get a reaction. Play time. My older shepherd is lazy and not too fond of playing. Our 14 week old puppy obviously wants to play all the time, and the only way he can get a reaction out of my older shepherd is by messing with his bone when he's chewing on it. Not the friendliest reaction, but a reaction nonetheless. They both eventually end up on either end of the bone, chewing and growling at each other. Nothing serious.    Let them scuffle, but keep an eye on it. If it gets out of hand, or if they fight CONSTANTLY, you may have to look at doing something about it.|`|tUcBasPfaa	when the dog does that smack her lightly with the toy eventually she will get tired of that and leave ur mutt alone|`|iZEAJGK3aa	dogs always think what the other has is better, just like a child. from the sound, she hasnt really been around other dogs before, and hasnt learned the alpha dog chain. there is always an alpha dog even if it isnt aggressive. you should be the main alpha dog in your house, but then there will be one dog who is the next in line. i am willing to bet that your mutt may not be too aggressive and will just teach her with a good pin or wrestling match, but if you see any aggressive snapping immediately intervene. pay attention to the tails. if your mutts tail points down, and his ears tuck back, thats a sign he is being threatened and he means business. but if his tail is wagging or pointing up, thats a playful manner, and the growling or fighting will just be to establish the alpha dog spot and teach the little one whos the boss.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	How much money you got for the vet bill? If you had 2 four year olds battling over a toy would you give them sharp knives (which dogs have in their mouths) and let them duke it out? Hope not.    Some dogs have never learned how to interact appropriately with other dogs. If your dog is being polite, keep it that way and monitor the situation so that the dogs don't have the opportunity to practice bad behaviors. The result you think you're going to get by letting one dog attack another may not be what you end up with.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Provided you are there, I think I'd let them sort this one out !!  Sometimes it is necessary for the pack order to be established and this little Madam needs to learn respect for the older one.  Provided no actual damage is done, I'd allow them to sort this situation out.  But I wouldn't leave them alone with 'treats', at least for now.|`|nsVbWXKraa	I'd let them fight over it a couple times and they will get what they deserve...

9dlRcS7caa	If you are worried, then let the physician check you. It's better safe than be sorry.|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	It's hard to tell if you are infected this soon. Wait a little while, maybe consult your physician about the possibility of cat scratch fever, etc.    It shouldn't be much to worry about, though. Most cat scratches don't lead to infection.
6L0tVhn7aa	I assume the 'tube' is part of the venturi and the end should be out of the tank to suck in air to make the bubbles. The powerhead itself should ideally be fully submerged so that a. the impeller is fully submerged to prevent damage and b. the water will help dissipate any heat from the powerhead.|`|WFxVuM1Laa	you can put it anywhere you want. i hide mine behind my live rock. all the way down.|`|syH2DpN7aa	You should have it very close to the level of the water. It should make ripples or waves at least. Having it too far out of the water can be quite turbulent, but you need at least a bit of surface agitation to make sure the water is oxygenated enough for your fish.
7HBTvg8Caa	I have had a German Shepard dog (Cleo) that I rescued when she was a puppy because the owners children were allergic to her dander and they were going to take her to the woods and shoot her! I've had her for about 5 1/2 years now and she has always been the only dog, very well tempered, loving, loyal, but she seemed lonely. So I went out and bought a Pug puppy (Pugsley) from the pet store. At first it didn't seem as though Cleo and Pugsley would mix and I immediately thought I would have to find a new home for Pugsley, the thought killed me. I was sure they'd get along as they were both the runt of their litters. But as the weeks progressed Cleo took on a sort of sisterly natrue with Pugsley. Bullying him really, hogging the food and water, hoarding the toys, pushing him around, growling at him and the like. But when Pugsley would get in trouble Cleo would stand in between me and Puglsey and not let me near him. When the dog next door would sniff at Pugsley, Cleo's hair would stand on end and she would go on the defense. She had also gotten into her first fight protecting the little guy, and she whined when he had to go the vet and sit on the table. It may take a while but I do believe your dogs will become friends and I would suggest giving it a try, because there is no separating my two dogs now that they have each other.|`|ltP1gO4taa	Has your APBT ever socialized with other dogs?  That's the key right there.  If you've always had good experiences with your dog around other dogs then I say go for it.  If your dog has shown aggression towards other dogs, then you have a problem and might not want to choose a dog that's too small to defend itself.  If your dog has never been around other dogs, then you need to start socializing him now.  Dogs have a small window in which they can learn proper socialization and your dog is at an age where that window is closing.    If you decide to go ahead with it, I would arrange for the dogs to meet before you commit.|`|LWEceVT4aa	I say go for it. If you think that you can handle the responsibility then go right ahead. But try to adopt the dog, therefore you can take you dog in first and see if they get along. And you can pick the right energy dog to fit your lifestyle.  Good Luck!!!|`|1i8HiHHeaa	however adorable he may be does not guarantee he'll be happy about a new addition to the family - especially at first. has he been exposed to puppies before? is he well socialized around small dogs?     if you do decide to get a puppy i would recommend you get a female. there will be less competition between them. even though you'll be busy with a new puppy make sure that your boy retains his privileges. make sure he is fed first & separately, goes outside first & make every effort to ensure he doesn't feel he's lost his place.     keep a close eye on them when they're together & make sure the puppy isn't pestering him too much. if it looks like your boy is losing his patience put the puppy safely in it's crate. that way your boy will get a break & the pup will learn that it's not acceptable to be a nuisance.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Look at my profile pic. The black dog is a lab/rottie mix and 8 months old. The JRT is 8 months old and the two collies are both adults. They get along perfectly.    You are right to be doing your research, but so long as you know that your pit bull is good with other dogs and you handle the initial introduction and first few days well and carefully, you should be fine.    Dogs are dogs, I bring many different breeds and ages of dogs with all sorts of behavioral problems into my home for rehabilitation with my pack. You just need to be vigilant, experienced and unless there is sign of aggression, let them sort themselves out.    All too often, people get too involved and create problems. Just have your dog on a lead, bring the new dog in and providing there is no silly behavior, continue to let them get closer, sniff each other and take it slowly.    Good luck!|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	As long as you are 100% positive that your APBT won't have animal aggression issues with another dog, there's no reason not to get one if you are ready for one. All properly socialized dogs love a playmate! I've never had issues with any of my dogs, and I've had every imaginable size dog. I've had GSD/wolf hybrid and a papillion in the same household and they were best friends. And all of my pits love their brothers and sisters! They were all properly trained and socialized from a young age.  When you introduce them, make sure you do it slowly and gradually so as not to overwhelm or confuse either of them, and for the first couple weeks, monitor them very closely and keep them seperate while you are gone, just to be sure.  Good luck!|`|NJ9dmMUMaa	I think you should buy another one because since your first dog is kind to other dogs but you don't have to!|`|rVHdiaMdaa	I have a German Shepherd and a Cavalier. When we welcomed the smaller one into our family, the shepherd ignored her for a little while. Make sure you spend a lot of time with each of them, so neither gets jealous. My dogs love each others company now, and the shepherd has mothered our puppy so much! I really recommend big and small together. That way there's less of a chance of them being aggressive together. Good luck!!|`|W0buucLsaa	I've had experience in this. I've had a household mix of two 60-pounders and two 18-pounders. They got along pretty well. The only one that had problems was the crotchety old lhaso apso; he would occasionally growl or snap when one of the big ones would back into him or whatever, but the big ones just ignored him.     Generally I think the main thing you have to worry about with two dogs of drastically different size is how conscientious the big dog is about his size and where he puts his body. I do have one obnoxious biggish dog that just doesn't pay attention; she sits on other dogs' faces and uses them as mattresses. That's not an aggression issue, it's a sensitivity issue.     In my experience (which is a bit different cause the little ones are much older) dogs of very different sizes are more likely than not to just ignore each other most of the time. They aren't as likely to play and roughhouse. That could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it.

o9dMd2rBaa	You are quite misinformed    Snake Head dominate the native fish populations (well depending on which state you are talking, but it does for most states). They eat up the fish in the lakes. Once all of the fish get eaten up, they sliver as a snake does on the ground! and travel to the next body of water where they spread their chaos to that body of water    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPGmvemG6... This video says it all|`|a2cjwMKcaa	They totally disrupt the food chain and could potentially drive local fish species into extinction.    It's not allways about the place in the food chain, they may simply displace a local species by eating all their food or young.    They may not affect the Bass directly, but if they wipe out the small fish that Bass eat, the Bass may die out?    Introducing an exotic species can totally disrupt local fish populations and wipe out local species - thats the problem. Rare endangered species dont just live in exotic far away places, they could be in your local pond too.    Ian|`|Jtd7kXQSaa	Ok here is the thing. The snakehead can and will eat any fish that it can fit into its mouth. Or even take a bight out of. These fish are not native to us waters. Along with many other fish here in the us. This causes a big problem with the natural food chain. Look at it this way. If I took my 13inch electric catfish and put her into my African tank. She would kill and eat every thing in it. She does not know any better that is what she does. It is not the fish's fault it is the way it is. It is irresponsible people that release these fish into their local water ways. In NC where I live there is a big lack called Lake Hyco. This lake has a nuclear power plant on it. The plant keeps the water very warm all year. I have seen people catch huge oscars and pacus out of this lake.   Take the tilapia. They are every where in Hyco lake. They are considered an invasive species.  all the way to the bottom of this one  http://www.mhaze.net/blog/2008/07/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilapia    http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquat...    the bowfin  http://wdfw.wa.gov/fish/ans/identify/htm...  Now these are a native fish. Read a little about them. They are not snakeheads, but it does make you think. And if you ever catch one then you know why they are diss liked. Big teeth and powerfull jaws.

When your filter died all the good bacteria within it that kept your tank cycled, died too. Your tank is going back through the nitrogen cycle.

I chucked out anything that was covered in the green slime and completely cleaned and dried the tank before filling back up again. I had to remove every trace of bacteria.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	It seems that sitting causes your dog some pain.  Have you had him to the vet to have his knees checked?   I would do that because he seems happy to please you with all commands other than sit.   It seems it's not a behavioural issue but a physical one.    BTW I agree with you about the 'I don't know' replies.  What a waste of space and not very smart.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Unfortunately rescued dogs do come with 'baggage'.  I'd say something has happened to this lad in his past.  Could be you need to rule out something physical with him however.  His hips may hurt - does he sit when you haven't asked him to?  It could also be something in the way you are trying to make him sit that either hurts, or reminds him of something that happened in his past.    My sister's rescue is terrified of going into a car - she's better once in, but if you go near a car (to put her in) with her, she freaks.  This isn't down to anything my sister has done with her - she was like it from day one.  And it's proving almost impossible to 'cure'.    At the end of the day, this little lad doesn't really need to have to sit on command, does he?   Perhaps this is something you will just have to let go.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Perhaps try using a different cue that sounds nothing like the word "sit" and see if that makes any difference. It can be any cue you choose, from "butt on the floor!" to "pickle."     When you practice it, don't do it randomly during the day, try practicing this command when he's sort of already in "command" mode. For instance, when he's automatically responding to other commands like down and shake paw, toss it in the middle of the session. He might be less likely to react if he's already in the right mindset to obey.    What someone else mentioned, rewarding him when he sits on his own, is called shaping a behavior. You can shape any behavior, from putting a basketball through a hoop to behaving in a relaxed manner. It's a method often used in clicker training. A clicker is a little device that makes a distinctive clicking sound when you depress the metal tongue, and it's used to mark an exact behavior. For example, the second his bottom touches the floor, you'd click to mark the sitting behavior. If you're going to try that, you might want to try using the clicker, too. You can get one at most pet stores.  http://www.clickertraining.com/whatis  http://www.clickertraining.com/node/1135    If you change the command word, this won't really matter, but try not to repeat the cue a bunch of times. It just makes it completely ineffective because if the dog doesn't listen the first time, he doesn't have to listen the 32nd time, either. Try to only say it once, firmly, at a time you're pretty sure you can get the dog to listen. That's another part of shaping a behavior; first you get the behavior of sitting, and once you reliably have that, *then* you can put a name to it once you know he'll actually do it.    I guess you can be glad that he does run to you for protection when your fiance gives the command, at least, instead of hiding somewhere else again.     This won't necessarily change anything, but you might want to experiment with new treats, too. If you try different things, you might find something that he really can't resist. Some common suggestions include chicken, cheese and hot dog.    Working a trainer privately is a good idea. Obviously, if he's so very traumatized, you can't just plunk him down in a setting full of dogs. A qualified, patient trainer may help you conquer his phobia.    Good luck!      EDIT: Also, if you had a physical cue that went along with the verbal "sit," change that, too. It might have been a small cue you just give naturally, like putting your hand palm-down.|`|dqCzNNYpaa	Thats very strange that he's afraid of sitting. It is possible that something happened at the puppy mill. He might just have a problem with sitting, i doubt its your fault. Try not training him for a day then the next take it very slow.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I'd say that he associates the command to sit with something bad.  Maybe, before you got him, he was told to sit and then kicked or otherwise abused.  He's definitely sounds afraid of it.  It's really sad what has happened to some dogs you get from the shelter and can take a lot of work to reassure your dog and show him that there is nothing to fear from you.    Don't push too hard on the sit command.  Maybe you could try just waiting for your dog to sit on its on accord, then say sit and give a treat and pats straight away.  If you do this for a while your dog will learn that the word and his action are associated but you didn't force the issue.  As your dog gets more confident with the word you can start using it as a command, still with the instant reward.  If your dog runs off scared don't follow it - you are reinforcing negative behaviour.  Your dog will come out of hiding eventually (it will want o eat at some time).  By making a fuss everytime it gets scared and runs away it is learning that you will give extra attention.    Just take thing s slowly, don't force the issue and your dog will get used to the command and learn that you will not hurt it.    Good luck...|`|peQIh3Pgaa	yeah the poor little guy.... it sounds like they used to beat him when he wouldn't do as they say at the puppymill. Or Sit might be another word in another language that the puppymillers spoke, which meant something awful. Stop asking him to sit. Just let it go. Not every dog has to sit or do tricks.|`|D3ZCZPYuaa	i really don't know what's wrong with him|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	It could be that someone had tried training him when he was at the puppy mill, and he didn't pick it up quick enough for the monster that was running the mill so he was harshly punished. I've heard of this happening before. All I can say is maybe try another command, he may associate the word 'sit' with negativity. One of my rescue dogs was terribly smart, but was abused as a puppy, so the words 'down' and 'come' for some reason scared the hell out of him. We used 'lay' instead of down, and 'here' instead of come. For sit, you could use 'down' or 'seat.' A friend of mine taught her dog to sit in a chair, and the command is 'chair' and she'll run and jump on the nearest furniture, so even though you may not want her to sit on a chair, that kinda has an association with sitting, ya know?  Also, change the intonation of your voice so there are no traces of harshness whatsoever.  Another thing it could very well be is that it hurts him when he sits. He may have a hip problem or something. He's very young but it's possible. Have a vet check him out to rule out health issues.   Good luck!|`|HpvyeQgDaa	I would visit a vet, Then after that I would join classes this may encourage him, and also you would have the aid of a professional trainer that would have more clue as to what is happening.  When in doubt get the advice of a professional.  Things will work out everything takes time :0)  keep your head up the fact that you have come on here for advice shows your really care about your fur baby.

The injections might have been banamine, which is given to horses who are colicing.|`|ndqjst7taa	As the  to Question   2 We had a horse that had the same thing, and   our vet said that our horse Eastern  Encephalitis this is cause from Moskuaioa. This was highly contagious, you can prevent this from with a vaccine. Our horse survived. I suggest you have your vet give your horse injections of B 12 , an Vitamaster. Sorry about the spelling  Our  horse is a belgian, he is now 20 years old|`|ZBMm4wJnaa	1st-  Since there was a law already on the books, you probably are not going to win BUT you could try working out an arrangement for some riding time on the beach during specific hours if your group is willing to keep the area clean.      2.  This definitely sounds neurologic.  I would have your vet out again or another (second opinion) to check for EPM, EEE (Eastern Encephalytis, Western Encephlalytis, Rabies, West Nile, EHV-neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus).   There are tests for all of these, except Rabies requires of course putting your horse down.   I don't know where you live (US or not) but these are the things my husband would test for immediately (of course except rabies unless there were definite signs of that).  I would get another opinion.  There are possible treatment options out there.  There have been a lot of documented cases of these diseases in the last year because people can't afford to feed their horses right now much less have the vet vaccinate them.|`|nKwcGLQraa	question one:  well, you should first ask them to write 15 good reasons why you guys should not be able to ride there, since the beach is a public place and technically you are "public too". I understand if they dont want you riding there whn there are a bunch of people, but how about if they could give you permision to ride there early in the mornings (before 8-9 am) and later afternoon (after 5-6 pm). negotiating is what you gotta do!    question 2:  i actaully dont know. But it might be something with the heart. Ive heard of people having horses with really weird mixed symptoms that nobody could figure out, and it turned out to be something wrong with the heart. he could also be missing importand nutrients? like with the muscle spasms and stuff, or he could be dehydrated which can affect the balance.|`|AA10986942	1st question-  sorry for your luck but people dont like horse poop on the beach so you will probably lose that one  2 nd question - Did your vet consider EPM?|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Question 1.  I would ask the council why they suddenly deem horses not members of the public.    State that the sand  and water is therapeutic for horse's legs and feet.  Plead with them and ask that maybe a part of the beach can be set aside for horses or ask them for certain times of the day like when there is no tourists.  Say very early in the morning or after 7,30 at night in summer time - giving you plenty of daylight to get to and from the beach.    As for this staggering, it could be a brain tumour or epilepsy.  I have seen horses with both.  Unfortunately the brain tumour one died but the one with epilepsy was retired and could not be reliably ridden.    Could it be that the horse has laminitis and a long curly coat even in summer?  Reason I asked this is because I am also thinking Cushings Disease - a tumour on the pituatry gland.  I would try the brain scan if you are prepared for the cost or are well insured.  Cushings can be treated and controlled with drugs, but eventually it does finish them with collapse - but not fits like yours.    Just re read the blurb and the condition mentioned is encephalitis - meaning inflammation of the brain.  I personally have not seen it in horses.  (syphillis is an STD!  Mad king George had it!)|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Question One:  Unless you can sway the majority of the voting population in favor of horses, there's not much you can do.

Politics always wins over and you are left looking like a dope.  Way to go is propose a compromise based on many years of usage, possibly even attempting to off fer horse riding rental for the "bathers".  Compromise, compromise, compromise, you may just get a piece of it to keep.    2/  Sick horse:  About 20 yrs ago, we were running about 100 head of brood mares, so it could have been likely that we may have missed one going through the chute with the sleeping sickness shot...but one of our calm, broke broodmares began showing the symptoms that you described.  She was so aggressive that she would rush you when you entered the stall.  We had to let her drag a lead rope and get the end of it and dally to the side of the stall to have the vet examine her.  He finally diagnosed her with sleeping sickness and along with the other injections, instructed us to keep her tranked with Ace (before other stuff came on the market) and believe it or not, she made it and continued to produce beautiful foals...although no one was ever game to ride her again as we didn't feel that she was ever "right" after her ordeal.
edLbogmYaa	Hi! Yes it is completely normal I have a rabbit that is the same color as yours. Over the summer he looks light brown but in the winter he's like a weird grayish color. Don't be worried, it is just the undercoat when he sheds.  My bunny is brown on his back and neck right now and gray everywhere else.  He looks a little silly.. But don't be worried it's completely normal.|`|cZCaHWhOaa	It could be his undercoat. Most animals have an undercoat which is a different color. When they shed you are able to see the undercoat easier.

She at 1st didn't want to either but what I did was take treats on our walks and every time she took a few steps , I gave her a treat and praised her .

Don't worry, if you keep working her, she will start to understand that she needs to follow your commands. also, about the barking problem, she either is barking to "talk" to you, or she's just excited|`|lyocWukKaa	When you take her out. Take a few steps forward and wait for her to move forward to you.  Keep repeating this.  Pulling her will not get you anywhere.  Be patient.  It will be slow going at first but she will get the hang of it.|`|49IbcrLaaa	For the walking on a leash walk a little ways & give her a treat & continue until she is confident enough to go further on her own without the treats. She is probably just really scared because the world looks so big from her eyes.When she barks she is playing.

They don't malt (loose hair) if they are pure bread.You may find a  few bits of hair around the house when pup has been itching a bit. All dogs have this though.        T hey are good for people with allergies.       We have a lot of fun with our Bailey.He loves to play with the kids,and he loves to snuggle up on my lap during the night. They are great indoor dogs.     But be prepared for a lot of caregiving. You have to groom a lot to keep hair in top condition. shaving is essential at least twice a year. Regular bathing is needed to keep them looking and smelling fresh.      Cleaning theire face weekly is best for weeping eyes, which is another common trait of the breed.

Fleas require specific chemicals.    Get your treatment from a vets. You need a proper spot-on for all of your animals - Frontline Plus, Stronghold or Advocate. Do not confuse these with store-bought spot-ons, they are not the same chemicals. You will also certainly need a decent spray for your house.

ak9DrBSwaa	1. Apart from the syrian (??? Syrians aren't a dwarf breed!) what is a Nice dwarf breed that really (?? do you mean rarely???) bites and is calm.    http://www.hamsterific.com/hamsters.cfm  Look up "Types of Hamsters"; they have a comparison chart of the different dwarf breeds that can help you select the one that's best for you.    Dwarfs should live in same sex pairs or trios and you REALLY should have a bin cage for them or a 20 gallon long or larger aquarium to house them in.    I really like Campbells, friendly, easily handled (I have kids ages 5-10 who do) and a great beginner dwarf hamster.  If this is your first hamster I'd avoid robos (small,  fast, hard to hold for the inexpierenced) and chinese (easily stressed by change), although that's not as much of a concern as if you were a little kid.    Anyone with little kids who has never had hamsters before, a single syrian is a great choice and their larger size is better for small kids.    Edit: ignore the first poster - just some of the falacies she posted corrected:    "owned many, many different breeds" - there's only FIVE hamster types available in the pet trade - Syrian, Chinese, Robovorski, Campbell's & Winter Whites - everything else is simply a gimmicky nickname the pet store uses to charge higher prices for a particular colour or hair length.    "control food portions" - in an animal whose name means "to horde" - restricting their ability to store seeds and pellets will simply stress them    Golden OR Teddy Bear? - umm those are the same species - "golden" is what the common species name was when first introduced, later that was changed to Syrian. TeddyBear is a long haired Syrian.    On "dwarfs being difficult to keep alive" - NOT AT ALL TRUE - unless you have some underlying genetic disorder or poor living conditions this is silly. With proper care, there is no reason why a dwarf hamster won't live out it's normal lifespan.    Siberian dwarfs are hateful  - "siberian dwarf" probably refers to a Campbells or Winter White - they are so closely related they were once thought to be the same species. Umm, my FIVE year old regularly holds the 20+ Campbells we have without ever getting bit.|`|XrMMH5tZaa	i have 2 russian dwarf and a syrian    the dwarfs nibble as play, and one actually licks your lips when u do kissy faces in front of him  ahahha    idk why he does it but hes my little turd lol    russians arent all bad  when u go to the pet store take ur time  have the worker put thr cage on the ground and do tests to see which r friendliest, nicest, not too wild ect    mine were nice and lovable brothers so i said those r the ones     good luck|`|JmD0oq2Naa	ive got a russian dwarf hamster. he is really cute, but he does bite. i have to wear gloves to hold him. he is blind in 1 eye now and he is nearly 3 years old|`|2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	As a person who has owned many, many different breeds of hamsters, I can tell you that dwarf hamsters are very difficult to keep alive.  Siberian Dwarfs are hateful.  You will never be able to hold it.  The Chinese Dwarfs are very, very sweet but again, they are very difficult to keep alive.  Their metabolism is very hard to control, unlike the Goldens or Teddy Bears, you have to vary their diets and control food portions.  Going with a Golden or T.B. is a way better bet.  They are sweet and easy to care for.  They also can be trained to ride in a shirt pocket, etc, which makes them kind of fun.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Hi!  I'd look into a campbells dwarf.  They are lovely.  Chinese hamsters are cute too.  Both are available at pets at home.    However, just a word of warning, when you go into pets at home, you may notice the really cute Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters.  They are fun to watch, but very difficult to handle.  They advertise for them to be sold in groups, but most people I know who have kept them had them eventually split up (myself included). 2 of my robos randomly  had a fight and one absolutely battered the other (at night so i didnt see til morning) and he had to have his back leg removed at the vets.    Robos are lovely though, and rarely bite-i have been bitten twice, but when i was attempting to give the one legged one his anti biotics.  It didnt hurt.  Of course, if you really want one, dont be persuaded otherwise, but its just something to bear in mind. They are lovely animals, and my remaining robo is still fun, a bit mental, and occasionally lets me hold him.  But hes a bugger to catch when he escapes.      A good place to go online is www.hamstercentral.com and go to the forums.  There is pretty much all the information you could ask for in one place, and you can talk to like minded hamster owners.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	I used to have a roborovski hamster, they are perfect.|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	I've owned syrian, chinese, and roborovski hamsters.    The syrians been the most easiest to tame/handle - but when they bite, they really draw blood.    Chinese I never knew to have ever bit me - I had these ones when I was about 12 (now 19) so can't really remember tooo much about them - but I know I was able to hold them and they never bit me.    Roborovski's - they dont like being handled so are VERY hard to tame to hold - but are very approachable to you - and are quiet content to be in their cage or in their balls, or a playpen (be carefull with playpens as if they get scared - they do get through the bars!)        Dwarfs like to be kept in twos or more (of the same sex!), and syrians on their own, so it depends how many you want.        Hamster care is generally really easy, feed them often, change their water, and clean them out every week. They love to climb on toys, so make sure the cage is big enough for them (dwarfs cant have bars) for them to have toys in there, and something to chew.        Syrians are prone to wet tail though, which dwarfs rarely get, so for the health side of things, I prefer dwarfs (being my chinese lived for 5 healthy yrs). If you want a syrian, learn the signs of wet tail and take them to vet immediatly (pricy I know - but they're worth it arnt they?) as they can survive (mine unfortunatly didnt, but atleast had medication to make it not as bad until we put her to sleep, aged 2).        I absolutly love my Roborovski hamsters, they suit my lifestyle as I can't let them out everyday to handle (like my syrian) and they're the ones happy not to come out.    If you want one to handle the best is the syrian hamster which wont bite once it knows you which is a very quick process, and loves to be handled and is very calm.    For dwarfs, out of the ones I've had chinese would be best if you want a hamster to be able to hold - but there are the russian as well - but I cant really tell you much about them...|`|VzOFreIDaa	Hi there. Well i have a syrian hamster and a couple of weeks ago i looked after my friends dwarf hamster for the weekend and I realized a few things. Dwarf hamsters are very cute and have small cages but I found that they are just so so small they are extremely hard to physically handle and play with. Mainly because the are alot faster than normal pet hamsters and with their speed combined with there small size and agility, they can be a nightmare to stop running away when on your lap etc . Also you could easily hurt them accidentally because of their such tiny body's.  With a syrian hamster, they are generally quite slow and easier to handle but most of all, I think you will probably be able 2 become better friends with a syrian cus their easier to get close to physically and affectionately|`|QL3prjHyaa	They are very very very very fast if they  get out of there cages and love to find ways out.So no habatrails.Metal or glass cages Only with glass you have to weight the top down.they love sm run balls so they can be out and about with you.They love to clime and can jump about 5 feet straight up.Don't give them very much fresh  food or they can get cheek infections in there pouches.They are most active at night. and are farly easy to hand tame as long as you are slow and gentle.last but not least they live 2 to 5 years.  mines name is gizzmo.
4Sf8hgy3aa	Any age past approximately 8-10 weeks is safe. However, the longer you wait, the higher the chances of complication. Get it done as soon as possible, and if your dog is already older, make sure you discuss it with your vet, becuase regardless of the risks it needs to be done for your dog's health, and for society's health. I know I don't need to tell you this but under-funded shelters are killing thousands of animals as I type this.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	It's recommended to get your Doberman puppy neutered around 5-6 months of age. Later than that, and it may be more painful. And like other previous answers said; yes, you can get him neutered as an adult, but that will be extremely painful. Some people decide to go through with it regardless, because they don't want any more puppies and that's the only way to prevent more litters.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	First off, you don't have to neuter your dobie as long as he is good tempered and does not go outside without you.  That being said, if you are not going to breed him (and unless you are showing him and he is doing really well, I would not breed him), I would wait until he is at least a year old.  There is new research showing that waiting until the large breed dogs are adults will protect them from some joint disease and newer research showing a decrease in the chance for bone cancer if you wait until they are 1-2 years.  This is as long as he is not showing aggression or dominance issues.  If this is the case, he needs to be neutered sooner.  Other things that neutering will decrease is prostatic hyperplasia and perianal adenomas.    Contrast this with the female.  Spaying before the first heat cycle will decrease the chance for mammary carcinoma by 80%.  Spaying before the second heat cycle will decrease it by less but will still decrease it.  After that, spaying is still important because it will decrease the chance for pyometra (stump pyos can still happen if ovarian tissue is left).  It also makes her unable to contribute to over population.|`|CzWvNQxMaa	You can get them whenever but It really is suppose to be around 6 months any earlier they have a high risk of getting cancer.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Lol...I was going to say exactly what "Just Kiddong" said. But legit, you can get them neutered anytime after 8 weeks. There is no limit unless you have an unhealthy dog which would be determined by your vet.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	As old as the vet feels it is safe to do.  Can be any age past 8wks|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	the day before he could die|`|RFfTjnxzaa	What "Just Kiddong" said.|`|W02kTOqmaa	As long as he's not dead, he can be neutered. Although if he was really old or sick, a vet might hold off. Going under for surgery can be very stressful to a dog, so if it would compromise his health, the vet would wait until he was healthier.|`|lmSffrNuaa	A male dog can be neutered any time after eight weeks of age. A few years ago, most veterinarians advised waiting until puberty hit at about six months, and some still make that recommendation. Talk to your vet about what's best for your dog.

Ik6WOcw3aa	If it causes them pain, they will move away from it. But heaters shouldnt be able to get that hot. As long as the heater you have is rated for your tank, youll be fine.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	the heater doesn't really get that hot as it's surounded by tank water that conducts the heat away.    The only fish that seem to get burnt are big lazy plecos that try to hide behind the heater and stay in contact with it for a long time.    Normal fish just swim away.    Ian|`|AraBfesHaa	I'm sure they can sense heat.  When my tanks get a little too cold to their liking, they will all go hang out around the heater trying to get warm, so they know where it is at least, and the only way they would know that is by sensing the heat coming from it.
B6zl0AJDaa	Actually a WIDE tree is what you need!  I've used my old siegfried (Stubben) on a LOT of Arabs and because it's a wide tree, NEVER had an issue (It also has sat on a LOT of TBs, QHs and one lonely little Azteca.).|`|AA11164698	if you go to http://www.easychangegulletsystem.com/ and click on Easy-measure gullet gauge and then try and find one at your local tack store its easy to use to find a gullet size and even if you don't get a wintec/bates saddle with their easy change gullet system you should be able to find the size.    im sorry if this doesn't make sense its been almost 2 weeks above 35*c or 95*F and im tired and hot.... and im probs not making any sense|`|OjeL1if4aa	I don't know about converting sizes... I ALWAYS try saddles on to be sure they fit... reguarless of sizing.    If he's an arab and has high withers... chances are he's going to need a narrow or regular size tree. Go to some local tack shops and ask for some test saddles to figure out which fits best then go from there.|`|nKwcGLQraa	well, since western saddles and english saddles are build so differently, its practically impossible to "convert" the size.  you gotta go to the store and borrow a few saddles home to see how they fit. also in, most stores they offer to help take measurments of your horse to see what size should fit.  good luck :).
041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Can a dog be gay hum.....let me se now I know they will hump your leg and if a male human gets on all fours if the dog is in heat will try to hump him. Gay no I think it is more Instinct, as for as humping other male dog no. And as for as sniffing other dogs butts ask a vet they would know.  Can and do dog have emotions yes to and extent do like you and I do but yes dog have emotions.  They can grieve feel sadness love but not in the sense you and I do..  Can a dog feel happy excited yes  but again it is not the sae as you and I feel happiness.  And I no dog lover I seen dogs hump pillow trees any thing that won't move that just makes them a dog.  Animals go on Instinct and the need to survive when it comes to sex or matting animals do not know right from wrong  good from evil.  If a male dog sniff another male butt are licks it penis it is more like establishing who the dominate male is.  Male animale will sometimes fight to to death over the female, so not I really dough that they can be gay, that is a human thing and it is by choose mostly, Now in some rare case the individual may be born with female tendencies but for the most part in a human it is by choice.  But in a dog all they know is it is just something to hump.|`|kHxqPIGeaa	Not really sure about the hole " gay" thing, but I have a female Jack Russell and she tries to hump our bigger female dog, not all the time but once in a while. My girls say she's lesbian. lol !!! Sorry I wasn't of any help.|`|eu6UQElYaa	No.  Dogs aren't people.  They don't form sexual "relationships".  They mate and that's it.   They have sex based off of hormones and instictual drives, not based off of attraction.   So, a male dog will mate when a female is in heat because they are biologically programmed to do so.  They don't have a "gender preference".  Many times you will see a male dog "humping" another male or a female "humping" another female.  But that is about dominance, not sexual pleasure or attraction.|`|W0buucLsaa	No. Human sexuality is a lot more complex than almost any other animals'. (Dolphins and other primates may be exceptions.) Our sex drive and our higher brain functions are linked, as are a plethora of different hormones and environmental factors. We're CHOOSY over who we mate with. Dogs aren't.    Dogs just have sex out of instinct. Humans can have sex for a huge variety of reasons - love, to have babies, power, money, control, ego, etc. Lust is only a part of why we have sex, and human relationships and sex are intertwined. Dogs aren't like that.     I'd say a dog's relationship with humans or other dogs is way more complex than dogs' sexual behavior.|`|cusngBDQaa	yes, they have emotions like us.     they also have dog language.    that we don't understand.    like they don't udnerstand what we say .     we're probably talking jibberish to them while we just thinking they're barking mad :D|`|XVVkrlnTaa	No I don't think dogs can be gay. They go on instinct. No they don't think like humans do. You don't get exited when someone throws a ball at you and say "fetch". But they do have emotions. They also pick up on all human emotions.|`|qS4EG5qYaa	not sure  even though guy dogs somtimes hump each other    my aunties dog is ''gay'' lol they dyed it pink.............|`|33PwXUblaa	that just.....um....let's see......ummmmmm.......                  GAY? LOL|`|SYGGh9Jdaa	No, and anybody who tells you otherwise is a zoophile, furry or with greenpeace. Dogs may display such behavior as skronking(Humping) another male dog or licking their penis. This is Dominance behavior. Dogs do not have the mental capacity to know what "Love" is, they follow instinct|`|2jMFurDoaa	it possible but my dog humps everything... males females pillows lol|`|gKMQeSHSaa	No.
07YBD5mJaa	try a water gun, this shocks him but wont hurt him. we use it with our cat, and it works every time. they stop in their tracks to figure out what just happened! you can also try a whistle, it gets their attention so they know they have done something wrong. pets mart sells the "clicker" that they promote when you sign up for their pet training class, it's pretty cheap, 10 bucks or so. but it works as a whistle would, and it has proven to be very effective. Good luck!|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	He doesn't need to relax, he needs to be put in place and I say this in a constructive, not negative way.    The fact that he's managed to overcome your older, large dog means that you are very lucky in having the pleasure of a good, balanced and naturally submissive dog. I am guessing you've had little or no problems with him.    With your puppy, you have some dominance issues that need to be kept under control from this day on to prevent them escalating.    Your questions doesn't mention how old your pup is, but I would get him into regular puppy classes or training classes to make sure he is kept well socialized. Also, if you want to email me, I can send you my client info pack (by email) which will give you detailed information on a dogs psychology and what they need in order to live balanced, happy lives. It would be useful to know the breed of your puppy. This does not determine behavior, but would allow me to tailor games for you and him that will allow him to fulfill his natural need to work, whether that be to hunt, retrieve, herd etc.     To start with the food, you need to make sure you have plenty of time for this exercise and bucket loads of patience. You need to have your puppy on a lead so that you can control him easily without you getting frustrated or him being allowed to run away.     Have one person handle the puppy and the other person bring in the food for both dogs. The very moment the puppy starts to jump about and act up with the food coming, you should make a short sharp sound like AH or SHHHT and if necessary, back this up with an equally quick "check" on the lead. To do this, the lead should be slack, but not long. The moment the puppy tries to move away, jump about etc, pull quickly on the lead, but I stress.....not too hard. You don't want to yank or jerk his neck. You just want him to feel the correction from your hand and voice to snap him out of the behavior. When he's calm, put the older dogs food down. Again, correct any unwanted behavior here and when he's calmed again, put his food down. The dogs should be in the same room and close, but not next to each other and you and your partner need to stay calm, consistent and confident all the time. Don't talk to the puppy, stroke him or fuss him at all. You will be teaching him a valuable lesson and will need to continue with this every feed until the puppy no longer reacts in the way you describe above.   You can use this technique to make sure your puppy is calm before walks, when visitors come and when he has a negative Reaction to anything (apart from fear reactions).    Good luck and email me if you want that pack, but I'll say it again, get in puppy classes and training classes and they will help an enormous amount.|`|dqCzNNYpaa	You should point at his head and make a loud noise that sounds like "psst." It works on my dog and he will usually lay down if he is acting bad. Water guns worked very well when i was training my dog as well.
RXI8ImdIaa	Oh yeah. They are super contagious.    You will need to treat all of the cats simultaneously in order to really get rid of it.    Have fun giving ear drops to 4 cats. LOL    been there.|`|z5GwTXx6aa	Yes, you may need to treat all the animals in your house**|`|87Zhgwmcaa	Yes. Ear mites can be passed on to your other cats. A product that worked for me was Mita Clear. Of course, I took my cat to the vet, but the product is being sold online and you can get it cheaper this way. Good Luck.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Yes, they are really contagious. Take all your kitties when you go.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	yes,hun.  They sure can.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	Yes actually they are very contagious. You can clean out their ears for now wtb cotton swabs and qtips. I usually lightly dab it with peroxide or get and animal ear cleanser. This will make it less likely that they will spread it or that it will get worse. Be careful and don't go to deep. I you are scared just use the cotton balls.|`|y56BkEcMaa	yep, its like lice, little "bugs"
kkYOhDSLaa	Firstly, At One year old he is still very much a puppy & has just started the teenage years for dogs, so he is full of energy. Dalmatians, as a breed, require about an hours walk/ run a day, especially if confined to a small yard all day. You an try using a Haulty or Gentle Leader when taking him for walks, these go over the head & provides the owner with much better control, it uses the same concept as the Bridle on a horse.    Secondly, Is he desexed?? The first thing I would advise if he is not, is to do so asap. Male dogs, especially, are a lot harder to handle & control when they are entire, all the raging hormones. He & your family will be a lot happy if he is neutered.  Thirdly, Dalmatians are a very smart breed, sometimes too much for their own good but they are easy to train, as they love food, & are fast learners. You'll need to teach him you're the boss, not him, don't let him nibble on your hand, when he gets julius egnore him & walk away, when he is calm then give him attention, it's all about you being the boss not him & you letting him get away with these thing reinforces the behaviour. Taking him to an odebience class, individual or group classes are up to you, but he would really benefit from the socialisation.  Fourthly, Food. Puppy's can eat up to & even more then twice what they would as an adult. How come it takes you hour to cook his food. A good brand of dog food, dry & tin, with some rice or pasta & a couple of lamb flaps, or half a chicken carcase is all he will need, and wont take forever to prepare.       If you would like some more information or help with his training, you can send me an email privately.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Have you had the dog checked out for deafness?  Alot of Dalmations suffer from it unfortunately, and that maybe why hes ignoring you! If he is deaf you can buy special dalmation whistles, which only the dalmation can hear, that way you can train the dog.  I also recommend dog behaviourists, I took my doberman to 1 and they are good but expensive.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	He's absolutely bursting with pent-up energy. You should not have gotten a high energy breed if you couldn't provide the exercise. You don't have a fenced backyard? You don't know anyone with a fenced backyard, or a fenced field? He needs to get his energy out. He needs to run around like a maniac, play fetch, soccer, whatever.    You need to teach him how to walk on the leash.   http://searchwarp.com/swa295322.htm    Consider buying a tool like an Easy Walk Harness. It won't magically fix the problem, but it should help. I, a completely unathletic teenage girl, can restrain my 150-pound Mastiff puppy using this harness.  http://www.puplife.com/Shop/Control/Prod...    He requires the training that he should have been receiving since eight weeks of age. You will need to teach him how to behave with other dogs by bringing him to as many training classes as necessary. Keep your eye out for "Rowdy Rover" type classes, which cater to "crazy" dogs. Use Google to find training facilities in your area.    Dogs need a lot of food, especially puppies -- which he is. He is a puppy, and technically will be for another good year or so. So, if cooking for him is a bother, why on earth don't you just feed him dog food?    An article that should help:  http://www.clickertraining.com/node/1721    Also, stimulate him with interactive toys like Kongs and Buster Cubes.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	We had a dalmatian for 13 years.  Up until she passed, she was the most hyperactive dog you have ever seen.  Dalmatians need lots of exercise.  We use to attempt to take her for a walk, however, she would end up dragging us down the road.  My husband was the only one that could handle our dog, too.  Our dog was also very skiddish around visitors and very protective of our family.  The vet said she was dangerous to others.  We kept her in the back yard on a running cable, but warned everyone not to get near her or they would get nipped.  A great guard dog!  I'm simply gonna tell you they are hard to handle.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	This dog is running wild, you need to either get a private trainer in to show you how to train your dog or enrol in a local obedience class.
AA11457471	Small breeds have a tendency to have anal gland issues. It can be very uncomfortable for them when the glands are full & they can't get them to empty.   This is also very easy for the vet to solve : )|`|X7i59NeIaa	I think your dog has a bad case of worms. That will cause the behavior you describe. I'm sure your vet will give you something to take care of the problem. Good luck.|`|TEucykbZaa	Your dog could have worms just as he said. But it could also be that you are not yet attached enough to him so he does not feel any love so he might give up on stuff he is trying to do because he feels like he doesn't impress anyone by what he does. Try to care more for him maybe. If this doesn't work he could have worms, but that is curable all you need to do is ask the doctor for medication.|`|2Om1LosMaa	Sounds like worms. A can of sardines is a great alternative to meds. But do something soon.

Oleander is highly toxic to cats and can cause severe kidney failure even if it's a small amount she has eaten.  Read this online.  Also the chronic cough could be allergies or more severe make sure she gets plenty of fluids just in case she has ingested the oleander plant.  It will help get it out of her system.|`|cpfwyFo7aa	keep the kiitten inside for a while and see if it continues caughing, then see if the problem is the plant, because if the kitten isnt vacinated it might just be having problems with the plant. or even if its vacinated it might just be too small for the outside, it all depends on the weather too, hope this helps and your kitty to get better :)|`|LVPYnB6gaa	I'm not sure about the orleander but the oleander is actually a toxic plant for cats.

W0buucLsaa	I tend to prefer large breeds, BUT...    For me, it's not so much the size of the dog as the usefulness of the dog. Most small dogs are companion animals and aren't bred for a particular purpose. Those I'm not a huge fan of. But some are. Dachshunds, for example, are awesome little guys. When bred properly, they are hardcore, fearless, big dogs in little dog clothing THAT CAN KILL OPPOSUMS THEIR OWN SIZE. Total pains in the butt, but one of my top 3 favorite dog breeds.    A few large breeds have no jobs that they do, and those I am not very fond of either. But the huge majority of big dogs were bred for a particular job.     Medium-sized dogs are about half and half, I think. The Puli is an amazing animal - one of the best herding dogs, they manage flocks of 400 (!) sheep. And they weigh 30 pounds! I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to have a Puli one day - once I'm like, retired, and have an hour each day to spend on a dog's coat, I'm sure I'll adopt a Puli or a Puli mix.|`|cZCaHWhOaa	I personally love larger breed dogs. I like how you can be rough with a larger breed dog without hurting it. I do not care for animals that are fragile. I enjoy a dog that can ride in the back of my truck to the mountains and have some good ol' fun without getting scared or needing to be pampered.|`|W02kTOqmaa	I like large breeds.     It's hard for me to explain WHY I like them with out bashing, so PLEASE forgive me.    I personally feel that small breeds are a waste of time. IMHO (and keep in mind that I really don't like dogs in general, and I'm more of a cat person) if you are going to get a small dog, get a cat instead. If you are going to get a dog, get a REAL dog    Most of my bad feelings towards small dogs are because a lot of idiots out there get them because they are "cute", and then they treat them like dolls or babies, and never train them properly! 90% of small dogs I meet aren't trained and are annoying as all get out. The few small dogs I meet that are trained are great, and very cute and fun to be around. So I don't completely dislike them. I just dis-like the majority of people the poor things end up with.    I also like the feeling I get having two huge shepherds. Such big, powerful dogs (well, one is a puppy at 4 months, but very big in spirit, lol), and they are my big goober babies! lol. Plus they'll kick anyones butt if they go after me|`|eFLiKTB3aa	i love big dogs! i have a german shepherd and i love him to bits. when you have a big dog, you can play with it knowing that you won't hurt it. you can also get a lot of exercise when you walk them and they are also very loyal and friendly.|`|eOLnWXT2aa	im a dog lover of a very large dog and a medium dog.me myself ,  would have to say lg.im into a dog that says dog when u look at them.im a happy owner of a rottie/mastiff and i will say this........she is the best dog i have ever owned and would do it again and again.

47P7uLV6aa	Congratulations, you have a kitten!!    This is what kittens are like.  This is what kittens do.  If you don't like this behavior, then don't get a kitten!      I can tell you love your cat.  You need to be patient with her.  She will learn, eventually, what the 'rules' of the house are but she will never totally obey.  Our cats aren't allowed on the kitchen counters but they occasionally jump up there anyway.  That's just being a cat.  Our cats aren't allowed outside either, but one of them TRIES, all the time, to get out the door.  Using a squirt gun is the best method we have found for training a cat but even that isn't foolproof.      If she scratches you when playing, don't let her play with your hand.  Get some feathers on a long plastic wand -- she will LOVE playing with that!      In fact, get her LOTS of toys.  Do you know what the BEST toy for a kitten is?  Another kitten!  Cats really do get lonely and need friends.  If you can possibly do it, get another cat, preferrably from a shelter.  You will all be happier and you will be giving a home to a cat who needs one.  But be sure you can commit to keeping BOTH cats for a lifetime, and can afford vet bills.    Cats do like to play at night.  Eventually she will adapt her routine to yours.      Don't get angry with her, it won't help.  Just be glad she is playful and normal.  Believe it or not, when she stops playing so much you will miss it!      Good luck.|`|Wn4tjazIaa	She's a kitten. She's gonna start out being nocturnal, so try playing games with her about an hour or two before bed.... try to wear her out, not wind her up. Trim her claws if she's aggressive. Remember, she's a kitten, so she's not going to know what's okay and what's not okay. And she's not a puppy or a kid, which means she's not going to listen as well.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	You cannot rough house with your cat. You cannot grab its head and move your hand around. This creates an aggresive cat.     You can play with toys but NOT with your hand. Your hand is not a toy.     Keep up with the water bottle. Make sure you aim for the face but away from the eyes. They hate getting hit with water on their nose and head.     Get a small empty coffee can and put a bunch of coins in it. When kitty acts out shake the can near kitty and say no. Don't shout no but say it firmly. This should scare the beejeez out of him. You have to be consistent though and keep doing this and the water or it will not work.     Also your cat is ready to mate. She may be in heat and if demanding more attention and being more agressive may be a sign she is in heat. If you have not had her fixed now is the time. If she is requiring an unusual amount of affection that could be it.     good luck|`|udLtA7T7aa	If your cat is attacking you, your furniture, phantom spirits and invisible mice; if he's bouncing off the walls and ceiling; knocking things off counter tops; stealing; carrying around or hiding the most unusual objects; don't worry, your cat is quite normal. Much of this obnoxious behavior is caused by his acting out play and predatory behavior. If these events occur in the middle of the night or in the wee hours of the morning, don't forget that cats are nocturnal animals. It's normal for their activity level to peak late at night or early in the morning.     This frequently happens with lonely, bored cats that have an excess of energy and no where for that energy to go. They cannot chase real mice and birds, or climb real trees, so they develop other habits to entertain themselves.     Many of these problems can be prevented or cured by providing games, exercise and entertainment for your kitty. Get on the floor and play with your cat. Don't just toss her a toy and expect her to play by herself. Tie a toy to the end of a string, toss it down the hall and reel it in, or slowly drag it across the floor. This gives kitty a moving target to chase and attack. Put a bird feeder outside a window so your cat can watch hummingbirds dive-bomb the fuchsia bush.     Sometimes kitten behavior, such as suckling and kneading, continues into adulthood. Provide your cat with something safe of his own towards which he can direct this behavior. If the cat decides to use you or your clothing for this activity, simply let him know you disapprove. A sudden, sharp shout or loud noise is usually sufficient. Remember to frequently encourage kitty to indulge himself with his own special suckling/kneading pillow, blanket or toy.     Often a cat's misbehavior is actually reinforced by your unintentional rewards. The cat suddenly runs up, nips you on the ankle and runs off. You scream and chase him. Although you think you are reprimanding the cat, he probably thinks this is a fun game. Cats can also become pests, demanding attention and affection because when they come over to bug you, you give them what they want - food, attention or affection. Read more about how cats learn.|`|cZ4ul6znaa	She is still just a baby. I know we have a kitten and he has always been like that. This is actually quite normal at this stage, as she gets older she will start to calm. But when they are kittens they just very hyper. I have had my cat for not even a year and all he does it attack me, its his way of showing he wants to play, if he gets to violent we just smack him genitally and tell him NO! and he usually gets the picture. But this is a normal part of growing up. Also look at her teeth and see if she might  be teething. I know they are always willing to bite and things like that when they are teething.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	Sounds like a normal kitten to me. I've got one the same age sitting on my lap right now (on my shredded legs). She's being a perfect little angel, but I know it could be a matter of seconds before she's on the keyboard "helping" me type and swatting the monitor, or bouncing off the walls in one form or another.    I wouldn't scold her because she is just practicing being a REAL cat and she could become neurotic if you do. She'll outgrow it soon enough and I bet you'll be missing the days when she used to seem like such a "problem child".    Enjoy it while you still can!
7bbfUYUOaa	Your tank hasn't had time to cycle properly if you only had it set up 5 days before you added fish.  Usually it takes about a month.  Google "Nitrogen Cycle" to learn more about that.  Your tank is probably murky for 2 reasons.  1. Your kid is overfeeding the fish.  Teach your son not to feed the fish more than they can eat in three minutes.  That is a general good rule of thumb to go by.  2. You have goldfish.  Goldfish are extremely messy fish.  They also require quite a bit of space (at least 100 gallons when full-grown).  I would recommend returning the still-living goldfish (if you can).  They really aren't that great for beginner fish (too messy).  I recommend tropical community fish like guppies, tetras, and swordtails.  They are smaller fish, which means you can have more of them and can have a wide variety of colors in your tank.  Just be sure to research the fish you are looking at buying so you know you can meet their needs before you bring them home.  A good rule of thumb for stocking your tank is 1" of full-grown fish per gallon of tank.      Now, for your murky water.  With your goldfish, I wold recommend 25% water changes twice a week with a gravel vacuum.  With tropical community fish, I do a 25% water change every two weeks.  See the difference in upkeep?  Good luck with your fish!|`|AA11708471	what sized aquarium is it?  You only brought it 5 days ago and you should have put it through the nitrogen cycle (takes about a month) before you added fish so the other one may also die. I encorage you to research the fishless nitrogen cycle    if its less than 70 gallons its too small for 2 common/comet goldfish  if its less than 30 gallons its too small for 2 fancy goldfish    Goldfish are terrible beginner fish    if its atleast 5 gallons you could get a school of white cloud mountain minnows or add a heater and get a betta  both these fish are ideal for beginners    Edit: i agree with pbr_chics answer except for the 1 inch per gallon rule. It is a terrible rule and it does not work|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	Yup, overfeeding can do it. But usually not that quickly I didn't think? It might have been sick when you brought it home?    I think you need to clean the tank every 5 days. Or when it's murky. So try cleaning it and see how long it stays clean. And be really careful about only changing out 20%? of the water, and rinsing out the tank thoroughly, etc.    Also you should ask the store where you purchased it from for help--you're supposed to take the dead fish, plus some of the water it was in, in for analysis (that's what Petco does). It's not as easy to take care of fish as people always think! Good luck!!|`|pcJgr1K1aa	maybe u got the fish that u feed to other fishe. u noe the ones they give at fairs. they die within a day three tops. i work in a pet store|`|KuXNYqa3aa	murky colour is algae+bacteria. decomposing food/manure=nitrogen=plant food=algae=bacteria=death.  search for info on nitrogen cycle to teach to son.(experience tells me kids overfeed fish. kids overfeed fish. kids overfeed fish. )wont change. death by kindness  ;)|`|mC4mnvGFaa	the tank is supposed to go cloudy, it cycling, which means its building up a good bacteria base. and your son could indeed have over fed the fish. when you bought the tank, they should have told you in the store not to put any fish in it that you wanted to keep for at least 2 weeks. I'd suggest just letting it run and feed the fish only a single pinch of food twice a day for at least another week(the water shouldstart to settle by then) and then go buy another fish or two.|`|1H9DEy7Oaa	Goldfish produce ammonia when they are in the tank, and it will get murky.  You can buy clearing tablets.  Additionally, the fish should not be fed more than a teaspoon of food together 2 or 3 times a day at most.  Man people over feed their fish.  Make sure that you are using some sort of de-chlorinator as well, as tap water will kill the fish.|`|UT9Wlu5Faa	Probably becuase u have a small tank or a bowl.... and the goldfish died because of water quality issues.|`|nKgGJuMCaa	get a air filter and snails

No offense, but you should have thought about all this before actually getting a dog,let alone a puppy.|`|AA11457471	Your dog simply lacks training & I suspect you are aware of this.

They should get adult dogs instead.     Now you know that. Tell your friends who are about to get puppies and are gone all day. You CANNOT housetrain a puppy without being IN THE HOUSE.     Also, male dogs that are not fixed are that much harder to housetrain. Now you also know that.     I think it's great that you have found a home for the dog. But it may be a good idea to go ahead and neuter him before you send him over there.    ETA - tons of people make this mistake; my own parents did, TWICE. Puppies are cute and roly-poly and lovable, and people who have never adopted adult dogs before think - INCORRECTLY - that they won't love them the same way.     People also think - INCORRECTLY - that an adult dog is more difficult to train (for certain things like tricks it's easier to train puppies, but not so for housetraining). They also don't realize that adult dogs are *emotionally* able to see humans less often during the day than puppies are. Fairly constant contact with humans is *essential* for puppies' development; they will often be ill-behaved monsters if they don't have enough human contact.     Parents hear their kids whine for a puppy, and the kids think that the puppy will be a puppy forever. And this is another reason that parents get small breeds, and they also think - again INCORRECTLY - that the small breeds will be easier dogs to handle.     These are just all-around bad reasons to get a dog and bad logic about dogs, but no one has the balls to tell people that, and the backyard breeders and pet store owners who sell these puppies are greedy and WON'T tell people that.|`|Z0nooDxDaa	that thing happened to me, the best thing to do is to give him up, its not fair on u or the pet!|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	He needs a new home. Just make sure it's a safe, competent one.     A dog needs to be trained from puppyhood on. Meaning you can't teach him to sit and never work with him again expecting him to remember it. Also they need to be exercised daily, which is why your dog is tearing everything up, he has pent up energy and is bored. Getting him neutered would also be a great idea.    If you don't have the time for these things, a dog is not for you, it's not fair. I'm sorry to hear you would give up so easily, but if you're not willing to put in the time you're only hurting the animal.    ADD:::  Well said, KZ.  Also, I would like to add that I don't intend for my answer to come of harsh or rude, even though it probably did, I just want people to understand that a dog is a bigger responsibility than a new pair of shoes.|`|TEucykbZaa	You should never give a puppy away when it is only 1 in a half years old. You just need someone to care and love for it. That is why it is pooping and peeing all over your house. You need to take care of it and nurture it as if it were a baby. Little puppies like that need some attention every now and then. You should most definitely not give it away. Maybe you should give it to a relative or friend that lives nearby so you can visit it. You should not give it away.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	It is for the best.  Your kids' health is more important.  Some dogs are just untrainable.  I suggest taking him to a shelter, or selling him in your local paper/pennysaver.  May be next time, you can adopt a shelter dog that is already houstrained.  I've done this with great results.  Anyway, Bichon Frises aren't really family dogs.  They are more like old lady dogs, lol.  Next time, op for a smarter breed...(Lab, Doberman, Shepard, ect.)

It seems to me that you haven't invested enough time in training your puppy. I have a 7 month bichon who I had to devote most of my attention to for a month before she was decently potty trained and able to be left alone for any period of time. I also took her to puppy training classes that did wonders for her behavior. She now knows many commands and tricks. We still have a lot of work to do with her, but bichons are also known to be very smart and it's gotten easier with time. I had the luxury of winter break from school to do all of this but if you don't have time to really focus on the training then it'd be in the best interest of the dog and your family to give him up.|`|z2yUgnYfaa	I know how upset you are. I had the same problem with my 4 year old Chihuahua. We got him from the humane society, and they told us they thought he was probably house trained. Well, he wasn't. I tried everything and could not train him. I have OCD, so germs are extra hard for me.     One day, he peed on some dirty clothes outside of my laundry room. It was just more than I could handle. We decided to take him back to the humane society the next day. I cried all night, and all the way to the humane society. We gave him back. I was so upset that not even 4 hours later I went back and got him.    He still makes messes. It is only when we are gone, so it is hard to train him. We have tried everything, but it just doesn't work. We are still dealing with it; but it is a very personal decision.     Don't listen to all the people telling you how bad you are. Just do what you feel is right. If you think he would be happier with the other people, let him go. If you don't think you can handle losing him, keep him. The choice is yours.|`|HpvyeQgDaa	If this was My dog I would find him a friend and make them outside dogs that come in at night In a large cage to sleep. My dogs live out side during the day they have the run of the section and when I go to bed at Night they Go in big cages Two in each cage for company.  They are happy with this, They play all day with my kids out side.  And they play inside when the door is left open to access our section to go loo.  Ur baby Loves you, your not a perfect pet own, Get ur baby a friend even a kitten may be the perfect company who knows lol  Don't Feel down and if your decision is to give him away find a home that is close so you visit him and be his auntie. :0)  I really wish you the best of luck for trying so hard to be a good owner. When we first get involved with dogs we dont know everything just like having babies we learn as we go and not every animal is a text book case.

vbEkYH2haa	Cockatiels are beautiful when they are bonded to you. It is best to get a hand reared one directly from the breeder so you can see they have been well socialised and reared properly. Pet shops often sell hand reared birds that have had little more than their wings clipped. A quality hand reared cockatiel will be your best mate for life. they come when called and will follow you longingly around the house. They will also be happy to chill on their own. i think they are a really well balanced parrot and i would recommend them to anyone|`|ppKQEhEMaa	I had a cockatiel and it was the most loving bird ive ever had. He would kiss my lips, love being scratched and was really well trained.    If you get a hand raised cockatiel and give it love, it will give it back.    I think you should get one!|`|qS4EG5qYaa	ohohohoh ur friends dont no anything!!!!    they are playfull, love flyin around, are cute, sing (my bird never stops singing in the moring) yer, they love u! wen i pat shadow he loves it and is so cute! hes so cute and loving|`|zakbXGK6aa	Cockatiels that are well socialized have plenty of personality, and can be affectionate.  I'd ask your friends how much time they spent with their tiels.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	I own a Cockatoo now.  I did have a Cockatiel (it died) but he was very loving and affectionate towards me and my mom.  He would let me pet him and hold him.  He also could whistle Andy Griffith and Popeye theme songs.  And he would say pretty bird and his name smoky.  So although parrots ie cockatoo, conure, quaker parrot, mccaw are very noisy birds; A cockatiel is very docile and sweet not loud.|`|brFVpD1Qaa	Ok, it depends whether you raise the cockateil, from like eight weeks. Ok you cant have more than one, because then they go wild, to give them a personality, you have to give them, lots of care, attention (usually hours of whisteling) and let them be themselves, play with it and love it  and it will have a personality. They are very rewarding birds, but you just have to put in the effort.  We did and i couldnt bare to be without mine. OH YES, DO NOT MISTREAT THE BIRD! its wipes away all chance of personality.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvXK8Kk4Q...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czOfYDxa7...  there just watch these.|`|F0qPuMGCaa	Your friends are SO TOTALLY WRONG!!!    Cockatiels are always happy, running round and are so loving and playful.  They are very playful birds and love being around people and they love their owners.  You can teach them to whistle so you can show off to your friends that they are not dull and do nothing.  My cockatiel knows how to sing 5 different songs.|`|OQM5rkF5aa	Your friends just dont know!!!! I will admit though  you make 'em how u want 'em. Meaning if your not home for a long time, dont talk to them and dont pay attention to them they will be nasty and hiss at you. If you love them and are sweet to them there your best buddy. I have two of the sweetest bords ever. One is an albino cockatiel named Chiko and the other is a yellow bird named Rocky. If im gone for more than 2 days they cry like crazy. Wont eat wont sleep. They go everywere with me in the summer, stores and places like that dont mine we attract MORE custumers but if your going to do that make sure that there wings are clipped really really good.|`|Hv7L5CrGaa	From what I've heard, cockatiels are really affectionate and tame, also loving and cute. But I would suggest you to buy a budgie. I've had a budgie and a cockatiel, and I can tell you that the budgie was tamer than the cockatiel. If you are a first time bird owner, try getting a budgie. They're cute, and come in many different colors, unlike the cockatiel. Of course, the cockatiel is also really adorable but can sometimes be aggressive. You just got to be nice and patient, things like that.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	Well my fiance has 2 cockatiels and both are very cute and cuddlie they can learn to talk and whistle tunes there smart birds and love to have their heads scratched and feathers petted they make great pets i on the other hand have lovebirds and wouldn't triad them for any other bird they bond really well to you and i like that but you really need to get the bird you want if you do decide on a cockatiel then get one from a breeder a hand fed one although they are one of the easier birds to tame there some on kijiji right now babies

ztMeGHY0aa	Yes I brought my cat to the vet and he put on one of those cones. My cat hated it and refused to eat drink and just lay in one position miserable so I took it off and he was back to normal except for his condition. I brought him back again and got one of the older vets in the practice and he said he didn't use the cone anymore as they caused so much distress. It is amazing how cats recover so quickly from awful cuts when hit by cars etc so I would take off the cones and let them lick especially as there is no stitches. The cut will heal anyway at least they did with mine when ever I get them neutered.I never had to have a cone for just that operation it's very quick and easy they can go out straight away not like a female.  The disorientation is horrible to watch isn't it when their heads go back like they have had a stroke.   Since the vet didn't put a cone on them the first time I feel it ok to say to take them off again as I am not a vet|`|4aAhEK9daa	Should be just a few days.  Those cones aren't really necessary.  They're to keep the cats from licking the stitches but most vets don't even use them.  I would take them off tomorrow.  The cats are disorientated from the anethesia - not the cones - so should be less "wonky" tomorrow.    Note that recovery time would have been MUCH faster had you gotten them neutered earlier.  Kittens can be spayed or neutered as early as eight weeks as long as they're two pounds in weight and healthy.  I've seen kittens at the shelter jumping around playing the same day they've been neutered!|`|z7JsVzcnaa	A few days to a week (at most).  The cones are really necessary though.  You don't want the cats getting at themselves, so to speak.|`|PuPQF8QIaa	Call your vet. or wait until monday, and ask them then.    They never even gave my cat a cone, he did just fine.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i have never heard of cones for neutering.    it is a small incision, not like for the female. i would question the use of collars.|`|5aKUV5afaa	I'm not the best cat person in the world.  I let the cones go long before the Vet said I should.  I just keep an eye on them.  I did it with all my pets. I have 3 dogs and two cats.  All of them have had to have E-Collars.  It's sad for them so I take them off.  But you have to watch them.|`|cZCaHWhOaa	I have owned cats all my life and I have never had any of my male cats needing cones after being neutered. Is your cat trying to chew his stitches?    It should not take no more than a week for the stitched to either fall out on their own (depending on what kind are used) or be manually removed.|`|1CvrXvjoaa	i have had many males neutered and have never put a cone on them they don't have stitches so i don't see any problem with them not having the cone on them. its up to you though but me personally i would take them off now. and none of my male cats have ever had stitches.  hope this helps|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Two girls, I take it. That's to stop them worrying at their stitches, just ask your vet if you're unsure. It's not necessary for boys.  Cats heal like lightning, it shouldn't be long.|`|16XpYCBmaa	If your cat is having trouble wearing the cone then I would just take it off your cats and see how they act now without them. And if you see them lick there selves once put the cones right back on them.. maybe they will get the hint not to lick down there. They should heal up in about a week or so.|`|zC4cgGhqaa	Our 6 month old girls were spayed and we were given cones (buster collars, the vet called them) but as the stiches were internal, we never used them.    We had to keep them in a security cage for the most part of 10 days but this is ONLY because they are VERY rough and tumble and because as we are out at work most of the time, we wouldn't know if their internal stitches had ruptured and would not get them back to the vet in time.  Our vets are really great and although at first they said 3 days' healing time would be sufficient, they told us at the follow up check to keep it to 10 days, just to be sure.    For male cats, I can't see any reason why they wouldn't be fine after no longer than 7 days - the wounds aren't as severe as with females and they don't have the layers and layers of stitches.    The simple answer is - if your cats (boys or girls) don't lick their wounds, they won't get infected, so by all means give it a try and take the cones off them while you're there to watch them, and hopefully you'll find they ignore the incision and you will all be back to normal in no time.    Hope this helps.|`|f6ob1dllaa	After my cat was neutered she couldn't cope with the cone either, she just sat in the corner of the room. So while i was in the house with her i took the collar off, she licked the wound initially but then hasn't bothered since, and didnt lick it to the point of making it sore. It is distressing to watch them with their cones, so personally id take them off while you can supervise them and see if they continue licking their wounds. Obviously if they do, its best the collar stays on, and try keep them in a room with as few obstacles as possible? But if they dont lick their wounds, try keeping the collar off for extended periods of time and just keep an eye on how the wounds are looking.  Good luck with your little boys.|`|z0e1bnaOaa	I know. it's horrible to see them wear cones. well, if they don't have stiches, then you can take them off sometime soon but you really have to watch them to make sure they won't lick and bite the incision. wait a day or two and try taking it off while you are home and can watch them closely.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Both males? I'm assuming yes as you said no stitches. Shame that they both licked, they mostly don't do that, but if they do they have to have the collars on. Yes the collars are a nightmare, but they are better than the cats getting the wound infected or even the wound breaking down, believe me!    You might want to just check the cats were given Metacam. This is a standard anti inflammatory pain relief, usually given to neuters via injection. It really reduces swelling and soreness at the op site and so makes licking less likely. Of course if they have had it, it means they're just naughty lickers!    The male cats we neuter just have to be kept inside for 3 days. After that they're healed up enough. I would not really think the collar would need to be kept on for more than 2 days, but PLEASE check with your vet before removing them!!    Chalice

Is she young? did you give her cows milk, this can cause life threatening diarrhea to young kittens. It could be her food, or she could have gotten into something. Even house plants can effect your pets so the variables are pretty endless. If this has lasted for a week or more, I suggest you seek medical attention for her.    If you can, borrow the money from your parents or someone else that's going to be willing to lend you a couple hundred.  If that's not possible Your best bet is to contact a local vet and discuss a payment plan with them, and get a job.  Most vets will work with you when it comes to payment methods, it's their job and oath to help sick animals regardless of the owners situation.  .

If she continues this way without proper treatment she can get dehydrated and die.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	She needs to go to a vet, this sounds like a pretty bad upset tummy and could well be a dangerous virus. I'm going to assume she isn't vaccinated.    It really is true that you shouldn't own an animal you can't afford to take care of. Animals have rights - we've domesticated them, we have a responsibility to keep them happy and healthy if we're going to bring them into our homes.    I don't know what country you're in so I don't know what help they're might be in your area. If you're in England and on benefits you can take the cat to the PDSA. The cat needs a vet within 24 hours tho, so you need to get off the computer and sort something out, even if it means surrendering the animal.    Chalice

If it's sore they can give her pain relief, you can't. For just the price of a consult fee, it's worth having it properly checked rather than waiting to see if it becomes infected or not.

After the loading dose, he started to become more comfortable & mobile & was soon chasing his frisbee again.

I think they now charge for writing one, unfortunately, but generally speaking it is a lot cheaper than buying from a vet, if you are going to have your lad on this long-term.  However, yes, you can use glucosamine - there are any number of good products with this in, for dogs.  Again some are quite expensive however.   Metacam does have side effects long term (although you'd have to decide whether the risk long term is worse than the benefits, depending on how long your lad will live for) so it might be worth switching to something with less risk.   You might try Cortaflex but have a look at www.hyperdrug.com - there are any number of products under Movement in their catalogue.    Edit - I think you will find most vets use Metacam (or the like) as pain relief post surgery, as an injection.  So although sometimes it might be seen as a last resort, it's not by any means always the case.  And even if it is, if it gives some quality of life at the end of a dog's life, isn't it worth it?|`|Qks0PQhAaa	yes you can give ur dog Glucosamine its actually alot better then what ur vet has prescribed him :)|`|mcJNBa0Baa	Sophie is correct. My parents dog is on glucosamine and it has worked wonders for his joints. I would try to cut down on the metacam if you can, because prolonged use can lead to problems in the dog. This is what we were told anyway. Hope Milo picks up soon :)|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Your vet can advise you on appropriate supplements and also appropriate diet, have you asked them? Metacam is extremely useful for management of long-term joint problems, but if it isn't quite doing the job then there are certainly other alternatives. Yes Metacam can be expensive but it should be worth it - if you feel it's not then you can investigate either a different drug or a different supplier (you will need a prescription from your vet wherever you get it)    Glucosamine is used in dogs but it's efficacy is not proven. There are other more specific supplements that you will probably have better results with and of course, you should never give your dog anything without discussing with your vet first.    Goes without saying, ANY excess weight on your dog must be got rid of. Get your vet to assess if your dog is at his ideal weight - not all vets are comfortable with doing this, so don't just accept a 'yeah he's fine' - they should feel the dog and be able to discuss body condition score with you.    If the pain really can't be managed with drugs, supplements, diet and more physio (hydrotherapy?) then it's worth considering if your dog truly has quality of life. At the moment it sounds as if he doesn't - sleeping almost 24/7 is not quality of life.    Chalice|`|AA11097657	I used to have a copper collar on my old dog.

Bakers Weight Control: http://www.feedem.co.uk/dog-2/dog-food-1...    Even if your dog isn't over weight Bakers will help him not put on weight.     Hope i helped and Good Luck.
CsC2xqM9aa	here is websites you can look at to calculate the weight of your horses.    http://www.gaitedhorses.net/Articles/hor...    http://www.cowboyway.com/HowTo/HorseWeig...    http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/health/horsew...    Personaly i think the last one is best since there is a table :)|`|FLBCvJuDaa	On the Belgian... from experience I would say approximately 1500 lbs.  The other two I do not know.|`|RloOJ43haa	You can use a weight tape to get an approximate weight. They are not super accurate, but good for measuring trends.    Also, they are probably less than 5 bucks.|`|t6Ya3c3baa	Take them to a public scale, the kind that truck drivers would use, and get them weighed. A large feed store, that sells hay by the ton, should have one.    This is the most accurate way; more accurate than a weight tape.|`|Oiabe82gaa	Firstly, I would advise you to get yourself a weight tape. Used properly they are very accurate, and are also a good way to keep an eye on your horse's weight. If you are wanting to slim these guys down it'd be an easy way to for you to see if they are losing weight!  Secondly, I would guess that your Belgian would be approx. 1,400lbs and the pony approx. 850lbs.
33PwXUblaa	Having a dog is a life time responsibility.  It may be harder than you think.....you want it bad....I know how you may feel but......you must earn it!!  I had wanted dogs since i was only 5 yrs old adnd didn't get any till i was 12!  I tell you...it si hard!  Maybe you have feconomical difficulties? idk.......but you must earn it!  It wont come easy....but it is worth it!!  GOOD LUCK!!|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Are you responsible? Do you clean your room? Do what your told? Don't argue when your needed to help out?  A dog costs money - mum and dad need to know its worth it. And they need to know you'll treat it well and when it needs walking that you wont whinge and whine - you'll just go and do it.|`|2d161d1ede80ea983c1d8b6f85f0e0b5aa	Grown ups used to think that little'uns can't take responsibility. Show them that you can be responsible by doing some house chores etc.|`|gzwdEZcMaa	if you can put it enough of work to take care of a dog then its should be easy to convince them coz you cant say there not a lot of work coz they are. you should show your parents how responsible you are if you are but maybe you should start with smaller lower maintenance pet like a mouse or guinea pig|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	It IS a lot of hard work a big responsibility and at least 10 years of vets bills , dog walks, picking up dog poos, grooming , training, and forget a social life, dogs need walked even in rain , wind ,snow and even if you take ill, or fancy a drink at a weekend the dog need you home for it to be fed and walked, its like having a baby in some ways .|`|AA11593134	First, find out if the place you are living in, you can have a dog (if you're renting, most rental places do not allow dogs). Dogs can be expensive to own/take care of. So you might want to get some way to earn money (mowing, etc.) and show that you can afford to take care of the dog. Then it takes a lot of your time as well. You know you have to walk th dog several times a day so he/she can pee, etc... If you are in school, you should think about that -- like who can take your dog for a walk when you're at school, or if you can come home at lunch and do that, etc. I'm sure if you already had your plans made up and present it up to your parents, they might let you have one... Good luck!   I have two kids and bought rabbits, fish, turtle, etc. and now a cat, and they PROMISED that they'd take care of them. It lasted only a week or two and I ended up taking care of them all... So, you better have a good plan and stick with your plan -- or it could be your last pet (parents might not get you any pets anymore...)  : )|`|3AuBsNylaa	beg and make a deal with ur parents for example do the dishes for a month or something or just say if u get good grades they have to buy u a dog|`|JOjaycXLaa	Make it look like a stranger or  someone broke into your house and stole some of your familys stuff! Then tell your parents see if we had a gaurd dog none of this would have happen ! You have  to create the need for a family dog! They won't just buy you one !|`|HpvyeQgDaa	Before I answer how old are you please its makes all the differance to the question?

If they come on to the land, they will get new names after they adapt themselves to the challenges on land. Obviously they can't survive with fins and gills.    It is believed that life originated in the oceans and the embryo of people, animals, reptiles, birds, and fish are similar. We adapted to land/air and now have modified fins known as limbs.|`|jXLPMB3Eaa	if fishes lived on land all fishes are likely frog's and in water there is no fishes and no need search in water for fishes.|`|vHeCd9kDaa	heard of mudskippers?????|`|ROh1hVzHaa	madhu should be in the sea|`|mQYy2y9naa	obviously they might die..|`|7EiWSuPLaa	then nobody at the beach could say "herbie? he swims like a fish"|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	then they would be lizards|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	They would have been extinghised because it would have been easier for human race to catch fish easily and eat.|`|AA12347845	.... then birds would be swimming underwater,  dogs ,cats (and all other land creatures) would be flying and humans would be living underground.    What if the sun came out at night and the moon shone in the daytime ? Even then we would have day & night, light and darkness. So nothing really would have changed-except the names.    In other words, nothing would be strange because we would be used to fish living on land and dogs and cats flying, birds swimming & so on.  In fact , we would then be astonished at the idea of fish living in water !    It sounds strange now because it is not so.    Understood ???|`|lTUmzLuxaa	It will die..
5M57TTfpaa	my rabbits are 6 days old today, i have touched them everyday, twice a day, since birth. i just had one in the bed with me while i watched tv... nothing has happened. plus if you handle from birth, they will get used to being handled by the time you find them a home.     the doe was supposed to be eating extra food during pregnancy, and while lactating.. up until the kits start eating pellets and dont rely on her milk, then you can take her back to normal. Im just giving my doe unlimited food right now. all she really needs extra is her pellets and water(mine isnt eating her hay at all right now, do i dont know if yours would), and just feed the same amount of veggies you are feeding.  Just remember the babies dont get veggies until they are about 6 months old.    if you dont want to touch your babies that is up to you, but you need to count them and at least make sure they are all alive, and you need to check that everyday. leaving a dead kit in there can cause bad problems. Mine started growing the fur around the first day. their eyes still are not open. normally they open around 8 to 12 days. Make sure you have the dad separate!!      here is a helpful link that should help with your kits  http://www.mybunnyfarm.com/breeding/    here are my kits, taken at 4 days old!!  http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d101/k...    and here was one shortly after kindling  http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d101/k...      here is a video  http://s34.photobucket.com/albums/d101/k...|`|dAn9koABaa	yes she needs to feed her babies and build her strength get good quality food from pet shop yes the greens are ok but be careful as to much will give them all the trots|`|GTmkQzCgaa	Yes, because they need the food to provide for their needs, and for the kit's needs.    I've never had baby rabbits, but I would give it a few days before touching the babies unless something is wrong with them.|`|cnMk2jWAaa	yeah she probably should have extra food!  lactation does a lot to her so she needs to keep up with it!|`|6G47mC9Taa	Yes your right they will need more greens as your lop just had a baby so you will need to pay extra attention and make sure you dont try to bond with the baby lops too much coz the mother will think your trying to steal her babies x x|`|LDdd6uAQaa	Firstly remove the buck as there is a chance that he could kill the kits, this will also benefit the mum in that she will not have to be challenged to feed.

dAn9koABaa	hi this can be because they do not want to go out in the cold , try putting litter tray near back door and over time move it to just outside the door have you got a cat door ,i am sorry to say cats can be lazy  so you will have to find a way to motivate them . big problem is once they start doing it in the house they think its where to do it, oh one last thing change the litter tray often if its dirty they wont use it , good luck|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Your cats are confused.  One minute they are outside, then they are inside, then they had a tray (if it was only one tray between 7, no wonder you have a problem) now they don't have a tray .........  Cats need consistency and they also need a lot of litter trays if you have 7 cats or they will all be fighting for their own territory and if that means using the worktop then so be it.      The rule of thumb is one litter tray per cat plus one extra.  Therefore, with 7 cats you should have 8 litter trays.  Now you obviously are not going to be keen on this idea so you need to work out a system.  I have 6 cats.  During the day when I am at home and they are in the house I have 3 trays down as I know exactly what is going on and can scoop the trays immediately. When I go out then I put a couple of extra ones out for them incase they all need to "go" whilst I am away.  Overnight, I put down 8 trays and if they don't get used then all I have to do is gather them up in the morning and put them away in the utility room until I need them again.      If you are having the cats in your house then you really need to give them the proper facilities they need.|`|fJaZlJQXaa	If you used to have litter trays in the house for them but now dont,maybe they are a little confused as to where to go to the toilet.  Try putting a little tray down again and see if that solves the problem.  The reason they dont go to the back door when they need to go to the toilet I would guess is that as they are used to having a litter box they have never had to go stand at a door to be let out so dont know they have to do that.|`|bvdbYujMaa	because they are not trained.

zWFJBlJZaa	Right now she has PMS.  She's not yet out of season and she's not ready to let ANYBODY near her (this is a good thing).    After her season ends and her hormones settle, you'll probably see a difference and she'll be more normal (as long as nothing traumatic happened with another dog during her cycle.)    If it still continues after her cycle is finished, your Dog School Instructor should be able to help you re-socialize her.|`|AA12083992	Here's a thought, spay her. It is a good thing on so many levels.|`|BhWmEZWNaa	would you not be angry too if could not get one on?  Look, when you walk it it walks in front meaning it thinks its the boss, same thing when you let it out. Sort this out! making it walk by you or behind you. Go out first then let it out. Eat first then give it its food. YOUR THE BOSS!  I hate lil yappy dogs!|`|5a3n8IDTaa	please dont blame ur dog i have a pitbull and a staff the pitbulls a boy and the ***** is the staff ,,,ur dog has just had a season and will be extremley frustrated ,,thats y she is doin this she might stop but she also might not because my 2 go mental everytine they see another dog its just one of them things but if u are really botherd by this then take an bottle of water when u go for a walk with her and when she see's another dog and gets aggresive squirt the cold water in her face itt will destract her ,,it does work ,,and when she has not got aggresive then praise her so much ,,,i hope u are an animal lover as much as i am so please dont get angry with ur its not her fault ,,just try different technuiqes it will be fine ,,,wish u all the best and give ur dog a stoke from me|`|AA11097657	After they have had the first season their temperament completely changes for ever.    They lose their puppy ways and turn into an adult over night.    This is the reason that I advise people to get their females spayed at 6 months. They never experience the hormonal changes if they never have a season.    Too late to tell you that now though!|`|3y96DmJdaa	I have six dogs, my dogs are exactly the same with other dogs, maybe just the break away from them has made her forget about them and made her used to being alone. Just keep with the routine of taking her to these classes and im sure she will get used to other dogs.|`|4ceE9TFcaa	why don't you ask your trainer at dog training?    he's a professional - people on here can only guess.  and guessing wrong is easy!|`|spbqfjvbaa	Get her spayed.  It is not uncommon for a change in behavior to occur that coincides with her cycle.  It will reduce/eliminate the risk of certain cancers, you won't have to deal with cleaning up her cycle, & you should be back to her normal behavior.  In addition, it's usually cheaper for licensing if she has been spayed.    In addition, the other dogs (especially intact males) are going to have a reaction to her being in season.  It's distracting & will not have them focus on their owners during dog training.|`|s9haCi64aa	My lab went through the same thing at the same age. Dogs go through an adolescence phase and will try it on. Only thing that stopped my dog was neutering him so he didnt get that macho ego. Spaying her could be the answer in a couple of months, now she has had her 1st season she could be feeling more adult and challenging. Dont stop going to classes your trainer should be able to help you with this problem.
W0buucLsaa	1) If the dogs aren't neutered/spayed, neuter or spay them.     2) If the dogs are altered, well... a dog that bites another dog is not a lost cause. I've adopted two that this happened with. One, who had lived on her own in the woods for several years, occasionally would bite another dog for about a year (fortunately, she never caused real injury - she's not very strong or big). But my spouse + time managed to train her out of it, and she's been happy, well adjusted, and not-dog-attacking for a year now. She LOVES other dogs now, invariably.    There's a BIG difference between biting another dog and lunging for a kill.     I think that the new dog is having competition issues. Abandoned dogs, dogs that have lived on their own, dogs that have lived in areas with scarce resources (rather that be food, love, whatever) often still feel like they are competing when they enter a new household. This is also where food aggression comes from. I imagine your new dog is competing for love and attention, which he still believes is a scarce resource even though it isn't.     Time may fix this. You may need the aid of a behavioral therapist. Normally I'm not a huge proponent of the "pack leader" school of thought, but in this case I think it would be a huge help.    But this is not a dealbreaker. You're just going to have to put a decent bit of effort and/or money into it.|`|b1TjlYODaa	Many canine misbehaviors are born out of instinct, and most arise from either boredom or stress.

JjU6IdnDaa	Stray animals are fortunate to find a caring home.  Unless there is information connecting this rough and tumble feline to another owner it would probably be in the cat's best interest to stay with "Dad and his girlfriend".    This is one of the positive outcomes for a stray animal.  Many less fortunate are abandoned, abused, or euthanized when shelters are short on adoptive home, resources, or space.     "Dad and his girlfriend" get the "good job" compliment for their sensitive generosity.    Thanks for sharing this story.  Maybe someone will be inspired to be kinder to pets.|`|fb8c0aba86d9b697276644e63200d049aa	If the cat is sleeping in their house and was uncared for before her owners probably didn't want her.  If your father in his gf are happy with the cat and the cat is happy with them then I think the decision has been made.|`|AA11449595	i would adopt the cat because perhaps the people that had him or her before didn't care for it that's probably why it can away they  should give it a nice loving home|`|m16gf9mzaa	"I am going to see them in February and they want my advice about this cat, but what I would like to say is they should try and find it's owners."    Why can't you just say, "I think you should try and find the cat's owners. Oh, and if you do find them, you can expect repayment for the vet bills."  I mean, they want your advice, so go ahead and say what you think. And it is reasonable to check out the local lost and found classifieds, etc. Of course, after that you pretty much have to leave it up to them to decide what do to.  Don't nag them about it. And why wait until February, why not say that now. On  the off chance the cat actually does have owners, why make them wait longer to find their cat.    But my guess is, no owners will be found, and your dad and his girlfriend have themselves a nice cat to share their home with.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Tell them to put up signs and maybe an ad in the newspaper, to try and find the owners.  More than likely the cat is truly a stray and has found a new home.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	adopt the cat instead before the vet turns the cat to some siopao|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	Chances are it's owners no longer want it. You can suggest making posters to put up in the area they found the cat (pet shops/vets/etc)   And even if the owners are still out there, they may have moved on, gotten a new cat or simply moved and didn't take the cat.  It sounds like your dad and his girlfriend have gotten attached to the cat, and it sounds like it would have a pretty good life with them. If they can keep it, it would be best for the cat.. Because the cat will have bonded with them now.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Yes, that's ok. Put an ad about the cat and when no one claims him then they can adopt it. Support them wholeheartedly, then all will be happy.
eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Most people think that cats are nocturnal, but the truth is that they actually sleep during the darkest hours of the night just as they sleep during the brightest hours of the day. Cats spend most of their natural waking hours during dawn and dusk, which is when they usually hunt for food. That is why your cats are so rambunctious early in the morning...their hunting instincts and their energy level are at their peak at this time of the day. They will then peak again right after the sun goes down.     If they have no real prey to pounce on, then cats will gladly substitute their other feline family members or their human's feet/legs/whatever. :)
H06PtiIAaa	no it will be fine.    cycleing does take a round 2-4 weeks but hte live sand does help.|`|gHKJmygoaa	That won't mess it up. 3 minutes without flow won't kill the aerobic bacteria in the sand. However, if you used your hands to remove it and they had chemicals[cleansers or lotions] or other, infectious, bacteria on them then that would be a cause for concern.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	No..your cycle will continue regardless, your sand would of had to of been out a lot longer than 3 mins to kill of the bacteria.
9kTejB0uaa	I can hardly find a way to answer this question - in fact maybe I shouldn't.  However, I can't resist asking why on earth you don't KNOW whether she's pregnant, or not.  Pregnant bitches do not, normally, bleed before whelping.  If they do, it's a sign that things are not right which means you must get her to a vet.    If she's coming into season, you must remove her from the other dogs, assuming they are entire.  And obviously it goes without saying that she, and the males, must be neutered, given your obvious lack of experience!!  Are they all the same breed?  Is it likely that one of the males (or both!), assuming this ****** is pregnant. is the sire?  Is the size difference between the males and this ****** significant (if so, and one is the sire, she could be seriously at risk of having to try to whelp oversized puppies - in other words, she could die)?    You have to find out where this mysterious blood is coming from - frankly they could have had a fight and one of them has a nick (ear?)    All I can say really.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	You should know if she's pregnant or not.  If so it could be time for the pups to arrive. Monitor her closely if it is then she will need to be away from the males & left in peace & quiet to get on with it.  I hope you are going to get her spayed soon.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	Ignorant fool. One is a female and appears to be pregnant! 'they all seem normal and healthy' er DUUUUHHH!     Locked in a bathroom 'because it is cold outsiude' what sort of life have they got? The female could be dying one of them could have internal bleeding,  pups may be in the offing, and you do not even know if she is pregnant? Yet you own 3 dogs?      I have seen pups born and NO blood came out the mum before they were delivered, she may have pyometra.   Shame on you.|`|KPNRNnbeaa	Yes... its time for the pups!! yay!!    My dog usually does that after the pups hav arrived... like yesterday...  the blood was on the steps..  The i looked at her umm... yea that!  and i saw it coming from her...  I guess she has her period after she  gives birth! hehe|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Hmmm, you may not like this, but you are getting a lot of negative comments for a reason. You are not displaying much that says you care for these dogs or give them a good life, BUT, you at least brought them in from the cold.    Follow this order:-    1/ Separate them, get the female in a warm place with a comfortable bed in case she is about to whelp.    2/ Check her out (don't do an inspection yourself as I don't think you have the experience), just check her body and paws for any cuts or nicks.    3/ Check the male dogs for any cuts or nicks.    4/ Treat any cuts or nicks or take the dog to the vet if you are unsure you can do this yourself    5/ Get your female dog to the vets TODAY to find out for sure if she is pregnant and get the right care for her. Think about the male dogs, did they mate with her, are they bigger than her? Tell your vet, you could save this dogs life!    6/ Get the males neutered.    7/ If there are puppies, be responsible in finding them good homes and get her neutered too.    8/ Decide if you really want these dogs or if they would be better off with other families. I have no problem with dogs being kept outside or have a room in the house so long as they are having all the exercise they need, all the affection and attention they desire and are warm, fed, watered and comfortable.    I am not standing in judgment here, just trying to make it clear to you that up until now, your ownership and responsibility to these dogs has failed them somewhat.    Please have a good think, don't feel attacked and do the right thing.    EDIT: to the other poster whose dog just had pups. If your dog is still bleeding or starts bleeding the day after she has whelped....get her to a vet!|`|mqcVaxMvaa	let that poor ***** on a blanket and watch her squirt|`|sbsbCTZGaa	Matbe she's on her "time of the month" dogs have it too|`|mnb0PxRhaa	If the blood is from the girl about to deliver...let go of any grossness you may feel and use your fingers and check her!!  If there is no vaginal blood, check everyones feet.  Then faces for bites.  Keeping three dogs in a bathroom can cause fighting.    And if you have a very pregnant dog, stop locking her up with a bunch of males.  What are you going to do if she delivers when you are gone and the boys kill them, or she kills them to keep them away from the boys?|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	What kind of handler doesn't even know for sure if his ***** is pregnant? You have to be kidding me. Check her right now and if you even *remotely think* there's a chance she's pregnant, get her OUT of the bathroom and into a warm blanket and AWAY from the males! And why the hell weren't any of these three dogs fixed?    Ugh, call your vet after you check for bites and scratches on the other dogs. And fix them ALL when this is over.|`|BkatcMZbaa	No need to ask for answer, U have it and there is no wrong with it.

9kTejB0uaa	These unexplained problems are the very devil - and empty a bank account faster than anything!!  Been there.    I have one who used to do this.  Every morning, and bile stain is the very devil to clean up.  And it's not good for their throat, teeth etc. either.  I eventually decided to switch him from his individual (he's always had a different diet to the rest and was on Winalot because this seemed to help, until it stopped helping!!) feed to Burns Holistic.  He's on the Venison and Rice version (for some reason, he didn't do well on their Chicken and Rice although they assured me the basic recipe was the same, chicken/venison apart).  He's not had ANY repeat of this ever since.   My boy is now 11 too.  I wonder whether you might try exploring alternative food (change slowly of course) and see if this improves things.  Some people say giving them something last thing helps this condition (putting it down to no food in the system for a number of hours causing this).  This is assuming he does this more often first thing in the morning?  However, doing this with mine didn't help.  Just the switch to Burns (and no, I don't have shares!!)    Also, Chappie (I'm assuming you are in the UK btw) is gentle and supposedly easily digested.      Something is wearing out with your elderly lad and frankly if the vets can't identify anything significantly wrong (have they scanned his stomach ?) you have to look for alternatives.  Hope this helps.    Edit - I'd say this most def. isn't GDV (obviously without seeing your dog)!!    We've had 4 cases (we have Bassets which are prone to this) and in no cases did they upchuck bile.  It was white frothy stuff.  You will know if it's bloat, going to a full torsion.  Once the stomach flips, if you don't get to the vet within 10 minutes, it's more often than not, fatal.  And quite often it's the shock/stress on the other organs, from the swelling of the stomach, that causes the fatality - so many are lost 48 hours into 'recovery'.|`|AA11097657	I have owned dogs for 25 years and throwing up yellow bile has been very common in my dogs.    I haven't had any problems with yellow bile in the last few years and I put that down to the food I now feed my dogs.    I feed a gluten, additive free complete food.    Maybe you should consider a change of diet.|`|J9AvKefwaa	you can't buy Burns food in Jollys... some independent pet stores stock it or you can buy it from the burns website.

Its where the stomach flips and twists the intestines. It can kill dogs, and I suggest you ask the vet about this. Bloat is not always fatal, but it is very uncomfortable for the dogs. This is all I can think of, that the vet may have overlooked. If the stomach flips back, they would never know.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	I would say for what it,s worth that there is a problem in the digestive system.I had a dog that started with a problem like that and was continually eating grass and i took him to 4 vet,s one of whom sedated him and did an endoscopy but found nothing. Another similar investigation by another vet discovered an enlarged spleen which they removed but the poor dog was no better and i wish i had put him to sleep.In spite of paying well over 1000 pounds the dog was no better and eventually wasn't able to lie down for long due to internal pressure.I took him to the vet to be put to sleep.I believe that he had a growth inside him|`|iVQULHqYaa	If my dog ever has a grotty tummy I put a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into Goats Yogurt, this gives immediate relief. Thankfully her tummy problems are very rare because she is now on grain free dog food. Investigate this on the Internet and see what the experts say about the dangers and ramifications of giving dogs grain.    Hopefully you are not giving your dog Cows milks. because this causes problems.     If your dog is a bit stiff its time for the usual meds. Even if he has not got artritus the following will help.    Metacam and Rymadal are usually prescribed by vets for arthritis. Unfortunately both of these medications can cause internal bleeding and they horrify me; however at the onset of pain they give relief.     My GSD was diagnosed with arthritis in her knees, she suffered from internal bleeding when she was prescribed Metacam, this was apparent when her stools became almost black. I investigated other meds on the internet and discovered Flexadin. Its about 70 from the vets and 20 on the internet.  It contains Glucosamine and Chondroitin which help enormously with pain and bone problems; however it also contains Devils Claw which also helps with pain. Later I accidentally discovered that Seraquin has other virtues because as well as the above stuff it also contains Turmeric, this is about 60 from the vets and 16 on the internet. My ten  year old is now chasing rabbits and she appears to be pain free.

It could really have been anything without a better description!    The one glaringly obvious blue/yellow fish would be Centropyge bicolor, an Angelfish:  http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Image:Cen...    If it wasn't him, have look through the list I mentioned below.    If you go on this site:  http://www.fishbase.org and scroll down to "Information by Country / Island" you can search Australia - New South Wales and Reef-Associated only fish species, it comes up with a list of fish, over 200, but concentrate on fish in the families such as Labridae (very colourful)|`|WNSG3RNoaa	How cool, unfortunately i know nothing about fish.

But it could also be a bi colour angel, although less likely because they hide and I think they might be further north - not sure. The one from Nemo is a blue Tang. I'm sure there's probably many blue and yellow fish in the ocean, good luck in your searches.
AA11097657	This is due to her being stressed.    Maybe she has been frightened by fireworks and won't go out in the dark.    Maybe her eyesight is failing and she is unsure in the dark.    I had the same problem with a few of mine after bonfire night so I feed them in the morning instead of the evening. That way they have all day to go to the toilet. It has cured the problem.    Also put something over the area where she goes, like a few chairs.  This will also help to break the habit.    If all that fails then she will have to come to bed with you.

1XLZdOcQaa	Many canine misbehaviors are born out of instinct, and most arise from either boredom or stress. Aggressive behavior, chasing, marking, and resource guarding are modern manifestations of dogs' early instincts to acquire food and protect their territory and pack. Digging and chewing, on the other hand, are usually the results of boredom. Barking is a little of both. Jumping up and mouthing are simply examples of one species (dogs) attempting to make a connection using very different forms of communication than another species (humankind) understands.    Check out this link and find out the different behaviors of dogs along with the explanation and solution on how to curb them. good luck!  http://elfurl.com/5i4s6

oACF40HYaa	Budgies are very adaptable, I know breeders that have their birds in outside flights all year round. Summer heat to winter snow.  Provided they have somewhere to shelter from wind and rain and the ice is removed from their water they are usually ok.  Using a mist spray to cool them in very hot weather is good, not all of them will like a bath but most will love a mist shower provided they can be dry before roosting time.|`|xowm9t3kaa	you shouldn't bring your budgie out side i keep my budgie in my bedroom and shes fine. the temperature should be between 68 and 80 F. you can spray them with a misty water bottle but you have to get them used to it also you can also get them a little bah that's made for them at the pet store, some birds even like to bath in the sink(water should be looke warm)|`|6KxBqnstaa	do not take outside when temps are below 65 degrees F.

AA11708471	First get rid of the goldfish!  They are coldwater and would grow big enought to eat the guppies and mollies    male mollies have a gonopodium  When the female has a box shaped belly transfer her to a tank with lots of java moss. When she has had her fry put her back in her tank|`|AraBfesHaa	After you've had them awhile you'll be able to tell the difference just by their shapes.  The male is longer and more streamlined than the female.  Underneatch, the anal fin of a male looks like a backwards penis. The female's kind of looks like a fan.  You don't have to do anything to breed them, trust me.  They'll do it all themselves, then your tank will be overrun with them.  Guppies are the same way, so you're looking at a big headache  not too long from now.  After livebearers-you have 2, mollies and guppies-breed, the female can and will store sperm and release fry every 30 days or so for about 6 months without even breeding again.  they can have as few as 2 fry if it's their first batch, or more, and up to 80+ in one batch.  Don't think that's too many?  Remember they're gonna grow up and be just as big as the ones you have now, and they will all be breeding with their siblings and parents also.  I don't know about guppies, but the male mollies are the horniest things I've ever seen.  That's all they have on their mind and will never quit trying to breed as long as there's a female in the tank with them.  Once you have fry, don't forget to check daily for ammonia spikes, etc. that's alot of fish to add to a tank at once, even if they are small.  I started out with 2 mollies in a 10-gallon tank.  That's all I wanted.  Now I have over 240 gallons in different sized tanks just to house them all, and they're still overcrowded.  You're gonna be having headaches over them like I am and have been for 5 years now.  Can't even give them for free to pet stores, they're not worth it cuz they're cheap.  So unless you plan to use them as feeder fish (which I won't do), you better have alot of room in your house for lots of tanks.  I'm in the middle right now trying to separate all the males from the females, but it will take months, because most of all the females will still be dropping fry.  When they do, I'll have to separate them again.  thank god I can tell when they're still young what sex they are!  You might separate the fry from the adults the first couple of batches, but believe me, you quit doing that and hoping they get eaten by the other fish.  For some reason, none of my fish seem to eat them, they even spit them out if they happen to get in their mouths at feeding time.  I've watched them do that a few times now.  I have never separated them and still have probably a thousand of them. You quit counting after awhile too.  Good luck, you're gonna need it.|`|T3lEhfdSaa	hmm i dunno if they are the same as guppies as to checking for gender but the way i checked was to look for a stick like thing underneath the bellie. with a stick its a male, without, female.|`|MEpwxCvnaa	First things first get rid of the goldfish. The mollies and guppies will not like the goldfish. The male has a penis called a gonopodium. and the female has a fan shaped fin on the bottom.you do not have to seperate the guppies and mollies because they will get along very well. http://www.petco.com/assets/livefish/fre...  http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~gabor/caito/...
T3lEhfdSaa	basically, your dog is just jealous of the baby. before the baby came, he was your baby and now there is someone in his position. introduce him to the baby and give him plenty of attention. he doesnt really understand that a baby cant take care of itself. its kind of like the lady and the tramp movie if you think about it. Lady being your dog. :3   by peeing and pooping he is basically saying that, that is his territory and that cant be allowed because it will lead to more aggression towards you and your baby. Call a trainer and ask them to help you with the aggression, but really he is just jealous. he loves you xD|`|5rvjjaVlaa	the dog think you are his property and this could be a dangerous situation,so be careful.jealous dog!not sure what to do about it but i would keep an eye on things but let him get to know the baby and things might work out.happens alot|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	Since dogs are by natural pack animals and follow a strict hierarchy in their lives, having a strange new member of the pack might confuse them. In the beginning, your dog will probably consider the new baby as a member of the lower pack order and may display dominant behavior such as growling, crouching, or laying their ears down or back.    Check out this link and read on an article that can help you with your problem. good luck!  http://dogtime.com/introducing-dog-to-yo...|`|BYoVsKY4aa	Your dog is simply being jealous of the attention you are giving the baby.

This can turn very serious very quickly!|`|36c7247679a853a5f8f5039bbfa74097aa	your dog is certainly jealous. he wouldn't understand what the baby is and he's probably confused too. he might see the baby as a threat and it's all normal behaviour. try holding the dog instead of the baby if you're trying to introduce them, when he growls tell him no in a firm voice and stand between the dog and the baby. you need to be the 'alpha' here.

672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	actually, my dad had a wall clock that had a new bird sound every hour.    after a few weeks my dad's cockatiel started to almost perfectly mimic the other birds she was hearing.    it stimulates their mind and entertains them. its just like if you whistle the andy griffith theme and eventually he picks it up and starts whistling it back.    it is perfectly fine.|`|wF52XMxAaa	It's only bad if it's a male cockatiel and you had your heart set on teaching him to talk (if it's a female, it's already unlikely to talk).  Many bird sounds will be easier for your bird to imitate than talking, so he'll probably end up doing them instead.  But it's not bad for the bird, who will probably enjoy it.    P.S. to Aravyndra: Our amazons' sleep cages are by a similar wall clock, but they prefer to imitate the burglar alarms they hear on stupid TV commercials, or the sound of the wood chipper our next door neighbor was using.  The clock just isn't loud and obnoxious enough to interest them.  But they're amazons - cockatiels can't duplicate a siren at full volume.

3arJsZ91aa	What do your parents do to help?  I think you are being great in caring about your grandmother's cats, but understand that it is difficult for you to do anything much to help.  Have a look at the link.  There are some places in Michigan which do free neutering, but you would have to ring and find out.  They might also offer to take them in if you explain to them your concerns.  The other alternative is to get the SPCA involved.  Do try to enlist the help of a parent though.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	You are trying to make decisions about her cats.  Her cats, her choice.  You may not like it, but you are acting childish.  She neutered the male so for the moment kittens shouldn't be a problem if the cats are indoors.    ADD:  IF all that is the case ( not included in your first post)  Then the cats need to be rehomed.  It sounds like it is more than Grandma can take care of.  As her grandchild you should be helping her in acting like a CHILD and refusing to speak to her.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Communicate with your grandma. Silence can be devastating for her. You can start by respecting her wishes, then you can persuade but not force her to consider your suggestions about the cats.

It sounds like she is much better off having her cats for company, than the likes of you.    Using emotional blackmail to get someone to do what you want is a nasty way to deal with someone you supposedly care about, but when you do it to an old person...it's called elder abuse. Purposely ignoring or emotionally neglecting an old person in order to control their behavior is against the law.    What you are doing is elder abuse and you need to stop before you cause her major emotional trauma.     Here is a website that tells you what elder abuse is. You'll find the type of abuse you are inflicting on your own grandmother under the title "Nonverbal psychological elder abuse" a small way down the page.  http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_ab...

You may need to get the authorities involved for the sake of the cats as well as your Grandma's own health. Living in that kind of filth is not only unhealthy for the cats but also for her.

Sometimes the humane society will spay them for nothing.  But it may not be money that worries her.  It may be that she worries the cats my die or change with spaying.    She's old and has earned the right to spend her money any way she wants and the RGB's may be her only joy.    Why not call the humane society and see if she qualifies for free spaying.  If she dies you're going to feel very badly about not speaking to her and wasting all this time.  I know, when my father died I wished I had spent more time with him. Was the litter before or after the Tom was neutered?|`|j2yHX3mOaa	Feel sooo sorry for you, I completely understand your emotional stress being a fellow cat lover. Firstly as you have tried your hardest to sort these cats out and your grandmother just wont cooperate I would tell someone else, in england we have the RSPCA who would take the cats off of her and make a court order making sure she could'nt keep anymore cats, they have the legal power to stop animal cruelty, try phoning the RSPCA or whatever it is you have in your country (there must be somewhere in your country that has a similar power). Dont feel guilty cause of your grandma she obviously does not know how to care for animals and they need your intervention to make sure they are looked after, as for your grandmother she sounds like she's using the cats too get attention something that probably needs looking at by a trained psychiatrist.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Since you're willing to pay half the cost for each cat to be spayed, maybe take half the cats and get them spayed? It works out to the same amount of money and reduces the chances of future litters by half - which is far better than the current situation. It also might motivate grandma to find a way to get the others done.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Someone needs to call Animal Control on both of you!

AA12083992	Why would anyone want to teach a dog the house is their toilet? You will get tired of the smell. The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck|`|PvaxJHLuaa	negative sanctions for behavior you dont support. get a squirt bottle with water and spray her when she goes sniffing around for that nice spot on the carpet. and i always pick my puppy and run them to the pee pad. (she usually holds it once i touch her so shes not a sprinkler when i run her over to one) lol|`|ltP1gO4taa	I would get rid of the pads if I were you.  And the bathroom is too big.  Get a cage (crate) that is just big enough for him to stand up and turn around in.  You don't want too much room, or he'll pee on one sid and sleep on the other.  If you want to plan for the future many companies sell cages with a temporary divider so the cage can grow with the dog.  Alternatively you can put something in the cage to take up the extra space.      This is the method I've used with every dog I've had.  I got my current dog at 12 weeks of age and she NEVER went in the house, not once.    Keep your puppy in the cage any time you can't supervise him.    A puppy can hold it in about an hour for every month of age. For instance, a 3 month old puppy can hold it for about 3 hours.    All you have to do is take your dog outside, on a leash, to the area where you want her to eliminate under the following circumstances:  First thing in the morning.  About 15 minutes after eating.  About 15 minutes after drinking water.  Immediately after a play session.  Right before you put him in the cage.  Immediately after you let him out of the cage.  AT LEAST every x number of hours. (1 hour for every month of age.)    Remember, your puppy can only hold it for 1 hour per month of age. So if you have a 3 month old puppy, you are going to have to get up and take it out every three hours during the night if you want to be successful.|`|ard3L0hHaa	Try a different kind of pad.  The disposable ones tend to create a noise that some dogs don't like when being wetted.  Try a reusable pad.  They absorb better without the sound and since they are reusable they end up being cheaper in the long run.  My sister's toy poodle didn't like the disposable pads and the reusable ones were just the ticket.    Add:  Ignore those who will tell you not to pad train.  I think it is just responsible to ensure that the dog will have access to a means to potty 24/7.  Not to mention sometimes it just isn't safe for some dogs(especially the smaller ones) to go outside.  In my area I have seen many animals BIGGER than my sister's toy poodle carried off as a meal by various predators.  Pad training has been the safest way for her, just as  it may be for you.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Goldfish tanks need weekly water changes. They are very messy fish, which only increases as they grow. Lethargy is a sign of water quality problems.    Test your water, do a partial water change and gravel vac. If there's any ammonia or nitrite reading on your tank you'll need to do several water changes a week until this has dropped to 0 and held there.    For 3 fancy calico Goldfish you need at least a 35-40 gallon long tank minimum for juveniles, larger for adults. For 3 calico common/comets you need twice that again as they get substantially larger.

There are commercial diets for dogs that are strictly vegetarian for dogs who are allergic to animal protein (rare, but true). Veggies & fruits would not be harmful for them to eat.

This is interesting I didn't know the pips had poison. etc|`|cZCaHWhOaa	Dogs can eat apples but do not to let your dog eat the apple seeds.|`|ua61WAvIaa	I was worried when my labrador ate all the plums off our tree - pips and all. He loved them. He also ate  dates from our palm trees by the bucket load, again with big seeds. So I found a website called peteducation.com and it lists all the foods dogs shouldn't eat and the reasons why, and I'm happy to say apples aren't on it so your pooch should be alright. Its a good site, check it out.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Why not??? Check out the ingredients on some of your gourmet type dog foods -- like Merricks.  they have apple in many of them.  The dogs like it and fruit in general is good for them.    My Briard (the soccer player) spent the summer running around with his Boomer Ball and when he got thirsty went and picked peaches off of the overhanging branches of my neighbor's peach tree.  He'd bring them up on the shady porch and eat 'em and spit out the pit.  Gatorade!    (At first I thought he was picking them up off the ground, but one time he came back with leaves from the tree too so I knew he was getting up on his hind legs to pick them -- well, he picked those branches bare!)|`|H8zItnVwaa	Apples are great for dogs, but make sure to remove the core and any seeds.  The seeds contain cyanide which is poisonous.  That does not mean if the dog ingested a few seeds there is cause for alarm.  On a constant basis, yes it would be harmful.

ArtZzDU8aa	Go adopt from a shelter, those kittens need love and they come with shots and are already spayed/neutered.    EDIT: If you are worried about the cost then don't bother getting one! Animals need regular and emergency vet care which can get costly. Not to mention quality food and all the supplies that are needed for a pet.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Don't go to any pet store that sells pets unless it is one with an adoption center with agencies you know. These cats are warehoused and not taken care of properly. Get one from the shelter and take it to the vet immediately. The kittens only survive if someone adopts them. The price usually includes the vaccinations, and spay/ neuter costs. Have fun with the new member of your family. Cost very, aprrox $50.00 and up.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Unless "Petland" allows shelters to have their cats at the store do NOT buy a kitten from them.  Pet stores get their kittens from what's known as "mills" where animals are kept in very horrible conditions and litters churned out repeatedly - like they're a "mill" churning out a product.    They're also not tested for diseases and so you can end with a kitten that dies within the first few months you have it.  They also don't sell altered animals - so you have to cover that cost.  If you want to read about what these "mills" are like read this article from wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_farmi...     If you adopt from a shelter you'll pay an adoption fee of about $100 and you'll get a kitten or cat that's already spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, deflead, dewormed, tested for disease and microchipped.    Don't have $100?  Well then you sure won't have the $300-$400 to get all of these done for a pet store kitten!|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Why would you want a cat mill cat?  I am getting my cat at a KILL shelter in march.  shame on you for not adopting.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	If you buy a kitten at Petland YOU are financing kitten mills. PLEASE don't!|`|s4iVl04raa	Check the local newspaper, shelter, adoptapet.com, or petfinder.com. There are so many animals that need homes, especially kittens. Adoption is usually free, or may require a small donation.|`|yGteqZoCaa	why even pay for a cat or pet.  Look in your local newspaper and you will find that people give pets away for free all the time.  Young ones, old ones, cats or dogs, even birds and horses.  So just look around first before spending your money.  Good luck.|`|36c7247679a853a5f8f5039bbfa74097aa	kittens in pet stores usually come from back yard breeders and if you knew what these people did you would NOT buy a kitten from a pet store. There are many animal rescue groups out there which are not-profit and do their work purely for the love of animals. Rescue animals come with all their vet work done for a small adoption fee. You can google 'animal rescue groups' ... most have profiles on them with photos too.|`|6HC0rRTsaa	I agree with Freya. All of my cats, all of them were kinda strays. My oldest one, midnite I did adopt from the animal shelter. The next two, my son found in a house he was remodeling. They were so small and young, we had to bottle feed them. The next one my husband found in the middle of a highway here in town. Couldn't figure out why she wasn't afraid of the cars, until we found out she was deaf. The next one, we were on a wrecker call in a really bad drug neighborhood, and I saw her playing in the ditch, got out of the truck and asked the guys who were being arrested who she belonged to, They said you if you want her. So there's my story. PLEASE adopt from a shelter though. They have been loved and taken care of and also because I am a BIG supporter of the ASPCA.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Well, not to be evasive but that would be a question best asked of someone at Petland.  Puppies and kittens are generally expensive no matter where you go, especially if they're purebred.  But another one your answers is right. The best thing to do is to adopt your baby either from a shelter or from someone who has one that needs a good home.  She's also right about it being expensive. Think long and hard before you do anything.|`|qm4Mbhwwaa	Well expect to pay 25 to 150 for a kitten depending on the breed and how old it is, and sometimes its best just to resort to good ole give away cats. Just depending if your want a Himalayan or american short hair you could check vets. Also if they come with papers and are an expensive breed be prepared to spend more the 150. good luck hope this helps
ZNDqYUwkaa	If you're worried, call your vet and tell him/her everything, but it is probably just that she got a bit cold and maybe had a bit too much running.     If she is eating, drinking and going to toilet in her usual routine, she should be fine, but if she is still sleepy tomorrow, definitely call your vet, just to be on the safe side.|`|vQJf2mIKaa	you should make sure your dog has plenty of water its obviously  lacking water so don't be worried|`|SaU9i4Qbaa	your right to be a bit worried. a sign of a dry nose on cats and dog shows that their is something wrong. a healthy cat and dog has a wet moist nose. your dog could have caught a cold. take a day trip to your vet just to be on the safe side x

4Sf8hgy3aa	Stop with Purina ASAP  Purina, Iams, Pedigree, Beneful, even Science Diet--- essentially anything you can buy at a grocery store---stay away from.    Good foods are food that do not contain cheap fillers that dogs cannot digest (corn, soy, wheat, white rice, etc) or animal by-products. The first ingredient listed should be meat. Ie. beef, chicken, lamb, fish. Meat meal or animal digest is not acceptable.    I recommend these foods:  Blue Buffalo  Innova  Canidae  The Goodlife Recipe  California Natural    My personal favorite is Blue Buffalo:::  http://www.bluebuff.com/    Do some research of your own before you make a decision.   http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/brand...    Raw and prey model diets are also a great way to go.  http://www.barfworld.com/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_feeding    Good luck|`|AA12083992	Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available. If you want to learn more check out: http://www.sagekeep.com/petfood.htm    www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359& more=1    http://animalark.eapps.com/animal/PetFoo...|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Well no wonder. Purina is a pretty crappy quality dog food, so I'd switch her to a higher quality dog food. Remember to switch gradually.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. If you can't find a food, most of the high quality food brands have websites with store locators on them.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (Excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Even more!)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs. BARF Diet)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...

2Zb0eNfeaa	You can do a few things.   1. make sure you have a new airstone   2. cut off any extra airline tubing you might have  3. move the airstone higher in the tank so that the pump doesn't have to work as hard   4. you may have get a bigger air pump|`|6L0tVhn7aa	Is your pump rated high enough for the tank? if the volume (weight) of the water is greater than the rating of the pump then it's going to struggle to push air into the tank.|`|nkJdQeI0aa	Not completely sure, but recently came across a cool site that might have your answer - AquariumDoctor.com - I was reading about plants there.|`|b28575cda6dd4d85b7ebf0f8185b9849aa	Move the Air stone (with the air pipe) up and down to see if its is a problem of low pump pressure or blockage.

qR3MYSOIaa	Upper respiratory infection, it's common in kittens who's mothers weren't up to date on their shots.  The vet will give drops ointment for the eyes.

She'll be fine.|`|YBcB0732aa	Upper respiratory infection.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	Sounds like she just has a cold (hopefully).

ArtZzDU8aa	Step on it?    No, but maybe some bitter apple spray on the bars will deter him.|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Here are some things that may help:    1. From Lucy the Hamster Vet: Bitter apple sprays DO work. Within a week of giving it to my hamster, it never chewed on the bar again! They sell this online and probally at a local pet store. (Do not buy one from the food store, make sure it's pet-safe!)    2. Get some new chew toys, if you have some he may not like them, try something new.  Some prefer the flavored wooden toys.  You can also try the ones that look like plaster (they aren't) that contain some minerals and often look like little ice cream cones - they're good for grinding down long teeth.    3. Get a salt and mineral lick to hang in his cage, he can lick/chew those as well and it may provide something he's lacking.    4. Definitely check the length of his teeth, if they're too long that can cause problems too.  "As you may know, hamster incisors grow perpetually.  This may be a problem if the hamster chooses not to gnaw to file down his teeth. You should inspect your hamsters teeth regularly.  If they are getting too long, the hamster will not be able to eat properly.  Also there is a condition called malocclusion which is an inherited misalignment of the teeth.  A hamster can die from starvation with this problem, but there is also a risk that the teeth themselves will grow until they penetrate the skull, killing the hamster.   The teeth in this case need to be clipped.  A vet can trim them for you.  If your hamster has maloccluded teeth, you will have to have this done regularly, about every other month, but you should check his teeth routinely when you clean his cage.  The vet can show you how to use baby nail clippers or nippers to keep the teeth at the right length if you are brave enough or independent enough to do this yourself." (1)    "The easiest way to avoid hamsters getting overly long teeth is to make sure it never happens in the first place. This is done by making sure your hamster has predominantly hard food to eat, like seeds, chew sticks and even bits of stale dog biscuit. There are many hard commercial hamster treats available to help keep the hamster's teeth and belly happy. Even chewing timothy hay helps wear the teeth down at a steady rate." (2)    The product links below are simply to give you an idea of what to get, I don't work for and I'm not attempting to endorse PetSmart    Good luck and please contact me if you'd like any additional help :)|`|nmzpdvkqaa	give him to me i need some snake food.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	lmao! mine does that too.  it means hes bored and wants to get out.  they sell this apple spray stuff that you can spray on the bars and they dont like the taste of it so they stop.    i will try to find the link and re-post it :)|`|c2YcBbXyaa	move him into an aquarium........|`|aF0DRDwnaa	lmao . Oh my god I forgot how annoying that was until I just read this. I use to hate that! You could always get him or her an aquarium instead of a barred cage. They aren't too expensive either (though it's been about 5 years since I last had one). Or they sell certain ones that are just plastic encased with accessible tunnel extensions. You could try chew things but they might not be occupied by it for very long. I swear they know it's annoying lmao.|`|EHozsofQaa	Do you have to keep the cage in your bedroom? I would move it into a different room if I were you... I used to have a hamster when I was a teen, and I used to put his cage on a separate piece of furniture in a little corner of the kitchen. This way, nobody in my family would hear his night time gnawing on the bars.|`|M4E9XIFgaa	Get him something to chew on they have wooden blocks and such you can buy that my stop the bar chewing for a softer sound of wood.  Or move the hamster into a different spot.|`|2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	Get him some wooden blocks to chew on.  He's chewing on the bars because he needs to work his teeth.  They love to chew on wooden blocks, toilet paper rolls, sticks, etc.  It helps their teeth and it keeps them entertained.|`|UT9Wlu5Faa	well. It looks like this is a classic case of " I did not do enough research before getting my pet"  You should know that hamsters are mostly nocturnal and therefore is bout to stop u from sleeping.... Try putting some vegetable oil on the wheel to make it run smoother though....|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Well I had a hamster that did the same thing I mean the only thing you can really do is buy some wood sticks and your hamster might chew those up instead and also maybe buying your hamster a treat that's shaped like a log and it will eat it bit by bit but its very hard to stop them from biting on the cage bars or from exercising on the wheel because they are nocturnal and they are way too excited at night. Also I think some pet stores might have covers for the bars but I'm really not sure you may have to google it or ask around in pet stores.     However, hamsters are fun I wish I could have another one since mine died like 5 years ago I hate that they have a short life span.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	Excessive bar chewing is a common problem and is often associated with boredom.  It is probably worth investing in a few new toys to keep him occupied.  If this doesnt work, and you really cant take the chewing, you may have to consider transferring him to a tank style cage.  Zoozones are great and offer plenty of room for your hammy friend, and are relatively cheap.  Just you may have to mesh the top so he doesnt get out. (they are actually guinea pig cages, but make fab hamster cages, i have my robo in one).  Also keep an eye out for hammys nose, persistent chewing can often cause injuries to the nose.    Good luck!|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Switch him to a bin cage. Bar chewing is a very dangerous habit for your pet which can cause things like misaligned or broken teeth, brain damage and even death. It's also almost always a sign that the cage is significantly to small or lacking in enrichment.|`|ZCBotgcIaa	Get him some chew toys, like wooden toys, or rubber ones. If it's still annoying you, take the cage out of your room, and leave it in a room, that no one's resting in.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	If your water company used chlorine, technically it would be partially true, but most water companies have switched to using chloramine which does the same job but does NOT evaporate. There are also various metals a conditioner would remove that do not evaporate either.    Conditioner is a must.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	It's true that chlorine will evaporate but not cloramines and heavy metals, like zinc, therefore a "conditioner" must be used each and everytime you do water changes. It's not expensive either, 3 bucks at the most and it last a long time.|`|UT9Wlu5Faa	Chlorine is the most dangerous of them all and thus if chlorine is gone then most fish can deal with the other one... however just to be on the safe side i let my water sit for one week. I have two pails next to the sink that is constantly filled with water...  O and here's a good idea... Use your old aquarium water to water your plants.. It works just like fertilizer.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	Have to agree with the other to 'top contributers', chlorine is a very unstable chemical and can dissipate or be removed by simple aeration of the water, however chloramine is a very stable chemical thats just as lethal as chlorine but will not dissipate so the use of a conditioner that states clearly on it that it neutralise's chloramine is a must. Most conditioners that neutralize chloramine will also deal with heavy metals. I can fully recomend Seachem's Prime for both fresh and saltwater.
8ba614025fcbb970cec97e3f152d6d21aa	My cat understands certain things:    Sit  Beg  Come get your 'nuggles - meaning I'll pet you  I have two whistles, one for a treat, one for dinner.  For the treat he comes running.  For dinner he strolls over whenever he's ready lol.    It seems to me that when my cat is happy, he sleeps with me at night.  For example, if I play with him, groom him and snuggle him a few times in a day, he'll sleep with me.  If I don't, he sleeps in the closet.  He also greets me at the door when I get home and then I pet him on the couch for a few minutes before I start dinner.    I think cats are pretty selfish creatures.  I think they show you they love you when they let you spend time with them...my guess is my cat thinks "She's been nice, I'll let her pet me for a while" :)    Best of luck|`|44kEtDvIaa	They don't necessarily understand your exact words, but they do pick up on your emotion and can tell love from anger.  They will show their love with a soft purring, cuddling, rubbing up against you and licking.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Purring when you touch them.    Arching their backs and rubbing against your legs.    Giving a "meow" to me then stretching over onto their backs and purring when I walk into the room.    Head butting.  My Ragamuffin literally SLAMS her head into mine if I put it down for her.

If you speak lovingly, they may come closer to you, while a stern or angry voice will scare them away.  Cats also understand body language.  If they notice you moving very quickly or aggressively, they may run away.    Cats express emotion with body language.  If a cat's tail points straight up, he is comfortable with you and his surroundings.  If he is quite happy, the very tip of his tail may rock slowly back and forth.  If he is irritated or scared, his whole tail will flick back and forth quickly.    Cats express affection with touch.  If a cat is particularly fond of you, he will touch you with a paw, rub his body against you, or even sit on your lap or chest.  A cat that just rubs his face against you is marking you with his scent; he is saying "you are mine!"  He may also become attached to your scent: if you find him sleeping on your laundry pile or used clothes, it may mean your scent makes him comfortable.    If you want to tell your cat you feel comfortable with him, look him in the eyes and blink very slowly.  He may blink back.  A slow blink means "you're okay with me".
AA12083992	That behavior is called coprophagy and many dogs do it. It could signal a vitamin deficiency in your dogs diet. Are you feeding a food with fillers (corn, wheat, animal by products) instead of a good quality food?                                                                                                            It could also go back to the fact that our dogs ancestors learned to eat stool to keep their dens clean. Even our modern day dogs eat their pups feces to keep the whelping box clean.                                                                                                  Finally the dog might just be bored and looking for something to do or attention. He did get attention, right?   You can try switching to a higher quality food. One that has meat (not meal) as a first ingredient and no corn, wheat or animal by products. Wellness, Innova and Merrick are in that group.   Put the cat box where the dog can not get to it, maybe use a baby gate for the room the litter box is in.     CAUSES OF COPROPHAGY  The exact causes of the habit are unknown, but several ones have been described. There appears to be some connection between excessive coprophagy and nutritional deficiencies, stress, boredom, unsanitary rearing conditions, and restrictive housing. Overly restrictive or isolatory confinement has been linked to a higher incidence of coprophagy in dogs. Dogs kept in kennels or basements are more likely to engage in the habit than dogs kept in close contact with people. Eating non-food materials (pica) has also been reported similarly increased among dogs housed under restrictive conditions, suggesting that both coprophagy and pica may be influenced by environmental stress.A common assumption holds that coprophagy is related to some sort of nutritional problem or deficiency. The theories generally focus on one of two possibilities: (1) coprophagy is a search for nutrients lacking in a dog's diet or (2) the habit is motivated to consume undigested nutrients passed into the feces. Vitamin B12 and other B-complex vitamin deficiencies have been frequently implicated.    In one study, rapid control of coprophagy was achieved by increasing the ration's protein and fat content, reducing the amount of carbohydrates, and supplementing with brewer's yeast. Another obvious nutritional possibility to consider, and one perhaps more directly linked with a nutritional function, is that coprophagous dogs may simply be harvesting undigested food passed in the feces.Enzyme Conservation  Besides undigested food and other nutrients, feces is a rich source of digestive enzymes and bacteria. Whether or not the ingestion of alimentary bacteria is of benefit to dogs is not known, but some evidence suggests that digestive enzymes may play a role in the control of coprophagy. Many veterinarians and dog trainers report anecdotal success when a meat tenderizer containing papain (a proteolytic enzyme) is added to the coprophagous dog's diet. In one study 4 of the 9 dogs treated with a plant-based enzyme supplement responded favorably to the therapy. http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dog-health/...|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Put the litter box where the dog can't get to it.  Baby gate it off in a room.  Hope you have both your cat and dog on worming meds.|`|GotzM1BTaa	Cat... stuff... has enough undigested protein in it (as cats are carnivores and have a high protein intake) to make it attractive to dogs.  First, make sure that his food is of a high quality and contains everything he needs - a vitamin may help.  Also make sure the cat box is nowhere near anything the dog considers "his" - especially sleeping areas - some dogs will consume waste left in their den area in order to keep it clean by instinct.  If he were eating his own waste or waste outside, there are products you could use to make it unappealing to him.  However, cats can be quite picky about food and litter, and you would not want to disrupt a well behaving cat in those respects if it is avoidable.      Is there a location you could move the box to that the dog would not be able to access?  Could you move it to a table, perhaps in a laundry room or something, perhaps with furniture nearby that the cat could use to jump/climb?  The dog may be too small for this to work, but you can also turn the door toward a wall or corner - if the cat fits and he doesn't, then that may solve it.    Beyond that, you mostly have the usual sorts of training, which should help but will take time.  He should be prevented from doing this though, as many litters would be harmful if consumed by dogs, even if the waste itself may not be.  Keep a close eye on your dog - especially if the litter is a clumping variety.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	I don't know why dogs love cat s**t so much! my dog did the same, and we got that same litter box and the dog still wouldn't stay the heck out of it. What we did was put the litter box in the laundry room where we can close the door to keep the dog out. We cut a hole in the wall where it's hidden and put a cat door so that we can't see the hole in the wall, but the cat can go in there and do his business in his box.|`|mnb0PxRhaa	Boredom may be part of the problem but in my considerable dog experience...ALL dogs love cat ****.  I keep my cat box in a room with a baby gate across the door.  The cats can hop over, the dogs can't.  If you have a big leaper, as Jacks can be...get a really tall gate and put a climber or bookshelf by it so the cats can get over it.  Another choice I used once was keeping the cat box in top of a utility table in the work room.  Tha cats had no problem being self conscious using the box on the table.

AA11567932	Male cats do this often like us really. If she has been neutered then dont worry because she cannot get pregnant. If he has not been neutered it might be worth doing it to calm him down.

ArtZzDU8aa	If he ate one then it will probably just pass (depending on the size of the dog). But if he ate a lot then this could cause a blockage in his digestive system and he will need a trip to the vet and surgery. See if he is passing stool and look for the packing peanuts. If he seems to be in discomfort take him to the vet and if he does not pass them or throw them up then take him in as well.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Yes.  They will not digest.  Whether or not you should see a vet will depend on how much he ate and if he is starting to act differently than normal.  Could get constipated.  Any signs of a problem and see your vet right away.|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	It;s dangerous for any living being to eat packing peanuts. Studies have shown that feeding lab animals relatively large amounts of styrofoam over the course of several weeks has led to damage of the liver, kidneys, brain and lungs. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has labeled styrofoam as a possible carcinogen, as well.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Yes    They are basically Styrofoam which consist of many chemicals that are probably toxic if ingested.     If your dog ate some please see a vet.|`|OB4fmosJaa	Of course it is, they are made from styrofoam.|`|49IbcrLaaa	Absolutely! It can clog the intestines, they can choke, it can cause problems with the chemicals they make them with... If this happened to your dog I'd recommend a vet visit.

AA10097817	I don't know about that...the care of a dog brings its own stresses. I know. Believe me, I know.|`|AA11457471	Over the years I've adopted a number of dogs. I can tell you this, after adopting adult dogs I will probably not adopt a puppy again. It was great getting a dog that already had some basic house manners & was past the terrible chewing stage. Plus, I knew the pups had a much better chance of getting adopted.    Go to your local shelter & let them know you want a good beginner's dog. Avoid those that are aggressive with other dogs & those that are very fearful/ timid as they tend to be fear biters. That won't help the social anxiety at all.   I'd also avoid the breeds that tend to dominate their owners as they need a confident, assertive owner. You can do some research on this.  Look for the ones that are standing quietly at the front of the cage wagging their tails.     You may also want to consider contacting a Golden Retriever rescue group. A Golden would be a great starter dog.  Greyhounds are also easy keepers if they're walked regularly. Many of the rescues insist on a fenced yard, though.    Whatever you get please sign up for a basic obedience class ASAP! It's a great way to bond with your new dog.    Best wishes & good luck!  >^..^    Add: Although you should feed them whatever they've been eating till they settle in, keep in mind that the best investment you can make regarding your new friend is feeding them a really good food.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Depends on if you live in an apartment or a house .. have a large yard, or small one .. whether you can give lots of exercise, or not.  Then check the local animal shelter and you will eventually find a pet that needs you as much as you need it.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I'm not really sure but perhaps a puppy that will make you smile and probably an older dog. Visit the shelter and pick the one that doesn't bark at you and that feels like there's a connection.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Why not check out your local shelter.  There are dozens and dozens of dogs to choose from.  Mixed and purebred, puppies and adult dogs.  You can go down there and interact with the dogs to see which one best fits your personality and life style.  That way, you can help a dog and a dog can help you.  Good luck!|`|zO7Wy2qSaa	great suggestion by the therapist...    having a furry friend around will indeed help you to breathe better. I would suggest having a labrador....as they are affectionate and loving.    Lab loves to be with you all the time and you can together with the dog to overcome the depression and anxiety. With such a friendly dog, you will be able to make and meet a lot of friends who loves furry friends.    Yes, to give the abandoned dogs a second chance, please adopt a dog from the shelters.|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	That depends on your means, lifestyle, accomodations, etc.    Here is a site that has several questions to ask yourself so you can narrow down your search:::  http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/selecting-...    Once you've decided on a breed, so some deep research and make sure you know what it needs once you decide to get it.  Good luck|`|11aoH0O5aa	Yes for sure . Go to a shelter and get a dog . They help alot and who knows maybe that dog will even help you become more social !!|`|E9kl3Oddaa	Definitely get a border collie.  I do not own one personally but a close family friend has two border collie mixes and they are the best dogs.  Very active yet loyal, guarding, and will snuggle with you for long long periods of time.  They are great dogs to have and gorgeous ones too|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Unfortunately this isn't something people other than you can make a choice on as none of us know what your preferences would be for dog breed.  What I will suggest however is go to a shelter and try to find a dog that matches your personality.  You'll know when you found the right dog for you.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	I would definately recommend a shelter dog. A mix, or a purebred, and definately one with some training. Just the thought of saving an animal's life and allowing another one to take their spot and live a bit longer can make anyone smile! Get a dog that is active, so that you will need to get out of the house and take walks, play fetch, and other fun outdoors activities. Also, try finding a group of people who can form a "play group" with their dogs. People that are your same age would also be great, so that you can form social bonds with people as and the pressure would be off because you are there for the better of your dog.
8NSh1D4Maa	Make sure you check with your local law enforcement and make sure they are legal there first.  In most places, they are still considered farm animals and you need to be zoned for livestock to keep them legally.  Also, please do realize that the pig in that film is a very young baby.  In real life, these pigs average 150 pounds full-grown.  While sometimes you'll find them around 60 pounds or less (still the size of a medium dog), these especially small specimens have a large number of health issues as their organs will grow to nearly the size of a normal-sized pot belly pig, and their body cavity does not have the space to accommodate that.  Make sure you have realistic expectations of a pig and also make sure your mother wants a pig as much as you- they live for 15-30 years, what will happen when you go away to college?  A dorm will not allow them and rentals will be almost impossible to find with a pet pig.  I know it's hard to wait for things when you're young, but you have a long life ahead of you!  It may be best to wait until you're out on your own and settled into a place where you can responsibly care for a pig for its entire life.  Pets are a big commitment, so make sure your family is in a place to make that commitment.|`|AA11457471	Good luck with that one.LMAO!  Do some research in case you get lucky.

djmqoFSTaa	Without a photo it's hard to tell...    She could be sluffing the false sole...  Or the farrier/trimmer could have cut out something.  Although a farrier would usually communicate to the owner what they are doing.    You don't say how deep the hole is also...if it's just a depression, I would leave it alone and pay attention to the ground that I didn't ride over small gravel that would press into the thinner area until it grows out some.  A week or so should do it.  With the hole...the sole is thinner and therefore she may be more sensitive to pressure on the sole.    I wouldn't think it was an abscess blowout...your horse would have been obviously lame if that was the problem.  And the hole would go into the hoof...very obviously.  If she's been lame lately...that could be it.    I'd give my farrier a call if you are wondering if he did it...or to ask.    And to the first poster...IF it was an abscess blowout....YOU DO COVER THE HOOF AND DUCT TAPE IT to prevent things from getting in the hole and causing further infection.  You can clean it all you want...and as soon as the hoof hits the ground...mud, dirt, pee, poop, shavings...if it's on the ground...will get back in there.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I agree with those that think it could be an abscess that surfaced.  The farrier may have taken away some of the sole, and that brought it closer to the surface so that it came through and drained.  I would soak it in warm water and Epsom salts, or as barefoot (on here) suggests, diluted apple cider vinegar which is more acid, and may be a better choice.  Now that it has drained, soaking just encourages any remaining infective debris to come to the surface and drain.  If the horse shows lameness,  It may be something else, or there can be more abscessed areas within the hoof that haven't drained.  It could also be a puncture, which can develop an anaerobic infection.  I think the vet should see it, especially if there is any lameness, and if you can't figure out what it is.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Take the duct tape off, first of all. Pictures would help but it sounds like a puncture wound to me. These can be serious, I'd bandage her foot properly and ask someone at your barn about it.|`|gzQAIahaaa	First of all are you retarted? take the duct tape off! everything needs air to heal. It may be normal as a part of her hoof coming off but in my opinion you should probably see a vet and apply a hoof oil mived with bluestone. This will help prevent infection and help it to heal.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Sounds like an abscess that's broken the surface.  You'll want to soak it in epsom salts daily for a while and keep it as clean as possible while it heals.  Additional information is here: http://www.ehow.com/how_2080398_care-hoo...  While most of the pain is gone when the abscess ruptures, it's still uncomfortable, I'd give her a bit of time off before riding again as well.|`|ndqjst7taa	1ST Don't put Duck tape on the horses foot, if you need to put something on it use vet wrap it's breathable. As for the hole call your farrier. She could have had a puss pocket and that's what cause the hole but i would really need to see a picture|`|K6lGQqTFaa	Sounds like a burst abscess, do keep it clean and probably best to take off the duct tape.  Google horse hoof abscess and try to find pictures to see if that's what happened.  There are also remedies there.  I would call the farrier or your vet too to have them check it out.  You want to make sure you treat the hole right or she could end up lame for quite a while.    Good luck!

YnG0Tjxjaa	Just keep doing what the vet has ordered. I hope everything works out well for her. Please don't bring her to a pound. At least find a friend to take her in if you can't afford her. It's heartbreaking to hear that you want to bring her to a pound. The Revolution should work. Your vets sound like they need more practice. It's too bad you couldn't find a real good vet before all this. (I have trouble finding decent vets too). Please try to hang in there and get your kitten better.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Yes - Revolution works quite well.  Not sure why he gave her the shot and then sent you home with Revolution as the Revolution alone would have quickly cleared the mites up.  One of my cats recently had mites and the vet put on a dose of Revolution and without a couple of days he wasn't itching anymore.    Her ears NEED to be cleaned out.  Sounds like she's had a bad infestation and there's lots of debris in there.  Get some ear cleaner at the pet store.  Scruff the kitten and then squirt the ear cleaner.  Massage the base of her ear to help loosen the debris and then put her down.  Note that she'll shake her head so best to put her down in the shower or bathtub.  That way it won't get all over you or your house.  Using a cotton ball or Qtip remove whatever debris is OUTSIDE the ear canal.  Do NOT poke the Qtip down into her ear.  You'll end up plugging her ear with debris or even rupturing her eardrum should she jerk when you do this.    Mites do clear up quite quickly.  They're probably already dead it's just she's got so much debris in there.  And it won't just disappear - it needs to be cleaned out.    edit: please don't take the advice of flushing the cat's ears with dish detergent.  Use an ear cleaner made for - and safe for - cats.|`|GduRpnn0aa	I'm sorry that you are so frustrated, but I totally see your point! Have you thought about using something more natural and gentle to remove the mites from your kitten's ears? I work in a Vet's office and if the cat owners cat afford to pay for the expensive stuff, then we always recommend using Ear Clear Drops for Cat Ear Mites. You can buy it online here: http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-ear-mite...    Left unattended, infection caused by cat ear mites can spread to the brain, possibly even causing death. The natural herbs found in Feline Ear Clear Drops help to fight viral infections, anxiety and depression. It also acts as a disinfectant.|`|VScRdzJKaa	When we first got my dog she had ear mites and our vet gave me ear drops for her. They went away within about a month. You can clean out her ears with a cotton swab.|`|r9wrDGm2aa	do not use a cotton swab!!!!!!!!    How are Ear mites treated?    One of the biggest causes of treatment failure is not removing the exudate BEFORE applying the medication. Every bit of the black, crusty exudate must be removed from the ear canal before any medication will work.  This is best accomplished by gently flushing the ear canal using an ear bulb (available from drug stores). Mix up a solution of warm water and liquid dishwashing detergent (just enough detergent to slightly color the water) and fill the ear bulb. The tip of the bulb is held loosely in the ear and the water/soap solution is gently squeezed in allowing it to bubble out carrying the debris (Never block the free passage of the solution out of the ear or you could rupture the ear drum). This process is repeated three or four times until the ears are clean. The ears are then rinsed with warm, clear water and dried. Q-tips are not recommended because they carry the dirtiest contamination deeper into the canal making the infection worse.    after doing this apply medication. soon earmites should be gone. good luck. also humans cannot get ear mites but your other pets can so you should treat them too.    also the revolution is one of the top three topical anti flea/earmite medication perscribed by doctors. the best things about it are that you only have to apply it once per month and it stays on through baths &it also suppresses heartworm, hookworm, roundworm and ear mites     the only bad thing is that it exposes pets to insecticide|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	get a new vet.    it might be just fleas, revolution will cure that too.
u4liwDhAaa	If I understand correctly, it sounds like your pooch just ate to fast.  Mine has a habit of doing that and then throwing up.|`|AA11457471	Your dog is a gobbler. She eats without taking the time to swallow it. Feeding her a high quality canned food will prevent that. You can also soak the dry food in water or broth till it's soft before feeding her.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Sounds like it is not able to digest the food so i would suggest getting a food that is in smaller oieces|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Something upset her tummy.  Kibble-fed dog's vomit is often fairly solid and foam-like, especially if they are not drinking a lot of water.  If the vomiting continues for more than 12 hours or there is blood in the vomit, or is accompanied by diarrhea or another symptom of illness, it's time for a vet visit.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Dogs don't chew their food well,so it often comes up undigested. If she doesn't vomit anymore,she probably just had a mild tummy upset or choked on a piece of food.She should be OK.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	If your dog is eating a dry food and drinking water shortly after, it will cause the food in the dogs stomach to expand. This causes them to vomit as they are fuller than when the food went down dry.    My cat was vomiting every once and a while and it was pretty much fully formed crunchies. It's a combination of her eating too much, too fast, and then drinking the water.    If it's not dry food and your dog is vomiting very often, you may need to see the vet. It's possible she/he ate something they shouldn't have and it's working it's way out.    When in doubt, ask the vet.|`|8OFTX19Yaa	my dog did that when i put a flea stuff on him he got over it in like  1 or 2 days.... but im not a doctor...|`|AA10691904	Milk probaly, cus when u drink milk it turns into a Cheese foam :) i know that trought experinace of drinking up till puking :D
YTGwHqOtaa	You can be leading your horse behind you and the whip in front of you. Then swing the whip to the ground on your right side then left. Keep walking as the horse see's the whip bouncing away from it, the horse will think the whip is scared and "running away." Or you could just stroke the horse with the whip very gently, though i do that with my horse who hasn't been afraid of it,so your horse might not like that.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	It's going to take a long time, so go slow. Reactions shaped by fear stick with horses longer than any other kind.    I would start with the whip being on the floor of the arena, taking the horse over while wearing it's halter, and letting him smell and touch it, if he will. He may not want to approach it. Next you can lean it against the wall and do the same thing. When this all works without a reaction, walk the horse around the arena and then approach the whip on the floor. Pick it up and walk with it. DO NOT face the horse. Don't move the whip, just walk with it. When that's OK, try dragging it behind you on each side of the horse. When that's OK, start to wave it from one side to the other as you walk, slowly and lazily.    Whenever the horse is tolerating the whip, reward him, ideally with a treat. Make sure you have a helper who gives him the treat while you are handling the whip, otherwise you are rewarding the stop, not tolerating the whip.    If he balks and tries to retreat, you need to hold him in place until he gives up. This could take a long time. You need to NEVER let him step back until he steps toward the whip. Every time. Even one step. The last thing he does before you release the pressure always must be to step forward at least one step. As soon as he does, slack the pressure to nothing. This is his signal that stepping toward the whip is what you want.    Most horses will balk but stand if you hold the lead rope hard (you will need a fair amount of strength and may have to lean into it). Face in the direction you want the horse to go. Usually after a period of time, the horse will suddenly start to pull back harder and then will capitulate and move forward. Slack the pressure immediately. If he goes for longer than five minutes or just continues to build the pressure, try to pull him to one side or the other and if he take any step, even slightly toward the object (he'll be off balance and will need to) reward him as if he had willingly stepped forward.    If all this is OK, stand far from the horse and pick up the whip while facing him. You'll need your helper to stand with him and hold his lead rope. Same rules as always and rewards when he tolerates facing you with the whip. When he tolerates this, at the distance, raise the whip to a position similar to the punishment position. Same rules.    Repeat this on all sides of the horse at the same distance.    Then each session, get closer.    At some point, you will be close enough to touch him with it. Don't start in the scary places where he was abused. Rub it on his body. Eventually he has to tolerate it being rubbed everywhere. Same rules as above about not letting him retreat, and giving him a treat reward for tolerating.    At some point, with all this , you will need to approach the scary place and hold the whip in what he may interpret as the punishing position. Move gradually and slowly each time you go here. Eventually you need to reach out from the punishment position and touch him with the whip.    This is going to take hundreds of repetitions. You should think of this as addiing exercises rather than finishing one and moving on. You need to do this every day you can. You need to be very careful not to reward him for retreating or attempting to retreat.    Don't do too much of this on any one day and do other things that he is comfortable with during the same session. Don't make this a big deal for him.    Don't be frustrated or disheartened by how hard this is or how long this takes. Horses learn differently from us. A human mostly can reencounter a scary situation and reason about it that since it was not hurt this time, that will be true next time, even if the situation is slightly different. Horses don't do that. If you are not comprehensive about going to every possible position of fear, you will someday accidentally go there and the horse will hyperreact.    I hope this helps. Good for you for working to save this horse. Best wishes!

ltP1gO4taa	Get a cage (crate) that is just big enough for her to stand up and turn around in. You don't want too much room, or she'll urinate on one side and sleep on the other. If you want to plan for the future many companies sell cages with a temporary divider so the cage can grow with the dog. Alternatively you can put something in the cage to take up the extra space.    This is the method I've used with every dog I've had. I got my current dog at 12 weeks of age and she NEVER went in the house, not once.    Keep your puppy in the cage any time you can't supervise her.    All you have to do is take your dog outside, on a leash, to the area where you want her to urinate under the following circumstances:  First thing in the morning.  About 15 minutes after eating.  About 15 minutes after drinking water.  Immediately after a play session.  Right before you put her in the cage.  Immediately after you let her out of the cage.  AT LEAST every 4 hours. (You can gradually extend this up to 6-8 hours.)    In the beginning you are going to have to get up and take her out every four hours during the night if you want to be successful.    Hope this helps.  I know that in many countries sending your dog away for training is the only option , but I agree that you should not send your dog away for training.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Get a dog cage big enough for her to comfortably fit in the start your training routine.  Let her out and immediately take her outside, bring her back and into the cage/crate.  Again in a few hours the same routine and immediately back in the cage with a small treat of some sort.  If she is as smart as you say she will get the message.  When you go out potty and put her in the cage until you return unless this is for the entire day.  IF the entire day then give the dog to someone who can properly care for and train her.    A vet visit might also reveal a urinary problem.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	send her to a potty training center
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Does your tank have proper lighting and a filter? If not, live plants won't do so well. They can be quite tricky and some are more difficult than fish. If you have a reasonable light you can try java moss or java fern, both need to be bound to bogwood or rocks.    As for the rock with algae, I wouldn't recommend it. Is this aquatic algae? In which case it could spread and cause problems, if its terrestrial it could be harbouring nasties.    Silk plants don't generally tear fins.|`|NUIrBHXgaa	A good tank plant for Bettas is java moss. it grows all over the ground and on things like driftwood. its mainly a ground cover plant. It also removes lots of nitrate from the tank.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Don't fill fish tanks to the brim. Bettas especially are known jumpers, leave about 1" between the water line and brim of the tank.    The UG filter should be ok as long as its not causing the Betta trouble when its trying to swim. UG's a fairly high maintenance and get grubby, don't forget to clean out the gunk underneath occasionally. I prefer HOB, Power and Canister filters personally. All filtered tanks need to complete the nitrogen cycle.|`|yV8fog7Paa	depends on the tank because good aquariums are gallon aquariums with lids most of the time. -.-   so fill it all the way up if you have a lid.  if you have under 5gal send the fish back because its cruel to leave it in it,.|`|VwJRT1SGaa	Betta's like a little light. I have a betta and i leave my lamp on he's swims around so happy and moves around the gravel. Let me say this clearly PUT A COVER ON YOUR TANK. Okay? This means a tank shouldn't be open. CLOSED. Betta's jump out of their tanks and you could come home finding your fish on the floor dry as a potato chip!  I say pick up a 2 dollar thermomator. Betta's are also air fish. SO leave some air for it.
ks2z4po8aa	I've had Boston Terriers as well as French Bulldogs for the past 20+ years and when it comes to children I ALWAYS tell people to opt for the Boston Terrier... Unless you genuinely know a great deal about dogs and behavioral training, a French Bulldog can be challenging... They're VERY people-oriented and they tend to gravitate towards one person... They're also A LOT stronger than they appear... Though they're just a tad bit larger and chestier than the BT, they can pull, shove, and pounce on kids... They can also be prone to resource-guarding - protective of food, toys, and even people... Granted, so can the BTs, but BTs just tend to be easy-going and active dogs... French Bulldogs also require special handling... They are prone to osteo / spinal problems... Not the kind of dogs that can actively run long distances, or climb over tree logs, or go up and down stairs frequently... They also need to be hoisted in a certain way and not all kids can bear that weight in the correct manner without doing damage... The well-bred Boston Terrier can be obtained from reputable breeders for under a thousand dollars... The well-bred French Bulldog costs at least 3 to 4 times that much... They're not a little more expensive, they're a lot more expensive... They're companion dogs (read about the history and why they were originally bred) and prefer the companionship of adults. They can be fine with children, but they're not intended as suitable dogs to give children...    Hope this helps you in your endeavors : )|`|mnb0PxRhaa	These are both excellent breeds and good with kids.  The Boston Terrier is more active and needs to be run out much more that the French Bulldogs, though all dogs need exercise of course.  But Bostons are hyper.  The Boston is a very sharp looking dog with its handsome black and white crisp marks.  But the Frenchie is more wrinkly, if you like wrinkle faces.  Now both breeds can have trouble delivering puppies since their heads are big but I think the bulldogs is a bit worse than the Boston in that regard.  Both train easily.|`|Tsjy6fu2aa	We've had three French Bulldogs, and each one has a totally different personality. We haven't had a Boston, but we can tell you everything we know about Frenchies.   They Shed. They need to be brushed. They shed to the degree that you can pull the hair, and it just comes out ( Around shedding time, anyway ).  They breathe heavily. If you don't mind snoring, you can sleep with them just fine, but otherwise they may keep you up.  Their faces need to be washed regularly ( At least once a week )  Bacteria can build up between the crevices on their faces. Now for each one of our Frenchies..  Coacoa - She is the most ' In your face ' dog. She was constantly on the lookout, and couldn't really bring her anywhere. She loved to pick fights with huge dogs, and really didn't like interaction. Nevertheless, we loved her dearly, and she was everyone's favorite. She had a very unique personality. From the day we got her, she was everywhere at the same time, She didn't have any fears.  Loulou- She's the lovebug of them all. She is almost the exact opposite of Coacoa. She loves to be held, and is always trying to get into your lap. She hates being locked up.   Francois - He's the boy of the group, and he really doesn't care what you do with him. He likes all the ladies, and gets jealous very easily.    From what we've experienced, French Bulldogs are very easy to train, and they're definitely a family dog. They shouldn't be kept in hot or cold weather for extended periods of time, as it effects their breathing. Water should always be kept available. We recommend this breed, they just steal your heart.|`|nZg00MQOaa	hi,    to know what type of dog will suit your daughter, you can use this dog finder match up http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=545261114984...  the goal here is to help you figure out what type of dog best suits your daughter's personality and lifestyle.

With my cat she was suppost to be an inside cat until one day the house door opened and she ran out as fast as she could but she came back like at 4:00am and everyday she'll leave and come back around the same time unless I called her. They usually stay close to home and the fact that I lived by the park helped alot cus she spent more time there than in the streets.|`|qicRLHMLaa	Cats should be kept indoors.

What do you do?    How about keeping your kitten safely indoors? It'll be much healthier for your kitten to be indoors where it's safe from poisons, loose dogs, other cats, cars, wild animals, malicious people... and so on (the list of dangers is quite long). Indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats and it's very possible to have a happy, well entertained indoor cat. It's also entirely possible to train a cat to walk on a harness/leash for safe outdoor trips.

You can build your cat an outdoor enclosure, or buy one like this: http://www.cdpets.com/enclosure_kits.php...|`|GotzM1BTaa	After living inside for a year I especially would not let her out.  The average life of an outdoor cat is 3-5 years.  An indoor cat lives 12-15 years.  I could not imagine condemning my own cat to those risks.    There are many, many things you can do to expand her space, amusements and such indoors.  I'd get some cat grass planted for her, a secure enclosed window box seat, a good cat tree (remember - cats live and explore in all 3 dimensions - expand their play area UP to save your own floor space and give them even MORE of what they need and want.)|`|S7uh7eG6aa	You have to decide whether she will be an In/out cat or not, If you are going to let her out you have to take the risk she will be lost or injured, but on the other hand she will lead a much more 'natural' cat life. She may live 20 years or 20 minutes if you decide to do this.  She WILL come home unless she is hurt so bad she can't. She won't get lost. if you decide to let her be an in/out cat, let her out just  half an hour before feeding times the first few times.  You have to decide. it depends where you live, how busy the roads are and your neighbours. In the USA the average lifespan of an outdoor cat is I hear very short, in the UK they live on average MUCH longer.|`|gf7nMEWHaa	never..?|`|j2yHX3mOaa	As long as she has been fixed and had her jabs then she can go out, dont worry too much about her being outside on her own, you could go out with her for an hour each day and build it up gradually, I would let her go out in the morning and during the day but make sure she's in at night. A tip for letting her out and making sure she will come back is to not feed her just before she goes out and then she will come back for food, tummy talks eh!!|`|BS8278aDaa	never let ur cat go out..thatz my advice bec i was also the owner of a cat and i let him walk around in our villa but he ran away how n when i dont know it was only a sec and he was gone now itz three day didnt saw him.....  now itz my advice to u not to let her go out...plz
kzgmFekKaa	As healthy as it is to eat a live chicken or a live cow.    There exists a risk of disease, and also because you are considering eating the thing live it could very well release hormones into its blood stream which may affect your health. Then there are bones, fur etc... Eeech.    Ultimately it's as unwise as eating roadkill or eating dirt.    And it's cruel and painful for the mouse too. If you eat any animal, I say give it an honourable and quick death (which is why I prefer roo meat, because it's a quick shot to the head from a range so it doesn't even expect death).    The fact you are asking this is either out of curiousity or because you wanna try it.

ltP1gO4taa	The vast majority of dog trainers are self taught.  I recommend you start reading a lot of books and attending seminars.  The University of North Texas does offer some classes aimed at animal training.  The only college to offer a degree in animal training is Moorpark College, but the emphasis is on exotics, like in a zoo.    The Coast Guard might be able to offer some training.    You might contact the people at Leerburg, Sirius Pups, or The Los Angeles Dog Psychology Center directly and see if they offer an apprenticeship program.    Read about the different methods of training.  Ed Frawley (Leerburg) and Cesar Millan (LA Dog Psychology Center) are similar, but their methods are far different from those of Ian Dunbar (Sirius Pups).    I'm attaching a few relevant links.    Good Luck!|`|W0buucLsaa	The thing is, the market for attack dog training outside the military and police force is not going to be huge, and as someone without the military or police dog training experience, you'd be way behind the competition.     There are several different kinds of dog training careers, though. I don't think this is a particularly good one unless you try to go about it the traditional way. I highly doubt that the USCG employs attack dogs... drug sniffing dogs perhaps. I'd think that the army would do that. Border patrol might also.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	You could try training in Schutzhund, which would be similar to the police dog work.   What it entails is obedience, tracking and protection, and typically involves GSDs but any breed I believe can participate.     You could try searching for local dog training schools, or find someone in your area that may be willing to let you shadow at their classes.     But really, being a Schutzhund trainer would not be ideal for a full time job. Simply as it's not exactly a well known sport to the general populous.|`|mnb0PxRhaa	The attack dog guys in the police force are cops.  The attack dogs guys for the miltary are in the military.

Also, Boerboels are not as far along on the domesticated ladder as most Mastiffs, so again, puppy classes and training so that it will be well socialized.

ZNDqYUwkaa	Firstly, out of a litter of herding pups, say border collies, not all of them will make good sheep dogs. Farmers usually keep the ones that show the best instincts for it and sell the others.     As for herding in numbers, yes there can be more than one dog herding the same flock. They follow the farmers commands and work as a team to guide and control the sheep. In small herds, one dog can do it alone.    Regarding losing affinity for man when a dog is an active working dog, nothing could be further from the truth. Because these dogs have such a high level of very acute training, are fulfilling the need to work and getting excellent exercise and leadership, these dogs make the most loyal and wonderful companions.     I'm not saying that some working dogs don't have problems with people or other dogs, depends on the socialization they had as a pup, but for the handlers, they are amazing.    Hope that helps.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	First, let me get technical.  In years past the AKC had one group for all Working Dogs which included the Herders.  Later they broke off the Herding Dogs into a separate group and just lately they started to split the Herding Dogs into Herders and Guards.  The Guards are usually heftier breeds that are more aggressive and less agile.  The Herders are more agile and less aggressive.  That being said, some guards will herd and some herders will guard (just ask that wolf over in that clump of trees eyeballing that Rottweiler -- ROTWEILLER??? -- Yes, Working breeds will herd, too)!!!    Usually 1 dog will work a small herd of sheep and 2 dogs are used for a large flock and work them as separate independent groups for Competition purposes.  In otherwords 20 sheep on the left with one dog and 20 sheep on the right with one dog.    All the dogs as puppies live with the flock to form a bond.  The dogs must feel an attachment to the sheep, just like they form a bond with us.    Check out www.AKC.org and look for Herding Events that might be in your area and go out to a few to see how they're run and to meet and talk to the competitors.    I know a little about this because I'm in Obedience and own Briards.    There are 2 different types of Herding -- Continental and Border.    This brings up another point -- Herding Style.  Border Collie herding style is different from Briard (upstanding dog) herding style.  And ... what they do here in the USA is tremendously different from what  they do overseas (where the actually make a living by using their dogs to herd their flocks daily).  The European dogs work much more independently than here in the USA where we feel we have to be in control and nag the dogs to death!!!    In Europe the dogs shed off the sheep with the red paint or collar on their necks (we don't do that here) and there's a great story in a book on The Briard by Diane Mc Leroth about the Academie at St. Cyr, which was the Herding Dog School.  In the morning they would open the doors and let the sheep and dogs out.  The dogs would take the flock through town and out into the fields.  They would spend all day out in the field and at dusk the dogs would bring the flock back through town to the Academie --  NO SHEPHERDS INVOLVED!!!|`|mTcUaxwpaa	I own a Border Collie, which are bred for hearding, my dog doesn't though. Avrage 2 dogs heard a flock no more than about 35. But sometimes it only takes 1 dog if there are only 10-15 sheep.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Well trained herding dogs don't interact with each other when working, they are far too intent on their jobs.  Ranchers with large commercial flocks will use multiple dogs on a single flock, when not working some dogs make great pets, some could care less about getting petting and loving and the job is their world.  For starting young dogs its best to have a small herd ( 3-4) of very dog broke sheep, training is usually started in a 30ft round pen and until a dog is proficient with his job most training is done here.  Not only are there trials with sheep but also ducks/geese,and cattle|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	depends on size of flock.  i have seen one border collie with a herd, up to four that worked in tandem.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Well right now you're asking about two different types of dogs.   There are dogs that were bred to guard the flock of sheep, and there's also dogs who have been bred to herd a flock of sheep.     Generally speaking the dogs bred to guard typically aren't "pets" because they more or less become a part of the flock.     Herding dogs on the other hand don't spend all of their time out with the sheep like the guarding dogs. So basically instead of a "life" herding is just a job for the dogs. Which means you can bring him/her in and he/she will still be a pet to you.  And yes two dogs can herd 1 flock at once. They tend to work together, and not get in each other's way.|`|ltP1gO4taa	Generally speaking, 2 dogs will not fight over a herd, because they are more interested in the other animals than they are each other.  I have seen 2 dogs herd a flock of no more than 30 sheep.    I don't know how most seriously competitive herders do it, but I have a neighbor who has a competitive herding dog, and they keep geese in there backyard for the dog to herd.  She basically herds anytime she is outside.  She also loves people.

LDdd6uAQaa	if a rabbit stops eating or drinking then i suggest you take it to the vet.  obviously check the water bottle for blockages too.  a rabbit can go down hill fast due to their high body metabolism, which means they need to have a constant supply of food to keep their organs functioning. without this their organs shut down.  Rabbits can stop eating or drinking for a number of reasons but it usually due to ill health. the most common cause is dental problems and digestive tract problems which must not be left.|`|ZUepJf63aa	my  cat was the same for a bit maybe it's in some sort of pain? while drinking you best bet is to feed it food with lot's of water in it like cucumber   be if i were you i would take it to the vet just in-case it not old age or something and more likely the tounge and gum@s    XX....x|`|xtQkSimpaa	Give him a quick check over - fur, bottom , teeth and also check bottle - sometimes they get blocked or rust.

Check his bottom for fly strike just because it seems that he is unwell.  Take him to the vet ok, best of luck with him. :)    P.s for now while you are waiting to go to the vets, give him as much food with high water content.
iVQULHqYaa	Get sachets of electrolytes from the vets. Vets often prefer to wait and put a dog on a drip and add to your costs. Electrolytes will stop her from becoming dehydrated, you should also buy a large syringe from the vet. Tip your dogs head forward and squirt a small amount towards her teeth. Do this every ten minutes and your dog will perk up.|`|MaAtfDV7aa	Throw some cheerios into her water bowl, and while eating those she'll get some water into her as well.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Don't stress!  Let the antibiotics do their job.  Her system needs to settle down and if she hasn't vomited since the injections, that's a step in the right direction.  Make sure she has fresh water (NEVER EVER ALLOW HER TO DRINK FROM THE TOILET!!!) available, and she will drink once she's feeling better.  You could try ice cubes, but unless this goes on for another 24 hours, leave her alone to recover.    You might try her on a little natural yogurt (it's a pro-biotic) and helps with uncomplicated cases of upset tummies.  But again, if she's not interested, let her be.  They go down fast, but like children, come back equally fast and if the antibiotics are going to work, she should be showing signs of feeling better within 48 hours.  If not, take her back to the vet.    Edit - If you don't know how to check for dehydration - pull some of her skin up from around her neck.  If it goes back immediately she's fine, if it remains up (it's called tenting) you do need to get her back to your vet.  But truly, provided she doesn't start vomiting again, or doing diarrhoea, I wouldn't panic unduly.|`|AA11097657	Make a sweet cup of tea and put some in her dish infront of her.

Her not being sick again is a good sign.  lf she's still not drunk in the next 48 hours then either ring the vet or take her back, she will start to dehydrate if she doesn't take in any liquids, although if she starts being sick again then take her straight to the vet as this will cause her to dehydrate faster.|`|J9AvKefwaa	just make sure there is fresh water available... keep an eye and make sure she isn't showing signs of dehydration... she will probably drink of her own accord soon.|`|DuSvfGDLaa	maybe shes not thirsty ur dog is probly sick and doesnt want to drink idk tho|`|gqWGUO3Zaa	dogs like fresh cold water this may sound sick but flush the toilet and he should drink that     ps it wont harm him as they drink out of puddles all the time and the have the correct bacteria to deal with it in there stomach|`|qoS3gUukaa	Put a nice big bowl of fresh cold water out for her, dab your finger in it so it gets her attention and keep trying to get here interested in it.

3FZhgqfNaa	The AKC will register puppies of AKC registered parents ONLY if the litter was born in the US.      This is what the application form actually says:    Use this application to register a litter of puppies bred and whelped in the USA from an AKC?-registered  female and an AKC-registered male of the same breed.    In order to individually register a foreign born dog, as opposed to registering the entire litter, you must provide the registration certificate and certified pedigree (in some countries it's called an Export Pedigree) of the country of residence.  So if it isn't recognized in it's country of residence, you can't then register it in another country.|`|AA10412922	The parents are both AKC registered,the litter can be registered as well|`|vPde97E2aa	Obviously,one can only register a dog that is recognized by the registry.  If you use AKC reg.dogs,their offspring are AKC registerable.|`|9kTejB0uaa	No - they would surely need an Export Pedigree from their country of birth.  In other words they would need to be registered in their country of birth first.  When we took our UK bred hounds to Canada (and imported a couple into Canada from the UK) we had to have Export Pedigrees to submit to the CKC for them to be registered in Canada.  And likewise when we came back to the UK, we needed similar paperwork to register our 'imported' Canadian bred with the KC.    I've always loved the look of the Coonhounds, all of them!    Edit - I guess you could lie about their country of birth, and get a friend over there to swear up and down that they were their's and had been born in the USA (but why would anybody bother?)
tXKMeirKaa	Hi Lady, What kind of bush is that and is it a live plant? I'd take it right out of there. The main this with a baby is to have very little furniture in their tank so he can find his food.  I'd have just one branch on one side of the tank with the heat lamp over it. The branch should be about half the height of the tank so he can get close enough to the heat to get warm, but not too close. He should be inbetween 8-10in from the heat.  The only other items you should have in this tank are a low sided food bowl and low sided water bowl. If your using sand place a few small flat rocks around the bowl so he doesn't track sand into veggies.  Babies get dehydrated quickly so you should be misting him with warm water twice a day to get him drinking. He should be dry before lights out.  You need to buy a new thermometer that goes over 120 degrees to make sure your temps are inbetween 100-105 on the basking spot on the branch. If it's not right he won't survive.  I would not be handling him till he's eating regularly. Lights should be on like daylight, 8-10hrs a day. Night temps over 60 degrees are fine.    Good luck!  Gina|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|LMflh3C4aa	He could be going through relocation stress, since he is so new, that could be why he isn't eating.  Also, offer crickets, smaller than the space between his eyes, and see if those perk up his appetite.  Those should be the majority of his diet right now anyway.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	Here is some important info for you to take a look at  a small care sheet type thing I made up:  They need at least a 40g tank - this is for each. You should never house two bearded dragons together as they can and probably will end up fighting  if not at first, they will with time as they get territorial. They get big in size, plus this size tank will properly distribute the needed temps on the hot and cool side. The hot needs to be 90-100, the cool 80-90 (add 10 to both sides for juveniles). The temp can go into the 70s at night throughout the whole tank as this is the normal temp they are used to at night. Beardies also MUST have an UVB light 10-12 hours a day, and need to be able to get within 6-8 inches of it to properly receive its rays. UVB helps some reptiles properly digest their food and receive the nutrients, especially calcium from their food. DO NOT use any type of under the tank heater or heat rock for your dragon or in the tank. Bearded dragons do not have heat sensors on their underside and many have experienced serious burns, some life threatening, due to these items.  Any type of loose substrate is bad for a bearded dragon as it can cause impaction (http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/im... The best substrates to use are repti-carpet, outside carpet, tile, non-adhesive shelf liner, paper towel, and even felt. If you have a bearded who likes to dig, you can place a towel or some paper towel, or even a small blanket loosely where he likes to sleep. This will safely give him something to bury himself into. Here are some pics of my Spike with her favorite blanky, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... and http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Beardies need both live food and salads on a DAILY basis. The salads should contain a mixture of greens, like collard greens and others plus an occasion of fruits and veggies mixed in. Visit http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co... to get a listing of the foods that are good, and foods to stay away from. For the live foods NEVER feed your bearded meal worms or mice. Meal worms have too hard of an outer shell with very little meat inside making them hard to digest. Mice, no matter what size, are very fattening and have very hard bones that are hard to digest. A bearded dragons digestive track is VERY small and at one point has like a kink in it, anything that has not been digested properly up to this point can get stuck and cause impaction. This is why the rule of thumb as far as size of food, whether it be salads or live, is it should be no bigger than the space in-between their eyes. Some better choices for live food are crickets, super worms (only when beardie is big enough), wax worms (only as a treat as they are fattening), calci-worms, silk worms, and the best are turk and dubia roaches. A lot of people freak when they first hear about the roaches, but they are not like your house roaches. I have a colony of dubia roaches. They are clean, don't smell like crickets do, easy to care for, and reproduce for themselves! Here are some pics of my dubia colony. There are more pics that you can scan through, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Always gut load all live feeders before giving them to your beardie. Gut loading is pretty much just making sure that the feeders you are getting ready to feed to your bearded are full and have recently eaten themselves. This fattens them up, puts more meat on them, and makes them nutritionally better for your beardie.  Example: Take the crickets you bought and put them into a container with cricket feed, fish food, or crushed dog/cat food over night and then feed them to your beardie.  Humidity is bad for a beardie and should only be at 30% in the viv. They normally do not drink from a bowl, but I keep a small one in my Spikes viv just in case. In the wild they drink from falling water when it rains as it falls down leaves and such. They also get it from their food, and it is good to soak your beardie as much as possible. You can soak (or give your beardie a bath) your beardie in like a plastic container, in the sink, or in the tub  wherever is easiest and more convenient to keep a good eye on him/her. Be sure that the water stays warm  you can test the warmth of the water by letting it run along the inside of your wrist much like when you test a babys bottle. Let your beardie soak for at least 10-15 minutes as often as you can. Soaking a beardie helps them get hydrated, helps them with shedding, and the warmness and pressure from the water helps things move through their digestive system better. A lot of beardies are known to use the bathroom while soaking. Be sure that the water is no deeper than about the knees to shoulder  your beardie should be able to relax comfortably without having to raise its head, etc. You may hear about some who mist the inside of the tank, this is okay as|`|VG7Q1BLPaa	I thought bearded dragon was a euphamism
im3vWyv6aa	I've been amazed at how well Frontline or Advantix works. I wish we had a flea problem right now (we have tons of snow), but in the Summer time we have terrible sand fleas because we live across the street from a lake and have very sandy soil. Frontline and Advantix works wonders - we rarely see a flea on our dogs. Without Frontline or Advantix the poor dogs would be miserable.    Best wishes...|`|SYrJiDKwaa	When it comes to flea, you have to spend the money.  Get the expensive stuff from a vet.

Fleas hate garlic and when your dog sweats his furr will smell of garlic only a little bit enough for fleas to sent it but not use. :D|`|UONwTWIQaa	well, lydia is right about the garlic, but wrong about the sweat.. dogs dont sweat! what i would do (at least it worked for my sister and i) is to ask your vet what the best yard flea spray would be... you will have to keep your dog out of the yard for a day or two after you apply it, but that should help... and also get your dog on frontline.. that was the best thing for me... she was constantly getting ticks and within a week of starting frontline, boom, no more ticks! however, i think some dogs do better on advantix - as far as i've read, if you try one, and it doesnt seem to work, the other should work better.. i think its different for every dog.. but, i do agree that you can give your dog a garlic pill each day.. wrap it in a treat and shove it in their mouth.. lol.. good luck, i hope they can help.. just give your vet a call, they should be able to tell you over the phone, no charge!|`|kHxqPIGeaa	Call your vet, they will have stuff  ( Front-line ) you can put on her. You'll have to continue the treatment. I have the same problem. Your vet might also have a pill ( I can't remember what this is called ) you can give her to kill all the fleas on her in about 30 min. I did this ( the pill once ) and it works great. The Front-line I do once a month. You will also have to get all the fleas out of your house ( if any ), your vet can help with this also. I'm not sure what you can do bout your yard maybe your vet can help there too. Good luck !!|`|AA11171398	Frontline.  Frontline kills all stages of fleas.  It attracts fleas that are not on your dog and kills them.  With monthly application, all the fleas will be dead in about 3 months.  Flea baths will really hurt your dog after a while, limit them to 1 every 6 weeks. With the Frontline, you wont need them.  Collars don't work, so don't waste your money. BioSpot sells all kinds of parasite killing products that are not as harmful to your pet.

They would need to be kept in a cool room with a tank with low water line and open lid, no lights also.

ZNDqYUwkaa	He doesn't despise you and I would imagine he behaves when on the lead because he has learned that the lead gives a correction for unwanted behavior. You need to take him to classes and learn along with him so that you can continue the work at home. It is a lifelong committment to keep your dog socialised, fulfilled and balanced.    It is unlikely your trainers hit him, people don't get into this business to abuse dogs, they do it because they love dogs. That said, all dogs and all trainers are different and what worked for this trainer may not have been a suitable method for your dog. I.e. police dog training on a soft breed like a labrador or papillion could be too dominating and hard. This may and I mean MAY be the cause for the sudden shyness.    You need to ignore this shy, cowering behavior and don't raise your voice. Raising the voice shows a lack of control and your dog needs to know that you are in control all of the time.This can be very hard with a dog that is rowdy and jumping around everywhere, but you need to exercise a calm, confident and consistent manner with your dog.    I have a whole information pack that I give to clients and can email this if you want it as it will help you better understand your dogs behavior, needs, what makes him tick and how you can set up your daily routine and change the way you handle him to give him a balanced, healthy life.     There is an important exercise with food and that is that you don't put it on the floor until the dog is calm and you don't let the dog then come to the bowl until you are ready and again, the dog is calm. Also, take him for a good walk before you feed (but let him rest a while) as this will allow him to "work" for his food and it will get rid of excess energy that he can use when misbehaving.    As for the timid behavior, ignore it. Don't give it any attention or affection by looking at or talking to it, it will look to you for your reaction. If you stay calm, the dog will learn there is nothing to be afraid of. If you react, give affection or try to console the dog, you will give it reason to believe it's fear is warranted and it will get worse.    For the peeing and pooing, you need to go back to the basics of potty training and start over.     Good luck and email me if you want that info pack or more advice.|`|AA12083992	First of all, you shouldn't send a dog to trainers, you should take the dog to trainers, obedience classes. The classes do not train the dog, they teach you how to train/handle your dog.  So, what did you learn while he was with trainers? Nothing. Enroll in obedience classes and take your dog so you can learn how to train/handle him.  Dogs respond best to positive reinforcement. Praise and rewards for good behavior. Yelling at a dog does absolutely no good.    As for potty training, again, you have to train him.   When you get up in the morning, take your dog out. Walk her/him till  elimination occurs, then praise him/her, a lot. Give a treat. Walk your dog again midday, afternoon and at bed time. Always stay with the dog so when she/he goes you can give praise . At this age old you should know your dogs looking for a spot behavior. When you see that behavior, get him/her out. Any time elimination occurs outside, give praise. If you catch your dog in the act inside, say no and get him/her outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact put your dog in another room then clean the spot with an enzyme cleaner to get rid of the odor, not cover it up. The reason for putting him/her in another room is if your dog sees you cleaning up after her she/he will think that is your job. You must be diligent and consistent. Make sure you implement  a feeding schedule, if your dog eats at the same times every day she/he will poop the same times every day. At night time or when you are gone, crate train.  Here are three websites on how to crate train a puppy/dog.    http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...     http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....     http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...|`|YWUjeTnUaa	You should have went to the trainer to learn how to work with your dog. It really doesn't do any good to train a dog if you don't know how to follow through and keep the training up. Training isn't a one time shot then they get it, it takes constant work.|`|AA11171398	The trainer obviously only worked with him when he was leashed. The leash for him means, time to behave now. A crate is an awesome way of controlling behavior when off leash.     Look into crate training, and then try working with him training wise off leash. To help with things in the house, try a squirt bottle.
5Sr0HtFHaa	I have had budgies all my life. All of them are finger tamed. First take away there food for 5 - 6 hours. Then open the cage and have food in your hand and let them sit on your finger while they eat. Eventually they will stop bighting and will come to you.     You might get something from this site also.    http://www.budgieplace.com/taming.html|`|uIk9MAnDaa	well i do to if it has it's wings clipped then you can hold it with gloves then go on to just hands but if it's wings are clipped then you need to get them clipped      One of my parakeets did that and i did what i just told you and now she will sit on my shoulder and i can't get her off she really likes me now and that could happen to you.|`|8xVGuEDkaa	I have no idea what a Budgie is, but anything that bites me get thrown in the microwave.

He's been biting us for 12 years. We have other birds and parrots, and have stopped tham from biting but He attacks my hand everytime I put it in the cage lol. Maybe it's just a budgie thing :D|`|614tYbzxaa	Try wearing gloves when handling your budgie until he gets used to you . The more you handle your budgie he will then begin to trust you and hopefully will stop biting you .|`|xowm9t3kaa	You have to let him trust you budgies bite because their testing you, it doesn't hurt when they bite you it tickles just let him bite you and if it starts to hurt blow on him lightly and tell him "no".
AA12083992	Never hit a dog!  Taming a Big Barker   Your dog communicates with his bark. But if he barks excessively, it can diminish his effectiveness as a watchdog.   The good news is you can control the situation. Understanding why you have an excessive barker is the first step to solving the problem.   Here are the most common causes of constant barking:   Loneliness  A dog that is home alone for long periods is likely to bark because he feels anxious or sad and is afraid his owner may not return.   Conditioning  Your dog may bark because you have inadvertently trained him to do so. Think about it: He barks and you open the door to let him out. He barks again and you let him back in. He may even bark for a treat-and then you give him one.   Inactivity  Lack of exercise can result in a dog that has pent-up energy and barks out of frustration. A well-exercised dog is more likely to sleep when you're not there.   How to tame the dog that cries wolf   Take your dog for at least two 30-minute walks each day, or head to the park for a game of fetch. Dogs that spend most of their time in the backyard or in the house need regular exercise.   Visit the same park daily or weekly and let him find doggy friends. Dogs are social creatures. Plus, there's a lot of truth to the saying "a tired dog is a good dog."   Give your dog something to do when he is home alone. Instead of barking, your dog can keep himself busy by earning his food. Fill a hollow chew toy with a biscuit or two.   You can also pack it with canned food and freeze it, so it takes a long time for your dog to get the food out.   Attach an unpleasant experience to inappropriate barking. Never strike your dog, but do something that will catch his attention, such as clanking an empty soda can filled with coins. As soon as your dog stops barking, instantly reward him.   Teach your dog a "quiet" command.   Each time your dog barks, give him a command of "quiet" or "no bark." At the same time, hold a treat in front of your dog's nose. Most dogs get quiet immediately because they can't sniff the treat and bark at the same time.   Lavish praise on your big dog during his quiet time. After three seconds of no barking, let him have the treat. As you continue with your training, increase the amount of time you require him to be quiet before giving the treat.   While you can't calm your dog's constant barking overnight, you can retrain him to bark only when necessary. Be prepared that it may take weeks to establish new habits. Just stick with the training and you'll see a new pattern of appropriate barking develop|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Keep an old Windex bottle or similar filled with water at hand. Splash them mercilessly every single time they bark. Chase them around the house if they flee but don't let them escape your response. Guaranteed to work within a week's time. No harm, no violence, no mistreatment.|`|lmSffrNuaa	The first step towards controlling excessive barking is to understand the specific reasons behind it. Even after you know the why, don't expect to wave a magic wand and stop your dog from barking. Training your dog to bark less (you will never stop it altogether) is a time-consuming process. Also keep in mind that some breeds are more apt to bark than others and these could prove more difficult to train.    Check this link for more info.    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxa.html|`|otdrnPUtaa	I had this problem with my terrier cross and I tried loads of different ways to distract him.  What finally worked for me was having a jar of special treats (small pieces of cooked liver or cheese worked for me), handy and every time he started, grabbing a treat, telling him to sit, making him wait for about 10 seconds then giving the treat.  He stopped very quickly.  It doesn't however work with him outside as absolutely nothing seems to distract him from barking at lorries, motorbikes, vans, trains and anything else that makes more noise than he does.  Anyway, give it and try and hope it works for you.  Good luck!|`|mTcUaxwpaa	There are many stragies ppl use, i have a border collie (pedigree) who does the same but has stoped now. I used a bark collar which sprays water at the dog when it barks, but i found she hates it when you shake a bottle at her just once give it a good tap. Dont hit the dog or else the dog will be scared Put about 5-10 stones in a bottle and when they bark hit the bottle againest your hand, it will scare your dog but it will think if i bark there is that loud noise that i hate. :)|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Never strike a dog. You can create fear, anxiety and make your dogs life a misery.    B.W. has pretty much covered it the best way possible here, but I would add that when you are in the house and you hear a knock at the door, correct the dogs barking and don't open the door until the dogs are calm and quiet. Don't let them run to the door and get excited, take control and be consistent. Have a friend help you practise this so that the dogs don't bark excessivley at the doorbell, car door shutting or a knock at the door.    All my dogs will bark when something startles them and this is absolutely normal communication for which they should not be corrected. Be sure to only discourage the excessive/fixated barking.    EDIT: Chasing your dogs around the house, splashing water on them is harmful and abusive. You can easily make dogs fearful this way. To ensure the dogs don't run away from you, stay calm, walk over calmly and interrupt the barking by using any of B.W.'s methods, ne need for me to repeat them.|`|lL1IkNN7aa	hit the dog a slap on the nose not a really hard just a gentle slap the dog then knows to shut up i do this to my lab and rottie let the dog know who the master is
tP4Bx4OWaa	Could be a sign of liver/pancreatic /gallbladder trouble. lack of bile makes them appear pale and a sample should be taken to vet, could be your dog ate pale coloured foodstuffs as I have seen this when a greedy dog gobbled down chicken rapidly and done pale poo next day and vomited as has an upset tum. Keep an eye on her, probably be fine tomorrow.
AA12083992	First you don't break a dog, you train them. I would strongly suggest you take him to obedience classes geared for aggressive dogs.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	Find a trainer. Read some books. The dog might be afraid, in which case visit this site    http://www.fearfuldogs.com    The dog might be a resource guarder, read this book    MINE!    http://www.fearfuldogs.com/html|`|AA10029366	That is NOT acceptable behavior from a Siberian. These dogs should NEVER be aggressive. "Aggressive" and "Siberian Husky" do NOT belong in the same sentence!!    This dog is unstable, which is likely the result of poor breeding. I don't care how long he has to "get used to" things, NO SIBERIAN SHOULD EVER GROWL OR SNAP AT A HUMAN BEING.    If you want to try to save this dog, find an experienced behaviorist/trainer NOW. Start by keeping this dog OFF your bed, and start using the Nothing In Life Is Free method.  http://www.westwinddogtraining.com/NILIF...  http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm    If there is any possibility that this dog might bite a child, he needs to be euthanized. I'm completely, utterly, totally serious. This is an unacceptable trait, NOT typical of the breed, and this dog is not right in the head. There are plenty of normal, happy Siberians out there who need homes. There is no need to keep a human-aggressive one around.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	I am glad it aint me as I have young children and simply would not tolerate any aggressive animal, dogs are hard enough work without taking on one large breed who is exhibiting aggression and the owners mysterious in that old nutshell 'went to live overseas' strangely a lot of people with horrible aggressive dogs move overseas! lol    Protect the 7 year old and remove the dog , he needs specialists training in a controlled experienced environment. If it goes wrong, nasty consequences could ensue. You have had them in the past but this one is showing a horrible side. Do you have time and inclination?     Professional help is needed-I fear the dog is a lost cause, best to be put to sleep, sorry to be blunt and sound harsh but a nasty dog is no use to anyone.|`|LWEceVT4aa	Since you only mentioned the bed thing, its seems as though he is possesessive of the bed. So get him off don't let him up on the bed. If he is allowed on the same level of you he may think he is equal to you. Huskies are beautiful dogs BUT they do need a lot of exercise  to get rid of all their excess energy. A tired dog is a good dog.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	You hire a professional trainer who knows what they're doing.  Aggression is dangerous, especially when there is a child in the family, and using the wrong technique will only make the aggression worse.  Aggression is a serious problem, it's not something that most people should even attempt to deal with by themselves.    In the meantime, stop giving this dog access to the room when you're not around.  And when you are around, don't allow him to get on the furniture in the first place.  I'm not one of those people who believes that dogs should never be allowed on the furniture because it gives them the idea that they are "high ranking in the pack," but it is YOUR furniture and if your dog gets aggressive when he is on your furniture then clearly he is a dog that doesn't deserve furniture privileges.      I would also start a Nothing In Life Is Free (NILIF) program with this dog.  Google it, you'll find a lot of information on this method.  Make him work for every single thing he gets.  Going out the door to go potty, getting the food bowl set down (or better yet, handfeeding him and making him work for every single bite), putting the leash on for walks, getting pet, I mean EVERYTHING.    Edit: Please don't leave a choke collar on any dog unsupervised.  Choke (or check, or chain, whichever term you prefer) collars are TRAINING collars and should ONLY be used while you are actively training the dog.  They should never be left on the dog when you are not physically attached to the other end of the leash because they WILL tighten and cut off the dog's air supply.  Dogs are perfectly capable of hanging themselves on a regular buckle collar that doesn't restrict, leaving a choke collar on a dog unsupervised (crated or not) is just asking for a dead dog.  Not to mention that it will become loose enough that he can easily slip it over his head and remove it and then you're back at square one with no leash or collar to use to control him if he becomes aggressive.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	First off -- are you positive it was a Siberian Husky? Like Loki said, Sibes are *not* known for being aggressive *at all*.  West Siberian Laikas, and Russo-European Laikas both look similar to Huskies; but have quite different temperaments from them.  They're both known for having problems adjusting from having one owner to having another; and generally won't like their new owner for quite some time.    As for your dog. It doesn't need to be "broken". It needs to be trained and taught who the pack leader is.|`|mTcUaxwpaa	Don't let the dog sleep in your bed it must feel that it is better than anyone else. becareful though because it may go 4 you if it thinks its better than you. Start training i go to Mels Klever K9's in Healing, Lincs. Good Luck :S|`|AA11171398	Buy a crate large enough that he can turn around, stand, and lay down with bowels in it. Put a choke collar on him with a cheap nylon leash that can be easily replaced if he chews it.    Do not let him sleep on the bed, he is claiming your bed. He is being dominant, and protecting his pack. He needs to understand that he is not alpha male.    Keep him in the crate overnight.  Let him out in the morning to go to the bathroom.  Feed him in his crate.  Wait 1 hour- then out the potty.  Go on a nice long walk, or a jog. (try getting a doggy backpack and making him carry weight, like a water bottle or something)  Back into the crate with water.  Out to potty every 3 hours.  Eat lunch  Wait 1 hour then out to potty- another long walk (about an hour)  Make sure he pottys and then he can come into the room where the crate is. This should not be your bedroom. The living room is good.  Feed dinner.  Wait 1 hour then back out to potty.  One last walk before going back in his crate at night.    It is a lot, but it is worth it and will break him of his dominance. Once he gets rid of excess energy and realizes that he is not pack leader, and the house is not his to control,. he will lighten up. Also, huskys are working dogs. They need long walks and lots of exercise. A under exercised husky is one that has the energy to become a dangerous dog!|`|qsqmykzsaa	Very gently.  He would be feeling insecure at the moment. He just needs you to love him and he will learn you are not going to abandon him like his previous owner did. It will take a little time for him to settle in properly.  Dogs, (I own 4 and breed) need stability in their lives, just like we do.  At 6 pm every night, my dogs tell me it is their dinner time.    Be firm with commands, but don't shout.  Have you watched Ceaser Milan on tv? He is the dog whisperer and shows us what to do. He is amazing.  Just gently correct his unwanted behaviour. He will come around.  Good luck.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	There is no such thing as breaking a dog. People use this term with horses as well and you just can't do it.    Firstly, let your dog have access only to a few rooms of the house. He's decided your bed is his so don't take the risk with yourselves and especially your children and don't allow him access to it.     Sign up to obedience classes straight away and keep at them. You cannot "break" a dog of certain behaviors, only through training, positive reinforcement of good behavior and consistency can you have a dog that no longer shows unwanted behavior.    Good luck and find a good trainer nearby.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Well i was going to post an answer suggesting behavioral training and obedience training as well....but Loki pretty much summed it all up. Huskies are not suppose to be aggressive by nature, esp towards humans.  this would concern me a great deal! as i am the mother of 4 children (and have 4 dogs of my own). i also foster dogs for the SPCA. I can tell you that if this dog had been in a shelter situation instead of being pawned off by an owner that was "moving overseas"  (we are a military family, and have taken our 4 dogs all over the place w/us) this dog would have gone through temperament testing before being placed in ANY home environment be it a foster home or permanent home.  Aggression of any kind is not tolerated in potential adoptees. it sounds cruel, and i do feel sorry for the dogs that have to be euthanized for it, but these are dogs that show severe temperament issues and no training would help, and even if the behavior could be modified they would still NEVER be placed in a home w/children under the age of 12 or 13. a dog w/these issues needs a very strong leader who is willing to devote enormous amounts of time training to redirect his behavior to stable state.    I would suggest you stop allowing the dog on your bed. he sees it as HIS not yours, and WILL protect it (guard it) from even YOU eventually. Is the dog food aggressive as well? these are serious indications that the dog came from a terrible environment, had no training at all, and was NEVER scocialized properly with other people.     you need to seek out an animal behaviorists professional opinion of this dog's behavior ASAP before something tragic happens. NEVER leave the dog unattended w/the 7 y/o. Look for signs in the dog when he's around the child. his stance when aggressive would be head slightly downward, ears back and standing very still, erect tail (or slight wagging while erect).   a dog has a very stiff posture before attack. which is where some ppl say "it came out of nowhere".  don't let the child corner the dog either as this will trigger the dog's flight or fight response, and based on what you decribe he'd be fighting not running away.    I think this dog may be too much for you to handle, it's obvious he was poorly bred.
